<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Meals of many courses are neither practical nor popular with the modern
hostess. For a company luncheon or supper it is not necessary to serve
more than a hot dish, a salad, a biscuit or sandwich, a dessert and a
beverage. A first course and a relish may be provided if desired.</p>


<h3 class=intro>SUNDAY NIGHT SUPPERS</h3>

<p>The following menus were arranged especially as Sunday night suppers,
but they are equally suitable for midday luncheons or high teas. Many of
the dishes will be found desirable for afternoon teas or evening
spreads, and for use in tea and lunch rooms, and for automobile picnics.</p>


<h3 class=intro>PRELIMINARY PREPARATIONS</h3>

<p>Preparations for Sunday night suppers should be made on Saturday as far
as possible. For a luncheon it is a help to have some things done the
day before. For picnics and parties much must be done in advance. As an
aid to the hostess we have listed after each menu what these preliminary
preparations may be.</p>


<h3 class=intro>COOKING AT THE TABLE</h3>

<p>Many of the hot dishes may be prepared in a chafing dish or on an
electric grill. For these, much of the measuring may be done in advance,
the ingredients being put in small dishes on a tray. Coffee and tea may
be made at the table with electric appliances.</p>


<h3 class=intro>SANDWICHES AND BISCUITS</h3>

<p>Sandwiches may be made and wrapped first in dry cheesecloth, then in
damp cheesecloth, and placed in a covered crock some hours before a
meal. The hot biscuits may be replaced by rolls or bread and butter if
desired.</p>


<h3 class=intro>AUTOMOBILE PICNICS</h3>

<p>For picnics the beverages and hot dishes may be prepared at home and
carried in thermos food jars. The cold dishes may be packed in a small
portable refrigerator. The biscuits, sandwiches, cakes, and cookies
should be carefully wrapped in wax paper and packed in boxes. Ice creams
may be taken in the freezer. Hot sandwiches and bacon may be cooked over
the coals or on a portable oil or alcohol stove. In some menus it may be
desirable to omit or modify a few of the dishes, if food is to be
carried several miles.</p>


<h3 class=intro>MARKET ORDERS</h3>

<p>Supplies for use on Sunday evening should, of course, be purchased on
Saturday. To prevent any mistakes in ordering we have listed under each
menu the foodstuffs that will be required. Supplies that are usually
kept on hand are not listed, as
<p>
<blockquote>
  Baking powder<br>
  Cayenne<br>
  Cornstarch<br>
  Bread flour<br>
  Pastry flour<br>
  Molasses<br>
  Mustard<br>
  Paprika<br>
  Pepper<br>
  Rock salt<br>
  Table salt<br>
  Granulated sugar<br>
  Soda<br>
  Spices, whole and ground<br>
  Table sauce<br>
  Vanilla<br>
  Vinegar</blockquote>




<h3 class=intro>HOW TO BUY</h3>

<p>Some things are listed in the market orders that many people always have
on hand. This is for the benefit of those who do not prepare all their
meals and have little space for seldom used supplies. As far as feasible
the amounts of material in the market orders are such as could be
purchased. They may differ somewhat from the amounts called for in the
recipes, thus leaving some foodstuff on hand. In many cases it may be
more economical to purchase in larger quantities than those given. In
some cases smaller amounts are called for than can be purchased, as
one-half can, or one-fourth cup, in case supplies on hand are adequate
without purchasing more than required. Butter only is given in the
market orders. In cooking, margarine, lard, and other shortenings may be
used instead, if preferred.</p>




<h3 class=intro>MEASUREMENTS</h3>

<p>In all recipes measurements are made level. Measuring cups, divided into
thirds and quarters, are used, and tea and table measuring spoons. Cups
of dry material are filled to overflowing by putting the material into
the cup with a tablespoon, and are then leveled off with a knife. Tea
and tablespoons are filled heaping with dry material, and then leveled
off with a knife. Flour should be sifted once before measuring.</p>




<h3 class=intro>RECIPES AND MENUS</h3>

<p>The recipes are planned to serve eight persons. Most of them may be
divided for a smaller party.</p>

<p>The average cost of the menus is fifty cents per person. Some of the
dishes may be made less expensive and rich by substituting milk for
cream, and by other substitutions and omissions that will suggest
themselves to the resourceful hostess. Many types of dishes are given.
Many variations are possible.</p>

<p>In some menus a choice of dishes is suggested. A few recipes are given
that are not called for in the menus. These are usually to show how to
utilize in a different way something for which a recipe is given or to
use in another meal some foodstuff left from a recipe.</p>

<p>These recipes and menus have all been tested at Miss Farmer's School of
Cookery. The author wishes to express here her appreciation of the
painstaking work of all the members of the staff of the school who have
assisted in making this little book possible.</p>

<h3 class=prep>FRUIT CUP</h3>

<p class=ingred>Remove skin and seeds from<br>
  &frac12; pound white grapes. If grapes are firm, boiling water may be
poured over them and allowed to stand 1 minute, when skins will come
off easily.</p>

<p class=ingred>Pare<br>
  2 oranges, removing white part with the skin, and remove sections
free from membrane.</p>

<h4 class=caption>FRUIT CUP</h4>



<h3 class=prep>HOT HAM SANDWICHES</h3>

<p class=ingred>Put<br>
  1 pound cooked ham through food chopper. Add<br>
  4 tablespoons creamed butter,<br>
  1 teaspoon mustard and<br>
  1 teaspoon paprika, and mix well.</p>
<p class=ingred>Cut<br>
  Bread in sixteen &frac14;-inch slices, spread eight slices bread with
the ham mixture, cover with remaining bread and press slices firmly
together. Cut each sandwich in three strips.</p>
<p class=ingred>Beat<br>
  2 eggs slightly and add<br>
  2 cups milk. Dip sandwiches, one at a time, in this mixture, and sauté
in butter, cooking on one side until browned, and then turning and
browning the other side. Serve very hot.</p>

<p>Other meat, or marmalade or jam may be used in sandwiches in place
of ham.</p>

<center><img src="images/013.png" ALT="HOT HAM SANDWICHES"></center>
<h4 class=caption>HOT HAM SANDWICHES</h4>




<h3 class=prep>GRAPE OR CURRANT JELLY</h3>

<p class=ingred>Wash and pick over<br>
  Fruit. Crush in kettle one layer at a time and boil, stirring
frequently, until juice is extracted from pulp. Let drip through
double piece of cheesecloth, rinsed in cold water, over night or
till juice no longer drips. Do not squeeze.</p>
<p class=ingred>To<br>
  1 tablespoon juice add<br>
  1 tablespoon alcohol; stir and let stand 10 minutes.</p>
<p class=ingred>If &#8532 of the mixture is cloudy use<br>
  &#8532 cup sugar to each cup juice. If all is cloudy use equal parts
sugar and juice. (This is called the Pectin Test.) Be sure that juice
mixed with alcohol is discarded immediately. Measure remaining juice
into kettle, bring to boiling point, add required amount of sugar and
cook to 220 degrees F. or until mixture will show two distinct, firm
drops when dripped from side of spoon, or when small amount will
become firm when dropped on very cold saucer. Then skim and pour into
sterilized glasses.</p>
<p>

<h4 class=prep><i>Second Extraction</i></h4>

<p class=ingred2>Return fruit pulp to kettle, add barely enough cold water to cover it,
bring slowly to boiling point, stirring to prevent burning on; cook
5 minutes, drain and finish as for first extraction, boiling 5 minutes
before adding the sugar.</p>

<p>
<h4 class=prep><i>Third Extraction</i></h4>

<p class=ingred2>Proceed as for second extraction. Oftentimes the juice from second and
third extractions may be combined before being made up into jelly. By
making three extractions the amount of jelly obtainable from a given
amount of fruit may be almost doubled.</p>



<h3 class=prep>TOMATO SALAD WITH CHEESE DRESSING</h3>

<p class=ingred>Cut<br>
  4 tomatoes in halves in such a way that they come apart in points.</p>
<p class=ingred>Arrange each half in a nest of<br>
  Lettuce leaves. In the center of tomato pile<br>
  Cream cheese forced through a coarse strainer. In center of cheese
put a<br>
Few bits of green pepper finely chopped. Serve with cheese dressing.</p>


<center><img src="images/015.png" ALT="TOMATO SALAD"></center>
<h4 class=caption>TOMATO SALAD</h4>



<h3 class=prep>CHEESE DRESSING</h3>

<p class=ingred>Mix<br>
  2 tablespoons mayonnaise dressing with<br>
  2 tablespoons cream cheese. Add<br>
  &frac12; teaspoon salt<br>
  &frac12; teaspoon table sauce<br>
  &frac12; teaspoon paprika and add very slowly<br>
  &frac14; cup salad oil, beating with egg beater until very thick. Add slowly
  1 &frac12; tablespoons vinegar. Keep in cool place till ready to serve.</p>

<p>Cream cheese with Roquefort flavor is desirable in both the above
recipes, but the usual cottage or cream cheese may be used if preferred.</p>



<h3 class=prep>COCOA ICE CREAM</h3>

<p class=ingred>Mix very thoroughly<br>
  &frac12; cup dry powdered cocoa<br>
  Few grains salt<br>
  1 cup sugar and<br>
  1 tablespoon cornstarch.</p>
<p class=ingred>Add slowly<br>
  2 cups milk, scalded, and cook over boiling water 20 minutes,
stirring until thickened and occasionally afterward.</p>
<p class=ingred>Pour over<br>
  2 eggs well beaten, chill, and add<br>
  2 cups cream beaten stiff<br>
  1 teaspoon vanilla and<br>
  1 cup syrup drained from canned raspberries or strawberries, and freeze.</p>

<p>If frozen in a vacuum freezer, put mixture in center can of freezer;
cover, invert freezer, and fill outer compartment with finely crushed ice
mixed with half the amount of rock salt. Open the freezer occasionally,
scrape cream from sides and mix well, using a long-bladed knife. If frozen
in an ordinary freezer, it is not necessary to beat the cream. Put mixture
in can of ice cream freezer, surround with three parts ice and one
part salt.</p>

<p>Let mixture stand 5 minutes, then turn crank slowly until mixture is
stiff. When frozen drain off ice water and repack, using four parts
ice and one part salt.</p>



<h3 class=prep>FIG MARGUERITES</h3>

<p class=ingred>Put in top of double boiler<br>
  &#8542; cup sugar and<br>
  3 tablespoons water.</p>
<p>Stir until sugar is dissolved as much as possible. There will still be
small sugar crystals remaining. Wash sugar crystals
from inside of double boiler with pastry brush dipped in cold water.</p>
<p class=ingred>Add<br>
  1 egg white, unbeaten. Place over hot water and cook, beating constantly
with egg beater for 7 to 12 minutes or until mixture will hold its shape.</p>

<p class=ingred>Add<br>
  1 tablespoon marshmallow cream and
  &frac14; teaspoon vanilla, and fold over and over until again stiff
enough to hold its shape.</p>
<p class=ingred>Add<br>
  &#8531;cup (3) figs cut in small pieces and<br>
  &#8531;cup nut meats cut in small pieces.</p>

<p class=ingred>Pile on<br>
Small round crackers and bake at 375 degrees F. for 10 minutes or until
delicately brown. This rule will cover 3 dozen small crackers.</p>

<p>Should frosting be too soft to hold its shape after adding marshmallow cream,
it may be again placed over hot water, and folded gently over and over,
until it becomes slightly granular around the edges. Remove from hot
water, and continue folding over gently until of the desired stiffness.</p>



<h3 class=prep>MARSHMALLOW FROSTING</h3>

<p>Use above mixture with or without figs and nuts as a cake filling or
frosting. It need not be baked.</p>



<h3 class=prep>CANDIED MINT LEAVES</h3>

<p class=ingred>Wipe<br>
  Fresh mint leaves, remove from stems and rub each leaf gently with
the finger dipped in<br>
  Egg white slightly beaten.</p>
<p class=ingred>Mix<br>
3 tablespoons granulated sugar with<br>
3 drops oil of spearmint, and sift over each side of the mint leaves.</p>
<p>Lay close together on a cake rack covered with wax paper and leave in a
warm but not a hot place until crisp and dry.</p>
<p class=ingred>Serve in<br>
  Tea with<br>
  Sliced lemon and<br>
  Loaf sugar.</p>



<h3 class=prep>TEA</h3>

<p class=ingred>Half fill a perforated tea spoon or tea ball with<br>
  Orange Pekoe, or other preferred tea.</p>
<p class=ingred>Place in cup, add fresh<br>
  Boiling water, until cup is two-thirds full. Remove tea spoon as soon
as tea is of the desired strength.</p>

<p>Two or three cups of tea can usually be made without emptying and refilling
the tea spoon.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
