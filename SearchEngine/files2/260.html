<p>The <i>Cologne Gazette</i> is of the opinion that the American
troops, when they arrive in France, will be hampered by their
ignorance of the various languages. But we understand that the
Americans can shoot in any language.</p>

<p>"I decline to have anything to do with the War," said a
Conscientious Objector to a North of England magistrate, "and I
resent this interference with my liberty." Indeed he is said to be
so much annoyed that he intends sending the War Office a jolly
snappy letter about it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>CHARLIE CHAPLIN says a gossip writer is coming to England in the
Autumn. This disposes of the suggestion that arrangements were
being made for England to be taken over to him.</p>

<p><i>Incidentally</i> we notice that CHARLIE CHAPLIN has become a
naturalised American, with, we presume, permission to use the rank
of Honorary Britisher.</p>

<p>Before a Northern Tribunal an applicant stated that he was

to concentrate for a while on making certain Germans say

<p>An Isle of Wight man has succeeded in growing a vegetable marrow

<p>The great flagstaff at Kew Gardens, which weighs 18 tons and is

come as a great consolation to certain people who had feared the

<h3>THE END OF AN EPISODE.</h3>
<p>I write this in the beginning of a minor tragedy; if indeed the
severance of any long, helpful and sympathetic association can ever
be so lightly named. For that is precisely what our intercourse has
been these many weeks past; one of nervous and quickly roused
irritation on my part, of swift and gentle ministration on his.</p>
<p>At least once a day we have met during that period (and
occasionally, though rarely, more often), usually in those
before-breakfast hours when the temper of normal man is most
exacting and uncertain. But his temper never varied; the perfection
of it was indeed among his finest qualities. Morning after morning,
throughout a time that, as it chanced, has been full of distress
and disappointment, would his soothing and infinitely gentle touch
recall me to content. That stroking caress of his was a thing
indescribable; one before which the black shadows left by the hours
of night seemed literally to dissolve and vanish.</p>
<p>And now the long expected, long dreaded has begun to happen. He,
too, is turning against me, as so many others of his fellows have
done in the past. Who knows the reason? What continued roughness on
my part has at last worn out even him? But for some days now there
has been no misreading the fatal symptoms&mdash;increasing
irritability on the one side, harshness turning to blunt
indifference on the other. And this morning came the unforgivable
offence, the cut direct.</p>
<p>That settles it; to-morrow, with a still smarting regret, I
unwrap a new razor-blade.</p>

<h2>THE SUPER-PIPE.</h2>
<p>When Jackson first joined the jolly old B.E.F. he smoked a pipe.
He carried it anyhow. Loose in his pocket, mind you. A pipe-bowl at
his pocket's brim a simple pipe-bowl was to him, and it was nothing
more. Of course no decent B.E.F. mess could stand that. Jackson was
told that a pipe was <i>anathema maranatha</i>, which is Greek for
<i>no bon.</i></p>
<p>"What will I smoke then?" said Jackson, who was no Englishman.
We waited for the Intelligence Officer to reply. We knew him. The
Intelligence Officer said nothing. He drew something from his
pocket. It was a parcel wrapped in cloth-of-gold. He removed the
cloth-of-gold and there was discovered a casket, which he unlocked
with a key attached to his identity disc. Inside the casket was a
padlocked box, which he opened with a key attached by gold wire to
his advance pay-book. Inside the box was a roll of silk. To cut it
all short, he unwound puttee after puttee of careful wrapping till
he reached a chamois-leather chrysalis, which he handled with
extreme reverence, and from this he drew something with gentle
fingers, and set it on the table-cloth before the goggle-eyed
Jackson.</p>
<p>"A pipe," said Jackson.</p>
<p>There was a shriek of horror. The Intelligence Officer fainted.
Here was wanton sacrilege.</p>
<p>"Man," said the iron-nerved Bombing Officer, "it's a
Brownhill."</p>
<p>"What's a Brownhill?" asked Jackson.</p>
<p>We gasped. How could we begin to tell him of that West End
shrine from which issue these lacquered symbols of a New
Religion?</p>
<p>The Intelligence Officer was reviving. We looked to him.</p>
<p>"The prophet Brownhill," he said, "was once a
tobacconist&mdash;an ordinary tobacconist who sold pipes."</p>
<p>We shuddered.</p>
<p>"He discovered one day that man wants more than mere pipes. He
wants a&mdash;a super-pipe, something to reverence
and&mdash;er&mdash;look after, you know, as well as to smoke. So he
invented the Brownhill. It is an <i>affaire de coeur</i>&mdash;an
affair of art," translated the I.O. proudly. "It is as glossy as a
chestnut in its native setting, and you can buy furniture polish
from the prophet Brownhill which will keep it always so. It has its
year, like a famous vintage, it has a silver wind-pipe, and it
costs anything up to fifty guineas."</p>
<p>"D'you smoke it'?" asked Jackson, brutally.</p>
<p>We gave him up. In awful silence each of us produced his
wrappings and his caskets, extracted the shining briar, smeared it
with cosmetics, and polished it more reverently than a peace time
Guardsman polishes his buttons when warned for duty next day at
"Buck."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>And Jackson smoked his pipe in secret. He would take no leaf
from the book of the Sassenachs.</p>
<p>And the War went on.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Jackson went on leave. To his deep disgust he had to wait a few
hours in London on his way to more civilised parts, and fate led
him idling to Brownhill's. He flattened his Celtic nose on the
window and stared fascinated at the array of super-pipes displayed
there. After a furtive glance along the street he crept into the
temple. A white-coated priest met him. &lt;/&gt;</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I'm wantin'&mdash;a&mdash;a pipe," said Jackson. He saw
the priest reel and turn pale to the lips. "I should say a&mdash;a
Brownhill," he added hastily. The other man gulped, steadied
himself with an effort, and gave a ghastly smile. If you had walked
into a temple at Thibet and planked down sixpence and asked for an
idol wrapped up in brown paper you could not have done a more
dreadful thing than Jackson had done; but the priest forgave him
and produced in silence a trayful of Brownhills. Then was Jackson
like unto ELIA'S little Chinese boy with "the crackling." He
touched a briar and was converted. He stroked them as though they
were kittens, bought ten of them, a pound of polish, fifty silver
wind-pipes and a bale of chamois-leather. The priest took a deep
breath.</p>
<p>"You are a full-blooded man, Sir," said he, "if you will excuse
me saying so, and you should smoke in your new Brownhills a mixture
which has a proportion of Latakia to Virginian of one to
nineteen&mdash;a small percentage of glycerine and cucumber being
added because you have red hair, and the whole submitted to a
pressure of eighteen hundred foot-pounds to the square millimetre,
under violet rays. This will be known as 'Your Mixture,' Number
56785-6/11, and will be supplied to no one else on earth, except
under penalty of death.</p>
<p>"I will take a ton," said Jackson with glazing eyes.</p>
<p>This was a man after the priest's own heart. He took another
deep breath and dived into the strong-room. He returned under the
escort of ten armed men, each of them chained by the wrist to an
iron box, which he unlocked with difficulty. Inside the iron box
was a thing which Jackson a few months ago would have called a
pipe. He knew better now. In awful silence the priest lifted it
from its satin bed. "This," he whispered, "was once smoked by
Brownhill himself."</p>
<p>Jackson put out a hand to take it. The priest hesitated, then
laid it gently on his customer's palm.</p>
<p>And Jackson dropped it.</p>
<p>Jackson has never been heard of since.</p>

<h2>A STUDY IN SYMMETRY.</h2>
<p>The following story, however improbable it may seem to you, is
true.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was an artist with historical leanings
not unassociated with the desire for pelf&mdash;pelf being, even to
idealists, what petrol is to a car. The blend brought him one day
to Portsmouth, where the <i>Victory</i> lies, with the honourable
purpose of painting a picture of that famous ship with NELSON on
board. What the ADMIRAL was doing I cannot say&mdash;most probably
dying&mdash;but the artist's intention was to make the work as
attractive as might be and thus draw a little profit from the wave
of naval enthusiasm which was then passing over the country; for
not only was the picture itself to be saleable, but reproductions
were to be made of it.</p>
<p>Permission having been obtained from the authorities, the artist
boarded the <i>Victory</i>, set up his easel on her deck and
settled down to his task, the monotony of which was pleasantly
alleviated by the chatter of the old salts who guard the ship and
act as guides to the tourists who visit her. All of these estimable
men not only possessing views on art, but having come by now to the
firm belief that they had fought with NELSON, their criticisms were
not too easily combated and the artist hadn't a tedious moment.
Thus, painting, conversing and learning (as one can learn only from
a trained imparter of information), three or four days passed
quickly away and the picture was done.</p>
<p>So far there has been nothing&mdash;has there?&mdash;to strain
credulity. No. But a time will come&mdash;is, in fact, upon us.</p>
<p>On the evening of the last day, as the artist was sitting at
early dinner with a friend before catching the London train, his
remarks turned (as an artist's sometimes will) upon the work upon
which he had just been engaged. He expressed satisfaction with it
in the main, but could not, he said, help feeling that its chances
of becoming a real success would be sensibly increased if he could
find as a model for the central figure some one whose resemblance
to NELSON was noticeable.</p>
<p>"There are, of course," he went on, "at the same time&mdash;that
is to say, among contemporaries&mdash;no two faces exactly alike.
That is an axiom. Strange as it may sound, among all the millions
of countenances with two eyes, a nose in the middle and a mouth
below it, some difference exists in each. That is, as I say, among
contemporaries: in the world at this moment in which I am speaking.
But," he continued, warming to his subject, for, as you will have
already gathered, he was not one of the taciturn brush-brotherhood,
"after the lapse of years I see no reason why nature should not
begin precisely to reproduce physiognomies and so save herself the
trouble of for ever diversifying them. That being so&mdash;and
surely the hypothesis is not too far-fetched"&mdash;here his friend
said, "No, not at all&mdash;oh no!"&mdash;"why," the artist
continued, "should there not be at this moment, more than a century
later, some one whose resemblance to NELSON is exact? He would not
be necessarily a naval man&mdash;probably, indeed, not, for
NELSON's face was not characteristic of the sea&mdash;but whoever
he was, even if he were an archbishop, I," said the painter firmly,
"should not hesitate to go up to him and ask him to sit to me."</p>
<p>The friend agreed that this was a very proper attitude and that
it betokened true sincerity of purpose.</p>
<p>"NELSON's face," the painter continued, "was an uncommon one. So
large and so mobile a mouth is rare. But I have no doubt that a
duplicate exists, and no matter who is the owner of it, even were
he an archbishop, I should not hesitate to go up and ask him to sit
to me."</p>
<p>(For the benefit of any feminine reader of this veracious
history I should say that the repetition which she has just noticed
is not an accident, but has been carefully set down. It is an
attempt to give verisimilitude to the conversation&mdash;because
men always say things like that twice.)</p>
<p>The friend again remarked that the painter's resolve did him
infinite credit, and the two started for the station, still
conversing on the same theme.</p>
<p>On entering their carriage the first thing to take their
attention was a quiet little man in black, who was the absolute
double of the hero of Trafalgar.</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" whispered the painter excitedly, "do you see
that? There's the very man. The likeness to NELSON is astonishing.
I never saw anything like it. I don't care who he is, I must tackle
him. It's the most extraordinary chance that ever occurred."</p>
<p>Assuming his most silky and deferential manner&mdash;for, though
clearly not an archbishop, unless in mufti, this might yet be a
person of importance&mdash;the painter approached the stranger and
tendered a card.</p>
<p>"I trust, Sir, that you will excuse me," he began, "for the
liberty I am taking, but I am an artist and I happen to be engaged
on a picture of NELSON on the <i>Victory</i>. I have all the
accessories and so forth, but what I very seriously need is a brief
sitting from some gentleman with a likeness to the great little
Admiral. Such, Sir, as yourself. It may be news to you&mdash;it
probably is&mdash;but you, Sir, if I may say so, are so like the
famous and immortal warrior as almost to take one's breath away. It
is astonishing, wonderful! Might I&mdash;would it be&mdash;could
you&mdash;would you, Sir, be so very kind as to allow me to paint
you? I would, of course, make every effort not to inconvenience
you&mdash;I would arrange so that your time should be mine."</p>
<p>"Of course I will, guvnor," said the man. "I'm a professional
model and I've been sitting for NELSON for years. Why, I've been
doing it for an artist this very afternoon."</p>

<h3>THE SUNFLOWER.</h3>
<p>"Have you," said Francesca, "seen our sunflowers lately?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "I've kept an eye on them occasionally. It's a
bit difficult, by the way, not to see them, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Well," she said, "perhaps they are rather striking."</p>
<p>"Striking!" I said. "I never heard a more inadequate word. I
call them simply overwhelming&mdash;the steam-rollers of the
vegetable world. Look at their great yellow open faces."</p>
<p>"I never," said Francesca, "saw a steam-roller with a face.
You're mixing your metaphors."</p>
<p>"And," I said, "I shall go on mixing them as long as you grow
sunflowers. It's the very least a man can do by way of
protest."</p>
<p>"I don't know why you should want to protest. The seed makes
very good chicken-food."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," I said, "that's what you always said."</p>
<p>"And I bet," she said, "you've repeated it. When you've met the
tame Generals and Colonels at your club, and they've boasted to you
about their potatoes, I know you've countered them with the story
of how you've turned the whole of your lawn into a bed of
sunflowers calculated to drive the most obstinate hen into laying
two eggs a day, rain or shine."</p>
<p>"I admit," I said, "that I may have mentioned the matter
casually, but I never thought the things were going to be like
this. When I first knew them and talked about them they were tender
little shoots of green just modestly showing above the ground, and
now they're a forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlock
aren't in it with this impenetrable jungle liberally blotched with
yellow, this so-called sunflower patch."</p>
<p>"What would you call it," she said, "if you didn't call it
sunflower?"</p>
<p>"I should call it a beast of prey," I said. "A sunflower seems
to me to be more like a tiger than anything else."</p>
<p>"It was a steam-roller about a minute ago."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "it was&mdash;a tigerish steam-roller."</p>
<p>"How interesting," she said. "I have not met one quite like
that."</p>
<p>"That," I said, "is because your eye isn't properly poetical.
It's blocked with chicken-food and other utilitarian objects."</p>
<p>"I must," she said, "consult an oculist. Perhaps he will give me
glasses which will unblock my eye and make me see tigers in the
garden."</p>
<p>"No," I said, "you will have to do it for yourself. For such an
eye as yours even the best oculists are unavailing."</p>
<p>"I might," she said, "improve if I read poetry at home. Has any
poet written about sunflowers?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "BLAKE did. He was quite mad, and he wrote a poem
to a sunflower: 'Ah! Sunflower! Weary of time.' That's how it
begins."</p>
<p>"Weary of time!" she said scornfully. "That's no good to me. I'm
weary of having no time at all to myself."</p>
<p>"That shows," I said, "that you're not a sunflower."</p>
<p>"Thank heaven for that," she said. "It's enough to have four
children to look after&mdash;five including yourself."</p>
<p>"My dear Francesca," I said, "how charming you are to count me
as a child! I shall really begin to feel as if there were golden
threads among the silver."</p>
<p>"Tut-tut," she said, "you're not so grey as all that."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," I said, "quite as grey as all that and much greyer;
only we don't talk about it."</p>
<p>"But we <i>do</i> talk about sunflowers," she said, "don't
we?"</p>
<p>"If you'll promise to have the beastly glaring things dug
up&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not," she said, "before we've extracted from them their last
pip of chicken-food."</p>
<p>"Well, anyhow," I said, "as soon as possible. If you'll promise
to do that I'll promise never to mention them again."</p>
<p>"But you'll lose your reputation with the Generals and
Colonels."</p>
<p>"I don't mind that," I said, "if I can only rid the garden of
their detested presence."</p>
<p>"My golden-threaded boy," said Francesca, "it shall be as you
desire."</p>

<h2>A DAUGHTER OF THE BACK STEPPES.</h2>
<blockquote class="note"><i>(Russia may not yet be quite
sufficiently herself to be the martial ally that we could desire,
but she still continues to send us the most delightful fiction. Mr.
PUNCH is privileged in being able to offer his readers the opening
of a new and fascinating story translated from the Russian of
Ghastlilkoff.)</i></blockquote>
<p>I was born in the year 18&mdash;, and I have never ceased to
regret it. I lived with my grandmother. She was called Natasha. I
do not know why. She had a large mole on her left cheek. Often she
would embrace me with tears and lament over me, crying, "My little
sad one, my little lonely one!" Yet I was not sad; I had too many
griefs. Nor was I lonely, for I had no playmates.</p>
<p>Often my grandmother told me I was ugly. I had no mirror, so I
believed her. When I was sixteen a man I met in the street went mad
for love of me and cut his throat. For the first time in my life I
wondered if my grandmother always spoke the truth. I went home and
wept, but when she asked me why I could not tell her.</p>
<p>Our house was quite dark. It had three rooms leading in and out
of one another, and no windows. There was not much fresh air. Every
morning my grandmother went out to buy otchkza and pickled onions.
The man who sold them was very old. He had a cast in each eye. He
inquired of my grandmother if she would allow him to be my husband,
but she refused. His name I do not remember.</p>
<p>Our neighbours were very pleasant people, kindly and simple.
There was a half-witted youth called Krop. He used to fill his
mouth with large brass-headed nails. I did not dare to go near him,
for he always tried to bite my arms. One day I learned that he had
died. My grandmother bought me black silk mittens to wear at his
funeral. I was very proud, and ran out into the road to show them
to the other children. But in my haste I split them across from
seam to seam, and my grandmother whipped me and put me to bed.</p>
<p>My grandmother's chief friend was a woman who sold toasted
cheese. It was her custom to bring round the delicacy on a small
hand-cart and sell to the children for a few kopecks. This woman
was reputed to be very rich. She was not beautiful, for she had no
teeth, and had hair on her face. The first time I saw her I ran
into the house and hid behind the large barrel of butter-milk. My
grandmother took me by the ear and led me to her friend.</p>
<p>"This is Ilonoka," she said. "She is a good girl."</p>
<p>I remember that I cried very loud.</p>
<p>Afterwards my grandmother told me that perhaps the woman would
leave me all her money. Next time she came I wished to speak to
her, but unfortunately I had a quinsy. When the woman eventually
died it was discovered that she had been destitute for a long time.
She left her hand-cart by will to my grandmother, and in her
disappointment my grandmother beat me over the head with it. Soon
afterwards my hair began to come out, and my grandmother said it
was time I found a husband.</p>
<p>Accordingly she went next door, where lived a woman with five
sons. They were all out except one, and he had a sore leg. She
brought him to me, and I cried very bitterly. He also. His name was
Ivan, and I wished it had been Peter.</p>
<p>The next day we were betrothed, and all our friends came to eat
the feast that my grandmother provided. A school-fellow of mine, a
very beautiful girl, was angry because I had a husband and not she.
She scratched my face, and the blood ran on to my dress. Our
friends congratulated us, and when they had gone my grandmother
said it had been a great success. She and I finished what was left
of the feast and went to bed. I remember that my feet were very
cold, and when I fell asleep I dreamed that my betrothed's name was
Peter. When I awoke I cried very loud, and my grandmother slapped
my cheeks.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards she died, and I went to live with my uncle,
who was a pawnbroker in Moscow.</p>

<h3>A STRAIGHT TALK WITH L. G.</h3>
<blockquote class="note"><i>(Everyone has views as to how to win
the War, but not all are vocal, or&mdash;shall we
say?&mdash;vociferous. If Mr. LLOYD GEORGE reads all the papers (as
their Editors of course expect him to do) he cannot have missed
quite a number of powerful articles in the following manner. And
even if he should miss one or two it would not matter, because
there is always another in preparation.)</i></blockquote>
<p>I've always said that the PREMIER shouldn't be bothered with
Parliament. Of course I've said too that our old friend Demos, the
new god, should have a say in affairs; but that's an inconsistency
that doesn't count in the least, does it?</p>
<p>Now then, Mr. PREMIER, you've got the chance of your lifetime. I
always said you were a lucky devil&mdash;in fact, I never met the
Welshman that wasn't.</p>
<p>You see, Parliament's in recess, and all its trivial overpaid
Members are playing golf and things. You've got absolutely a free
hand if only you'll take it. It's quite easy and bound to succeed.
You've only got to do as I tell you.</p>
<p>For instance, you want to buck up HAIG and the people at the
Front. It's no use them telling you they know best, being on the
spot. That's only bluff, old man. Don't take any notice of them,
but just order a big general offensive; and before you can say Jack
Robinson we'll have the Huns behind the Rhine.</p>
<p>And do tell the Navy to get a move on. I'm glad to see my
articles have made you change the heads at the Admiralty; and of
course that's all very well so far as it goes. But it doesn't go
far enough. <i>Have a chat with BEATTY about it.</i> Get him to
root the Huns out. He can bombard Ostend and Zeebrugge and all
those funny little places in two-twos. Tell KING ALBERT not to
mind. We'll easily slap up new towns for him after the War, built
on the speedy American principle.</p>
<p>Then about that aerial offensive. There's really been quite
enough talk about it. We want some action, Mr. PREMIER. Isn't it
time it came off? Think what a bombardment of Cologne (taking care
of the cathedral, <i>of course</i>), Frankfurt, Berlin, Essen and
Hamburg would do, not to mention other places that I could if I had
an atlas.</p>
<p>And about those pacifists. Just clap the whole lot in gaol.
That's the best place for them. I won't object in the least, even
though I am the apostle of freedom.</p>
<p>Then there are lots and lots of other things you might do. You
might deliver a reasoned manifesto to the Russian people and buck
them up a bit. That won't do anybody any harm, and <i>it'll be
getting on with the War</i>, my little Welshman.</p>
<p>Well, there are a few points for you to go on with. You've got
the brains to think of more, otherwise I wouldn't have helped to
put you where you are to-day. But remember that if you <i>don't</i>

<h2>THE ONLY OTHER TOPIC.</h2>
<p>"I shot a marrow into the&mdash;I mean I cut a marrow two feet
seven inches long yesterday," said the man in the corner seat.</p>
<p>"What did it weigh?" we asked anxiously. After two months of
them potatoes had somewhat palled. We were growing rather tired of
marrows, but we waited eagerly for his answer,</p>
<p>"Twenty-six pounds nine and three-quarter ounces."</p>
<p>Disappointment again. Our hopes were dashed to the ground. Some
obscure individual, according to the local press, had produced from
his humble cottage garden a marrow weighing thirty-four pounds, and
the thing rankled.</p>
<p>"Mine was a scraggy specimen, more like an Indian club than a
marrow."</p>
<p>"Crossed in love, perhaps," said Dalton.</p>
<p>"What your marrow wanted was nourishment," said the Authority.
"A piece of worsted round its neck, with one end dipped in a jar of
water."</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Jones, "the very latest is to insert a tube in
the stalk, and the flavour is greatly improved if you add a little
sugar to the water. Almost like a melon."</p>
<p>"Do you take a card out for each marrow, or one for each plant?"
asked Dalton.</p>
<p>The quiet man opposite put his paper down. He was a new-comer in
the district. We liked him, although he had no sense of humour and
did not appreciate Dalton's jokes. He appeared to be interested
only in the startling and the odd.</p>
<p>"That reminds me," he said, "of a most extraordinary experience
I had a few days ago. Of course you all know Enderby?"</p>
<p>None of us knew Enderby, but we I did not like to say so. The
quiet man's anxiety was painful. We felt he could not go on with
his story unless someone knew Enderby.</p>
<p>"He has a little place round at the back of the
Common&mdash;quite a nice little place." Freath&mdash;that was the
quiet man's name&mdash;looked at us reproachfully.</p>
<p>"I think I know Enderby," said Dalton. "Isn't he a heavily-built
man about fifty, with a grey moustache?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," said Freath eagerly. "And a curious wart on his left
cheek. Well, I dined with him the other night. His boy was there,
home for the holidays. Very clever boy; his special study is the
biology of plants. They gave me a very good dinner; I didn't notice
very much what I was eating, but I did when the maid helped me to
marrow. It was a deep crimson colour. I tasted it somewhat
nervously, for I felt they were all watching me. It had the taste
of the most exquisite fruit, and the flavour&mdash;I am afraid you
won't believe me&mdash;was that of the finest port that I ever
drank. 'How did you manage this, Arthur?' said Enderby.
'Grape-juice,' said Arthur. 'Those foreign black grapes are very
cheap just now, so I mixed some with the water that I was feeding
the marrows on.' I can't explain it to you; all I know is that I
had a second helping. I am afraid you don't believe it," said
Freath uneasily.</p>
<p>We assured him that we did, but we did not say it with
conviction.</p>
<p>"Enderby called round to see me a few days afterwards,"
continued Freath, "and I walked back with him. As we went along he
told me that a relative was staying with them&mdash;an uncle. The
first night, again they had marrow for dinner. This time its
flavour was not port but whisky&mdash;Scotch whisky. The old
gentleman was delighted with Arthur and his experiments. Although
an abstainer he had three helpings. This was very pleasing to
Enderby, as the uncle was a man of considerable wealth. But he was
not at all satisfied with his son's explanations, and he thought he
recognised the whisky. Although an abstainer while the War is on,
Enderby keeps a very good cellar, and when he came to look into
things he found that Arthur had been pumping his finest '60 port
and old matured Scotch whisky into the vegetable marrows. Now what
do you think of that?"</p>
<p>We thought it very strange and we said so.</p>
<p>"But the strangest part has yet to come. Of course they had to
keep it quiet&mdash;bottle it up, so to speak, from the old
gentleman, and let the marrows down gradually. But when the marrows
were once more on a temperance <i>r&eacute;gime</i> the most
extraordinary thing happened." The train was running into Finsbury
Park. Freath rose and collected his things.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg
195]</span>
<p>We stared at him, fascinated.</p>
<p>"Enderby took me into the garden to see it. He said it had been
going on for the last week. From all directions, rioting across the
flower-beds, the lawn, down the paths, the marrows were growing
towards the wine-cellar at the rate of twelve feet a day."</p>
<p>Freath hastily left the carriage and jumped into the Broad
Street train.</p>
<p>While we were discussing the story the voice of authority spoke:
"The whole thing's a tissue of falsehood. There's no such man as
Enderby."</p>
<p>"But Dalton knows him," we said.</p>
<p>"I don't know Enderby," said Dalton. "But I wanted to hear the
story."</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<h5>"THE PACIFISTS."</h5>
<p>As a reasonable jusquaboutist I have some misgivings about Mr.
HENRY ARTHUR JONES'S farce&mdash;parable, <i>The Pacifists</i>.
Assume <i>Market Pewbury's</i> afflictions to have been as stated:
an intolerable stalwart cad of a butcher fencing-in the best part
of the common, assaulting people's grandmothers, shutting them up
in coal-cellars and eating their crumpets, kissing their wives in
the market square and proposing to abduct them to seaside resorts,
and none so bold to do him violence and make him stop it; the
police being ill or absent, the Mayor and his friend, chief victim
of the butcher's aggression, unwilling on account of principles to
do anything but talk and get up leagues to deal with the trouble in
general, and in a final ecstasy of disapproval to write a strong
letter; only uncle <i>Belcher</i>, a truculent old sea-dog with a
natural lust for whisky and blood, organising an opposition,
valiantly hiring a notable pugilist to deal with the butcher, and
becoming desperately anxious lest the matter should be peaceably
settled because the basher, having been engaged, <i>must</i> find
something to bash or there will be trouble. Well, if we must have
forged for us the sword of a three-Act parable, we should like it
with one edge, not two.</p>
<p>Mr. JONES was evidently bursting with the desire to give some
irritating people a very hard knock&mdash;witness the barbed
dedication with which the normally peaceful theatre-announcement
columns have bristled some little time past; and I think I dare say
that we were interested in his first Act. He did really work out
his analogies with some skill. But we soon came to feel that he was
essentially doing something between flogging a dead horse, so far
as we were concerned, and shooting a sitting rabbit. I suspect too
that we realised the issues were too tragic for this kind of
buffoonery. The tribute of our applause was a tribute of loyalty to
one who has often deserved well of the republic, and partly the
desire to show that our hearts were in the right place. I don't see
<i>The Pacifists</i> as a pamphlet making many converts. As a kick
on the shins it has points.</p>
<p>I confess the thing that pleased me most was a gay little piece
of burlesque by Mr. ARTHUR CHESNEY as the red-haired shop assistant
who was <i>not</i> a pacifist. Mr. CHARLES GLENNEY so thoroughly
enjoyed the robustious sea-captain that we had to enjoy it
too&mdash;a sound notion of entertainment, that. Mr. SEBASTIAN
SMITH played chief rabbit with considerable skill and point; Mr.
LENNOX PAWLE amused with his plump dundrearyed mayor; Mr. SAM
LIVESEY'S offensive was, I am sure, as Hunnish as its author could
possibly have desired. Miss ELLIS JEFFREYS appeared in the first
Act as a very plausible imitation of a prominent tradesman's wife
in an eighth-rate provincial town, with some quite excellent
moments. But she was evidently labouring under severe strain, and I
amused myself by speculating how long she would keep out of a
really well-cut skirt and a sophisticated air of Mayfair. Just an
Act. And surely she is mistaken in thinking that an effect of
extreme agitation is best conveyed, by very rapid
quasi-cinematographic progression up and down the stage? But I saw
no reason to complain of the bold bad butcher's taste in the matter
of a subject for abduction.</p>

<h2>BUCEPHALUS AND THE ROAD-HOGS.</h2>
<p>When Miss Ropes asked at breakfast how many of us would like to
watch the very last cricket-match of the season at Lumsdale,
practically the entire hospital held up its hand, and it was found
that the two cars could not accommodate us all. It was therefore
settled that Haynes (who said he knew the moves) should drive
Ansell and me over in the governess-cart.</p>
<p>It was also settled that the crew of the governess-cart should
have an early cold lunch and start an hour before the cars; thus
(it was calculated) we should all arrive at the cricket-ground
fairly well together. This did not take Haynes' driving into
account. We started from the door at a very satisfactory pace,
probably because Bucephalus, the fat pony, objected to the
enthusiasm of our send-off. When we reached the road he dropped
into an amble so gentle that we decided that he had really been
running away in the drive. Next, taking advantage of an almost
imperceptible upward slope, he began to walk. Haynes clucked at him
and flapped the reins, but this had no effect beyond steering
Bucephalus into the left-hand ditch.</p>
<p>"I thought you said you knew the moves," remarked Ansell.
"Surely this is wrong?"</p>
<p>"The bally beast's lopsided," said Haynes with heat. "One side
of his mouth's hard and the other soft."</p>
<p>"The difficulty being," I suggested as we lurched across the
road into the other ditch, "to discover which is which.... Now
you're straight. We'd better trot. It's only a one-day match."</p>
<p>Haynes used the ancient whip, which had as much effect as
tickling a rhinoceros with a feather.</p>
<p>"Goad him with a penknife," suggested Ansell unfeelingly.</p>
<p>"There must be some way," said Haynes. "Because they <i>do</i>
trot, you know."</p>
<p>"Speaking as one ignorant amateur to another," I asked, "isn't
the right thing to pull gently on the reins and then slacken? You
go on doing it till the animal gets your meaning. Try it."</p>
<p>Haynes tried it, and Bucephalus stopped dead. Repetition of the
treatment simply produced a tendency to back.</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake don't lose any of the ground we've gained,"
said Ansell. "Let's get on, if only at a walk."</p>
<p>"We shall have to tow him," decided Haynes. He got out and
hauled at the bridle, but Bucephalus refused to budge.</p>
<p>"This," said Ansell, becoming suddenly business-like, "is where
the Boy Hero modestly but firmly takes charge. Jump in."</p>
<p>He picked up the reins and, though he apparently did nothing in
particular with them, Bucephalus came to life at once and broke
into a lumbering trot.</p>
<p>"You silly chump, why didn't you say you could drive?" asked
Haynes.</p>
<p>"Nobody asked me," said the Boy Hero modestly, "and I was
shy."</p>
<p>At the time when we had been scheduled to reach the
cricket-ground we had still a mile to go along a narrow leafy road,
hardly more than a lane. The cars were overdue, and Haynes, whose
haughty spirit could not brook the idea of being passed by jeering
plutocrats, propounded a scheme.</p>
<p>"They can't pass us unless we go into the ditch," he explained.
"So when they come we'll pretend to be asleep, take up the middle
of the road, and simply ignore them. We'll get there first, after
all."</p>
<p>A moment later we heard the buzz of engines. I took a hurried
glance round and saw the sunlight on brasswork as the car came
round a distant corner.</p>
<p>"It's them," I said.</p>
<p>The reins dropped slackly on Bucephalus's back and he slowed to
a walk. Inside the governess-cart all was somnolent peace. Behind
us the car was already beginning to make remarks on one of those
abusive press-the-button horns. "You FOOL! You FOOL! Get OUT o' the
way! Get OUT o' the way!" it said. Then we heard the car slow down
and pandemonium broke loose. The horn was reinforced by an ordinary
hooter, a whistle, several human voices and, lastly, an exhaust
siren. I stole a glance at Ansell and found that he was having a
good deal of surreptitious trouble in restraining our fiery steed
from doing a second bolt.</p>
<p>"I say," whispered Haynes in sudden agitation, "<i>has</i> Miss
Ropes an exhaust siren?"</p>
<p>"No, she hasn't," Ansell replied in tones of horror. "We've held
up the wrong car." He looked round. "Good Lord!" he added softly
and pulled Bucephalus into the ditch. In the car, with a grinning
Tommy at the wheel, sat two apoplectic generals and a highly
explosive brigade-major. They came alongside, and I should never be
allowed to repeat what they said to us. It seemed that by delaying
them we had been hindering the day's work of the entire Home
Forces. We were given to understand that it was only the blue bands
on our arms which saved us from being court-martialled on the spot
and shot by the grinning Tommy at dawn. Then they passed on.</p>
<p>When our cars did appear a minute or two later we pulled meekly
into the ditch to let them pass, and could find no better answer to
the jeers of their occupants than a wan sickly smile apiece.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>
<p>Unless you can share with me the sad immunity of the forties, I
must despair of translating for you the emotion raised in my
antique soul by the wrapper of a new RIDER HAGGARD story bearing
the picture of a Zulu and the discovery inside that
<i>Quatermain</i> is come again! The tale that has so excited me is
called, a little ominously, <i>Finished</i> (WARD, LOCK), and I
could have better loved a cheerier title. The matter is, to begin
with, an affair of a shady doctor, of I.D.B. and an abduction; none
of it, I admit, any too absorbing. But about halfway through the
author, as though sharing my own views upon this part of the plot,
exchanges (so to speak) the Shady for the Black, and transports us
all to Zululand. And if you need reminding of what H.R.H. can do
with that delectable country, I can only say I am sorry for you.
Incidentally there are some stirring scenes from certain pages of
history that the glare of these later days has rather
faded&mdash;Isandhlwana and Rorke's Drift among them; as well as
the human drama of the feud between CETEWAYO (terror of my
nursery!) and the witch-doctor <i>Zikali</i>. Whether the old
careless rapture is altogether recovered is another matter; at
least the jolly unpronounceable names are still there, and the
picturesque speech. Most of the names, that is; <i>Allan</i> of
course, and others, but I for one should have welcomed rare
<i>Umslopogaas</i>&mdash;or however he is rightly spelt&mdash;and
<i>Curtis</i>, for personal reasons my favourite of the gallant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg
198]</span> company that have so often kept secret rendezvous with
me behind the unlifted lid of a desk at preparation time. And now
have we really come at long last to <i>Finished</i>? I can only
hope that Sir H. RIDER HAGGARD doesn't mean it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD may be numbered amongst the most indefatigable
of women war-workers. She has now followed up her former success in
<i>England's Effort</i> with a volume carrying on the story of our
part in the War under the title of <i>Towards the Goal</i>
(MURRAY). The book is written in the form of a series of letters
addressed to ex-President ROOSEVELT, as the onlie begetter both of
it and its predecessor. It is further equipped with a preface by
the hand of this same able and clear-sighted gentleman, the chief
drawback of which (from my reviewing point of view) is that it
covers so well the whole ground of appreciation as to leave me
nothing more to add. "Mrs. Ward writes nobly on a noble
theme"&mdash;<i>voil&agrave; tout!</i> Her theme, as I have hinted,
is a further exposition of Britain's war activities as those have
developed since the former book was published. In its course Mrs.
WARD gives us some vivid experiences of her own as a visitor to the
Western Front: things seen and heard, well calculated (were this
needed) to stiffen the resolution of the great people to whom her
letters are really written. <i>England's Effort</i> was, I
understand, translated into many tongues (with results that can
hardly fail of being enormously valuable); <i>Towards the Goal</i>
should certainly receive the same treatment of which it is well
worthy.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. WILLIAM HARBUTT DAWSON, in his <i>After War Problems</i>
(ALLEN AND UNWIN), covers, under the four headings, Empire and
Citizenship, Natural Efficiency, Social Reform, and National
Finance and Taxation, bewilderingly wide ground, and drives a
perhaps rather mandarinish team of contributors. Lord HALDANE, for
instance, is no longer in the real van of educational endeavour,
and is it wholly insignificant that his chapter on Education
appears in the section headed National Efficiency rather than in
that of Social Reform? It ought not to be difficult to give, in the
light of these last years, a wider interpretation to Patriotism
than that expressed by Lord MEATH on lines familiar to his public.
Sir WILLIAM CHANCE has seen no new sign in the skies in relation to
the problem of poverty. Sir BENJAMIN BROWNE, whose death all those
interested in the settlement of the Capital-Labour quarrel must
deplore, as for all his uncompromising individualism he brought to
it a rare breadth of view, says much that is of real value, but
does not refrain from appealing to the fact that the mutual
confidence of man and officer in battle is a proof of the
possibility of a similar confidence in the workshop. That
confidence must, and can, we dare to believe, eventually be
established. But the men don't go over the top to put money in the
Colonel's pocket, and little good is done by exploiting these loose
analogies and putting on a too easy air of optimism in the face of
desperately serious and complex problems. But enough of
fault-finding, which is a poor reward for the serious and generous
labours of public-spirited men and women. After all, what one
reader calls timidity of outlook another may care to praise as
prudence. Here you will find an abundance of safe analysis, wise
comment and constructive suggestion from a galaxy of accredited
authorities.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In the early chapters of Mr. WILLIAM HEWLETT'S new story, <i>The
Plot-Maker</i> (DUCKWORTH), we are introduced to a popular and
highly successful novelist, named <i>Coulthard Henderson</i>, in
the emotional crisis produced by a sudden doubt as to whether his
output of best-sellers represented anything in the least
approaching actuality. You will admit a tragic situation. He meets
it by the determination that his next book shall be a veritable
slice of life, and to this end he selects and finances an eligible
young man for the purpose of vicariously experiencing those
emotions, from which age and other causes debar the chronicler; in
other words, he hires a hero. The worst of this excellent idea is
that it can hardly be said to originate either with <i>Mr.
Henderson</i> or Mr. HEWLETT, that credit belonging (I fancy) to
the late HERBERT FLOWERDEW in a too-little-appreciated masterpiece
of sensational burlesque called <i>The Realist</i>. However, <i>The
Plot-Maker</i>, once set going, develops admirably enough on lines
entirely its own. The so-much-an-hour hero turns out an engaging
young gentleman, but a wofully poor protagonist. The situation
where (in the midst of whirling events) he makes the startling
discovery that he himself has been in some way switched on to the
part of villain is one that you can appreciate only at first hand.
Certainly if you want (as who does not in these days?) an
anaesthetic of agreeable nonsense <i>The Plot-Maker</i> is a medium
that I can cordially recommend: one obvious advantage being that
you need not try to believe a single word of it.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
