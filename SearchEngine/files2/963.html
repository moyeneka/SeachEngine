<h3>WHAT BOOKS DID OTLOH WRITE?</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In Dr. Maitland's able vindication of the
<i>Dark Ages</i> (p. 419. 1st ed.), he concludes his interesting
extract from the scribe Otloh's account
of himself by saying:&mdash;"One would like to know
what books they were which Otlohnus thus multiplied;
but this, perhaps, is now impossible." I
have it accidentally in my power to identify two
at least of the number; and if it was his universal
practice to subscribe his name, as he does
in these instances, a search into the principal repositories
of MSS. would, no doubt, give a large
list. A valuable MS. volume in my possession
has been thus described by a learned Benedictine:
"Codex Membranaceus constans foliis 223 numerando;
sculis ix. desinente, x. et xi. incipiente,
variis manibus scriptus, per partes qui in unum
collectus, ex scriptis variis natid scriptur carlovingic,
varia continens: 1 Vita et Passio, seu
Martirium S. Dionisii; scripta fuit ab Hilduino
Abbate Coenobii S. Dionisii in Francia sub Ludovico
Pio." It is said that Hilduinus was the first
writer who gave the marvellous story of the saint
carrying his own head in his hand for nearly two
miles after his decapitation. But he tells us that
he abridged his narration <i>ex Grcam et Latinorum
Historiis</i>.</p>

<p>2 Revelatio facta S. Stephano Pap de consecratione
altaris SS. Petri et Pauli ante Sepulchrum
S. Martirii Dionisii qu consecratio facta
fuit v. kal. Aug. 754. This part of the MS. is
remarkable for containing in one place the date
written in Roman ciphers, thus&mdash;dccLiiii. v. kl.
aug.; a circumstance so rare in MSS. of this age,
as to have astonished the learned diplomatists Papebroch
and Germon.</p>

<p>3 Historia S. Simeonis Trevirensis Solitarii.
Of whom it is recorded that he lived <i>sub Poppone
Episcopo Trevirense, in qudam cellula ad portam
nigram sit</i>. At fol. 36. an interesting account of
the death of the saint is given by the author, who
was present, and with the assistance of two other
monks, piously performed his obsequies. It appears
that the abbey of S. Maximin was about
120 paces from the cell of the saint at Treves, and
it is therefore most probable that the writer was a
monk of the Benedictine order then belonging to
that foundation; but he puts his name out of
doubt by the following couplet, inscribed at the
end of the narrative:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Presbiter et monachus OTLOH quidam vocitatus</p>
<p>Sancte tibi librum BONIFACII tradidit istum."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This dedication of his labours to S. Boniface may
only indicate his veneration for the national saint;
but, as he tells us he worked a great deal in the
monastery at Fulda (of which S. Boniface was the
patron saint and founder), may not this have been
one of his labours there? At a subsequent period,
it appears, he revised and amplified Wilibald's
<i>Life of Boniface</i>.</p>

<p>I must summarily indicate the other contents of
this interesting MS., which are: 4. Passio SS
Sebastiani et Vincentii. 5. Vita S. Burchardi.
6. Vita et Passio S. Kiliani (genere Scoti). 7. Vita
S. Sole. 8. Vita S. Ciri. 9. Depositio S. Satiri.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>{114}</span>
10. Alphabetum Grcum. 11. Officio pro Choro
cum notis musicis, pro festo S. Pancratii; sequitur
ipsiis martiriis passio. 12. Vita S. Columbani
[this is anonymous, but is attributed to his disciple
Jonas, and contains much valuable historical
matter]. Lastly, 13. Vita S. Wolfgangi, by the
hand of our interesting scribe OTLOH, written at
the instance of the Benedictine Coenobites of his
monastery of S. Emmeram, at Ratisbon, where
the saint was buried. This, as in the case of the
<i>Life of S. Boniface</i>, is a <i>rifaccimento</i>; it was made
from two older lives of S. Wolfgang, as Otloh
himself tells us, one of them by a certain monk
named Arnolfus, the other having been brought
out of France. He is here, therefore, more an
author than a scribe; but he declares modestly
that it was a task he would willingly avoid for the
future. The passage of his Preface is worth
transcribing: "Fratrum quorundam nostrorum
hortatu sedulo infimus ego, O coenobitarum S.
Emmerammi compulsus sum S. Wolfgangi vitam
in libellulis duobus dissimili interdum, et impolita
materie descriptam in unum colligere, et aliquantulum
sublimiori modo corrigere.... Multa
etiam qu in libro neutro inveniebantur, fidelium
quorundam attestatione compert addere studui,
sicque qudam addendo, qudam vero fastidiose
vel inepte dicta excerpendo, pluraque etiam corrigendo,
sed et capitularia prponendo. Vobis
O fratres mei exactoresque hujus rei prout ingenioli
mei parvitas permisit obedivi. Jam rogo
cessate plus tale quid exigere a me." At the end
of the Life he has written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Presul Wolfgange cunctis semper vererande</p>
<p>Hc tua qui scripsi jam memor esto milii</p>
<p>Presbiter et Monachus Otloh quidam vocitatus</p>
<p>Sancte tibi librum Bonifacii tradidit istum."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>We have here sufficient evidence that Otloh was
a worthy predecessor of the distinguished Benedictines
to whom the world of letters has been so
deeply indebted in more recent times.</p>

<p>Dr. Maitland's mention of the calligraphic labours
of the nun Diemudis, Otloh's contemporary,
is not a solitary instance: in all ages, the world
has been indebted to the pious zeal of these
recluse females for the multiplication of books of
devotion and devout instruction. An instance, of so
late a date as the eve of the invention of printing,
now lies before me, in a thick volume, most beautifully
written by fair hands that must have been
long practised in the art. As the colophon at the
end preserves the names of the ladies, and records
that the parchment was charitably furnished by
their spiritual father, I think it worth transcribing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Expliciunt, Deo laus omnipotente, quinque libri
de VITA &amp; CONVERSATIONE SANCTORVM PATRVM Scripti
per manibus Sororum AUE TRICI et GHEEZE YSENOUDI
in festivus diebus suis consororibus dilectis in memoriam
earum. Finiti ano dni M CCCC XLIX in festo
decollationis Sci Johannis baptiste ante sumam missam.
Et habebant ad hoc pergamenum sibi ex caritate provisum
de venerabi li presbitero Dno NICOLAO WYT tunc
temporis earundem patre spirituali &amp; sibi ipsiis spiritualiter
ac in Dno sat reverenter dilectio. Ex caritativo
amore sitis propter Deum memores eorum cum uno
AVE MARIA."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I omitted to mention that Massmann, in his
<i>Kleinen Sprachdenkmale des VIII. bis XII. Jahrhunderts</i>,
Leipsig, 1830, p. 50, says: "The Benedictine priest
Otloh, of Regensburg, left behind
him a work, <i>De Ammonicione Clericorum et Laicorum</i>,
in which is twice given a Latin prayer
(Cod. Monacens. Emmeram. f. cxiii. mbr. sc.
xi.), at fol. 51. <i>d</i>., as <i>Oratio ejus qui et suprascripta
et sequentia edidit dicta</i>, and at fol. 158. as <i>Oratio
cuidam peccatoris</i>." On fol. 161. <i>b</i>. is an old German
version, first printed by Pez (Thes. i. 417.),
corrected by Graff. Diutiska, 111. 211., by Massmann,
at p. 168. Otloh mentions in this prayer
the destruction of his monastery of St. Emmeram,
which took place in 1062.</p>

<p>I have advisedly called him Otloh, and not
Otlohnus.</p>

<h3>NOTES UPON CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK FOR LONDON.</h3>

<p>No. 1. "<i>Gerrard Street, Soho.</i> * * * At the
Turk's Head, in Gerrard Street, Johnson and Sir
Joshua Reynolds founded, in the year 1764, 'The
Literary Club.'"</p>

<p>It would appear from the following extracts in
my Common-place Book, that the <i>original</i> Turk's
Head, at which the Literary Club first held their
meetings, was in <i>Greek</i> Street, Soho, not in
Gerrard Street:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The Literary Club was first held at the Turk's
Head in Greek Street, which tavern was almost half a
century since removed to Gerrard Street, where it continued
nearly as long as the house was kept open."&mdash;<i>European
Mag.</i> Jan. 1803.</p>

<p>"The Turk's Head, in Gerrard Street, Soho, was,
more than fifty years since, removed from a tavern of
the same sign the corner of Greek and Compton Streets.
This place was a kind of head-quarters for the Loyal
Association during the rebellion of 1745."&mdash;Moser's
<i>Memorandum Book</i>, MS. dated 1799.
</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 2. <i>Storey's Gate, Birdcage Walk, St. James's
Park.</i>&mdash;I have seen it stated, but do not recollect
where, that "Storey's" was a house of public
entertainment. "Webb's," mentioned in the following
extracts, was also a place of a similar description:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"April 25. 1682.&mdash;About nine, this night, it began
to lighten, thunder, and rain. The next morning,
there was the greatest flood in St. James's Park ever

<h3>WIVES OF ECCLESIASTICS.</h3>

<p>In reply to your correspondent's query as to
the "wives of ecclesiastics," I find amongst my
notes one to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
ERROR, to assume in ancient genealogies that a
branch is necessarily extinct, simply because the
last known representative is described as "Clericus,"
and <i>ergo</i>, must have died S.P.L.
</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be obvious to many of your readers that
Clericus is <i>nomen generale</i> for all such as were
learned in the arts of reading and writing, and
whom the old law deemed capable of claiming
benefit of clergy,&mdash;a benefit not confined to those
in orders, if the ordinary's deputy standing by
could say "<i>legit ut clericus</i>."</p>

<p>The title of Clericus, then, in earlier times as
now, belonged not only to those in the holy ministry
of the Church, and to whom more strictly
applied the term Clergy, either regular or secular,
but to those as well who by their function or
course of life practised their pens in any court or
otherwise, as Clerk of the King's Wardrobe, Clerks
of the Exchequer, &amp;c. Though in former times
clerks of this description were frequently in holy
orders and held benefices, it must be evident that
they were not all so of necessity; and the instances
are so numerous where persons having the
title of "Clericus" appear nevertheless to have
been in the married state, and to have discharged
functions incompatible with the service of the
Church, that the assertion will not be denied that
the restrictions as to contracting matrimonial alliances
did not extend to clerks not in holy orders
or below the grade of <i>subdiaconus</i>. The <i>Registrum
Brevium</i> furnishes a precedent of a writ,
"<i>De clerico infra sacros ordines constituto non eligendo
in officium</i>." This distinction alone would
prove that other clerks were not ineligible to
office. The various decrees of the Church may
be cited to show that the prohibition to marry
did not include all clerks generally. Pope
Gregory VII., in a synod held in 1074, "interdixit
clericis, maxime divino ministerio consecratis
uxores habere, vel cum mulicribus habitare,
nisi quas Nicena Synodus vel alii canones exceperunt."</p>

<p>The statutes made by Anselm, Archbishop of
Canterbury, Thomas, Archbishop elect of York,
and all the other bishops of England, in 1108, in
presence of King Henry I., and with the assent of
his barons, confine the interdiction respecting marriages
to <i>Presbyteri, Diaconi et Subdiaconi</i>, and a
provision is made by them for those cases where
marriages had been contracted since the interdict
at the Council of London (that probably in 1103),
viz. that such should be precluded thereafter
from celebrating mass, if they persist in retaining
their wives. "Illi vero presbyteri, diaconi,
subdiaconi, qui post interdictum Londoniensis
Concilii foeminas suas tenuerunt vel alins duxcrunt,
si amplius missam celebrare voluerint, eas a
se omnino sic facient alienas, ut nec illae in domos
eorum, nec ipsi in domos earum intrent.... Illi
autem presbyteri qui divini altaris et sacrorum
ordinum contemptores praelegerint cum mulicribus
habitare a divino officio remoti, omnique
ecclesiastico beneficio privati, extra chorum ponantur,
infames pronunciati. Qui vero rebellis et
contemptor foeminam non reliquerit, et missam celebrare
presumpserit, vocatus ad satisfactionem si
neglexerit, viiij. die excommunicetur. Eadem
sententia archidiaconos et cononicos omnes complectitur,
et de mulieribus relinquendis et de vitanda
carum conversatione, et de districtione censurae
si statuta transgressi fuerint.... Presbyteri
vero qui relictis mulieribus, Deo et sacris altaribus
servire elegerint, xl. dies ab officio cessantes, pro
se interim vicarios habebunt, injuncta eis poenitentia
secundum hoc quod episcopis corum visum
fuerit." In 1138 the penalty for priests marrying
was deprivation of their benefices, and exclusion
from the celebration of divine service:&mdash;"Sanctorum
patrum vestigiis inhaerentes, presbyteros,
diaconos, subdiaconos uxoratos, aut concubinarios,
ecclesiasticis officiis et beneficiis privamus, ac ne
quis eorum missam audire praesumat Apostolica
auctoriate prohibemus."</p>

<p>Many such decrees have been made at various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>{116}</span>
synods and councils holden for reformation of the
clergy, but I can find none wherein marriage is
interdicted to clerks generally. I will refer to
one more only, viz. that made in the Council of
London, held at Westminster in 1175. Here it
will be seen most distinctly that the prohibition
against entering the marriage state was confined
expressly to <i>Clerici in sacris ordinibus constituti</i>,
and that is was not only lawful for clerks below
the grade of subdeacon to marry, but that having
subsequently once entered the marriage state and being subsequently
desirous <i>ad religionem transire</i>, and to
continue in the service of the Church, they could
not do so and be separated from their wives unless
<i>de communi consensu</i>; if they continued, however,
to live with their wives, they could not hold an
ecclesiastical benefice: "Si quis sacerdos vel clericus
in sacris ordinibus constitutus, ecclesiam vel
ecclesiasticum beneficium habens publice fornicarium
habeat," &amp;c.... "Si qui vero infra subdiaconatum
constituti matrimonia contraxerint, ab
uxoribus sius nisi de communi consensu ad religionem
transire voluerint, et ibi in Dei servitio
vigilanter permanere, nullatenus separentur: sed
cum uxoribus viventes, ecclesiastica benficia nullo
modo percipiant. Qui autem in subdiaconatu, vel
supra, ad matrimonia convolaverint, mulieres etiam
invitas et renitentes relinquant."</p>

<p>This it will be seen that the title "Clericus"
under some circumstances, affords no certain indication
that a lawful marriage may not have been
contracted by the person so described and consequently
that he might not have <i>prolem legitimam</i>.</p>

<p class="author">W.H.</p>

<p>It does not follow that William de Bolton was
an ecclesiastic because he was called Clericus;
that designation being, even in that early time,
often used in a lay sense.</p>

<p>I have just come across an instance of a prior
date. In the Liberate Roll of 26 Henry III. the
king directs a payment to be made "to Isabella,
the wife of our beloved clerk, Robert of Canterbury,
to purchase a robe for our use." Even in
the reign of Richard I. it may be doubtful whether
the term was not used with both meanings; for in
the charter of Walter Mapes, granting certain
lands, among the witnesses are "Rogero, capellano,
Willelmo, capellano, Thoma, <i>clerico meo</i>,
Waltero, clerico, Jacobo, clerico, Bricio, fermario
meo."</p>

<p class="author">[Symbol: Phi]</p>

<div class="note">
<p>[In addition to the information afforded by the preceding
communications "A SUBSCRIBER" will find
much curious illustration of this subject in Beveridge's
<i>Discourses on the Thirty-Nine Articles</i>, where he treats of
the Thirty-second article "On the Marriage of Priests."</p>

<p>He must however consult the edition printed at the
Oxford University Press in 1840, which contains for
the first time Beveridge's <i>Discourses on the last Nine
Articles</i>.]</p>

<h3>TOWER ROYAL.</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In your second number I find a query
by Mr. Cunningham, respecting the origin of the
name of <i>Tower Royal</i>; although I cannot satisfactorily
explain it, I enclose a few notes relative to
the early history of that place, which may, perhaps,
afford a clue to its derivation.</p>

<p>In early records it is invariably called "la Real,"
"la Reole," "la Riole," or "la Ryal or Ryole;"
and it is described simply as a "tenement;" I have
never found an instance of its being called a
"tower". At the close of the reign of Henry III.
it was held by one Thomas Bat, citizen of London,
who demised it to Master Simon of Beauvais,
surgeon to Edward I.; this grant was confirmed
by that sovereign by charter in 1277. (Rot.
Cart. 5 Edw. I. m. 17.&mdash;Placita de Quo Warranto,
p. 461.) This Simon of <i>Beauvais</i> figures in Stow
and Pennant as Simon de Beawmes. In 1331
Edward III. granted "la Real" to his consort
Philippa, for the term of her life, that is might be
used as a depository for her wardrobe. (Rot. Pat.
4 Edw. III. 2nd part, m. 15.) By Queen Philippa
it was extensively repaired, if not rebuilt, and the
particulars of the works executed there by her
direction, may be seen in the Wardrobe Account
of the sixth year of her reign, preserved in the
Cottonian MS. Galba E iii. fo. 177, et seq.; this
account is erroneously attributed in the catalogue
to Eleanor, consort of Edward I. One Maria de
Beauvais, probably a descendant of Master Simon,
received compensation for quitting a tenement
which she held at the time Philippa's operations
commenced. In 1365 Edward III. granted to
Robert de Corby, in fee, "one tenement in the
street of la Ryole, London" to hold by the accustomed
services. Finally, in 1370 Edward gave
the "inn (hospitium) with its appurtenances called
le Reole, in the city of London," to the canons of
St. Stephen's, Westminster, as of the yearly value
of 20<i>l</i>. (Rot. Pat. 43 Edw. III. m. 24.)</p>

<p>It is sufficiently clear that in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries this place was not called
<i>Tower Royal</i>; nor does there appear to be any
ground for supposing it was so named in
earlier times, or, indeed, that it was ever occupied
by royalty before it became Philippa's wardrobe.
The question, therefore is narrowed to this point:&mdash;what
is the significance of "la Real, Reole, or
Riole?" I should be glad if any of your correspondents
would give their opinions on the subject.
I may add, that the building was in the parish of
St. Thomas Apostle, not in that of St. Michael
Pater Noster Church, as Stow wrote. (Rot. Pat.
4 Edw. III. 2nd part, m. 38.)</p>

<p>Let me refer Mr. P. Cunningham to "Stow's
<i>Survey</i>, p. 27. 92. Thoms' Edition," for a full answer
to his query. The passages are too long to
cite, but Mr. C. will find sufficient proof of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>{117}</span>
the part of a royal residence having once stood in
this obscure lane, now almost demolished in the
sweeping city improvements, which threaten in
time to leave us hardly a fragment of the London
of the old chronicler.</p>

<p>The Tower was also called the Queen's Wardrobe,
and it was there, Froissart tells us, that Joan
of Kent, the mother of Richard II., took refuge
during Wat Tyler's rebellion, when forced to fly
from the Tower of London. The old historian
writes that after the defeat of the rebels "pour le
premier chemin que le Roy fit, il vint deuers sa
Dame de mre, la Princesse, qui estoit en un
chastel <i>de la Riolle</i> (que l'on dit la Garderobbe la
Reyne) et l s'estoit tenue deux jours et deux
nuits, moult bahie; et avoit bien raison. Quand
elle vit le Roy son fils, elle fut toute rejouye, et
luy dit, 'Ha ha beau fils, comment j'ay eu aujourd'huy
grand peine et angoisse pour vous.' Dont
respondit le Roy, et dit, 'Certes, Madame, je le
say bien. Or vous rejouissez et louez Dieu, car
il est heure de le louer. J'ay aujourd'huy recouvr
mon heritage et le royaume d'Angleterre, que
j'avoye perdu.' Ainsi se tint le Roy ce jour delez
sa mre." (Froissart, ii 123. Par. 1573.)</p>

<p>In Stow's time this interesting locality had been
degraded into stable for the king's horses, and
let out in divers tenements.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT INSCRIBED DISH.</h3>

<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;The subject of inscribed dishes
of latten, of which so many varieties have recently
been imported, appears to be regarded with
interest by several of your readers. I am indebted
to the Rev. William Drake, of Coventry, for a
rubbing from one of these mysterious inscriptions,
upon an "alms-plate" in his possession. In
the centre is represented the Temptation. There
are two inscribed circles; on the inner and
broader one appear letters, which have been read,&mdash;RAHEWISHNBY.
They are several times
repeated. On the exterior circle is the legend
On the exterior circle is the legend&mdash;ICH.
SART. GELUK. ALZEIT. This likewise
is repeated, so as to fill the entire circle. I
have never before met with these inscriptions in the
large number of dishes of this kind which I have
examined. The have been termed alms-dishes,
and are used still in parochial collections in France,
as doubtless they have been in England. They
were also used in ancient times in the ceremony
of baptism, and they are called baptismal basins,
by some foreign writers. This use is well illustrated
by the very curious early Flemish painting in the
Antwerp Gallery, representing the seven sacraments.
The acolyte, standing near the font,
bears such a dish, and a napkin. The proper use
of these latten dishes was, as I believe, to serve as
a laver, carried round at the close of the banquet
in old times, as now at civic festivities. They
often bear devices of a sacred character; but it is
probable that they were only occasionally used for
any scared purpose, and are more properly to be
regarded as part of the domestic appliances of
former times.</p>

<h3>BARNACLES.</h3>

<p>In Brand's <i>Popular Antiquities</i>, vol. iii. pp. 361,
362., there is an account given of <i>the barnacle</i>, "a
well-known kind of shell-fish, which is found sticking
on the bottoms of ships," and with regard to
which the author observes, that "it seems hardly
credible in this enlightened age, that so gross an
error in natural history should so long have prevailed,"
as that this shell-fish should become changed
into "a species of goose." The author then quotes
Holinshed, Hall, Virgidemiarum, Marston, and
Gerard; but he does not make the slightest reference
to Giraldus Cambrensis, who is his <i>Topographia
Hiberniae</i> first gave the account of the barnacle,
and of that account the writers referred to by
Brand were manifestly but the copyists.</p>

<p>The passage referring to "the barnacle" will be
found in the <i>Topog. Hiber.</i> lib. i. e. xi. I annex a
translation of it, as it may be considered interesting,
when compared with the passages quoted in
Brand:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"There are," says Giraldus, "in this country (Ireland)
a great number of birds called barnacles (Bernacre),
and which nature produces in a manner that is
contrary to the laws of nature. The birds are not
unlike to ducks, but they are somewhat smaller in size.
They make their first appearance as drops of gum upon
the branches of firs that are immersed in running waters;
and then they are next seen hanging like sea-weed from
the wood, becoming encased in shells, which at last
assume in their growth the outward form of birds, and
so hang on by their beaks until they are completely
covered with feathers within their shells, and when they
arrive at maturity, they either drop into the waters,
or take their flight at once into the air. Thus from the
juice of this tree, combined with the water, are they
generated and receive their nutriment until they are
formed and fledged. <i>I have many times with my own
eyes seen several thousand of minute little bodies of these
birds attached to pieces of wood immersed in the sea, encased
in their shells, and already formed.</i> These then are
birds that never lay eggs, and are never hatched from
eggs; and the consequence is, that in some parts of
Ireland, and at those seasons of fasting when meat is
forbidden, bishops and other religious persons feed on
these birds, because they are not fish, nor to be regarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>{118}</span>
as flesh meat. And who can marvel that this should
be so? When our first parent was made of mud, can
we be surprised that a bird should be born of a tree?"
</p></blockquote>

<p>The notion of the <i>barnacle</i> being considered a
fish is, I am aware, one that still prevails on the
western coast of Ireland; for I remember a friend
of mine, who had spent a few weeks in Kerry,
telling me of the astonishment he experienced upon
seeing pious Roman Catholics eating barnacles on
Fridays, and being assured that they were nothing
else than fishes! My friend added that they had
certainly a most "fish-like flavour," and were,
therefore, very nasty birds.</p>

<h3>REV. WM. STEPHENS' SERMONS.</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Amongst the books wanted in your sixth
number is "a Tract or Sermon" of the Rev. Wm.
Stephens. It is a sermon, and one of four, all of
which are far above the ordinary run of sermons,
and deserving of a place in every clergyman's
library. They are rarely met with together, though
separately they turn up now and then upon book
stalls amongst miscellaneous sermons; it is a pity
they are not better known, and much is every day
republished less deserving of preservation. The
author's widow published her husband's sermons
in two volumes; but, strange to say, these, which
are worth all the rest, are not included in the
collection. The titles of the four sermons are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The Personality and Divinity of the Holy Ghost
proved from Scripture, and the Anti-Nicene Fathers."
Preached before the University of Oxford, St. Matthias'
Day, 1716-17. Third Edition, 1725.</p>

<p>"The Catholic Doctrine concerning the Union of
the Two Natures in the One Person of Christ stated
and vindicated." Preached at the visitation of the
Bishop of Oxford, 1719. Second Edition, 1722.</p>

<p>"The Divine Persons One God by an Unity of
Nature: or, That Our Saviour is One God with His
Father, by an External Generation from His Substance,
asserted from Scripture and the Anti-Nicene Fathers."
Preached before the University of Oxford, 1722.
Second Edition, 1723.</p>

<p>"The Several Heterodox Hypotheses, concerning
both the Persons and the Attributes of the Godhead,
justly chargeable with more inconsistencies and Absurdities
than those which have been groundlessly
imputed to the Catholic system." Preached at the
visitation of the Bishop of Exeter, 1724.

<p>I shall be glad to learn from any of your readers
whether the author published any other sermons
or tracts which are not included in the two

<h3>ROGER DE COVERLEY.</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In No. 4 of your "NOTES AND QUERIES"
it is asked, if any notice of the tune called

1695, when it was printed by H. Playford in his

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>

<p><i>Omission of the Words DEI GRATIA from the new
Florin.</i></p>

<p>Ruding, in his <i>Annals of the Coinage</i>, iv. 9., furnishes
a precedent for the omission of the words
DEI GRATIA from the coinage, in the case of the
Irish half-pence and farthings coined at the Tower
in 1736-7. And he supplies, also, a precedent
for the dissatisfaction with which their omission
from the new florin has been received, in the shape
of two epigrams written at that time, for which he is
indebted (as what writer upon any point of English
literature and history is not) to Sylvanus Urban.
The first (from the <i>Gentlemen's Magazine</i> for

<p class="author"><i>Grace's Card, the Six of Hearts.</i></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>As a note to the communications which have
lately amused your readers, respecting the nine of
diamonds, and the curse of Scotland, allow me to
remind you of another card which has a peculiar
name, the origin of which is better ascertained.</p>

<p>At the Revolution of 1688, one of the family
of Grace, of Courtstown in Ireland, raised and
equipped a regiment of foot and a troop of horse,
at his own expense, for the service of King James,
whom he further assisted with money and plate,
amounting, it is said, to 14,000<i>l</i>. He was tempted
with splendid promises of royal favour, to join the
party of King William. A written proposal to
that effect was sent to him by one of the Duke of
Schomberg's emissaries. Indignant at the insulting
proposal, the Baron of Courtstown seized a card,
which was accidentally lying near him, and wrote
upon it this answer: "Go, tell your master, I
despise his offer! Tell him that honour and
conscience are dearer to a gentleman than all the
wealth and titles a prince can bestow!" The card
happened to be the "six of hearts," and to this
day that card is generally known by the name of
"Grace's card," in the city of Kilkenny.</p>

<p>I derive these particulars principally from the
<i>Memoirs of the Family of Grace</i>, by Sheffield
Grace, Esq. 4to. London, 1823, p. 42.</p>

<p><i>Florins.</i></p>

<p>The following extract from the Issue Roll of
Easter I Edward III. 1327, may interest the
inquirers into the antiquity of the FLORIN, lately
introduced into our coinage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"To Robert de Wodehouse, keeper of the King's
Wardrobe, for the price of 174 florins from Florence,
price each florin as purchased, 39-1/2_d_. paid to the same
keeper by the hands of John de Houton, his clerk, for
one pound and one mark of gold, to make oblations
on the day of the coronation for the Lord the King:&mdash;and
in the manner was delivered 104 florins and a
mark of 70_s_. by the king's command, under the privy
seal, which was used before he received the government
of this kingdom,&mdash;28.12.6."</p>

<p><i>John Hopkins, the Psalmist.</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Little is known of the personal history
of John Hopkins, the coadjutor of Sternhold in
the translation of the Psalms. It is generally
agreed that he was a clergyman and a schoolmaster
in Suffolk, but no one has mentioned in
what parish of that county he was beneficed. It
is highly probably that the following notes refer
to this person, and if so, the deficiency will have
been supplied by them.</p>

<p>In Tanner's List of the Rectors of Great Waldingfield
in Suffolk, taken from the Institution
Book at Norwich, there is this entry:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Countess of Pembroke's letter&mdash;Drayton's Poems&mdash;A
Flemish Account&mdash;Bishop Burnet.</i></p>

<p>Your correspondent, at p. 28., asks whether
there is any contemporary copy of the celebrated
letter, said to have been written by Anne, Countess
of Pembroke, to Sir Joseph Williamson? I would
refer him to Mr. Hartley Coleridge's <i>Lives of
Distinguished Northerns</i>, 1833, p. 290. His arguments
for considering the letter <i>spurious</i>, if not conclusive,
are very forcible, but they are too copious for this
paper.</p>

<p>Your readers, who may not be conversant with
that undeservedly neglected volume, will confess
their obligation, when they have consulted its
pages, in having been directed to so valuable and
so original a work. It may be observed, that those
letters of the Countess which are authentic, are
certainly written in a very different style to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>{120}</span>
one in question; but this letter, if addressed by her
to Sir Joseph Williamson, would be written under
peculiar circumstances, and being in her 84th
year, she might naturally have asked the assistance
of the ablest pen within her reach. I have the
copy of an interesting letter, addressed by the late
Mr. John Baynes to Ritson, in 1785, stating his
admiration of the Countess's "spirit and industry,
having seen the collections made by her order
relative to the Cliffords&mdash;such as no other noble
family in the world can show."</p>

<p>I join in wishing that Mr. Pickering would add
a judicious selection from Drayton's poetical
works to his <i>Lives of Aldine Poets</i>. To the list
given by your correspondent (p. 28.), may be
added a work entitled <i>Ideas Mirrour Amours in
quatorzains</i> (London, 1594, 4to. p. 51.), which
was lent to me about forty years ago, but which I
have not seen since. Some notice of it, by myself,
will be found in the <i>Censura Literaria</i>. with the
following note by Sir C. Brydges:&mdash;"The extreme
rarity of this publication renders a farther
account desirable, and also more copious extracts.
It appears wholly unknown to Herbert, and to all
the biographers of Drayton." It is unnoticed by
Ritson also. Chalmers, in his <i>Series of English
Poets</i>, has referred to this communication, but he
has not printed the poem amongst Drayton's
works.</p>

<p>The expression "a Flemish account" is probably
not of very long standing, as it is not found in
the most celebrated of our earlier dramatists, unless,
indeed, Mrs. Page's remark on Falstaff's letter
may be cited as an illustration:&mdash;"What an
unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard
<i>picked out of my conversation</i>, that he dares in this
manner assay me."</p>

<p>If the habit of drinking to excess prevailed in
the Low Countries in the sixteenth century to the
extent represented, may not the expression have
arisen from that circumstance, and been equivalent
to the contempt which is usually entertained for
the loose or imperfect statements made by a tipsy
or drunken man?</p>

<p>When quoting opinions upon Burnet, we must
not forget the brief but pregnant character which
Burke has given of the Bishop's <i>History of his
Own Times</i>. In his admirable speech at Bristol,
previous to the election if 1780, Burke says,
"Look into the History of Bishop Burnet; <i>he is a
witness without exception</i>."</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson was not so laudatory:&mdash;"Burnet
is very entertaining. The style, indeed, is mere
chit-chat. I do not believe that he intentionally
lied; but he was so much prejudiced, that he took
no pains to find out the truth."</p>

<p>The reader may refer to Dr. Hickes's <i>Criticism</i>
(Atterbury's <i>Correspondence</i>, i. 492.). Calamy's
expression is a significant, if not a very complimentary
one, as regards Burnet's candour (<i>Life
and Times</i>, i. 59.).</p>

<p><i>Viz., why the contracted form of Videlicet.</i></p>

<p>I shall be much obliged if any one of your

contraction viz. for videlicet, the letter <i>z</i> not being
at all a component part of the three final syllables
in the full world.</p>

<p class="author">[Cross symbol]</p>

<p class="note">
[Is not our correspondent a little mistaken in supposing
that the last letter in "viz." as originally a
letter z? Was it not one of the arbitrary marks of
contraction used by the scribes of the middle ages, and
being in form something like a "z," came to be represented
by the early printers by that letter? In short,
the sign3 was a common abbreviation in records for
terminations, as omnib3 for omnib<i>us</i>, hab3 for hab<i>et</i>.
Vi3, corruptly viz. is still in use.]

<p><i>Authors of Old Plays.</i></p>

<p>We are enabled by the courtesy of several
correspondents, to answer two of the Queries of
Q.D., in No. 5. p. 77., respecting the authors of
certain old plays.</p>

<p>G.H.B. informs us that <i>Sicily and Naples</i> was
written by Samuel Harding; of whom, as we learn
from J.F.M., an account will be found in Wood's
<i>Athenae</i>.</p>

<p>NASO informs Q.D. that <i>Nero</i> was written by
Matthew Gwinne; there are two editions of it,
viz. 1603 and 1633,&mdash;and that a copy of it may
be procured at 17. Wellington Street, Strand,
for 2<i>s</i>.</p>

<p><i>Birthplace of Coverdale.</i></p>

<p>Can you inform me of the birthplace of Miles
Coverdale?</p>

["Bishop Myles Coverdale is supposed to have been

Coverdale, in the parish of Coverham, near Middleham,
in the North Riding of Yorkshire; and it is the opinion

assumed, and not a family name." These are the words
of the Rev. Geo. Pearson, B.D., the very competent
editor of the works of Bishop Coverdale, published by
the Parker Society. His reference is to Whitaker's

<p>In reply to K.'s query in No. 7., I have to
inform him that "Charles Caraccioli, Gent." called
himself "the Master of the Grammar School at
Arundel," and in 1766 published a very indifferent
<i>History of the Antiquities of Arundel</i>; and
deprecating censure, he says in his preface, "as he (the

years has lived abroad, totally unconversant with
the English tongue, he flatters himself that the

<h3>LOVE, THE KING'S FOOL OF THAT NAME.</h3>

<p>In Rawlinson's Manuscripts in the Bodleian

in, or very soon after, the reign of Henry VIII.,
there is a poem thus entitled:&mdash;</p>

<p>"THE EPITAPHE OF LOVE, THE KYNGE'S FOOLE."</p>

<p>Can any of your readers furnish me with information
regarding him? He was clearly a man worthy
of notice, but although I have looked through as
many volumes of that period, and afterwards, as I
could procure, I do not recollect meeting with
any other mention of him. Skelton, who must
have been his contemporary, is silent regarding
him; and John Heywood, who was also living at
the same time, makes no allusion to him that I have
been able to discover. Heywood wrote the "Play
of Love," but it has nothing to do with the "King's
fool."</p>

<p>The epitaph in question is much in Heywood's
humorous and satirical style: it is written in the
English ballad-metre, and consists of seven seven-line
stanzas, each stanza, as was not unusual with
Heywood, ending with the same, or nearly the
same, line. It commences thus:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"O Love, Love! on thy sowle God have mercye;</p>
<p>For as Peter is <i>princeps Apostolorum</i>,</p>
<p>So to the[e] may be sayd clerlye,</p>
<p>Of all foolys that ever was <i>stultus stultorum</i>.</p>
<p>Sure thy sowle is in <i>regna polorum</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">By reason of reason thou haddest none;</p>
<p class="i2">Yet all foolys be nott dead, though thou be gone."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>In the next stanza we are told, that Love often
made the King and Queen merry with "many good
pastimes;" and in the third, that he was "shaped
and borne of very nature" for a fool. The fourth
stanza, which mentions Erasmus and Luther, is the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Thou wast nother Erasmus nor Luter;</p>
<p>Thou dyds medle no forther than thy potte;</p>
<p>Agaynst hye matters thou wast no disputer,</p>
<p>Amonge the Innocentes electe was thy lotte:</p>
<p>Glad mayst thou be thou haddyst that knotte,</p>
<p class="i2">For many foolys by the[e] thynke them selfe none,</p>
<p class="i2">Yet all be nott dead, though thou be gone."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The next stanza speaks of "Dye Apguylamys,"
who is told to prepare the obsequy for Love, and
of "Lady Apylton," who had offered a "mass-penny,"
and the epitaph ends with these stanzas:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Now, Love, Love! God have mercy on thy mery nowle;</p>
<p>And Love! God have mercye on thy foolysche face,</p>
<p>And Love! God have mercye on thy innocent sowle,</p>
<p>Which amonges innocentes, I am sure, hath a place,</p>
<p>Or ellys thy sowle ys yn a hevy case;</p>
<p class="i2">Ye, ye, and moo foolys many [a] one,</p>
<p class="i2">For foolys be alyve, Love, though thou be gone.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Now, God have mercye on us all,</p>
<p>For wyse and folysche all dyethe,</p>
<p>Lett us truly to our myndes call;</p>
<p>And to say we be wyse owr dedes denyethe,</p>
<p>Wherefore the ende my reason thys aplyethe:</p>
<p class="i2">God amend all foolys that thynke them selfe none,</p>
<p class="i2">For many be alyve, thoughe Love be gone."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>It is very possible that I have overlooked some
common source of information to which I may be
referred; and it is very possible also, that this
epitaph has been reprinted in comparatively modern
times, and I may not know of it. This is one of
the points I wish to ascertain.</p>

<h3>THE ADVENT BELLS.</h3>

<p>The Advent bells are ringing in many parishes
throughout various parts of England during this
month of December, if I may judge from my own
neighbourhood&mdash;on the western borders of Berks&mdash;where,
at least three times in the week, I hear
their merry peals break gladsomely upon the dark
stillness of these cold evenings, from many a
steeple around. In the Roman States and the
kingdom of Naples and Sicily, the "pifferari" go
about playing on a kind of rough hautboy and
bag-pipes, before the pictures of the Madonna,
hung up at the corners of streets and in shops, all
through Advent time; but why are the church
bells rung in England? What reference in ancient
documents can be pointed out for the meaning or
antiquity of the usage?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>{122}</span>

<p>He who draws upon a joint-stock bank of literature
as rich as yours, Mr. Editor, already is, should
bring a something to its capital, though it be a
mite. Allow me, then, to throw in mine. At
p. 77. "A SUBSCRIBER" asks, "if William de Bolton
was an ecclesiastic, how is it that his wife is openly
mentioned?" For one of these two reasons: 1st.
By the canon law, whether he be in any of the four
minor orders, or in any of the three higher or holy
orders, a man is, and was always, called "Clericus,"
but clerks in lower or minor orders did, and
still do, marry without censure; 2d. The Church
did, and still does, allow man and wife to separate
by free mutual consent, and to bind themselves by
the vows of perpetual continence and chastity, the
man going into a monastery, or taking holy orders,
the woman becoming a nun. Such, I suspect, was
the case with Sir William de Bolton ("Sir" being
the ancient title of a priest) and his wife, whose
joint concurrence in the transfer of property by
charter would be legally required, if, as is likely,
she had an interest in it.</p>

<p>Your correspondent "MUSAFIR," while on the
subject of the <i>Flemish account</i>, p. 74., is in error, in
assigning to a Count of Flanders the "old story"
of the cloaks; it belongs to Robert, Duke of Normandy,
who played off the joke at Constantinople
in the court of the Greek emperor, as Bromton
tells us (ed. Twysden, i. 911.)</p>

<h3>MR. POORE'S LITERARY COLLECTIONS&mdash;INIGO JONES&mdash;MEDAL OF STUKELEY&mdash;SIR JAMES THORNHILL.</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;With thanks for the insertion of my
former letter, I proceed to submit a few literary
queries for solution through the medium of your
pages.</p>

<p>In connection with the country of Wilts, I will
first mention the literary collections of the late
Edward Poore, Esq., of North Tidworth, which I
examined, with much satisfaction, on my visits to
him there, in the year 1798 and 1799. Mr. Poore
was a man of considerable attainments, and corresponded
with many distinguished characters,
both at home and abroad. He travelled over
many parts of the continent, and his letters and
notes relating to public and private occurrences and
persons were remarkably curious and interesting.
I have long lost all trace of them, and should be
glad to ascertain where they are likely to be
found.</p>

<p>An immense boon would be conferred on the
cause of Architecture and Archology by the recovery
of Inigo Jones's Sketches and Drawings of
Ancient Castles. These, together with his Plans,
Views, and Restorations of <i>Stonehenge</i>, probably
descended to his nephew, Webb. The latter were
engraved, and published in Webb's volume on
Stonehenge; but the Sketches of Castles have
never yet been published. On the ground of
Inigo Jones's intimacy with Lord Pembroke, I
was referred to the library at Wilton as a probable
despositor of his drawings, but without success;
as I am informed, they do not form a part of that
valuable collection. Perhaps I may be allowed to
correct the error which so commonly ascribes the
erection of Wilton House to Jones. In the <i>Natural
History of Wiltshire</i>, by John Aubrey, which
I edited in 1847 (4to.), it is clearly shown that
the mansion was built in 1633 by, or from the
designs of, Solomon de Caus, architect, who was
probably aided by his brother Isaac, and that it
was rebuilt in 1648, after an extensive fire, by
Webb, who, as is well known, married a niece of
Inigo Jones. The latter celebrated architect recommended
the employment of these parties, and
probably approved of their designs, but had no
further share in their production. His advice,
however, to the Earl of Pembroke, was the means
of preserving the famous <i>Porch at Wilton</i>, ascribed
to Hans Holbein, which gives him a peculiar
claim to the gratitude of all architectural antiquaries.</p>

<p>I possess a large collection of the manuscript
journals, papers, drawings, and correspondence of
Dr. Stukeley. To the kindness of my old friend
Dr. Ingram, President of Trinity College, Oxford,
I also owe a large Bronze Medal, with a medallion
portrait of Stukeley on the obverse, and a view of
Stonehenge on the reverse. This is evidently a
cast from moulds, and rather crudely executed,
and I am induced to regard it as unique. I shall
be much gratified if any of your correspondents
can furnish me with a clue to its history, or to the
name of its maker. I would here venture to
suggest some inquiry into the biography of
<i>Charles Bertram</i>, of Copenhagen, who furnished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>{123}</span>
Dr. Stukeley with the manuscript of the <i>Itinerary
of Richard of Cirencester</i>, which has led to so
much curious discussion. It would be interesting
to learn whether Bertram's papers were bequeathed
to any public library at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Sir James Thornhill was in the habit of making
sketches and descriptive memoranda in his various
travels and excursions. Some years ago one of
his pocket-books was lent to me, in which he had
not only written notices of the places visited, but
made very clever pen sketches of several objects.
Whilst in my possession, I copied many pages,
and also traced some of the drawings. Among
the latter is a Market Cross at Ipswich, long since
destroyed, also the Sessions House and the Custom
House of Harwich, with various antiquities, &amp;c.,
at Ryswich, Delph, Tournay, Brussels, and the
Hague. I have often regretted that I did not
copy the whole volume, as it contained many
curious facts and anecdotes. I have tried in vain
to ascertain the name and address of the possessor.
He was a country gentleman, and lodged in
Southampton Row, Russell Square. The volume
is dated 1711, and contains full accounts of buildings
and works of art. He says, "Killigrew told
King Charles that Ipswich had a large river without
water, streets without names, and a town
without people."</p>

<p>In July, 1817, I published a small volume entitled
<i>Antiquarian and Architectural Memoranda
relating to Norwich Cathedral</i>, in which were two
copper-plates, a ground-plan of the church, and a
view of the west front; with woodcuts of the font,
and of the Erpingham gateway, both engraved
by John Thompson. The plates and cuts were
sold by auction (by Mr. Southgate of Fleet Street),
with the stock of the work, and have been resold
by the purchaser. I have sought in vain to re-obtain
the woodcuts, and shall be gratified to find
that it is still practicable.</p>

<p>After many years' search for the documents, &amp;c.,
referred to in this and my preceding letter, I am
still reluctant to abandon their pursuit. That
valuable collections are sometimes protected from
destruction, in obscurity, for years, is shown by
the loss and recovery of the well-known collection
of Architectural Designs and Drawings by John
Thorpe, now in the Soane Museum. That singular
and interesting series was in the possession
of the Earl of Warwick, in the latter part of the
last century. In 1807 I applied to his lordship
for permission to examine it; but he informed me
that Richard Cumberland, the author, had borrowed
it many years before, in order to submit it
to Lord George Germaine, and that it had not
since been heard of. Thus, from before 1785,
when Lord George Germaine died, the drawings
were lost until about thirty years afterwards, when
I purchased them for Sir John Soane, at the sale
of the library of &mdash;&mdash; Brooke, Esq., of Paddington
(probably a relative of the Earl of Warwick), into
whose possession they had unaccountably passed.</p>

<h3>THE MIDDLE TEMPLE.</h3>

<p>In Mr. Frederick Devon's <i>Pell Records</i>, vol. iii.
p. 34., there is an entry in the Issue Roll of Easter,
41 Henry III. 1257, of a payment.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"To the Brethren of the <i>Middle</i> Temple, 4. in
part of 8. appointed alms for the support of three
chaplains to celebrate divine service, at Easter Term,
in the 41st year, by writ patent."
</p></blockquote>

<p>And in p. 88. is the following writ for payment
at Easter Term, 4 Edward I. 1276:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Pay out of our Treasury, from the day of the death
of the Lord King Henry, our Father, of renowned
memory, for each year, to our beloved Master and
Brethren of the Knights Templars in England, 8.
<i>which our father granted</i> to them by his charter to be
received yearly at our Exchequer, for the support of
three chaplains, daily for ever, to perform divine
service in the New Temple, London, one of whom is
to perform service for our aforesaid father, the other
for all Christian people, and the third for the faithful
deceased, as was accustomed to be done in the time of
our aforesaid father. Witness, &amp;c."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I presume that there can be no doubt that the
grant referred to in the last extract is that which
is mentioned in the first. But if so, what is meant
by "Brethren of the <i>Middle Temple?</i>"</p>

<p>Both entries are before the suppression of the
order, and it was not till long after the suppression
that the Temple was occupied by the lawyers as a
place of study; nor till long after the establishment
of lawyers there, that is to say, more than a hundred
years after the date of the first extract, that
the Temple was divided into two houses, called, as
now, the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple.
Added to which, the church of the Temple is in
that division which is called the <i>Inner</i> Temple.</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents favour me with
the precise words of the original record, or explain
the meaning of the term used?</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

<p><i>Henry Lord Darnley.</i></p>

<p>Can any of your readers inform me where the celebrated
Darnley, second husband of Mary, Queen
of Scots, was born? His birth took place in
England, where his father, Matthew Stuart, Earl
of Lennox, was residing, being banished from
Scotland. Henry VIII. gave the Earl his niece
in marriage, and several estates in Yorkshire;
among others, the lands of Jervaux Abbey, and
the adjacent manor of West Scrafton. Middleham
Castle, which was then perfect, and belonged to the
King, lies between these, and was probably at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>{124}</span>
an occasional residence of the Earl, though we have
no correct account of its occupants after the death
of Richard III.</p>

<p><i>Coffee, the Lacedaemonion Black Broth.</i></p>

<p>Your "notes on Coffee" in No. 2. reminded me
that I had read in some modern author a happy
conjecture that "coffee" was the principal
ingredient of the celebrated "Lacedaemonian black
broth," but as I did not "make a note of it" at
the time, and cannot recollect the writer from
whom I derived this very probable idea, I may
perhaps be allowed to "make a query" of his
name and work.</p>

<p><i>Letters of Mrs. Chiffinch.</i></p>

<p>The Chafins, of Chettle, in Dorsetshire, possessed
at one time some interesting family memorials.
In the third volume of Hutchins's <i>Dorset</i>,
pp. 166, 167., are printed two or three letters of
Thomas Chafin on the battle of Sedgemoor. In
a manuscript note, Hutchins alludes to letters,
written by a female member of the family, which
contain some notices of the court of Charles II.
Can your Dorsetshire correspondents inform me
whether these letters exist? I suspect that the
lady was wife of the notorious Chiffinch; and she
must have seen and heard strange things. The
letters may be worthless, and it is possible that
the family might object to a disclosure of their
contents. The manuscript memorandum is in
Gough's copy of the <i>History of Dorset</i> in the
Bodleian Library.</p>

<p><i>Sangred&mdash;Dowts of Holy Scripture.</i></p>

<p>In the will of John Hedge, of Bury St. Edmund's,
made in 1504, is this item:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I beqweth to the curat of the seid church iiij<i>s</i>.
iiij<i>d</i>. for a <i>sangred</i> to be prayed for in the bedroule for
my soule and all my good ffrends soulls by the space
of a yeer complete."
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same year Thomas Pakenham, of Ixworth
Thorpe, bequeathed 6 hives of bees to the sepulchre
light, "to pray for me and my wyffe in y'e <i>comon
sangered</i>;" and in 1533, Robert Garad, of Ixworth,
bequeathed to the high altar ij<i>s</i>. "for <i>halfe a sangred</i>."</p>

<p>Can any of your reader explain what the <i>sangred</i>
is? or give me any information about the
book referred to in the following extract from the
will of William Place, Master of St. John's Hospital,
Bury St. Edmund's, made in 1504:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Item. I beqweth to the monastery of Seynt Edmund

<p><i>Catsup, Catchup, or Ketchup.</i></p>

<p>Will any of your philological readers be so
obliging as to communicate any <i>note</i> he may have
touching the original or definition of the word
<i>Catchup?</i></p>

<p>It does not appear in Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>.
Mr. Todd, in his edition, inserts it with an asterisk,
denoting it as a new introduction, and under
<i>Catsup</i> says, see <i>Catchup</i>. Under this latter word
he says&mdash;"Sometimes <i>improperly</i> written <i>Ketchup</i>,
a poignant liquor made from boiled mushrooms,
mixed with salt, used in cooking to add a pleasant
flavour to sauces." He gives no <i>derivation</i> of the
word <i>itself</i>, and yet pronounces the very common
way of spelling it improper.</p>

<p>What reference to, or connexion with, <i>mushrooms</i>
has the word?&mdash;and why <i>Catsup</i>, with the inference
that it is synonymous with <i>Catchup</i>?</p>

<p class="author">G.</p>

<p>"<i>Let me make a Nation's Ballads, who will may
make their Laws!</i>"</p>

<p>One perpetually hears this exclamation attributed
to different people. In a magazine which I
took up this morning, I find it set down to "a
certain orator of the last century;" a friend who
is now with me, tells me that it was unquestionably
the saying of the celebrated Lord Wharton; and
I once heard poor Edward Irving, in a sermon,
quote it as the exclamation of Wallace, or some
other Scottish patriot. Do relieve my uncertainty,
and, for the benefit of our rising orator, tell us to
whom the saying ought to be set down.</p>

<p><i>To endeavour Oneself.</i></p>

<p>In the Collect for the 2nd Sunday after Easter,
in the preface to the Confirmation Service, and in
the form of Ordering of priest, the verb "endeavour"
takes (clearly, I think) a middle-voice
form, "to endeavour one's self." Is there any
other authority for this usage? No dictionary I
have seen recognises it.</p>

<p>It is well known in the neighbourhood, that the

pasture since the days of the wars of York and
Lancaster, produces two species of roses, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>{125}</span>
grow in stunted patches throughout its extent.
Has their presence ever been noticed or accounted
for? If we again allow tradition to give its evidence,
we are told they were planted on the graves
of the fallen combatants.</p>

<p><i>Papers of John Wilkes.</i></p>

<p>John Wilkes, it is well known, sent to the newspapers
copies of Lord Weymouth's and Lord

George's Fields in 1768. We Can easily conjecture
how he did or how he might have, got possession
of a copy of Weymouth's Letter, which
was addressed to the magistrates of Surrey; but
Barrington's letter was strictly official, and directed
to the "Field officers, in staff waiting, for
the three regiments of Foot Guards." Has the
circumstance ever been explained? If so, where?
Can any of your readers inform me the <i>exact date</i>
of the first publication of Barrington's Letter in the
newspaper? Is it not time that Wilkes' Letters
and MSS. were deposited in some of our public
libraries? They would throw light on many obscure
points of history. They were left by Miss
Wilkes to Mr. Elmsley, "to whose judgement and
delicacy" she confided them. They were subsequently,
I believe, in the legal possession of his
son, the Principal of St. Alban's; but really of
Mr. Hallam.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, CATALOGUES, SALES, ETC.</h3>

<p>Mr. Darling is preparing for publication a new
edition of his <i>Bibliotheca Clericales, a guide to
Authors, Preachers, Students, and Literary Men</i>.
The object of this very useful publication, which
deserves to be made a Note of by all who may have
Queries to solve in connection with the bibliography
of theology, cannot be better described
than in Mr. Darling's own words, namely, that
it is intended to be "a Catalogue of the Books in
the Clerical Library, greatly enlarged, so as to
contain every author of any note, ancient and
modern, in theology, ecclesiastical history, and
the various departments connected therewith,
including a selection in most branches of literature,
with complete lists of the works of each
author, the contents of every volume being
minutely described; to which will be added an
entirely new volume, with a scientific as well as
alphabetical arrangement of subjects, by which a
ready reference may be made to books, treatises,
sermons, and dissertations, on nearly all heads of
divinity, the books, chapters, and verses of Holy
Scripture, the various festivals, fasts &amp;c., observed
throughout the year, and useful topics in literature,
philosophy, and history, on a more complete system
than has yet been attempted in any language, and
forming an universal index to the contents of all
similar libraries, both public and private." The
work will be published in about 24 monthly parts,
and will be put to press so soon as a sufficient
number of subscribers are obtained to cover the
expense of printing.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, the modeller, of 125. Drury Lane, who
as our readers may remember, produced some time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>{126}</span>
since so interesting "a copy in little" of the monument
of our great bard in the church of Stratford-upon-Avon,
has just completed similar models of
Bacon's monument, in St. Michael's Church, St.
Alban's; of Sir Isaac Newton's, in the chapel of
Trinity College, Cambridge; and, lastly, of that
of the "Venerable Stow," from the church of St.
Andrew Undershaft. Many of the admirers of
those old English worthies will, we doubt not, be
glad to possess such interesting memorials of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe has published a <i>Catalog of some
Interesting, Rare, and Choice Books</i>, which he has
recently purchased, and which had been collected
by the celebrated antiquary and author, Browne
Willis. Many of them contain important manuscript
notes and anecdotes by him, particularly in
his own publications; and the Catalogue, therefore,
like all which Mr. Thorpe issues, contains numerous
notes highly interesting to bibliographical
and literary antiquaries. Thus, in a copy of
<i>Antonini Iter Britanniarum</i>, he tells us Browne
Willis has inserted the following biographical
note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
*.* "My very worthy friend Roger Gale, the
Author of this and many other learned works, dyed at
his seat at Scruton, co. York, June 26, 1744, aged about
72, and was by his own direction buried obscurely in
the churchyard there."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The following interesting articles we reprint
entire, as forming specimens of the rarities which
Mr. Thorpe offers in the present Catalogue,
and the tempting manner in which he presents
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>3450 BOECEUS DE CONSOLACIONE PHILOSOPHIE, TRANSLATED
OUT OF LATIN INTO ENGLISH BY MAISTER
GEFFREY CHAUCER, WITH EPITAPH FOR CHAUCER
IN LATIN VERSE BY STEPHEN SURIGO, POET
LAUREATE OF MILAN, AT THE COST AND INSTANCE
OF W. CAXTON, A MOST BEAUTIFUL AND
QUITE PERFECT COPY, WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST
DEFECT OR REPAIR, folio, <i>in old Oxford calf
binding, from Browne Willis's Library, 105</i>.</p>

<p>PRINTED BY CAXTON, WITH HIS NAME.</p>

<p>*.* One of the most interesting specimens of Caxton's
press. No other perfect copy, I believe, has occurred
for sale. The Aleborne copy, (imperfect, wanting the
Epitaph upon Chaucer, WHICH IS REPRINTED IN SOME
EDITIONS OF HIS WORKS, and other leaves,) sold for
53l. 11s. It is one of the earliest productions of the
father of the English press, and claims a very great
additional interest from being translated by the Poet
Chaucer. CAXTON gives us the following reasons that
induced Chaucer to translate, and himself to print
it:&mdash;"Forasmoche as the stile of it is harde, and difficile
to be understoode of simple persones, therefore the
worshipful Fader and first founder and embelisher of
ornate eloquence in our <i>English</i>, I mene Maister
<i>Geffrey Chaucer</i>, hath translated it out of <i>Latyn</i>, as
neygh as is possible to be understande; wherin, in
myne oppynon, he hath deserved a perpetual lawde
and thanke of al this noble Royame of <i>England</i>.
Thenne, forasmoche as this sayd boke so translated is
rare, and not spred ne knowen as it is digne and worthy
for the erudicion of such as ben ignoraunte, atte requeste
of a singuler frend and gossop of myne, <i>I, William
Caxton</i>, have done my devoir temprynte it in fourme
as is hereafore made."</p>

<p>3653 FOX (EDWARD) BISHOP OF HEREFORD, True
Dyfferens Between ye Regall Power and the
Ecclesiasticall Power, translated out of Latyn
by Henry Lord Stafforde, <i>and dedicated by him
to the Protector Somerset</i>, black letter, 8vo.
<i>fine copy, morocco, gilt edges</i>, EXTREMELY RARE,
6l. 6s.</p>

<p><i>Imprinted at the sign of the Rose Garland, by
W. Copland, n.d.</i></p>

<p>*.* This extraordinarily rare volume was written by
Edward Fox, Bishop of Hereford, according to Strype
and Leland&mdash;<i>see the latter's encomium upon it</i>. Lord
Herbert supposed it to have been written by King
Henry VIII. It is one of the most interesting and
rare volumes relative to church history. The noble
translator states that it was lent him by his friend
Master Morison, and finding the difference between
the power regal and ecclesiastical so plainly set out,
and so purely explained, that rather than his countrie
should be utterly frustrated of so great fruyte as myght
growe by redynge thereof, I thought it well-bestowed
labour to turn it into Englishe.</p>

<p>3318 LANE (JOHN) TOM TEL-TROTH'S MESSAGE AND
HIS PEN'S COMPLAINT, a worke not unpleasant
to be read, nor unprofitable to be followed, IN
VERSE, <i>dedicated to George Dowse</i>, 4to. <i>remarkably
fine copy</i>, UNCUT, <i>morocco elegant, gilt edges</i>,
EXCESSIVELY RARE IF NOT UNIQUE, 10l. 10s.</p>

<p><i>Imprinted for R. Howell, 1600</i>.</p>

<p>*.* This curious poem, consisting of 120 verses of
six lines each, is of such EXTRAORDINARY RARITY, AS
TO HAVE ESCAPED THE RESEARCHES OF ALL BIBLIOGRAPHERS.
The author is styled by Phillips, in his
Theatrum Poetarum, as that "fine old Queen Elizabeth's
gentleman," and is ranked in the class of poets
next to Spenser. The present volume acquires an
additional interest from being the <i>first production of
the Author</i>, which is thus expressed in the dedication:
"These first fruites of my barren braine, the token of
my love, the seale of my affection, and the true cognizance
of my unfained affection," &amp;c.</p>

<p>We have also received Supplements A, B, C,
and D, the last part issued, of the Catalogue of
Miscellaneous Books, in various languages, on sale
by Charles Dolman, of 61. New Bond Street,
which contain many rare and curious works,
more especially in the department of Foreign
Divinity.</p>

<p>To these we may add Parts V. and VI. of Catalogues
of "Cheap Books, Autographs, &amp;c.," on
sale by Bell, 10. Bedford Street, Covent Garden;
the "Cheap Catalogue," Part XXIV., of Thomas
Cole, 15. Great Turnstile, Holborn; a "Miscellaneous
Catalogue of remarkably cheap Old Books,"
on sale by C. Hamilton, 4. Bridge Place, City
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>{127}</span>
Road; Russell Smith's Catalogue of "Choice,
Useful, and Curious Books," Part VII., which he
describes, very justly, as "containing some very
cheap books;" Parts CV. and CVI. of Petheram's,
94. High Holborn, "Catalogue of Old and New
Books," containing, among other things, Collections
of the works of the various publishing Societies,
such as the Camden, Calvin, Parker,
Shakspeare, Ray, &amp;c., and also of the Record
publications; and lastly, which we have just received
from the worth bibliopole of Auld Reekie,
T.G. Stevenson, his curious "List of Unique,
Valuable, and Interesting Works, chiefly illustrative
of Scottish History and Antiquities, printed at
private expense," and "Bannatyniana,&mdash;Catalogue
of the privately printed publications of the Bannatyne
Club from MDCCCXXIII. to MDCCCXLVIII.,"
both of which are well deserving the attention of
our bibliographical friends.</p>

a Portrait; handsomely printed in 4to.; half-bound in morocco,

<p>This interesting MS., so frequently alluded to by Dr. Burney
in the course of his "History of Music," has been kindly placed
at the disposal of the Council of the Musical Antiquarian Society,
by George Townshend Smith, Esq., Organist of Hereford Cathedral.
But the Council, not feeling authorised to commence a
series of literary publications, yet impressed with the value of the
work, have suggested its independent publication to their
Secretary, Dr. Rimbault, under whose editorial care it accordingly
appears.</p>

<p>It abounds with interesting Musical Anecdotes; the Greek
Fables respecting the origin of Music; the rise and progress of
Musical Instruments; the early Musical Drama; the origin of our
present fashionable Concerts; the first performance of the Beggar's
Opera, &amp;c.</p>

Plates and Letter-press, price 7s. 6d. (folio, 12s., India paper,

<p>MONUMENTAL BRASSES and SLABS:
an Historical and Descriptive Notice of the Incised Monumental
Memorials of the Middle Ages. With upwards of 200 Engravings.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"A handsome large octavo volume, abundantly supplied with
well-engraved woodcuts and lithographic plates; a sort of
Encyclopaedia for ready reference.... The whole work has a look of
painstaking completeness highly commendable."&mdash;<i>Athenaeum.</i></p>

<p>"One of the most beautifully got up and interesting volumes we
have seen for a long time. It gives in the compass of one volume
an account of the History of those beautiful monuments of former
days.... The illustrations are extremely well chosen."&mdash;<i>English
Churchman.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>A few copies only of this work remain for sale; and, as it will
not be reprinted in the same form and at the same price, the
remaining copies are raised in price. Early application for the Large
Paper Edition is necessary.</p>

<p>By the same Author, to be completed in Four Parts,</p>

<p>CHRISTIAN MONUMENTS in ENGLAND

of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, Author of "The History of
the Ancient Britons," &amp;c.</p>

are known respecting the Life of Alfred, exhibiting the various
opinions on disputed points, and containing a very fair, sensible
summing up by the biographer."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i>

<p>HISTORY of the ANCIENT BRITONS,
From the Earliest Period to the Invasion of the Saxons. Compiled
from the Original Authorities. By the Rev. J. A. GILES,
D.C.L, late Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The longer and more important passages are full and clear in
matter, always well presented, often in a masterly mode.... Dr.
Giles is in thorough possession of his materials and of his
intention, which produces the clearness that arises from mastery;
and he exhibits the same general <i>bon hommie</i> and chronicler
disposition for minute and picturesque narrative which we noted in
his 'Life of Becket,' with more of a critical spirit."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i>

<p>THE BALLAD of EDWIN and EMMA.
By DAVID MALLET. A New Edition, with Notes and Illustrations,
by FREDERICK T. DINSDALE, Esq., LL.D., F.S.A.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"This volume is a curious instance of the effect of early
association ... Early knowledge of the genius loci has left an
impression on the editor's mind which has produced this very completely
illustrated edition. All that research can furnish touching the
families of Wrightson and Railton, the surnames of Edwin and
Emma, is collected."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"The editor's great merit is that of exhausting every probable
source of information, and equal industry spent in illustration of a
more important subject, would have led to equally curious and
more important results."&mdash;<i>Athenaeum.</i>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
