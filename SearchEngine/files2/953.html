    <h1>PUNCH,<br />
     OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

    <h2>Vol. 153.</h2>

    <h2>July 18, 1917.</h2>

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"

    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>It is reported that the Emperor of CHINA has joined the Boy
    Scoot movement.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Some explanation of the KAISER'S anxiety for peace and the
    GERMAN CHANCELLOR'S statement in the Reichstag has just come to
    hand. It appears from <i>The Boston Christian Science
    Monitor</i> that Mr. CHARLIE CHAPLIN is about to join the Army
    on the side of the Allies.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A baker has been fined ten shillings for selling War bread
    which was overweight, thereby unnecessarily endangering the
    lives of his customers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Cigars in Germany are now being made of cabbage or hay
    flavoured with strawberry leaves. Another march is thus stolen
    on British manufacturers, most of whom still cling obstinately
    to the superstition that a slight flavour of tobacco is
    necessary.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"How pathetic it is to see six small farmers sending six
    small carts with six small consignments along the same road to
    the same station twice a day," said Lord SELBORNE at the
    Agricultural Organisation Society. Almost as pathetic as seeing
    six fat middlemen making six fat profits before the stuff
    reaches the consumer.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We fear that some of our Metropolitan magistrates are losing
    their dash. At a police court last week a man who pretended to
    foretell the future was fined two pounds, and the magistrate
    forgot to ask the prisoner to prophesy how much he was going to
    be fined.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Adequate arrangements are being made, says Sir CECIL H.
    SMITH, to protect the National Gallery from air-raids. The
    intention, it is thought, is to disguise it as a moving picture
    palace.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A great impetus has been given to the teaching of singing
    since it has been pointed out that at the Guildhall School of
    Music a woman went on singing until the enemy aeroplanes were
    driven away from London.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Certain meatstuffs unfit for human consumption may now be
    used in the manufacture of dog biscuits. The news has been
    received with much satisfaction by several dogs, who have now
    promised to cut out postmen from their menu.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>When the Middlesex Sessions were about to commence, a bell
    warning people of the air raid was sounded, and the Justices
    immediately advised people to take shelter. No notice was taken
    of the suggestion made by several prisoners who expressed the
    view that the safest place was the street.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In view of the fact that the animals at the Zoological
    Gardens are on war rations, the R.S.P.C.A. especially request
    very stout people not to cause annoyance to the tigers by
    parading up and down in front of their cages.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>During the last air raid the windows of one house were blown
    outwards, the plaster and ceiling fell, and doors were thrown
    off their hinges, and yet the occupant&mdash;a
    woman&mdash;experienced surprise on hearing that the house had
    been struck by a bomb. She was under the impression that a new
    bus route had been opened.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Candidates for the diplomatic service," says Lord ROBERT
    CECIL, "will after the War be largely drawn from persons of
    talent." It is not known who first thought of this, but it just
    shows what a pull politicians have over ordinary people when it
    comes to thinking out things.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At the St. Pancras Tribunal last week an applicant said his
    only remaining partner had been ill in bed for some weeks, and
    the Chairman of the Tribunal promptly remarked, "Obviously a
    sleeping partner." This joke has been duly noted by a
    well-known revue manager, and as soon as a cast has been
    engaged an entirely new and topical review will be written
    round it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The policy of air reprisals advocated by a section of the
    Press has found much support. Indeed one prominent pacifist has
    even threatened to put out his tongue at the next covey of
    enemy aeroplanes which visits this country.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The raspberry crop in Scotland is to be taken over by Lord
    RHONDDA. The rumour that it is to be used for Army jam has had
    a most demoralising effect upon the market in imported
    tomatoes.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mysteriously, in the night, a pile of shells representing
    thirteen thousand eggs was deposited on a common outside
    Munich. This evidence of at least one citizen's return to the
    pre-war breakfast has given rise in some quarters to hopes of
    an early peace.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It must have been something more than carelessness that
    caused an evening contemporary to announce in a recent edition:
    "Since the commencement of the War three solicitors have become
    brigandiers."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is reported that two Leicestershire farm labourers have
    brought up twenty-nine children between them. It is hoped that
    the news will not cause any allotment enthusiasts to abandon
    their holdings.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Another hotel has been commandeered by the National Service
    Department. The task of preparing lists of men and women who
    would be willing to perform National Service if they were not
    already engaged in it is assuming colossal proportions.</p>

    weight:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>(<i>The Ophir Gold Pantomime Syndicate issues its
        Preliminary Instructions for the Production of its Annual
        Pantomime.</i>)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS.</h4>

    <h4>O.G.P.S. 42/B/26.</h4>

    <p><i>November 20th</i>, 1919.</p>

    <p>1. <i>General Outline</i>.</p>

    <p>It is the intention of the Ophir Gold Pantomime Syndicate to
    attack and capture the Public Favour on the night of the 26/27
    December, 1919.</p>

    <p>As foreshadowed in the preliminary Press Notices (which will
    be issued later) the production will outstrip all previous
    productions both in wit and splendour.</p>

    <p>The Preliminary Bombardment will be carried out by Press
    Agents of all calibres.</p>

    <p>The General Scheme will be as laid down in the West-End
    Managers' Standard Formation of Pantomimes.</p>

    <p>Zero time will probably be at 7 P.M.</p>

    <p>If the operation is successful it will be repeated daily
    until further (fortnight's) notice, and every endeavour will be
    made to exploit the success to the full.</p>

    <p>2. <i>Advertisements</i>.</p>

    <p>No opportunity for advertisement will be neglected.</p>

    <p>Advance Agents will reconnoitre the ground thoroughly and
    secure the best hoardings available.</p>

    <p>The Leading Lady will lose her jewels not later than 4 P.M.
    on December 22nd. "Q." will arrange for the necessary
    publicity.</p>

    <p>3. <i>Chorus</i>.</p>

    <p>Will consist of One Section Blondes and Brunettes, One
    Section Petites and One Section "Stunners" (<i>see</i> Standard
    Formation, para. 3a). Category "B" will be at the back.
    Category "B" of last year's Chorus will be transferred to the
    Pantomime Employment Company.</p>

    <p>4. <i>Scenery</i>.</p>

    <p>The S.E. (Scenic Engineers) will co-operate by improvising
    new scenery out of last year's production as far as
    possible.</p>

    <p>5. <i>Discipline.</i></p>

    <p>The stage-manager will be responsible for the strictest
    discipline being maintained during performances, and will put
    up a barrage of invective at the slightest signs of
    slackness.</p>

    <p>6. <i>Intelligence</i>.</p>

    <p>Ground observers will be sent out to note the effect of the
    comedians' gags upon the audience. They will report any
    impropriety at once to the Manager, who will at once take steps
    to improve upon it.</p>

    <p>7. <i>Police</i>.</p>

    <p>Special Mounted Police will assist the doorkeeper to collect
    all stragglers at the Stage Door and will cause them to be
    returned to their paternal units (if their credentials are not
    satisfactory).</p>

    <p>8. <i>Dressing-rooms</i>.</p>

    <p>Disputes over dressing-rooms will be arranged between the
    artistes concerned.</p>

    <p>9. <i>Artistes.</i></p>

    <p>The Fairy Queen will be specially employed to create a
    diversion while the Palace Scene is being set behind.</p>

    <p>The Demon King will put a few heavies across in the Grotto
    Scene.</p>

    <p>The Eight Aerial Girlies (under the direction of the O.C.
    Flying Corps de Ballet) will make a personal reconnaissance of
    the front rows of the Stalls in "The Fairies' Bower" Scene.</p>

    <p>The eyes of the Chorus will be worn in the "alert" position
    during performances.</p>

    <p>10. <i>Principals</i>.</p>

    <p>Artistes will submit for approval not later than the 10th
    December the details of their songs and dances. Comedians will
    also submit their "gags" and comic scenes for blue-pencilling.
    This is merely a matter of form and the strictest secrecy as to
    their real intentions will be preserved in order that the
    principle of "springing it on one another" should be
    maintained.</p>

    <p>If twenty people are found in the bar during a comedian's
    turn he is liable to summary dismissal.</p>

    <p>Cross-talk Machine Fun Fire will be under direction of O.C.
    Gags.</p>

    <p>11. <i>Music</i>.</p>

    <p>Choruses and incidentals will be original. That is to say,
    they will be taken from last year's MSS. and the crotchets
    moved up one space and the quavers down one space.</p>

    <p>12. <i>Rehearsals</i>.</p>

    <p>A hot meal will be served after midnight rehearsals and
    taxis will be provided for those who care to pay for them. "Q"
    will arrange.</p>

    <p>13. <i>The Audience</i>.</p>

    <p>Hostile retaliation is not anticipated, but arrangements
    will be made to deal summarily with any counterattack. O.C.
    Chuckers-Out will arrange.</p>

    <p>14. <i>Organisation</i>.</p>

    <p>The goodwill and earnest co-operation of all are solicited
    to achieve the success which will be advantageous to all,
    especially to the philanthropic Directors, who are poor men and
    cannot really afford it.</p>

    <p><i>Issued at 4 p.m.</i></p>

    <h2>PHILIP.</h2>

    <p>Philip is the morose but rather dressy foreigner who resides
    in a cage on the verandah. Miss Ropes, who owns him and ought
    to know, says he is a Grey Cardinal, but neither his voracious
    appetite for caterpillars nor his gruesome manner of
    assimilating them are in the least dignified or ecclesiastical.
    It takes the unremitting efforts of Miss Ropes and the entire
    available strength of convalescent officers (after deducting
    the players of bridge, the stalkers of rabbits and the jig-saw
    squad) to supply Philip with a square meal.</p>

    <p>Recently a caterpillar famine began to make itself felt in
    the parts of the garden near the house, and the enthusiasm of
    the collectors evaporated at the prospect of searching farther
    afield.</p>

    <p>Ansell was the first to cry off.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, Miss Ropes," he said firmly, "but I have an
    instinctive antipathy to reptiles."</p>

    <p>"They aren't&mdash;they're insects."</p>

    <p>"In that case," he replied still more firmly, "the shrieks
    of the little creatures when Philip gets 'em rend my
    heartstrings. I don't think the doctor would approve."</p>

    <p>Haynes suggested that Philip's behaviour savoured of
    unpatriotism, and that the one thing needful was the immediate
    appointment of a caterpillar controller. Miss Ropes countered
    this by electing herself to the post, and declaring that the
    supply was adequate to meet all demands, as soon as the
    regrettable strike of transport-workers was settled.</p>

    <p>"Don't you think," I said, "that it would be very much
    nicer&mdash;for Philip&mdash;if he were allowed to forage for
    himself? We had a bullfinch once who spent his days in the
    garden and always came back to the cage at night."</p>

    <p>This apposite though untrue anecdote obviously impressed the
    lady, but she decided that Philip was too precious to be made
    the subject of experiment. The transport-workers then returned
    to their labours, under protest.</p>

    <p>However, a day or two later Fate played into our hands. Miss
    Ropes herself inadvertently left the cage door open, and Philip
    escaped. The entire establishment devoted the day to his
    pursuit, without success; but in the evening the truant,
    dissipated and distended, lurched into his cage of his own
    accord and went instantly to sleep.</p>

    <p>Encouraged by his return and by the regular habits of my
    hypothetical bullfinch, Miss Ropes let him out again next day.
    This time he did not come back.</p>

    <p>"Probably he's sleeping it off somewhere," said Haynes
    cheerfully. "He'll be back to-morrow."</p>

    <p>However he wasn't. Miss Ropes had his description posted up
    in the village, and next day a telephone message informed us
    that a suspicious red-headed character answering to the
    specification was loitering near the "Waggon and Horses," and
    was being kept under observation. Miss Ropes and Haynes went
    off to arrest him, but hardly had they disappeared down the
    drive when Philip in person appeared on the lawn.</p>

    <p>This gave our handy man, James, his chance. James simply
    loves to make himself useful. If anybody wants anything done he
    can always rely on James to do it by a more complicated method
    and with more trouble to himself than the ordinary man could
    conceive. His <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span> education is generally
       understood to have consisted of an exhaustive study of the
       "How-To-Make" column in the <i>Boys' Own Paper</i>,
       completed by a short course of domestic engineering under
       Mr. W. HEATH ROBINSON.</p>

    <p>We first knew that he had undertaken the case when we heard
    his voice excitedly telling us not to move. Naturally we all
    turned to look at him. He had got a butterfly net from
    somewhere and was lying flat on his tummy and whistling
    seductively an alleged imitation of Philip's usual remark.
    Philip, about thirty yards away, was eyeing him with
    contempt.</p>

    <p>Suddenly James gathered his limbs beneath him, sprang up,
    galloped ten yards and flung himself down again, panting
    loudly. Philip, surprised and alarmed, took refuge in a tree,
    whereupon James abandoned the stalk (blaming us for having
    frightened Philip away) and retired to think of another
    scheme.</p>

    <p>Soon he reappeared with some pieces of bamboo and a square
    yard of white calico, sat down solemnly in the verandah and
    began to sew.</p>

    <p>"Is it a white flag? Are you going to parley with him, or
    what?" asked Ansell.</p>

    <p>"Trap," replied James shortly.</p>

    <p>We watched with silent interest while he got more and more
    entangled in his contrivance.</p>

    <p>"I hope Philip'll know how to work the machine," said I,
    "because I'm sure I shouldn't."</p>

    <p>At last it was finished, and James took it out and set it.
    He disguised it (rather thinly) with half-a-dozen oak leaves
    and baited it with a lot of caterpillars, and retired behind a
    tree with the end of a long piece of string in his hand.</p>

    <p>"When Philip walks up to the trap," he explained, "he starts
    eating the caterpillars. I pull the string, and he is caught in
    the calico. It's called a bow-net."</p>

    <p>He waited patiently for an hour-and-a-half, except for a
    short break while he rounded up the caterpillars, who, not
    knowing the rules, had walked away. Then we took the luncheon
    interval; scores, James (in play) 0; Philip 0.</p>

    <p>"I don't see," said Ansell soon after the resumption, "why
    poor old James should do all the work. Let's all help."</p>

    <p>We began by posting an appeal in prominent spots about the
    grounds:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>PHILIP&mdash;If this should meet the eye of. Return to
        your sorrowing family, when all will be forgotten and
        forgiven and no questions asked.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Next we festooned the estate with helpful notices, such as
    "This way to the Trap &mdash;&gt;" and "Caterpillar Buffet
    first turn to Left." One of the peacocks was observed to be
    reading this last with great interest, so we added a few more
    notices for the special benefit of unauthorised food-hogs:
    "Free List Suspended until Further Notice," and "Eat Less
    Worm."</p>

    <p>At tea-time Philip was still holding coldly aloof. But while
    we were indoors Bennett, the gardener, caught him by some
    simple artifice beneath James's notice. I found him putting the
    truant back in his cage.</p>

    <p>"Don't do that, Bennett," I said. "Put him in Mr. James's
    trap. He's had a lot of trouble making that trap, and it's a
    pity to waste it."</p>

    <p>Bennett grinned a toothless grin at me and did some dialect,
    which I understood to mean that I might do as I liked, but that
    he (Bennett) was not going to catch no more birds for us.</p>

    <p>Hardly had I put Philip in the trap when James emerged.</p>

    <p>"Good Lord!" he shouted, "it's done it! He's in!"</p>

    <p>He dashed on to the lawn, wild with joy. Probably it was the
    first time any of his devices had succeeded.</p>

    <p>"Aha, my beauty," he cried, slipping his hand under the
    calico. "We've got you safe, have we?"</p>

    <p>We had not. There was a flash of red and grey, and the
    outraged Philip, minus a tail feather, sought the sanctuary of
    the woods.</p>

    <p>He is still absent without leave at the time of writing.</p>

    <h2>FURTHER REMINISCENCES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>With acknowledgments to Mr. GEORGE R. SIMS</i>).</h4>

    <p>We come now to the beginning of the sixties. I well
    remember, early in the summer of one of them, Gentleman
    Dick&mdash;we called him this because his father had been a
    tramp, and, although he scarcely justified the maternal strain
    (his mother had been a washerwoman), he was certainly to all
    appearances his father's son&mdash;rushing in to tell me that
    "Blue Satin," the prize bull bitch belonging to the proprietor
    of that well-known tavern&mdash;public-houses were scarcely
    known in those days&mdash;"The Seven Sisters," had given birth
    to a son.</p>

    <p>This was an opportunity too good to be missed, and in spite
    of the bitter cold I hurried off with Gentleman Dick, who
    already had acquired no small reputation for his dexterity in
    hanging on to the backs of cabs, and ultimately secured "Albert
    the Good." If I had to christen a pup now I should naturally
    call him "Jellicoe the Brave." "Albert the Good" scarcely lived
    up to his name and eventually I had to get rid of him. He bit a
    piece out of a constable's leg. Sir J&mdash;&mdash;
    B&mdash;&mdash;, the presiding magistrate at Bow Street, was
    most charming about it however, and gave me a seat on the bench
    during the constable's evidence.</p>

    <p>I remember it especially because it was the day following
    this I was in at the death, when Ebenezer Smith, the Mayfair
    murderer, came to his end. He made an excellent breakfast of
    ham and eggs just before his execution, the Governor was good
    enough to tell me, and was collected enough even to grumble at
    the age of one of the eggs.</p>

    <p>D&mdash;&mdash; L&mdash;&mdash;, the famous comedian, was
    very funny always about his eggs. I remember he had an idea
    that if you whistled to the hen before the egg was laid the
    result tasted better when you ate it. He wanted me to write a
    comic song for him on these lines, but the idea never came to
    anything. I was very busy at the time collecting royalties. The
    thousandth performance of <i>The Merry Murderers</i> had just
    taken place, and at last I felt free to shake the dust of the
    City from my feet and devote myself to literature.</p>

    <p>It was just about this time that Jim Peters became the idol
    of England through knocking out the Black Bully&mdash;a
    coloured bruiser with an immense capacity for eating
    beef&mdash;in a couple of rounds. Peters was one of the best of
    fellows when he wasn't drunk, and could wink one eye in a
    manner I have never seen equalled by that later idol of the
    British public, M&mdash;&mdash; L&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

    <p>Alas! poor Peters from fat purses fell to thin times. He
    petered out, in fact, as far as the Mile End workhouse, where I
    discovered him one sad day, and was ultimately able to get him
    married to the lady who sold winkles on the pavement just
    outside. Her previous pitch had been just outside the Hoxton
    Theatre, but she told me she found Mile End more disposed to
    her wares. The marriage turned out a very happy one, I am glad
    to say, and it pleased me to think that Jim, having had his
    wink, was at least sure of his winkle.</p>

    <p>I remember another old friend of mine&mdash;John
    Madden&mdash;he made a hit in that ill-fated play, <i>A Little
    Bit Off the Top</i>&mdash;who had an extraordinary passion for
    shell-fish. I have often seen him seated on Southend Pier
    eating shrimps out of a paper-bag. By the way, I ought to add
    that he always purchased the shrimps in town and travelled down
    with them.</p>

    <p>Poor John, he might still be eating shrimps to-day if he
    hadn't caught a chill throwing off his sable coat during a
    rehearsal at the "Lane."</p>

    <p>Talking of fur coats, Florence Montgomery, who flourished in
    the early eighties, and took the town by storm singing, "Let me
    share your umbrella," in tights, had a perfect passion for
    them. She had one for every day in the week, as she laughingly
    told me once. She vanished suddenly, and everybody thought she
    had eloped with the Russian Duke B&mdash;&mdash; (he had been
    paying her marked attention), but it turned out afterwards that
    she had married a dustman.</p>

    <p>I met him casually at one of the yearly dinners given to
    this hardworking body of men&mdash;a most affable person he was
    too and deeply interested in the chemical properties of
    manure&mdash;and it came out. Some people might have thought a
    marriage like this a bit of a hygienic risk, but Florence
    always had a heart of gold.</p>

    <p>I have often thought this possession to be a particular
    attribute of the theatrical profession. Bessie Bean, the "Cocoa
    Queen," possessed it in a marked degree. I remember we called
    her the "Cocoa Queen" because she always fancied "a drop of
    something comforting" just before the curtain went up on the
    Third Act. Only, unfortunately, it wasn't cocoa.</p>

    <p>Arthur Batchen, manager of the Fly-by-Night Theatre and one
    of the best fellows that ever breathed, told me once he thought
    the soda must get into Bessie's legs. But her dresser was
    positive about her instructions always to forget the soda. So I
    don't think it can have been that.</p>

    <p>I remember too&mdash;</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, July 9th</i>.&mdash;With the sound of Saturday's
    bombs still in their ears Members came down to the House
    prepared to make things very uncomfortable for Ministers. Woe
    betide them if they could not explain satisfactorily, first,
    why the raiders had been able to get to London at all, and,
    secondly, why they had been allowed to depart almost unscathed.
    In this atmosphere the usual badinage of Question-time passed
    almost unnoticed. Mr. BALFOUR gave a neat summary of Germany's
    propagandist methods. "In Russia, where autocracy has been
    abolished, it declares that we are secretly fostering reaction;
    in Spain, where there is a constitutional monarchy, it
    proclaims that we are aiming at revolution. Both statements are
    untrue; both are absurd."</p>

    <p>Not until Mr. BONAR LAW announced that the PRIME MINISTER
    would move the adjournment of the House and make in Secret
    Session a statement regarding the air-raid was the House really
    roused. At once a storm of "supplementaries" broke forth. Mr.
    P. BILLING, baulked of his prey&mdash;for private sittings are
    no use to orators of the flatulent variety&mdash;bounced up and
    down like a Jack-in-the-Box until the SPEAKER finally
    suppressed him with the words, "There must be a limit to this."
    The Member for East Herts is presumably "the limit" referred
    to.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, perhaps, for the Government the Home Office
    Vote was the subject for discussion. This gave Members an
    opportunity for blowing off a lot of preliminary steam. At one
    moment an even more dangerous explosion was feared. Sir HENRY
    DALZIEL suddenly produced from his capacious coat-tails a shell
    which had fallen into his office during the raid. His
    neighbours crowded round to examine it, until his remark that
    it was "still unexploded" caused a slump in their curiosity.
    There was once a statesman who, to emphasize his argument,
    flung a dagger upon the floor of the House. For once the House
    was thankful that Sir HENRY DALZIEL bears no resemblance to
    BURKE.</p>

    <p>To warn or not to warn: that was the question mainly
    agitating Members. The majority appeared to think that some
    system of sound-signals was desirable; others pointed out that
    many threatened raids proved abortive, and that sirens would
    interfere with business, as in the leading case of Ulysses.
    Thanks to the HOME SECRETARY'S conciliatory methods there was
    considerably less tension in the atmosphere when the time came
    for the PRIME MINISTER to make his statement. When air-raids
    are about there is nothing he finds handier than a comfortable
    and capacious CAVE.</p>

        <h3>WORK OF "GREATER NATIONAL IMPORTANCE."</h3>MR. SPEAKER
        MISSES A GREAT CHANCE.
    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday, July 10th</i>.&mdash;The echoes of the air-raid
    had almost died away by this afternoon. When Mr. BILLING again
    tried to move the adjournment, the SPEAKER put him back in his
    box with so firm a hand that his spring may have been
    irretrievably injured. It is hoped that the National Service
    Department, which recently sent Mr. LOWTHER a notice informing
    him that he was about to be transferred to Wolverhampton as a
    labourer at 4<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> a day, "on the ground that
    such employment is deemed to be of greater national importance
    than that on which he is at present engaged," will now consent
    to hold its hand.</p>

    <p>When the House was about to go into Committee on the Corn
    Production Bill a strange thing happened. Before leaving the
    Chair the SPEAKER was proceeding to lop off a few excrescences
    in the way of Instructions that appeared on the Order-paper.
    Meanwhile the SERGEANT-AT-ARMS had advanced to the Table to
    remove the Mace. "Order, order!" exclaimed the SPEAKER, upon
    which Sir COLIN KEPPEL, much abashed to think that he, the
    guardian of order, should have been regarded as even
    potentially insubordinate, beat, for the first time in a
    gallant career, a hasty retreat.</p>

    <p>The Government had to withstand a massed attack by the Free
    Traders, who even in war-time have not entirely shed their
    prejudices against subsidizing the farmer at the expense of the
    rest of the community, although the object of the subsidies is
    to ensure the rest of the community having enough to eat. Mr.
    RUNCIMAN and his colleagues had the temerity to take a division
    which ran very much upon the old party-lines; but on this
    occasion the Nationalists, in the interest of Irish farmers,
    were not "agin' the Government," but helped it to secure the
    comfortable majority of 84.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, July 11th</i>.&mdash;In the matter of the
    Mesopotamia Report a large section of the public and the Press
    is in the mood of <i>Sam Weller</i>, "Ain't nobody to be
    whopped?" Anxious to satisfy this demand and at the same time
    to do justice to the individuals arraigned, the Government
    proposes to set up a special tribunal under the Army (Courts of
    Inquiry) Act. That measure, passed to deal with the strange
    case of the Bashful Lieutenant and the Lively Lady, and now to
    be utilized for this considerably larger issue, appears to
    resemble the elephant's trunk in its singular adaptability. But
    there was a tendency in both Houses to regard the procedure as
    more ingenious than statesmanlike.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, July 12th</i>.&mdash;The HOME SECRETARY
    announced that it had been decided to warn the public in future
    when an air-raid was actually imminent, and added that the
    exact method would be stated shortly. I am glad that he did not
    accept Sir FRANCIS LOWE'S proposal to set the telephone-bells
    ringing all over London. Think of the language which would
    proceed from a hundred thousand agitated subscribers, deceived
    into answering supposed "calls," when they ought to be making
    for their dug-outs.</p>

    <p>The gist of a very long speech by the ATTORNEY-GENERAL was
    that the Press had mistaken the Mesopotamia Commission for a
    Hanging Committee, whereas it much more resembled a Fishing
    Expedition. But his new tribunal found little favour with the
    House, especially when it was discovered that it would have no
    power to try the civilians affected. One of them,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN,
       announced his resignation&mdash;much to the regret of Mr.
       BALFOUR, who has no intention of following his example or of
       allowing Lord HARDINGE to do so. In the end it was decided
       that there must be an entirely new tribunal, which can deal
       fairly&mdash;and, one hopes, finally&mdash;with both
       soldiers and civilians. But it is now even betting that the
       Mesopotamia laundry-work will outlast the duration of the
       War.</p>

    <h2>WHAT THE KINGFISHER KNEW.</h2>

    <p>The wind ruffled the grey water of the stream under the old
    stone bridge.</p>

    <p>"Ssshhh, ssshhh," whispered the young willows, "what will
    become of us? what will they make of us? Ssshhh, ssshhh." But
    no one replied, chiefly because no one knew, excepting the
    kingfisher, and he was away on a fishing expedition.</p>

    <p>Then one day the woodcutters came and the sound of their
    axes rang out over the meadows by the quiet stream. A great
    many of the older willows were laid low that day, and the young
    trees bent and whispered among themselves, "Ssshhh, ssshhh,
    what will become of them? what will they make of them? Ssshhh,
    ssshhh." This time the kingfisher answered them, for he was
    just back from a fishing expedition.</p>

    <p>"They will make them into cricket-bats," he said; "that is
    what willow-trees are used for." And he sat and preened his gay
    little body in the sun.</p>

    <p>"Sss-shameful! Sss-shameful!" whispered the young
    willow-trees. "To cut and maim and carve us up just for men and
    boys to play with. Sss-shame! Sss-shame! If they only used us
    for tools to work with or for swords to fight with, we
    shouldn't mind; but just for sport! Sss-shame! Sss-shame!" And
    they trembled and whispered among themselves on the edge of the
    silver stream.</p>

    <p>But although the kingfisher happened to have a very little
    body he had a very big mind, and he explained to the young
    willow-trees that, even if cricket might be only a game, yet it
    trained boys and men for the Battle of Life. But the
    willow-trees were young and of course they thought they knew
    best, so they went on whispering among themselves, "Sss-shame!
    sss-shame!"</p>

    <p>After the War began the kingfisher used to bring back what
    news he could gather on his fishing expeditions. "They are
    cutting down the oaks in the lower spinney," he told them one
    day. "I expect they will be used for building ships." And he
    preened his little dazzling body in the sun.</p>

    <p>"I wish they would use <i>us</i> for building ships,"
    whispered the willows. "I wish they would let <i>us</i> die for
    our country. All our brave men and boys have gone to fight;
    they do not even need us for cricket-bats now," they sighed
    sadly. "I wish they were back and wanting us to play games
    with."</p>

    <p>And then one day, when the young willow-trees had grown
    older and more wise, the woodmen came again to the quiet
    stream.</p>

    <p>"What have they come for? What will they do with us?"
    whispered the willow-trees as they shivered and trembled on the
    reedy margin of the stream. The kingfisher was preening his
    small many-hued body in the sun.</p>

    <p>"I'll find out," he said, and flashed away like a fragment
    of rainbow gone astray. Almost by the time the first stroke of
    the axe rang out over the sleeping meadows he was back
    again.</p>

    <p>"You are going to die for your country," he told them. "They
    are using willows to make new limbs for our brave soldiers and
    sailors who have lost their own; they are using willows to make
    new limbs for our brave sailors and soldiers." Up and down the
    stream he darted, spreading the wonderful news; and so the
    willow-trees were comforted.</p>

    <p>"Ssshhh, ssshhh," they whispered. "Ssshhh! ssshhh! for our
    brave solders and sailors, for our dear sailors and
    soldiers&mdash;ssshhh, ssshhh."</p>

    <h2>THE BOAT.</h2>

    <h3>A STUDY IN INDIFFERENCE.</h3>

    <p>One likes to think of oneself as a person of some
    importance, whose vital spark, even in these days when life is
    so cheap, ought to be guarded with solicitude. Indeed, to adapt
    CLOUGH'S phrase, one wants other people&mdash;and especially
    those whose prosperity is dependent upon us&mdash;officiously
    to keep us alive.</p>

    <p>This being my not unnatural attitude, you will understand
    what a shock I had when the owner of the boat, who would expire
    of starvation if his boats were not hired, treated me as he has
    done.</p>

    <p>The boat in question was needed for an estuary or bay in
    which sailing is permitted. Since we had decided to take a
    holiday on the shores of this water it seemed well to secure
    something to navigate; and as I detest rowing it had to be
    something with sails, petrol being too scarce. The hotel people
    sent me the name of a man who had sailing-boats for hire. I
    corresponded with him, fixed up the price (an exorbitant one),
    and arranged for the boat to be ready on Monday afternoon.</p>

    <p>On Monday afternoon it had not arrived. There was the sea;
    there was the little pier; there were plenty of rowing-boats,
    but my vessel was&mdash;where?</p>

    <p>After breakfast the next day there was still no boat, but
    word came that its owner had called and would I see him?</p>

    <p>"About the boat," he began.</p>

    <p>"Where is it?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"She's moored just round the point there," he said.</p>

    <p>"Why isn't she here?" I asked, adopting his pronoun. I had
    forgotten for the moment that boats belong to the now
    enfranchised sex.</p>

    <p>"Did you want her so soon?" he replied.</p>

    <p>"It was all arranged for her to be here yesterday
    afternoon," I said. "I have your letter about it."</p>

    <p>"Oh, well, she'll be here directly," he answered.</p>

    <p>"I should have preferred you to keep your word," I said
    stiffly.</p>

    <p>He made no reply.</p>

    <p>"Send for her at once," I said. It was now half-past ten. "I
    want to go out this morning;" and he agreed.</p>

    <p>The boat arrived at a little after three&mdash;an open boat
    with a mast. No <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> deck; nowhere to be
       comfortable, as the boom swung almost level with the
       bulwarks. There was a foot of water in her.</p>

    <p>Her owner arrived while I was noting these things.</p>

    <p>He looked at her with pride. "She's a good boat," he said.
    "She used to be a lifeboat, with tanks in her to keep her
    buoyant, but I took them out."</p>

    <p>"I was expecting one with a deck," I said.</p>

    <p>"Deck? Who wants a deck?" he answered. "She's all right. You
    must keep baling, that's all. She would, be all the better for
    some white-lead and paint."</p>

    <p>"Why not give them to her?" I asked.</p>

    <p>He pointed to an island about a mile distant and a headland
    half a mile across the bay. "Keep within those two spots," he
    said, "and you'll be all right. It's not safe to take her
    beyond. There might be squalls."</p>

    <p>"Rather limited," I suggested.</p>

    <p>"There's grand water in between," he said. "Deep too in
    places. Nine fathoms."</p>

    <p>"Where's the man to sail her?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"The man?" he replied. "Aren't you going to sail her
    yourself? Your letter said nothing about a man."</p>

    <p>"Good heavens!" I said, "you surely wouldn't let a total
    stranger try to sail a boat here among all these unknown rocks
    and currents?"</p>

    <p>From his manner it was plain that he would, cheerfully.</p>

    <p>"Well, I've no man to spare," he said at last. "But there's
    a boy in the village who could come. He's not right in his head
    quite, but he'll be handy."</p>

    <p>"Does he know the channels?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"No, I wouldn't say he knew the channels," he replied, "but
    he'll be handy."</p>

    <p>"Have you any life-belts?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"There were some," he said, "but they've gone."</p>

    <p>"You're not very encouraging," I remarked. "Surely you don't
    want people drowned in your boats? It wouldn't do the village
    or the hotel any good."</p>

    <p>"No, I suppose not," he assented thoughtfully; "but no one's
    going to be drowned. No one ever has been drowned in that boat
    since I've had her." He laughed a hearty laugh. "So that's all
    right," he added, and was gone.</p>

    <p>I now know what an invalid feels like who, after a few weeks
    in (so to speak) cotton-wool, is deposited on the doorstep in
    the sleet.</p>

    <p>"I don't. I like your mature intellect. I can't do without
    your balanced judgment."</p>

    <p>"Thanks; it's pleasant to be appreciated as one deserves.
    And now I'll tell you what I'm going to do with my vote. When
    the time comes I shall take it with me into what's called a
    polling-booth, and I shall demand a piece of paper, and
    then&mdash;yes, then I shall destroy the sanctity of the home
    and neglect my children, and, incidentally, I shall break up
    the Empire, and do all the other dreadful things that you and
    the others have been prophesying; and I shall do them simply by
    making a cross opposite the name of the candidate who's got the
    nicest eyes and the prettiest moustache. That's what I shall do
    with my vote. I shall vote with it by ballot. What else could I
    do?"</p>

    <p>"Great Heaven! Francesca, how can you be so frivolous? Are
    you aware that politics, in which you are now to play a part
    however humble, are a serious matter?"</p>

    <p>"I know," she said, "and that is why they'll be all the
    better for an occasional touch of lightness. There's some Latin
    quotation about Apollo, isn't there, my Public School and
    University man? Well, I'm all for that."</p>

    <p>"But," I said, "you don't know how dangerous it is to be
    light and humorous at public meetings or in the House of
    Commons. A man gets a reputation for that sort of thing, and
    then he's expected to keep it up; and, anyhow, it gives him no
    influence, however funny he may be. The other men laugh at him,
    but distrust him profoundly."</p>

    <p>"Pooh!" said Francisca. "That's all very well for
    men&mdash;they have little humour and no wit&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"My dear Francesca, how can you venture to fly in the face
    of all experience&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Men's experience," she said; "it doesn't count. You've
    often said that smoking-room stories are the dullest in the
    world."</p>

    <p>"How you do dart about," I said, "from subject to subject.
    Just now you were in a polling-booth and now you're in a
    smoking-room."</p>

    <p>"And heartily ashamed to be found there&mdash;stale tobacco
    and staler stories. Why have a smoking-room at all when
    everybody's grandmother has her own cigarette case and her own
    special brand of cigarettes?"</p>

    <p>"We ought rather," I said, "to have two smoking-rooms to
    every house, one for me and the likes of me and the other for
    the grandmothers."</p>

    <p>"Segregating the sexes again! Surely if we have mixed
    bathing we may have mixed smoking."</p>

    <p>"And mixed voting," I said.</p>

    <p>"That is no real concession. We have wrung it from you
    because of the force and reasonableness of our case."</p>

    <p>"Say rather the force and Christabelness of your case."</p>

    <p>"Anyhow, we've got it."</p>

    <p>"And now that you've got it you don't really care for
    it."</p>

    <p>"We do, we do."</p>

    <p>"You don't. It's not one of the important subjects you and
    your friends talk about after you've quite definitely got up to
    go and said good-bye to one another."</p>

    <p>"What," said Francesca, "does this man mean?"</p>

    <p>"He means," I said, "those delightful and lingering
    committee meetings, when you have nearly separated and suddenly
    remember all the subjects you have forgotten."</p>

    <p>"Now," she said, "you are really funny."</p>

    <p>"I'm a man and can only do my best."</p>

    <p>"That's the pity of it; but now you've got the women to help
    you."</p>

    <p>"So I have. Well, <i>au revoir</i> in the
    polling-booth."</p>

    <p>"Anyhow, <i>&agrave; bas</i> the smoking-room."</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>The Candid Courtship</i> (LANE) is a story full of good
    talk; by which I do not at all mean brilliant epigram and
    verbal fireworks, but direct and genuine conversation, just so
    far manipulated by the author that it advances the business in
    hand without becoming artificial. I must add, however, that
    Miss MADGE MEARS occasionally displays the defects of her
    qualities, to the extent of sacrificing syntax to ease, even in
    passages of pure narrative, with results that might offend the
    precisionist. But after all it is what she has to say that
    matters most; and the story of <i>The Candid Courtship</i> will
    hold you amused and curious to the end. I will not spoil it by
    re-telling, save to indicate that (as the title implies) it is
    about a suitor who, in proposing to the girl of his choice,
    confessed to her that he had a past. Not a very lurid past, but
    quite bad enough for the G.O.H.C., who happened to entertain
    strong views on sex-equality. So, as vulgar persons say, the
    fat was in the fire&mdash;more especially when the lady of the
    past turned up again, not past at all, but very pleasantly
    intriguing with another, and that other own brother to the girl
    herself. A pretty complication, and leading up to an admirable
    scene of tragi-comedy over a double elopement and a pursuit,
    which you must certainly read. Do not, however, be led to think
    that the story is at all farcically treated; Miss MEARS is far
    too serious an artist to neglect the graver aspects of her
    theme. Briefly, an excellently human and stimulating novel,
    whose only drawback is that recent events have caused the
    suffrage atmosphere in which it is sat to taste somewhat
    stale.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Between anarchy and anarchy the history of unhappy Mexico is
    spanned for the space of a generation by the colossal figure of
    the soldier-president, <i>Diaz</i> (CONSTABLE). Mr. DAVID
    HANNAY, writing with exquisite literary workmanship in the
    series of biographies entitled collectively <i>Makers of the
    Nineteenth Century</i>, presents this typically "strong" man as
    neither hero nor villain, but as a human being with human
    limitations, even more as a Mexican with the characteristics of
    a Mexican. Amongst a populace hopelessly divided by race,
    untrained in self-government and cursed with a natural twist
    for lawlessness only equalled by its hatred of work,
    <i>Diaz</i> stands for a tyranny certainly, but for a unified
    orderly tyranny, preferable, one might think, to a myriad petty
    outlawries. If little of the country's wealth found its way
    beyond the narrowest of circles during his long control, and if
    certain Indian tribes were shamefully enslaved&mdash;a fact
    which is neither denied nor condoned&mdash;still railways and
    harbours did get themselves built and the dictator himself
    lived a life of uncorrupt simplicity. He has been blamed for
    failure to establish enduringly the civilisation that Europe
    thought bad been attained, but on this the author's verdict is
    an unhesitating acquittal. Only a god could have done better,
    he thinks, and, in a series of illuminating analyses of the
    material to be moulded he shows how anything more than a
    superficial improvement was humanly impossible. Until that day
    of absorption in the United States which Mr. HANNAY considers
    fortunately inevitable, Mexico has no chance, he maintains, of
    even a moderately good government except under a firm
    dictatorship; and so he renders no small homage to the man who,
    all his failures notwithstanding, did for a time lift his
    country from the anarchy to which in his old age it reverted.
    Sober reading in all conscience, but for the manner of the
    writing one can have nothing but joyous praise.</p>
    <hr class="short" />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>

    <p>His own modesty must preclude Mr. Punch from indicating
    those chapters in <i>Soldier Men</i> (LANE) that appear to him
    the most worthy of praise. But of course, if you specially want
    to know, a glance at the preliminary acknowledgments ...
    Anyhow, parental prejudice apart, these studies of military
    life, mostly on the Egyptian Front, form a sufficiently
    entertaining and interesting volume. In this war of many fronts
    and facets, literature seems a little to have deserted the
    desert; it is therefore good that a writer so well equipped as
    "YEO" should tell us a little of what our soldiers there are
    doing for the cause, the special variety of beastliness that
    they are enduring (to read the chapter called "Plagues of
    Egypt" is enough to make one seek out an English wasp and
    embrace it with tears of affection), and the courage and humour
    that support them in their task. Something more than this, too;
    the wholly illogical and baffling humanity that&mdash;one likes
    to think&mdash;helps to differentiate the British fighting man,
    and must surely cause certain European people such bewildered
    qualms, if they ever hear of it. Read, for example, that grim
    and moving story of the Corporal who thought shooting was too
    good for Bedouin rebels, and what he actually did to a family
    of them who interrupted these reflections. But I forgot; this
    is one of the chapters that I was not going to mention.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Miss MARGARET PETERSON's <i>Fate and the Watcher</i> (HURST
    AND BLACKETT) was already reminding me strongly of <i>The
    Broken Road</i> when I found that one of her characters had
    been struck by this same idea: "Lady Daring was not easy in
    mind, remembering the look in Prince Channa's eyes the evening
    of the ball. She had a vague memory of a novel by Mason that
    she had once read which dealt more or less with the same
    situation." This na&iuml;ve admission must be my excuse for
    making odious comparisons between the two books and saying that
    Mr. MASON'S novel, which also treats of a native prince's love
    for an English girl, is on bigger and broader lines. In <i>Fate
    and the Watcher</i> the heroine and the cause of all the
    trouble is a waif taken literally from the gutter. She develops
    into a most unscrupulous minx, and, although we are led to
    suppose that her defects of character were largely due to her
    origin, I am prepared to allot to <i>Sir Henry</i> and <i>Lady
    Daring</i>, who adopted her, their fair share in the blame. A
    girl of the sweet type, endowed liberally with virtues, is
    produced as an antidote to the minx, but is no match for her.
    The present is not perhaps the most happily chosen time for a
    novel with such a theme, but I can at least say that Miss
    PETERSON is an expert in her subject and is never at a loss for
    incident. And <i>Ruth</i> (if that will console you) pays full
    price for her sins.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. HERBERT VIVIAN is the complete partisan. He will believe
    always the worst of an enemy, the best of a friend&mdash;a
    credulous loyal fellow. And in <i>Italy at War</i> (DENT) he
    sets out to tell us a good deal that is interesting about the
    fine feats of our Italian Allies, especially of those Titanic
    gymnasts, the heaven-scaling Alpini. It is fair to warn the
    reader that it is a rather desultory scrap-book of the type the
    War has made common; fair also to add that some of the chapters
    least connected with the War are exceedingly interesting, as
    that about the elaborate sport of pigeon-netting at Cava dei
    Terreni. What I like least about our ready author is his
    fatuous little jokes, such as "Noli remained a sovereign
    republic for centuries ... had her own bishopric (hence the
    phrase '<i>Noli episcopari</i>')"; or, "Briand came to Rome the
    other day with much <i>brio</i>." And inconsequences like this:
    "One of Disraeli's heroes discovered two nations: the rich and
    the poor. In a similar spirit General February may be said to
    command two distinct armies." All the same, an interesting
    book.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I am no pacificist, but I am bound to admit that the moment
    seems distinctly ripe for a cessation in one minor War product,
    namely the trench-book. Perhaps some form of armistice might be
    arranged, to last, say, six months; at the end of which time
    (should the War last so long) the changed conditions of
    campaigning on German soil might at least give our
    impressionists a chance of originality. I have been inspired to
    these comments by a perusal of <i>Mud and Khaki</i> (SIMPKIN),
    in which Mr. VERNON BARTLETT has reprinted from <i>The Daily
    Mail</i> and elsewhere a number of vigorous and realistic
    studies of life on the Western Front. Perhaps, as a whole, the
    collection is a little more grim than most; but there are not
    wanting touches of light comedy, in, for example, the comments
    of an admirable philosopher named <i>"Pongo" Simpson</i>. For
    the rest the book is precisely what you can gather from its
    title. In his preface the author tells us that his object in
    writing it has partly been to correct a lack of appreciation
    among stay-at-homes of the hardships and heroism of their
    defenders. But does there really breathe a man with soul so
    dead as to belittle these to-day? I should be ashamed to think
    so. Still, do not suppose that I regret that Mr. BARTLETT
    should have been goaded by whatever motive into print. Far from
    it, for he is clearly a writer of gifts. But I suggest that he
    should next time exhibit them to us in some (dare I say?) less
    trenchant guise.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
