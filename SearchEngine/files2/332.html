<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>"Of course I cannot be in France and America at the same time,"
said Colonel ROOSEVELT to a New York interviewer. The EX-PRESIDENT
is a very capable man and we can only conclude that he has not been
really trying.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The Church of to-morrow is not to be built up of prodigal
sons," said a speaker at the Congregational Conference. Fatted
calves will, however, continue to be a feature in Episcopal
circles.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Berlin coal merchant has been suspended from business for
being rude to customers. It is obvious that the Prussian
aristocracy will not abandon its prerogatives without a
struggle.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The lack of food control in Ireland daily grows more scandalous.
A Belfast constable has arrested a woman who was chewing four
five-pound notes, and had already swallowed one.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An alien who was fined at Feltham police court embraced his
solicitor and kissed him on the cheek. Some curiosity exists as to
whether the act was intended as a reprisal.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>The English Hymnal</i>, says a morning paper, "contains forty
English Traditional Melodies and three Welsh tunes." This attempt
to sow dissension among the Allies can surely be traced to some
enemy source.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. GEORGE MOORE, the novelist, declares that ROBERT LOUIS
STEVENSON "was without merit for tale-telling." But how does Mr.
GEORGE MOORE know?</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Is Pheasant Shooting Dangerous?" asks a weekly paper headline.
We understand that many pheasants are of the opinion that it has
its risks.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Only a little care is needed in the cooking of the marrow, says
Mrs. MUDIE COOKE. But in eating it great caution should be taken
not to swallow the marrow whole.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An applicant at the House of Commons' Appeal Tribunal stated
that he had been wrongly described as a Member of Parliament. It is
not known who first started the scandal.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>HERR BATOCKI, Germany's first Food Dictator, is now on active
service on the Western Front, where his remarks about the
comparative dulness of the proceedings are a source of constant
irritation to the Higher Command.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is rumoured that the Carnegie Medal for Gallantry is to be
awarded to the New York gentleman who has purchased Mr. EPSTEIN'S
"Venus."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We understand that an enterprising firm of publishers is now
negotiating for the production of a book written by "The German
Prisoner Who Did Not Escape."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Four conscientious objectors at Newhaven have complained that
their food often contains sandy substances. It seems a pity that
the authorities cannot find some better way of getting a little
grit into these poor fellows.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>General SUKHOMLINOFF has appealed from his sentence of
imprisonment for life. Some people don't know what gratitude
is.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is good to find that people exercise care in time of crisis.
Told that enemy aircraft were on their way to London a dear old
lady immediately rushed into her house and bolted the door.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Owing to a shortage of red paint, several London 'buses are
being painted brown. Pedestrians who have only been knocked down by
red-painted 'buses will of course now be able to start all over
again.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We think it was in bad taste for Mr. BOTTOMLEY, just after
saying that he had seen Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL at the Front, to add,
"I have Taken Risks."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Six little boa-constrictors have been born in the Zoological
Gardens. A message has been despatched to Sir ARTHUR YAPP, urging
the advisability of his addressing them at an early date.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>To record the effect of meals on the physical condition of
children, Leyton Council is erecting weighing machines in the
feeding centres. Several altruistic youngsters, we are informed,
have gallantly volunteered to demonstrate the effects of
over-eating without regard to the consequences.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An allotment holder in Cambridgeshire has found a sovereign on a
potato root. To its credit, however, it must be said that the
potato was proceeding in the direction of the Local War Savings
Association at the rate of several inches a day.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We are pleased to say that the Wimbledon gentleman who last week
was inadvertently given a pound of sugar in mistake for tea is
going on as well as can be expected, though he is still only
allowed to see near relations.</p>

<p><i>A</i>. Beautiful weather for the time of year!</p>
<p><i>B</i>. A perfect spell, indeed, of halcyon calm,</p>

<p class="i4">A priceless gift to our brave lads in France,</p>
<p class="i4">Whose need is sorer, being sick of mud.</p>
<p><i>A</i>. They have our first thoughts ever, and, if Heaven</p>
<p class="i4">Had not enough good weather to go round,</p>
<p class="i4">Gladly I'd sacrifice this present boon</p>
<p class="i4">And welcome howling blizzards, hail and flood,</p>
<p class="i4">So they, out there, might still be warm and dry.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>C</i>. Have you observed the alien in our midst,</p>
<p class="i4">How strangely numerous he seems to-day,</p>
<p class="i4">Swarming like migrant swallows from the East?</p>
<p><i>D</i>. I take it they would fain elude the net</p>
<p class="i4">Spread by Conscription's hands to haul them in.</p>
<p class="i4">All day they lurk in cover Houndsditch way,</p>
<p class="i4">Dodging the copper, and emerge at night</p>
<p class="i4">To snatch a breath of Occidental air</p>
<p class="i4">And drink the ozone of our Underground.</p>

<p><i>F</i>. True. In addition to the regular stars</p>

<p class="i4">Closely resembling the report of guns.</p>
<p><i>H</i>. Ay, you conjectured right. Those sounds arose</p>
<p class="i4">From anti-aircraft guns engaged in practice</p>
<p class="i4">Against the unlikely advent of the Hun.</p>
<p class="i4">One must be ready in a war like this</p>
<p class="i4">To face the most remote contingencies.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to what</p>
<p class="i4">Do you attribute this unusual dearth?</p>
<p><i>K</i>. The general rush to Halls of Mirth and Song,</p>
<p class="i4">Never so popular. The War goes well,</p>
<p class="i4">And London's millions needs must find a way</p>
<p class="i4">To vent their exaltation&mdash;else they burst.</p>
<p><i>J</i>. But could you not have travelled by the Tube?</p>
<p><i>K</i>. I did essay the Tube, but found it stuffed.</p>
<p class="i4">The atmosphere was solid as a cheese,</p>
<p class="i4">And I was loath to penetrate the crowd</p>
<p class="i4">Lest it should shove me from behind upon</p>
<p class="i4">The electric rail.</p>
<p><i>J</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you account for that?</p>
<p><i>K</i>. I should ascribe it to the harvest moon,</p>
<p class="i4">That wakes romance in Metropolitan breasts,</p>
<p class="i4">Drawing our young war-workers out of town</p>
<p class="i4">To seek the glamour of the country lanes</p>
<p class="i4">Under the silvery beams to lovers dear. O.S.</p>

<h2>FORCE OF HABIT.</h2>
<p>The fact that George had been eighteen months in Gallipoli,
Egypt and France, without leave home till now, should have warned
me. As it was I merely found myself gasping "Shell-shock!"</p>
<p>We were walking in a crowded thoroughfare, and George was giving
all the officers he met the cheeriest of "Good mornings." It took
people in two ways. Those on leave, blushing to think they had so
far forgotten their B.E.F. habits as to pass a brother-officer
without some recognition, replied hastily by murmuring the
conventional "How are you?" into some innocent civilian's face some
yards behind us. Mere stay-at-homes, on the other hand, surprised
into believing that they ought to know him, stopped and became
quite effusive. As far as I can remember George accepted three
invitations to dinner from total strangers rather than explain, and
I was included in one of them.</p>
<p>We were for the play that night and I foresaw difficulties at
the public telephone, and George's first remark of "Hullo, hullo,
is that Signals? Put me through to His Majesty's," confirmed my
apprehensions.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour of this kind of thing produced in me a strong
desire for peace and seclusion. A taxi would have solved my
difficulty (had I been able to solve the taxi difficulty first),
but George himself anticipated me by suddenly holding up a private
car and asking for a lift. I could have smiled at this further
lapse had not the owner, a detestable club acquaintance whom I had
been trying to keep at a distance for years, been the driver. He
was delighted, and I was borne away conscious of twenty years' work
undone by a single stroke.</p>
<p>Peace and seclusion at the club afforded no relief however.
George was really very trying at tea. He accused the bread because
the crust had not a hairy exterior (generally accumulated by its
conveyance in a blanket or sandbag). He ridiculed the sugar
ration&mdash;I don't believe he has ever been short in his life;
and the resources of the place were unequal to the task of
providing tea of sufficient strength to admit of the spoon being
stood upright in it&mdash;a consistency to which, he said, he had
grown accustomed. When I left him he was bullying the hall-porter
of the club for a soft-nosed pencil; ink, he explained, being an
abomination.</p>
<p>I also saw him pay 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> for a <i>Daily
Mail</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>I got a letter from George just before he went back. He
patronized me delightfully&mdash;seemed more than half a Colonial
already. He said he was glad to have seen us all again, but was
equally glad to be getting back, as he was beginning to feel a
little homesick. He hinted we were dull dogs and treated people we
didn't know like strangers. Didn't we ever cheer up? He became very
unjust, I thought, when he said that France was at war, but that we
had only an Army and Navy.</p>
<p>Incidentally I had to pay twopence on the letter, the postman
insisting that George's neat signature in the bottom left-hand
corner of the envelope was an insufficient substitute for a penny
stamp.</p>

<h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>
<h3>LXVI.</h3>
<p>MY DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Here is a war, producing great men, and
here am I writing to you from time to time about it and never
mentioning one of them. I have touched upon Commanding Officers,
Brigadiers, Divisional, Corps, even Army Commanders; I have gone so
far as to mention the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF once and I have mentioned
myself very many times. But the really great men I have omitted. I
mean the really, really great men, without whom the War could not
possibly go on, and with whom, I am often led to suppose, the
decision remains as to what day Peace shall be declared. Take the
A.M.L.O. at &mdash;&mdash; for example.</p>
<p>Now, Charles, be it understood that I am not saying anything for
or against the trade of Assisting Military Landing Officers; I have
no feeling with regard to it one way or the other. For all I know
it may require a technical knowledge so profound that any man who
can master it is already half-way on the road to greatness. On the
other hand, it may require no technical knowledge at all, and, the
whole of a Military Landing Officer's duties being limited to
watching other people working, the Assistant Military Landing
Officer's task may consist of nothing more complicated than
watching the Military Landing Officer watching the military land.
If this is so, the work may be so simple that, once a man has
satisfied the very rigid social test to be passed by all aspirants
to so distinguished a position, he must simply be a silly ass if he
doesn't automatically become a great man, after a walk or two up
and down the quay. I repeat, I know nothing whatever of the calling
of A.M.L.O., and I could not tell you without inquiry whether it is
an ancient and honourable profession or an unscrupulous trade very
jealously watched by the Law. I have some friends in it and I have
many friends out of it, and the former should not be inflated with
conceit nor the latter unduly depressed when I pronounce the
deliberate opinion that the best known and greatest thing in the
B.E.F. is without doubt the A.M.L.O. at &mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>Though it is months since I cast eyes on him, I can see him now,
standing self-confidently on his own private quay, with the most
chic of Virginian cigarettes smouldering between his aristocratic
lips and the very latest and most elegant of Bond Street Khaki
Neckwear distinguishing him from the mixed crowd about him. Every
one else is distraught; even matured Generals, used to the simple
and irresponsible task of commanding troops in action, are a little
unnerved by the difficulties and intricacies of embarking oneself
militarily. He on whom all the responsibility rests remains aloof.
A smile, half cynical, plays across his proud face. He knows he has
but to flick the ash from his cigarette and the Army will spring to
attention and the Navy will get feverishly to work. He has but to
express consent by the inclination of his head and sirens will
blow, turbine engines will operate as they would never operate for
anybody else, thousands of tons of shipping will rearrange itself,
and even the sea will become less obstreperous and more circumspect
in its demeanour, adjusting, if need be, its tides to suit his
wishes.</p>
<p>I take it my condition is typical when I am "proceeding" (one
will never come and go again in our time; one will always
proceed)&mdash;when I am proceeding to the U.K. The whole thing is
too good to believe, and I don't believe it till I have some
written and omnipotent instructions, in my pocket and am actually
moving towards the sea. The youngest and keenest schoolboy
returning home for his holidays is a calm, collected, impassionate
and even dismal man of the world compared to me. I see little and
am impressed by nothing; all things and men are assumed to be good,
and none <span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id=
"page251"></a>[pg 251]</span> of them is given the opportunity of
proving itself to be the contrary. As for the A.M.L.O. at any other
port but this one, I remark nothing about him except his princely
generosity in letting me have an embarcation card. He is just one
more good fellow in the long series of good fellows who have
authorised my move. I am borne out to sea in a dream&mdash;a dream
of England and all that England means to us, be that a wife or a
reasonable breakfast at a reasonable hour. Not until I am on my way
back does it occur to me that landing and transport officers have
identities, and by that time I have lost all interest in transport
and landing and officers and identities and everything else.</p>
<p>At the port of &mdash;&mdash;, however, it is very different. I
may arrive on the quay in a dream, but I'm at once out of it when I
have caught sight of Greatness sitting in its little hut with the
ticket window firmly closed until the arrival of the hour before
which he has disposed that it shall not open. Thoughts of home are
gone; I can think of nothing but Him. When at last I have obtained
his gracious, if reluctant, consent to my obeying the instructions
I have, and have got on to the boat, I deposit my goods hurriedly,
anywhere, and fight for a position by the bulwark nearest the quay,
from which I may gaze at his august Excellency for the few
remaining hours during which it is given us to linger in or near
our well-beloved France.</p>
<p>How came it about, I ask myself, that the Right Man got to be in
the Right Place? It cannot have been merely fortuitous that he was
not thrust away into some such obscure job as the command of an
Expeditionary Force or the control of the counsels of the Imperial
General Staff. It must have been the deliberate choice of a wise
chooser; Major-General Military Landing himself, the SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR WAR on his own, even His MAJESTY in person? Or was a
plebiscite taken through the length and breadth of the British
Isles when I was elsewhere, and did Britain, thrilled to the core,
clamour for him unanimously?</p>
<p>I watch him keep a perturbed and restless Major from the line
waiting while he finishes his light-hearted badinage with a
subordinate. It is altogether magnificent in its sheer
<i>sangfroid</i>. Why is it that such a one is labelled merely
A.M.L.O., when he should obviously be the M.L.O.? He has his
subordinate, happily insignificant and obsequiously proud to serve.
Let the subordinate be the a.m.l.o., and let It, Itself, be openly
acknowledged to be It, Itself.</p>
<p>By the way, where <i>is</i> his M.L.O.? Has anybody ever seen
him? I haven't. Does he exist?... Has he been got rid of?</p>
<p>There is a convenient crevice between the quay and the boat with
a convenient number of feet of water at the bottom of it. Is the
M.L.O. down there, and is the "A.M.L.O." brassard but the modesty
of true greatness?</p>
<p>If the M.L.O. has been thrown down there, who threw him?</p>
<p>Was it my idol, the A.M.L.O., in a moment of exasperation with
his M.L.O.?</p>
<p>Or was it the M.L.O., in a moment of exasperation with my idol,
the A.M.L.O.?</p>

<h2>BEASTS ROYAL.</h2>
<h3>III.</h3>
<h3 class="sc">Duke William's Falcon. A.D. 1065.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Upon a marsh beside the sea,</p>
<p>With hawk and hound and vassals three,</p>
<p>Rode WILLIAM, Duke of NORMANDY,</p>
<p class="i2">The heir of Rover ROLLO;</p>
<p>And ever as his falcon flew</p>
<p>Quoth he: "Mark well, by St. MACLOU,</p>
<p>For where she hovers hasten you,</p>
<p class="i2">And where she falls I follow."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>She rose into the misty sky,</p>
<p>A brooding menace hid on high,</p>
<p>Ere she dipped earthward suddenly</p>
<p class="i2">As dips the silver swallow;</p>
<p>Then, spurring through the rushes grey,</p>
<p>Cried WILLIAM, "Sirs, away, away!</p>
<p>For where she hovers is the prey,</p>
<p class="i2">And where she falls I follow."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Her marbled plume with crimson dight,</p>
<p>Seaward she soared, and bent her flight</p>
<p>Above the ridge of foaming white</p>
<p class="i2">Along the harbour hollow;</p>
<p>Then, looking grimly toward the strait,</p>
<p>Said WILLIAM, "Truly, soon or late,</p>
<p>There where she hovers is my fate,</p>
<p class="i2">And where she falls I follow."</p>

<h2>THE CAVE-DWELLERS.</h2>
<p>"If you please, ma'am, that funny-looking gentleman with the
long hair has brought his jug for some more water. And could you
oblige him with a little pepper?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not," said my wife. "The man's a nuisance. He is not
even respectable&mdash;looks like a gipsy or a disreputable artist.
I'll speak to him myself." And she flounced out of the room.</p>
<p>I felt almost sorry for the man; but really the thing was
overdone when, not content with overcrowding our village, these
London people took to living in dug-outs on the common.</p>
<p>Matilda rushed back into the room with a metal jug in her
hand.</p>
<p>"Oscar! It's old Sheffield plate, and there's a coat-of-arms on
it. Turn up the heraldry book; look in the index for 'bears.'
Perhaps they're somebody after all."</p>
<p>Matilda is a second cousin once removed of the
Drewitts&mdash;one of the best baronetcies in England&mdash;and
naturally we take an interest in Heraldry.</p>
<p>"Yes, here it is. A cave-bear rampant! Oscar, it's the crest of
the Cave-Canems, one of the oldest families in Britain, if not the
very oldest! Poor things, I feel so sorry for them. Perhaps I might
offer him some vegetables."</p>
<p>"And to think of their having to live in a cave again after all
these centuries," said my wife when she returned. "Isn't it
pathetic? Oscar, don't you think we ought to call on them?"</p>
<p>We agreed that it was our duty to call on the distinguished
cave-dwellers. But what ought we to wear? They dressed very simply;
I had seen him in an old tweed suit and a soft felt hat.</p>
<p>"And his wife," Matilda said, "is positively dowdy. But that
proves they are somebody. Only the very best people can afford to
wear shabby clothes in these times."</p>
<p>We decided that in our case it was necessary to recognise the
polite usages of society. So my wife wore her foliage green silk,
and I my ordinary Sabbath attire.</p>
<p>A fragrant odour of vegetables cooking led us eventually to the
little mound amidst the gorse where our aristocratic visitors were
temporarily residing. There was some difficulty at first in
attracting their attention, but this I overcame by tying our
visiting-cards to a piece of string and dangling it down the tunnel
that served as an entrance. After coughing several times I had a
bite, and the cave-man showed himself.</p>
<p>"Hallo!" I heard him say, laughing, "it's the kind Philistines
who gave us the vegetables." Then aloud, "Come in. Mind the
steps."</p>
<p>I damaged my hat slightly against the roof, and I am afraid
Matilda's dress suffered a little, but we managed to enter their
dug-out. The place was faintly lighted by a sort of window
overlooking the third hole of the deserted golf course. Our host
introduced his wife.</p>
<p>"We were not really nervous," said the lady, "but a fragment of
shell came through the studio window and destroyed a number of my
husband's pictures. He is a painter of the Neo-Impressionistic
School."</p>
<p>"What a shame!" said Matilda, taking up a canvas. "May I look?
Oh! how pretty."</p>
<p>"My worst enemy has never called my work that," said the artist.
"Perhaps you would appreciate it better if you held it the other
way up."</p>
<p>It is at a moment like this that my wife shines.</p>
<p>"I should like to see it in a better light," she said. "But how
interesting! Everyone paints now-a-days&mdash;even Royalty. My
cousin, Sir Ethelwyn Drewitt, has done some charming water-colours
of the family estates. Perhaps you know him?"</p>
<p>Our host shook his head.</p>
<p>"A very old family, like your own," said Matilda. "Our ancestors
probably knew each other in the days of Stonehenge. I, of course,
recognised the coat-of-arms on your plate."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you are in error," said the artist. "My name is
Pitts. And I don't go back beyond my grandfather, who, honest man,
kept a grocer's shop in Dulwich. The jug you've been admiring I
bought in the Caledonian Cattle Market for fifteen shillings."</p>
<p>Matilda swooned. The air was certainly very close down
there.</p>

<h2>THE WAR-DREAM.</h2>
<div class="poem">

<p>I Wish I did not dream of France</p>

<p>And sometimes wake my anxious spouse</p>

<p>Because it seems a hundred "hows"</p>
<p class="i6">Are barraging the bed.</p>

<p class="i2">Or know the old nocturnal mares;</p>

<p>Would be a treat; I almost miss</p>
<p>That feeling of paralysis</p>

<h2>THE DOOR.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time there was a sitting-room, in which, when
everyone had gone to bed, the furniture, after its habit, used to
talk. All furniture talks, although the only pieces with voices
that we human beings can hear are clocks and wicker-chairs.
Everyone has heard a little of the conversation of wicker-chairs,
which usually turn upon the last person to be seated in them; but
other furniture is more self-centered.</p>
<p>On the night with which we are now concerned the first remark
was made by the clock, who stated with a clarity only equalled by
his brevity that it was one. An hour later he would probably be
twice as voluble.</p>
<p>It was normally the signal for an outburst of comment and
confidence; but let me first say that the house in which this
sitting-room was situated belonged to an elderly gentleman and his
wife, each conspicuous for peaceable kindliness. Neither would hurt
a fly, but since they had grandsons fighting for England, honour
and the world, it chanced that they were the incongruous possessors
of quite a number of war relics, which included an inkstand made of
a steel shell-top, copper shell-binding and cartridge-cases; a
Turkish dud from Gallipoli to serve as a door-stop; a pencil-case
made of an Austrian cartridge from the Carso; a cigarette-lighter
made of English cartridge-cases; and several shell-cases
transformed into vases for flowers. One of these at this moment
contained some very beautiful late sweet peas, and the old
gentleman had made a pleasant little joke, after dinner, about
sweet peace blossoming in such a strange environment, and would
probably make it again the next time they had guests.</p>
<p>You may be sure that, with the arrival of these souvenirs from
such exciting parts, the conversation of the room became more
interesting, although it may be that some of the stay-at-homes
began after a while to feel a little out in the cold. What was an
ordinary table to say when in competition with a .75 shell-case
from the Battle of the Marne, or a mere Jubilee wedding-present
against an inkstand composed of articles of destruction from Vimy
Ridge, which had an irritating way of making the most of both its
existences&mdash;reaping in two fields&mdash;by remarking, after a
thrilling story of bloodshed, "But that's all behind me now. My new
destiny is to prove the pen mightier than the sword"? Even though
the Jubilee wedding-present came from Bond Street, and had once
been picked up and set down again by QUEEN ALEXANDRA, what availed
that? The souvenir held the floor.</p>
<p>Gradually the other occupants of the room had come to let the
souvenirs uninterruptedly exchange war impressions and speculate as
to how long it would last&mdash;a problem as to which they were not
more exactly informed than many a human wiseacre. Under cover of
this kind of talk, which is apt to become noisy, the humdrum of the
others, the chairs and the table and the mantelpiece, and the
pacific ornaments, and the mirror, could chat in their own mild
way; the wicker-chair, for example, could wonder for the thousandth
time how long it would be before the young Captain sat in it once
more; and the mirror could remark that that would be a happy moment
indeed when once again it held the reflections of the Lieutenant
and his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, who was one of the prettiest girls
in the world.</p>
<p>"Do you think so?" the knob of the brass fender would inquire.
"To me she seemed too fat and her mouth was very wide."</p>
<p>"But that's a fault," the tongs would reply, "that you find with
every one."</p>
<p>To return to the night of which I want particularly to speak, no
sooner had the clock made his monosyllabic utterance than "I am
probably unique," the Vimy Ridge inkstand said.</p>
<p>"How?" the cigarette-lighter sharply <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span>
inquired, uniqueness being one of his own chief claims to
distinction.</p>
<p>"Strange," said the inkstand, "the blacksmith who made me was
not blown to pieces. The usual thing is for the shell to be a live
one, and no sooner does the blacksmith handle it than he and the
soldiers who brought it and several onlookers go to glory. The
papers are full of such incidents. But in my case&mdash;no. I
remember," the inkstand was continuing&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh, give us a rest," said the shell door-stop. "If you knew how
tired I was of hearing about the War, when there's nothing to do
for ever but stop in this stuffy room. And to me it's particularly
galling, because I never exploded at all. I failed. For all the
good we are any more, we&mdash;we warriors&mdash;we might as well
be mouldy old fossils like the home-grown things in this room, who
know of war or excitement absolutely nothing."</p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong," said a quiet voice.</p>
<p>"Who's speaking?" the shell asked.</p>
<p>"I am," said the door. "You're quite right about
yourselves&mdash;you War souvenirs. You've done. You can still brag
a bit, but that's all. You're out of it. Whereas I&mdash;I'm in it
still. I can make people run for their lives."</p>
<p>"How?" asked the inkstand.</p>
<p>"Because whenever I bang," said the door, "they think I'm an
air-raid."</p>

<h3>INFORMATION TO THE ENEMY.</h3>
<i>Wife.</i> "I CALL IT SIMPLY SCANDALOUS THAT THE PAPERS SHOULD

<hr />
<h2>OSWALD AND CO.</h2>
<p>We live in a fortress on the crest of a hill overlooking a
little Irish town, a centre of the pig and potheen industries. The
fortress was, according to tradition, built by BRIAN BORU,
renovated by Sir WALTER RALEIGH (the tobacconist, not the
professor) and brought up to date by OLIVER CROMWELL. It has
dungeons (for keeping the butter cool), loop-holes (through which
to pour hot porridge on invaders), an oubliette (for bores) and a
portcullis.</p>
<p>In spite of these conveniences our fortress is past its prime
and a modern burglar would treat it as a joke. It is so weak in its
joints that when the wind blows it shakes like a jelly, and we have
to shave with safety-razors.</p>
<p>In a small villa opposite lives Freddy, our married subaltern,
and Mrs. Freddy.</p>
<p>On a patch of turf up a neighbouring lane Oswald and Co. took up
their residence this summer.</p>
<p>The troopers called him Oswald for some unknown reason, but I
doubt if that was his baptismal name, and I doubt if he was ever
baptized.</p>
<p>Oswald was a tall bony grizzled child of the Open.</p>
<p>Years ago he would have been dismissed briefly as a tramp, but
we know better now; we have read our Georgian poets and we know
that such folk do not perambulate the country stealing fowls and
firing ricks from any dislike of settled labour, but because they
have heard the call of far horizons, <i>belles &eacute;toiles</i>
and great spaces.</p>
<p>The Co. consisted of a woolly donkey which carried Oswald's
portmanteau when he trekked, and a hairy dog which provided him
with company and conversation.</p>
<p>The donkey browsed, unfettered, about the roadside, taking the
weather as it came; but Oswald and the dog, degenerates, sheltered
under a wigwam of saplings and old sacks.</p>
<p>The wigwam being four feet long and Oswald six, he had to
telescope like a tortoise to get fully under cover; sometimes he
forgot his feet and left them outside all night in the dew, but, as
he had no boots to spoil, this didn't matter much.</p>
<p>Not having any business to attend to he lay abed very late. Our
troopers, riding at ease <i>en route</i> to the drill grounds,
would toss their lighted cigarette-ends at the protruding bare
feet. A grizzled head telescoping out of the other end of the
wigwam and a husky voice calling down celestial fury upon them,
would signalise a hit.</p>
<p>The Adjutant was for having Oswald moved on; we should be
missing things presently, he warned&mdash;saddle-blankets, rifles,
horses, perhaps the portcullis. However, the O.C. would have none
of it; he maintained that this constant menace at our gates kept
the sentries on the <i>qui vive</i> and accustomed them to
practically Active Service conditions.</p>
<p>So all the summer the wigwam remained on the turf-patch and the
sentries on the <i>qui vive</i>.</p>
<p>How Oswald existed is a mystery&mdash;probably on manna, for he
toiled not neither span, and if he stole for a living it was not
from us.</p>
<p>He spent his mornings in bed, his afternoons reclining on the
bank behind his residence, puffing at his dudheen and watching our
recruits going through the hoops with the amused contempt that a
gentleman of leisure naturally feels for the working classes.</p>
<p>At the end of September, Freddy, the Benedick, finding himself
in the orderly-room and forgetting what had brought him there,
applied for leave as a matter of habit, and, walking out again,
promptly forgot all about it. Freddy is given that way. Apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg
257]</span> the Orderly Room was finding time heavy on their hands
that morning, for machinery was set in motion, and in due course
the astonished Freddy discovered himself with permission to go to
blazes for seven days and a warrant to London in his pocket.</p>
<p>He capered whooping home to his villa, told Mrs. Freddy to pack
her toothbrush and come along, and the mail bore them hence. Next
day the weather broke, the sky turned upside down and emptied
itself upon us, the parade ground squelched if you trod on it, the
gutters failed to cope with the rush of business, and the roads ran
in spate.</p>
<p>The post-orderly, splashing back to barracks, reported the
disappearance of Oswald and Co.</p>
<p>We determined that they must have been washed out to sea and
pictured them astride the wigwam in a beam-roll off Kinsale,
keeping a watchful eye for U-boats.</p>
<p>We had seven days of unrelieved downpour. On the morning of the
eighth, Freddy and wife returned from leave, and, opening the front
door of the villa&mdash;which they discovered they had forgotten to
lock in the delirium of their departure&mdash;stepped within. At
the same moment, Oswald, the hairy dog and the woolly donkey heard
the call of the great spaces, and, opening the back door of the
villa, stepped without and departed for haunts unknown.</p>
<p>Freddy in a high state of excitement came over to the Mess and
told us all about it.</p>
<p>He himself had been all for slaying Oswald on the spot, he said,
but Mrs. Freddy wouldn't hear of it.</p>
<p>"She says he hasn't stolen anything," Freddy explained. "She
says he was only <i>staying</i> with us, in a manner of speaking,
and was quite right to take his poor old dog and donkey under cover
during that rotten weather, she says&mdash;so that's the end of
it."</p>
<p>But it wasn't the end of it; Freddy had reckoned without his
other O.C. Here was a heaven-sent opportunity of training the men
under practically Active Service conditions, scouring the country
after real game&mdash;Ho! toot the clarion, belt the drum! Boot and
saddle! Hark away!</p>
<p>So now we are out scouring the country for Oswald and Co., one
hundred men and horses, caparisoned like Christmas-trees, soaked to
the skin, fed to the teeth. And Oswald and Co.&mdash;where are
they? We cannot guess, and we are very very tired of practically
Active Service conditions.</p>
<p>Oyez, Oyez, Oyez! Anyone finding three children of the Open
answering to the description of our friends the enemy, and
returning them, dead or alive, to our little fortress, will he
handsomely and gratefully rewarded.</p>

<h2><i>L'AGENT PROVOCATEUR.</i></h2>
<p>A short while ago the following advertisement appeared in the
"Personal" column of <i>The Times</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Artist (33), literary, travelled, mentally isolated,
would appreciate brilliant, interesting correspondents; writers'
anonymity observed."</blockquote>
<p>Now thereby hang many tales (none of them necessarily true).
Here is one of them.</p>
<p>The Colonel of the Blank-blank Blankshires exclaimed (as all
proper Colonels are expected to do), "Ha!" Carefully marking with a
blue pencil a small paragraph on the front page of <i>The
Times</i>, he threw it on the table among the attentive Mess and
snorted.</p>
<p>"Ha! A Cuthbert&mdash;a genuine shirker! I think some of you
might oblige the gentleman."</p>
<p>Then he stepped outside and went into the seventh edition of his
impressionist sketch, "Farmyard of a French Farm," with lots of BBB
pencil for the manure heap. He was a young C.O. and new to the
regiment.</p>
<p>The Mess "carried on" the conversation.</p>
<p>"<i>I'll</i> write to the blighter," shouted the Junior Sub.
"I'll be an awf'lly 'interesting correspondent.'"</p>
<p>"And a brilliant one?" queried the Major.</p>
<p>"A Verey brilliant one, Sir," asserted the Sub., giving a
sample.</p>
<p>"This sort of slacker," said the Senior Captain bitterly, as
with infinite toil he scraped the last of the glaze from the inside
of the marmalade pot, "is the sort that doesn't realise that
there's a war on."</p>
<p>"Don't you make any mistake," said the Major, "<i>he</i> knows,
poor devil! I'm going to write to him and say, 'When I think of the
incessant strain of the trench warfare carried on with inadequate
support by you civilians of military age against the repeated
brutal attacks of tribunals, I marvel at the indomitable pluck you
display. In your place I should simply jack it up, plead ill-health
and get into the Army."</p>
<p>"I've got an idea," said the Junior Sub., joyously.</p>
<p>"Consolidate it quickly," said the Adjutant, "and prepare to
receive counter-attacks. Yes?"</p>
<p>"I've never yet been allowed to explain <i>my</i> side of that
confounded affair of the revetments. I'll tell it all to Cuthbert.
<i>He</i>'ll sympathise with me. I'll tell him all that the C.O.
said and all that I should have <i>liked</i> to say to the C.O. To
pour out one's troubles into a travelled literary bosom&mdash;what
a relief!"</p>
<p>"That's rather an idea," said the Senior Captain. "I nurse a
private grief of my own beneath a camouflage of&mdash;of
persiflage. I think I shall ask Cuthbert's opinion, as an artist,
of a brother artist who himself does perfectly unrecognisable
sketches of farm-yards"&mdash;he waved a golden-syrup spoon towards
the Colonel and the manure-heap&mdash;"and yet demands a finnicking
and altogether contemptible realism in the matter of trench maps.
Pass the honey, please."</p>
<p>"It seems to me," said the Major reflectively as he rose from
table, "that 'Artist, 33, literary, travelled, mentally isolated'
(one) is going to be buried beneath the weight of the world's
grievances&mdash;or the grievances of this battalion, at any
rate."</p>
<p>"It's the same thing," observed the Senior Captain gloomily.
"Isn't there any preserved ginger? Lord, what a Mess!"</p>
<p>Weary Williams, a time-expired <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page260" id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span> Second
Lieutenant&mdash;a ticket-of-leave man, as it were, without a
ticket-of-leave&mdash;who had once commanded the remnants of two
companies with honour but not with acknowledgment, poised a
fountain-pen, inquiring casually, "<i>What</i> was it the C.O. said
about the destruction of Ypres? Ah, yes" (and he began to write),
"<i>a Brobdingnagian act of brachycephalic brutality</i>...."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>At breakfast about a week later the Colonel seemed to be
enjoying his immense pile of correspondence so heartily that many
of the Mess, comparatively letterless as they were, directed
glances of injured interest towards him&mdash;of rather deeper
interest than was warranted by military discipline or civilian
breeding (which are, of course, the same virtue in different
forms).</p>
<p>Then, presently, as he put down one letter and opened another,
the Major was seen to stiffen and the Junior Sub. to wilt. The
attention of the table became as fixed and frigid as that of the
midnight sentry at a loophole. The Colonel toyed happily with
another letter (while the Senior Captain made a careful census of
the grounds at the bottom of his coffee-cup), took the range of the
manure-heap outside the window from the angles of the table-legs,
rose, and departed with his correspondence, summoning Williams to
follow him.</p>
<p>Outside the Weary One waited respectfully for the Colonel to
speak.</p>
<p>"So you saw through my camouflage?" said the latter
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
<p>"How did you do it?"</p>
<p>"Well, Sir, to mention only the internal evidence&mdash;an
'Artist'"&mdash;Williams waved his hand expressively towards the
manure-heap; "'thirty-three'&mdash;one of the youngest C.O.'s in
the Army, I believe?" He bowed politely.</p>
<p>"Ha!" said the Colonel.</p>
<p>"'Literary'&mdash;I remember your stopping Captain Jones's leave
for a split infinitive in a ration return. 'Travelled'&mdash;you
have travelled in Turkey, I think, Sir?"</p>
<p>The Colonel, who had been blown out of a trench at Krithia,
nodded shortly.</p>
<p>"'Mentally isolated'&mdash;I'm afraid, Sir, our Mess doesn't
afford very much for a mind like yours to bite on. I'm afraid, too,
that such correspondence as&mdash;as mine, for instance&mdash;can
hardly be called either brilliant or interesting."</p>
<p>"I don't know," said the Colonel. "That was a very good bit
about the destruction of Ypres. What was it?&mdash;Ha,
yes&mdash;<i>A Brobdingnagian act</i>&mdash;"</p>
<p>"&mdash;<i>of brachycephalic brutality</i>, Sir. But that was
not original."</p>
<p>"If you can't be original yourself," said the Colonel kindly,
"the next best thing is to quote from those who can."</p>
<p>"That's what I thought, Sir."</p>
<p>"Ha! Well, of course the writers' anonymity must be
observed&mdash;that's a point of honour. Still, I think,
Williams&mdash;I have been asked to recommend an intelligent
officer for a staff appointment&mdash;that if I were to name
<i>you</i> I should not go far wrong. And&mdash;er&mdash;if you are
ever asked for an opinion of the destruction of Ypres&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I shall remember to give the reference, Sir. Thank you,
Sir."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>
<p>Mr. STEPHEN McKENNA, with the blushing honours of <i>Sonia</i>
still fresh upon him, has now turned his pen to a tale of farcical
adventure, the result being <i>Ninety-Six Hours' Leave</i>
(METHUEN), and I could find it in my heart to regret it. Because,
to speak frankly, the present volume will do little to add to the
reputation so deservedly won by the other. It is a tangle of
complications, which, since they have nothing solid to rest upon,
begin by baffling, and end by boring, the reader who strives to
keep pace with them. A young officer, wishful to dine at a smart
hotel and having no appropriate clothes, is struck with the idea of
pretending to be a foreign royalty, and thus incapable of sartorial
indiscretion. And, as all sorts of assassins and undesirable aliens
happened to be waiting about to kill the man whose style he
borrowed, you can make a fair guess at the subsequent action. There
is much dialogue, most of it sparkling, though even here I have to
report criticism from a young friend to whom I introduced the
story. He said, "People don't talk like that really." Which happens
to be undeniably true. Thus, while giving Mr. McKENNA credit for an
active invention and some really writty turns of phrase, I fear I
must repeat my warning that as a <i>farceur</i> he is below his
best form.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The clever lady who elects to call herself "RICHARD DEHAN" has
already secured a deserved reputation as a writer of short stories.
Her new book, <i>Under the Hermes</i> (HEINEMANN), gives us a
further selection of tales of various lengths, from one that is not
quite a novel to others that are as brief as ten pages. The themes
and settings are equally varied; but all&mdash;or almost
all&mdash;show the writer at her best in the vigorous, swift and
exciting development of some dramatic situation. The exception, I
may say at once, is the title-tale, to my mind a stilted
and&mdash;in a double sense&mdash;obviously "studio piece," quite
unworthy of its position at the opening of so attractive a volume,
where indeed it might easily discourage a questing reader. "Mr.
DEHAN" is far more fairly represented by such brilliant little
miniatures of historical romance as (to select three at random) "A
Speaking Likeness," "A Game of Faro" and "The Vengeance of the
Cherry Stone"&mdash;slight sketches ranging from France of the
Revolution to medi&aelig;val Bologna, but each most effective in
its vivid colouring and well-handled climax. Since one of these has
lingered for many years in my recollection from some else-forgotten
magazine, I suspect that most of the tales in the volume may be
making a second appearance. If so, it is in every way deserved.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Trench Pictures from France</i> (MELROSE) is by the late
Major WILLIAM REDMOND, M.P., and <i>The Ways of War</i> (CONSTABLE)
is by the late Professor T.M. KETTLE, M.P. Both these books are
memorials raised to their authors by the pious zeal of relations
and friends who thought it shame that so much nobility of purpose
and generous ardour should go unrecorded in a tribute more
permanent than the fleeting memories of contemporary survivors.
Both WILLIE REDMOND and TOM KETTLE were Irishmen and members of the
Nationalist Party and were to that extent foes of the British
Government; yet, when they were <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page262" id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span> compelled to look the
Prussian menace in the face, neither the older man nor the younger
hesitated for a moment. Each, though there were many reasons that
might have pleaded against such a course, "joined up" in an Irish
regiment, each in due time went to France and each made the supreme
sacrifice, falling with his face to the foe. Neither doubted for a
moment that he was serving the cause of Ireland in fighting against
Prussianism and all that it implies. Their enthusiastic approval of
the justice of our cause should be to us a great assurance. I knew
them both and can say with the most complete sincerity that I never
knew two men better loved by all who had to do with them or more
worthy of this universal affection. It is in every way right that
they should be commemorated for future generations. WILLIE
REDMOND'S book consists of a series of sketches of the War
contributed by him to <i>The Daily Chronicle</i>. They are written
with great charm and, even in the gloomiest surroundings, reflect
the sunny nature of the man. There is a most appreciative
biographical memoir by E.M. SMITH-DAMPIER, and in an appendix will
be found the memorable and splendid speech delivered by WILLIE
REDMOND in the House of Commons on March 7th of this year&mdash;a
true salutation in view of death. KETTLE'S book is in the main a
reprint of articles that reveal a brilliant and versatile mind.
Mrs. KETTLE contributes a very interesting and sympathetic account
of her gallant husband's life. It would have been impossible for
such a man not to have hated the German tyranny.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. Stacy Aumonier takes for his theme the development of a
clever neurotic, <i>Arthur Gaffyn</i>, who stands, in relation to
normal life and normal feelings, <i>Just Outside</i>
(METHUEN)&mdash;a common modern type, perhaps a commoner type in
all ages than the obvious records show. The author handles with
real subtlety the phases of Arthur's marriage with a woman much
older than himself, a marriage in which the hunger of the woman for
love was a greater factor than the not deeply stirred passion of
the man. Then, with the appearance of the destined mate, beauty and
youth and desire carry the day against duty, but neither callously
nor flippantly. The insight and sympathy displayed in the analysis
of motive are remarkable. The author has a real gift for
portraiture. In particular he touches in his minor folk with
extraordinarily deft defining lines. Perhaps in general there is a
little hesitancy in craftsmanship, a slight quavering between the
fashionable modern realism and an older romanticism. But the
seriousness of his artistic intention, the solidity of his work
(which is by no means to say stodginess, quite the contrary) will
commend Mr. AUMONIER to all who care to listen to people who have
the one thing necessary, something to say; and the other thing
desirable, a pleasant way of saying it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In its quiet unobtrusive way <i>When Michael Came to Town</i>
(HUTCHINSON) is a most excellent specimen of Madame ALBANESI's art.
No sound of war is to be heard in it, and when I think how
completely some of our novelists have failed when trying to deal
with contemporary events I cannot be too thankful that this novel
is laid in a period before the Germans became an uncivilised
nation. <i>Olive</i>, the heroine, a delightful girl, is the
supposititious child of <i>Sir James Wenborough</i>, whose wife, in
his absence and without his knowledge, secured her as a substitute
for their own child, who died at its birth. The secret is disclosed
by an unscrupulous minx, who uses the knowledge she has obtained to
push her way into the <i>Wenborough</i> household. Men are not
Madame ALBANESI'S strongest points, but in <i>Roderick Guye</i> and
<i>Michael Wenborough</i> we have well-contrasted characters, and
the worst that can be said of them is that they belong to rather
stock types. Altogether a book which many people will describe as
"perfectly sweet;" but, because of its sympathetic qualities and
sound workmanship, it deserves a more distinctive label.</p>

snatches the beautiful mannequin from between the very jaws of an
omnibus, we realise that we are in the presence of Romance in its
purest form. A spin in the Park and a cosy dinner in a Soho
restaurant are quite sufficient to convince hero and heroine that
they are each other's own. Some novelists would let it go at that,
but not Mr. ARTHUR APPLIN, who has only got to chapter II, and
wishes to give us value for our money. What's to come is, as
SHAKSPEARE says, still unsure, but apparently the heroine, who has
gone to break the happy news to a poor but respectable aunt in
Devonshire, is met at the country station by a chauffeur, who calls
her "Lady Alice" and waves her towards a large Limousine. She knows
she isn't Lady Alice and has no car to meet her, but she hops in
nevertheless. She doesn't know where she is going, but she is on
her way. There is a smash, and when the heroine comes to she is
being called Lady Alice in an ancestral castle. Everything has been
obliterated from her memory, including her own identity and that of
the hero, and the author can now make a fresh start. If you wish to
know how it all ends you must get <i>The Woman Who Was Not</i>
(WARD, LOCK), but there is no compelling reason why you should.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
