<h2><a name="section2">Editor's Preface</a></h2>
<br>
If there be any among my Readers who, having turned over the pages of
"<b>Enquire Within</b>," have hastily pronounced them to be confused and
ill-arranged, let them at once refer to <a href="EWIndex.html">The Index</a>, at page 389, and for ever hold their peace.<br>
<br>
The <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a> is, to the vast congregation of useful hints and receipts that
fill the pages of this volume, what the <b>Directory</b> is to the great
aggregation of houses and people in London.<br>
<br>
No one, being a stranger to London, would run about asking for "<b>Mr.
Smith</b>." But, remembering the Christian name and the profession of the
individual wanted, he would turn to the <b>Directory</b>, and trace him out.<br>
<br>
Like a house, every paragraph in "<b>Enquire Within</b>" has its number,&mdash;and
the <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a> is the <b>Directory</b> which will explain what Facts, Hints, and
Instructions <i>inhabit</i> that number.<br>
<br>
For, if it be not a misnomer, we are prompted to say that "<b>Enquire
Within</b>" is <i>peopled</i> with hundreds of ladies and gentlemen, who
have approved of the plan of the work, and contributed something to its
store of useful information. There they are, waiting to be questioned,
and ready to reply. Within each page some one lives to answer for the
correctness of the information imparted, just as certainly as where, in
the window of a dwelling, you see a paper directing you to "<b>Enquire
Within</b>," some one is there to answer you.<br>
<br>
<b>Housekeepers</b> of experience live at Nos. <a href="#p1">1</a>, <a href="#p30">30</a>, <a href="#p438">438</a>, <a href="EWpart3.html#p1251">1251</a> and <a href="EWpart3.html#p2091">2091</a>; old

<br>
Well! there they live&mdash;always at home. Knock at their doors&mdash;<b>Enquire
Within. No Fees to Pay</b>!!<br>
<br>
Much care has been taken in selecting the information that is given,
and, as is amply shown by the above list, so many kind and competent
friends have lent a hand in the production of this volume that is
impossible to turn to any page without at once being reminded of the
<b>Generous Friend</b> who abides there.<br>
<br>
To some extent, though in a far less degree, assistance has been
rendered by the authors of many useful and popular works, for which due
acknowledgment must be made. Chief among these works are Dr. Kitchiner's
"<b>Cooks' Oracle</b>"; "<b>The Cook</b>," in <i>Houlston and Sons' Industrial
Library</i>; "<b>The Shopkeeper's Guide</b>;" "<b>The Wife's Own Cookery</b>," "<b>The
Practical Housewife</b>," and many of the volumes of the "<b>Reason Why</b>"
series.<br>
<br>
Lastly, as in everyday life it is found necessary at times to make a
thorough inspection of house and home, and to carry out requisite
repairs, alterations, and additions, this has been done in the recent
editions of "<b>Enquire Within</b>," to which some hundreds of paragraphs have
been added, while others have been remodelled and revised in accordance
with the progress of the times in which we live. Care, however, has been
taken to alter nothing that needed no alteration, so that, practically,
this Popular Favourite is still the <i>old</i> "<b>Enquire Within</b>;"
improved, it is true, but in no way so changed as to place it beyond the
recognition of those to whom it has been a <b>Book Of Constant Reference</b>
since its first appearance.<br>

<h2><a name="section3">Publisher's Preface</a></h2>
<br>
<i><b>to the Seventy-Fifth Edition</b></i><br>
<br>
The unparalleled success achieved by "<b>Enquire Within Upon Everything</b>"
demands special mention from its Publishers at the present moment. Its
prominent characteristics&mdash;varied usefulness and cheapness&mdash;have won for
it universal esteem. There is scarcely a spot reached by English
civilization to which this book has not found its way, receiving
everywhere the most cordial welcome and winning the warmest praise.
Proof of this world-wide popularity is clearly shown by the record of
the number of copies sold, now amounting to the wonderful total of<br>
<br>
<b>One Million Copies</b><br>
<br>
&mdash;a sale which the Publishers believe to be <i>absolutely without
precedent</i> among similar books of reference. This result has been
mainly brought about by the kindly interest shown in the book by many
friends, to whom the Publishers' most hearty thanks are tendered for
their generous support and recommendations.<br>
<br>
The work of revision has been carried on from year to year with
watchfulness and care, and many Additions have been made, both modern
and interesting, including Hom&oelig;opathy, Lawn Tennis, &amp;c Enquirers on
the laws of Landlord and Tenant, Husband and Wife, Debtor and Creditor,
are supplied with the latest information. Diseases and their Remedies,
and Medicines, their Uses and Doses, have received special attention.
The Index has been considerably extended, and with the aid of this, and
the Summary of Contents, it is hoped that no Enquirer will fail to
receive complete and satisfactory replies.<br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>

<b>The "Enquire Within" and "Reason Why" Series</b> now comprises Twenty-seven
Volumes, containing upwards of <b>Seven Thousand</b> pages of closely printed
matter. They are entirely original in plan, and executed with the most
conscientious care. The Indexes have been prepared with great labour,
and alone occupy about 500 pages. A vast Fund of valuable Information,
embracing every Subject of Interest or Utility, is thus attainable, and
at a merely nominal Cost.<br>
<br>
These Works are in such general demand, that the Sale has already
reached considerably upwards of<br>
<br>
<b>One-and-a-Half Million Volumes</b>.<br>
<br>
The attention of all parties interested in the dissemination of sound
Theoretical Instruction and Practical Knowledge is particularly directed
to the Twenty-seven Volumes in this Series of Popular and Valuable Books.<br>

<a name="p1"></a><b><i>1. &nbsp;Choice of Articles of Food</i></b><br>
<br>
Nothing is more important in the affairs of housekeeping than the choice
of wholesome food. Apropos to this is an amusing conundrum which is as
follows:&mdash;"A man went to market and bought <i>two</i> fish. When he
reached home he found they were the same as when he had bought them; yet
there were <i>three!</i> How was this?" The answer is&mdash;"He bought two
mackerel, and one <i>smelt!</i>" Those who envy him his bargain need not
care about the following rules; but to others they will be valuable:
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br>

<a name="p2"></a><b><i>2. &nbsp;Mackerel</i></b><br>
<br>
must be perfectly fresh, or it is a very indifferent fish; it will
neither bear carriage, nor being kept many hours out of the water. The
firmness of the flesh and the clearness of the eyes must be the criteria
of fresh mackerel, as they are of all other fish.
<br>

<a name="p3"></a><b><i>3. &nbsp;Turbot, and all flat white fish</i></b><br>
<br>
  are rigid and firm when fresh; the under side should be of a rich
  cream colour. When out of season, or too long kept, this becomes a
  bluish white, and the flesh soft and flaccid. A clear bright eye in
  any fish is also a mark of its being fresh and good.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br>

<a name="p4"></a><b><i>4. &nbsp;Cod</i></b><br>
<br>
  is known to be fresh by the rigidity of the muscles (or flesh), the
  redness of the gills, and clearness of the eyes. Crimping much
  improves this fish.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br>

<a name="p5"></a><b><i>5. &nbsp;Salmon</i></b><br>
<br>
  The flavour and excellence of this fish depend upon its freshness and
  the shortness of time since it was caught; for no method can
  completely preserve the delicate flavour that salmon has when just
  taken out of the water. A great deal of what is brought to London has
  been packed in ice, and comes from the Scotch and Irish rivers, and,
  though perfectly fresh, is not quite equal to salmon from English
  streams.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br>

<a name="p6"></a><b><i>6. &nbsp;Herrings</i></b><br>
<br>
  should be eaten when very fresh; and, like mackerel, will not remain
  good many hours after they are caught. But they are excellent,
  especially for breakfast relishes, either salted, split, dried, and
  peppered, or pickled. Mackerel are very good when prepared in either
  of these ways.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br>

<a name="p7"></a><b><i>7. &nbsp;Fresh-Water Fish</i></b><br>
<br>
  The remarks as to firmness and clear fresh eyes apply to this variety
  of fish, of which there are carp, tench, pike, perch, &amp;c
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br>

<a name="p8"></a><b><i>8. &nbsp;Lobsters</i></b><br>
<br>
  recently caught, have always some remains of muscular action in the
  claws, which may be excited by pressing the eyes with the finger; when
  this cannot be produced, the lobster must have been too long kept.
  When boiled, the tail preserves its elasticity if fresh, but loses it
  as soon as it becomes stale. The heaviest lobsters are the best; when
  light they are watery and poor. Hen lobsters may generally be known by
  the spawn, or by the breadth of the "flap."

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br>

<a name="p9"></a><b><i>9. &nbsp;Crab and Crayfish</i></b><br>
<br>
  must be chosen by observations similar to those given above in the
  choice of lobsters. Crabs have an agreeable smell when fresh.

<a name="p10"></a><b><i>10. &nbsp;Prawns and Shrimps</i></b><br>
<br>
when fresh, are firm and crisp.

<a name="p11"></a><b><i>11. &nbsp;Oysters</i></b><br>
<br>
  If fresh, the shell is firmly closed; when the shells of oysters are
  open, they are dead, and unfit for food. The small-shelled oysters,
  the Byfleet, Colchester, and Milford, are the finest in flavour.
  Larger kinds, as the Torbay oysters, are generally considered only fit
  for stewing and sauces, and as an addition to rump-steak puddings and
  pies, though some persons prefer them to the smaller oysters, even
  when not cooked. Of late years English oysters have become scarce and
  dear; and in consequence the American Blue Point oysters find a ready
  market.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br>

<a name="p12"></a><b><i>12. &nbsp;Beef</i></b><br>
<br>
  The grain of ox beef, when good, is loose, the meat red, and the fat
  inclining to yellow. Cow beef, on the contrary, has a closer grain and
  whiter fat, but the meat is scarcely as red as that of ox beef.
  Inferior beef, which is meat obtained from ill-fed animals, or from
  those which had become too old for food, may be known by a hard,
  skinny fat, a dark red lean, and, in old animals, a line of horny
  texture running through the meat of the ribs. When meat rises up
  quickly, after being pressed by the finger, it may be considered as
  being the flesh of an animal which was in its prime; but when the dent
  made by pressure returns slowly, or remains visible, the animal had
  probably passed its prime, and the meat consequently must be of
  inferior quality.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p13"></a><b><i>13. &nbsp;Veal</i></b><br>
<br>
  should be delicately white, though it is often juicy and
  well-flavoured when rather dark in colour. Butchers, it is said, bleed
  calves purposely before killing them, with a view to make the flesh
  white, but this also makes it dry and flavourless. On examining the
  loin, if the fat enveloping the kidney be white and firm-looking, the
  meat will probably be prime and recently killed. Veal will not keep so
  long as an older meat, especially in hot or damp weather: when going,
  the fat becomes soft and moist, the meat flabby and spotted, and
  somewhat porous like sponge. Large, overgrown veal is inferior to
  small, delicate, yet fat veal. The fillet of a cow-calf is known by
  the udder attached to it, and by the softness of the skin; it is
  preferable to the veal of a bull-calf.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p14"></a><b><i>14. &nbsp;Mutton</i></b><br>
<br>
The meat should be firm and close in grain, and red in colour, the fat
  white and firm. Mutton is in its prime when the sheep is about five
  years old, though it is often killed much younger. If too young, the
  flesh feels tender when pinched; if too old, on being pinched it
  wrinkles up, and so remains. In young mutton, the fat readily
  separates; in old, it is held together by strings of skin. In sheep
  diseased of the rot, the flesh is very pale-coloured, the fat
  inclining to yellow; the meat appears loose from the bone, and, if
  squeezed, drops of water ooze out from the grains; after cooking, the
  meat drops clean away from the bones. Wether mutton is preferred to
  that of the ewe; it may be known by the lump of fat on the inside of
  the thigh.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p15"></a><b><i>15. &nbsp;Lamb</i></b><br>
<br>
  This meat will not keep long after it is killed. The large vein in the
  neck is bluish in colour when the fore quarter is fresh, green when it
  is becoming stale. In the hind quarter, if not recently killed, the
  fat of the kidney will have a slight smell, and the knuckle will have
  lost its firmness.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p16"></a><b><i>16. &nbsp;Pork</i></b><br>
<br>
  When good, the rind is thin, smooth, and cool to the touch; when
  changing, from being too long killed, it becomes flaccid and clammy.
  Enlarged glands, called kernels, in the fat, are marks of an ill-fed
  or diseased pig.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p17"></a><b><i>17. &nbsp;Bacon</i></b><br>
<br>
  should have a thin rind, and the fat should be firm, and tinged red by
  the curing; the flesh should be of a clear red, without intermixture
  of yellow, and it should firmly adhere to the bone. To judge the state
  of a <b><i>ham</i></b>, plunge a knife into it to the bone; on drawing it back, if
  particles of meat adhere to it, or if the smell is disagreeable, the
  curing has not been effectual, and the ham is not good; it should, in
  such a state, be immediately cooked. In buying a ham, a short thick
  one is to be preferred to one long and thin. Of English hams,
  Yorkshire, Westmoreland, and Hampshire are most esteemed; of foreign,
  the Westphalian. The bacon and "sugar cured" hams now imported in
  large quantities from Canada and the United States are both cheap and
  good.

<a name="p18"></a><b><i>18. &nbsp;Venison</i></b><br>
<br>
  When good, the fat is clear, bright, and of considerable thickness. To
  know when it is necessary to cook it, a knife must be plunged into the
  haunch; and from the smell the cook must determine whether to dress it
  at once, or to keep it a little longer.

<a name="p19"></a><b><i>19. &nbsp;Turkey</i></b><br>
<br>
  In choosing poultry, the age of the bird is the chief point to be
  attended to. An old turkey has rough and reddish legs; a young one
  smooth and black. Fresh killed, the eyes are full and clear, and the
  feet moist.  When it has been kept too long, the parts about the vent
  have a greenish appearance.

<a name="p20"></a><b><i>20. &nbsp;Common Domestic Fowls</i></b><br>
<br>
  when young, have the legs and combs smooth; when old these parts are
  rough, and on the breast long hairs are found when the feathers axe
  plucked off: these hairs must be removed by singeing. Fowls and
  chickens should be plump on the breast, fat on the back, and
  white-legged.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p21"></a><b><i>21. &nbsp;Geese</i></b><br>
<br>
  The bills and feet are red when old, yellow when young. Fresh killed,
  the feet are pliable, but they get stiff when the birds are kept too
  long. Geese are called green when they are only two or three months
  old.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p22"></a><b><i>22. &nbsp;Ducks</i></b><br>
<br>
  Choose them with supple feet and hard plump breasts. Tame ducks have
  yellow feet, wild ones red.

<a name="p23"></a><b><i>23. &nbsp;Pigeons</i></b><br>
<br>
  are very indifferent food when they are kept too long. Suppleness of
  the feet shows them to be young; the flesh is flaccid when they are
  getting bad from keeping. Tame pigeons are larger than wild pigeons,
  but not so large as the wood pigeon.

<a name="p24"></a><b><i>24. &nbsp;Hares and Rabbits</i></b><br>
<br>
  when old, have the haunches thick, the ears dry and tough, and the
  claws blunt and ragged. A young hare has claws smooth and sharp, ears
  that easily tear, and a narrow cleft in the lip. A leveret is
  distinguished from a hare by a knob or small bone near the foot.

<br>
  when young, have yellowish legs and dark-coloured bills. Old
  partridges are very indifferent eating.

<a name="p26"></a><b><i>26. &nbsp;Woodcocks and Snipes</i></b><br>
<br>
  when old, have the feet thick and hard; when these are soft and
  tender, they are both young and fresh killed. When their bills become
  moist, and their throats muddy, they have been too long killed.<br>

<i><a name="p28vii"></a><b>vii.&nbsp; Scottish mode of division.</b></i><br>
<br>
According to the English method the carcase of beef is disposed of more
economically than upon the Scotch plan. The English plan affords better
steaks, and better joints for roasting; but the Scotch plan gives a
greater variety of pieces for boiling. The names of pieces in the Scotch
plan, not found in the English, are:<br>
<br>
<table summary="scottish" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td>the hough</td>
	<td>or hind leg</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td>the nineholes</td>
	<td>or English buttock</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td>the large and small runner</td>
	<td>taken from the rib and chuck pieces of the English plan</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td>the shoulder-lyer</td>
	<td>the English shoulder, but cut differently</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td>the spare-rib or fore-sye</td>
	<td>the sticking piece, &amp;c</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<br>
The Scotch also cut mutton differently.<br>
<br>

<br>
<i><a name="p28viii"></a><b>viii. &nbsp; Ox-tail</b></i><br>
<br>
is much esteemed for purposes of soup; so also is the Cheek. The
  Tongue is highly esteemed. The Heart, stuffed with veal stuffing,
  roasted, and served hot, with red currant jelly as an accompaniment,
  is a palatable dish. When prepared in this manner it is sometimes
  called <i>Smithfield Hare</i>, on account of its flavour being
  something like that of roast hare.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i><a name="p28ix"></a><b>ix.&nbsp; Calves' Heads</b></i><br>
<br>
  are very useful for various dishes; so also are their Knuckles, Feet,
  Heart, &amp;c

<a name="p29"></a><b><i>29. &nbsp;Relative Economy of the Joints</i></b><br>
<br>
<a name="p29i"></a><i><b>i. &nbsp; The Round</b></i><br>
<br>
  is, in large families, one of the most profitable parts owing to its
  comparative freedom from bone: it is usually boiled, and is generally
  sold at the same price as the sirloin, and ribs. It is sometimes
  divided downwards, close to the bone; one side being known as the
  <i>top side</i>, and the other as the <i>silver side</i>. Either of
  these parts is as good roasted as boiled.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="p29ii"></a><i><b>ii. &nbsp; The Brisket</b></i><br>
<br>
  is always less in price than the roasting parts. It is not so
  economical a part as the round, having more bone with it, and more
  fat. Where there are children, very fat joints are not desirable,
  being often disagreeable to them, and sometimes prejudicial,
  especially if they have a dislike to fat. This joint also requires
  more cooking than many others; that is to say, it requires a double
  allowance of time to be given for simmering it; it will, when served,
  be hard and scarcely digestible if no more time be allowed to simmer
  it than that which is sufficient for other joints and meats. Joints
  cooked in a boiler or saucepan, should always be <i>simmered</i>, that
  is to say, boiled as slowly as possible. Meat boiled fast, or "at a
  gallop," as the phrase goes, is always tough and tasteless. The
  brisket is excellent when stewed; and when cooked fresh (i.e.,
  unsalted) an excellent stock for soup may be extracted from it, and
  yet the meat will serve as well for dinner.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="p29iii"></a><i><b>iii. &nbsp;  The Edge-bone, or Aitch-bone</b></i><br>
<br>
  is not considered to be a very economical joint, the bone being large
  in proportion to the meat; but the greater part of it, at least, is as
  good as that of any prime part. On account of the quantity of bone in
  it, it is sold at a cheaper rate than the best joints. It may be
  roasted or boiled.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="p29iv"></a><i><b>iv. &nbsp; The Rump</b></i><br>
<br>
  is the part of which the butcher makes great profit, by selling it in
  the form of steaks, but the whole of it may be purchased as a joint,
  and at the price of other prime parts. It may be turned to good
  account in producing many excellent dishes. If salted, it is simply
  boiled; if used unsalted, it is generally stewed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="p29v"></a><i><b>v. &nbsp; The Veiny Piece</b></i><br>
<br>
  is sold at a moderate price per pound; but, if hung for a day or two,
  it is very good and very profitable. Where there are a number of
  servants and children to have an early dinner, this part of beef will
  be found desirable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="p29vi"></a><i><b>vi. &nbsp; The Leg and Shin</b></i><br>
<br>
  afford excellent stock for soup; and, if not reduced too much, the
  meat taken from the bones may be served as a stew with vegetables; or
  it may be seasoned, pounded with butter, and potted; or, chopped very
  fine, and seasoned with herbs, and bound together by egg and bread
  crumbs, it may be fried in balls, or in the form of large eggs, and
  served with a gravy made with a few spoonfuls of the soup.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="p29vii"></a><i><b>vii. &nbsp; Ox-cheek</b></i><br>
<br>
  makes excellent soup. The meat, when taken from the bones, may be
  served as a stew.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="p29viii"></a><i><b>viii. &nbsp; The Sirloin and the Ribs</b></i><br>
<br>
  are the roasting parts of beef, and these bear in all places the
  highest price. The more profitable of these two joints at a family
  table is the ribs. The bones, if removed from the beef before it is
  roasted, are useful in making stock for soup. When boned, the meat of
  the ribs is often rolled up on the shape of a small round or fillet,
  tied with string, and roasted; and this is the best way of using it,
  as it enables the carver to distribute equally the upper part of the
  meat with the fatter parts, at the lower end of the bones.

These herbs always at hand will be a great aid to the cook. Herbs should
be gathered on a dry day; they should be immediately well cleansed, and
dried by the heat of a stove or Dutch oven. The leaves should then be
picked off, pounded and sifted, put into stoppered bottles, labelled,
and put away for use. Those who are unable or may not care to take the
trouble to dry herbs, can obtain them prepared for use in bottles at the
green-grocer's.

<a name="p44"></a><b><i>44. &nbsp;Dr. Kitchiner's Rules for Marketing</i></b><br>
<br>
  The best rule for marketing is to pay ready money for everything,
  <i>and to deal with the most respectable tradesmen</i> in your
  neighbourhood. If you leave it to their integrity to supply you with a
  good article at the fair market price, you will be supplied with
  better provisions, and at as reasonable a rate as those
  bargain-hunters who trot "<i>around, around, around about</i>" a
  market till they are trapped to buy some <i>unchewable</i> old
  poultry, <i>tough</i> tup-mutton, <i>stringy</i> cow-beef, or
  <i>stale</i> fish, at a very little less than the price of prime and
  proper food. With <i>savings</i> like these they toddle home in
  triumph, cackling all the way, like a goose that has got ankle-deep
  into good luck. All the skill of the most accomplished cook will avail
  nothing unless she is furnished with prime provisions. The best way to
  procure these is to deal with shops of established character: you may
  appear to pay, perhaps, ten <i>per cent.</i> more than you would were
  you to deal with those who pretend to sell cheap, but you would be
  much more than in that proportion better served. <br>
<br>
Every trade has its
  tricks and deceptions; those who follow them can deceive you if they
  please, and they are too apt to do so if you provoke the exercise of
  their over-reaching talent. Challenge them to a game at "<i>Catch who
  can</i>," by entirely relying on your own judgment, and you will soon
  find nothing but very long experience can make you equal to the combat
  of marketing to the utmost advantage. If you think a tradesman has
  imposed upon you, never use a second word, if the first will not do,
  nor drop the least hint of an imposition; the only method to induce
  him to make an abatement is the hope of future favours; pay the
  demand, and deal with the gentleman no more; but do not let him see
  that you are displeased, or as soon as you are out of sight your
  reputation will suffer as much as your pocket has. Before you go to
  market, look over your larder, and consider well what things are
  wanting&mdash;especially on a Saturday. No well-regulated family can suffer
  a disorderly caterer to be jumping in and out to make purchases on a
  Sunday morning. You will be enabled to manage much better if you will
  make out a bill of fare for the week on the Saturday before; for
  example, for a family of half a dozen:<br>
<br>
<table summary="weekly menu" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><i>Sunday</i></td>
	<td>Roast beef and pudding.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><i>Monday</i></td>
	<td>Fowl, what was left of pudding fried, or warmed in the Dutch oven.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><i>Tuesday</i></td>
	<td>Calf's head, apple pie.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><i>Wednesday</i></td>
	<td>Leg of mutton.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><i>Thursday</i></td>
	<td>Ditto broiled or hashed, and pancakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><i>Friday</i></td>
	<td>Fish, pudding.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
	<td><i>Saturday</i></td>
	<td>Fish, or eggs and bacon.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<br>
It is an excellent plan to have certain things on certain days. When
  your butcher or poulterer knows what you will want, he has a better
  chance of doing his best for you; and never think of ordering beef for
  roasting except for Sunday. When you order meat, poultry, or fish,
  tell the tradesman when you intend to dress it: he will then have it
  in his power to serve you with provision that will do him credit,
  which the finest meat, &amp;c, in the world will never do, unless it has
  been kept a proper time to be ripe and tender.<br>

<a name="p45"></a><b><i>45. &nbsp;The Family Circle</i></b><br>
<br>
  Under this title a group of acquaintances in London once instituted
  and carried out a series of friendly parties. The following form of
  invitation, and the rules of the "Family Circle," will be found
  interesting, probably useful:<br><br>

<hr width="25%" align="left">

    <blockquote><i>Will you do me the favour of meeting here, as a guest, on &mdash;&mdash;
    next, at seven precisely, a few friends who have kindly joined in an
    attempt to commence occasional pleasant and social parties, of which
    the spirit and intent will be better understood by the perusal of
    the few annexed remarks and rules from<br>
<br>
    Yours sincerely, &mdash;&mdash;</i>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>

    "They manage it better in France," is a remark to be often applied
    with reference to social life in England, and the writer fancies
    that the prevalence here of a few bad customs, easily changed,
    causes the disadvantageous difference between ourselves and our more
    courteous and agreeable neighbours.
<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    Worldly appearance; the phantom leading many to suppose that
    wealth is the standard of worth&mdash;in the minds of friends, a notion
    equally degrading to both parties.</li></ol>
<ol start=2 type="i"><li>
    Overdress; causing unnecessary expense and waste of time.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Expensive entertainments, as regards refreshments.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Late hours.</li></ol>

    The following brief rules are suggested, in a hope to show the way
    to a more constant, easy, and friendly intercourse amongst friends,
    the writer feeling convinced that society is equally beneficial and
    requisite&mdash;in fact, that mankind in seclusion, like the sword in the
    scabbard, often loses polish, and gradually rusts.<br>

<ol start=1 type="I">
    <li>That meetings be held in rotation at each member's house,
    for the enjoyment of conversation; music, grave and gay; dancing,
    gay only; and card-playing at limited stakes.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="I">

    <li>That such meetings commence at seven and end about or after
    twelve, and that members and guests be requested to remember that
    punctuality has been called the politeness of kings.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="I">

    <li>That as gentlemen are allowed for the whole season to
    appear, like the raven, in one suit, ladies are to have the like
    privilege; and that no lady be allowed to quiz or notice the habits
    of another lady; and that demi-toilette in dress be considered the
    better taste in the family circle; not that the writer wishes to
    raise or lower the proper standard of ladies' dress, which ought to
    be neither too high nor too low, but at a happy medium.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="I">

    <li> That any lady infringing the last rule be liable to reproof
    by the oldest lady present at the meeting, if the oldest lady, like
    the oldest inhabitant, can be discovered.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="I">

   <li>That every member or guest, be requested to bring with them
    their own vocal, instrumental, or dance music, and take it away with
    them, if possible, to avoid loss and confusion.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="I">

    <li>That no member or guest, able to sing, play, or dance,
    refuse, unless excused by medical certificate; and that no cold or
    sore throat be allowed to last more than a week.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="I">

    <li> That as every member or guest known to be able to sing,
    play, or dance, is bound to do so if requested, the performer
    (especially if timid) is to be kindly criticized and encouraged; it
    being a fact well known, that the greatest masters of an art are
    always the most lenient critics, from their deep knowledge of the
    feeling, intelligence, and perseverance required to at all approach
    perfection.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="I">

    <li>That gentlemen present do pay every attention to ladies,
    especially visitors; but such attention is to be general, and not
    particular&mdash;for instance, no gentleman is to dance more than three
    times with one lady during the evening, except in the case of
    lovers, privileged to do odd things during their temporary lunacy,
    and also married couples, who are expected to dance together at
    least once during the evening, and oftener if they please.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="I">

   <li>That to avoid unnecessary expense, the refreshments be
    limited to cold meat, sandwiches, bread, cheese, butter, vegetables,
    fruits, tea, coffee, negus, punch, malt liquors, &amp;c, &amp;c</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="I">

   <li>That all personal or face-to-face laudatory speeches
    (commonly called toasts, or, as may be, roasts) be for the future
    forbidden, without permission or inquiry, for reasons
    following:&mdash;That as the family circle includes bachelors and
    spinsters, and he, she, or they may be secretly engaged, it will be
    therefore cruel to excite hopes that may be disappointed; and that
    as some well-informed Benedick of long experience may after supper
    advise the bachelor to find the way to woman's heart&mdash;<i>vice
    versa</i>, some deep-feeling wife or widow, by "pity moven," may,
    perhaps, after supper advise the spinster the other way, which, in
    public, is an impropriety manifestly to be avoided.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="I">

  <li> (<i>suggested by a lady</i>). That any lady, after supper,
    may (if she please) ask any gentleman apparently diffident, or
    requiring encouragement, to dance with her, and that no gentleman
    can of course refuse so kind a request.</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="I">

    <li>That no gentleman be expected to escort any lady home on
    foot beyond a distance of three miles, unless the gentleman be
    positive and the lady agreeable.</li>
</ol>
    <b>Rule the Last:</b> &nbsp;That as the foregoing remarks and rules are intended,
    in perfect good faith and spirit, to be considered general and not
    personal, no umbrage is to be taken, and the reader is to bear in
    mind the common and homely saying,&mdash;

<blockquote>"Always at trifles scorn to take offence,<br>
      It shows great pride and very little sense."</blockquote>

    P.S.&mdash;To save trouble to both parties, this invitation be deemed
    accepted, without the necessity to reply, unless refused within
    twenty-four hours.</blockquote>

<a name="p46"></a><b><i>46. &nbsp;Evening Pastimes</i></b><br>
<br>
  Among the innocent recreations of the fireside, there are few more
  commendable and practicable than those afforded by what are severally
  termed Anagrams, Arithmorems, Single and Double Acrostics, Buried
  Cities, &amp;c, Charades, Conundrums, Cryptographs, Enigmas, Logogriphs,
  Puzzles, Rebuses, Riddles, Transpositions, &amp;c Of these there are such
  a variety, that they are suited to every capacity; and they present
  this additional attraction, that ingenuity may be exercised in the
  <i>invention</i> of them, as well as in their solution. Many persons
  who have become noted for their literary compositions may date the
  origin of their success to the time when they attempted the
  composition of a trifling enigma or charade.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p47"></a><b><i>47. &nbsp;Acrostics</i></b><br>
<br>
  The acrostic is a short poem in which the first letters of each line,
  read collectively, form a name, word, or sentence. The word comes from
  the Greek <i>akros</i>, extreme, and <i>stichos</i>, order or line.
  The acrostic was formerly in vogue for valentine and love verses. When
  employed as a riddle it is called a <i>Rebus</i>, which <a href="#p69">see</a>.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p48"></a><b><i>48. &nbsp;Acrostics (Double)</i></b><br>
<br>
This very fashionable riddle is a double Rebus, the initial and final
  letters of a word or words selected making two names or two words. The
  usual plan is to first suggest the foundation words, and then to
  describe the separate words, whose initials and finals furnish the
  answer to the question. Thus:

<blockquote>A Party to charm the young and erratic&mdash;<br>
But likely to frighten the old and rheumatic.
<ol type="1">

<li>The carriage in which the fair visitants came:</li>

<li>A very old tribe with a very old name;</li>

<li>A brave Prince of Wales free from scandal or shame.</li>
</ol>
The answer is Picnic.

	<td>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
	<td><b>P</b></td>

 </blockquote>

Sometimes the Double Acrostic is in prose, as in this brief example:

   <blockquote> A Briton supports his wig, his grand-mother, his comfort, and his
    country-women.<br>
<br>
    The answer is, Beef&mdash;Beer:<br>
<br>
    <i>Bob, Eve, Ease, Fair</i>.</blockquote>

<a name="p50"></a><b><i>50. &nbsp;Anagrams</i></b><br>
<br>
  are formed by the transposition of the letters of words or sentences,
  or names of persons, so as to produce a word, sentence, or verse, of

  discover, but are exceedingly striking when good. The following are

<a name="p52"></a><b><i>52. &nbsp;Charades</i></b><br>
<br>
  are compositions, poetical or otherwise, founded upon words, each
  syllable of which constitutes a <i>noun</i>, the whole of each word
  constituting another noun of a somewhat different meaning from those
  supplied by its separate syllables. Words which fully answer these
  conditions are the best for the purposes of charades; though many
  other words are employed. In writing, the first syllable is termed
  "<i>My first</i>," the second syllable "<i>My second</i>," and the
  complete word "<i>My whole</i>." The following is an example of a
  Poetical Charade:

<blockquote>The breath of the morning is sweet;<br>
  The earth is bespangled with flowers,<br>
And buds in a countless array<br>
  Have ope'd at the touch of the showers.<br>
The birds, whose glad voices are ever<br>
  A music delightful to hear,<br>
Seem to welcome the joy of the morning,<br>
  As the hour of the bridal draws near.<br>
What is that which now steals on <i>my first</i>,<br>
  Like a sound from the dreamland of love,<br>
And seems wand'ring the valleys among,<br>
  That they may the nuptials approve?<br>
'Tis a sound which <i>my second</i> explains,<br>
  And it comes from a sacred abode,<br>
And it merrily trills as the villagers throng<br>
  To greet the fair bride on her road.<br>
How meek is her dress, how befitting a bride<br>
  So beautiful, spotless, and pure!<br>
When she weareth <i>my second</i>, oh, long may it be<br>
  Ere her heart shall a sorrow endure.<br>
See the glittering gem that shines forth from her hair&mdash;<br>
  'Tis <i>my whole</i>, which a good father gave;<br>
Twas worn by her mother with honour before&mdash;<br>
  But <i>she</i> sleeps in peace in her grave.<br>
Twas her earnest request, as she bade them adieu,<br>
  That when her dear daughter the altar drew near,<br>
She should wear the same gem that her mother had worn<br>
  When she as a bride full of promise stood there.</blockquote>

  The answer is <i>Ear-ring</i>. The bells <i>ring</i>, the sound steals
  upon the <i>ear</i>, and the bride wears an <i>ear ring</i>. Charades
  may be sentimental or humorous, in poetry or prose; they may also be
  <i>acted</i>, in which manner they afford considerable amusement.

<a name="p53"></a><b><i>53. &nbsp;Charades (Acted)</i></b><br>
<br>
  A drawing room with folded doors is the best for the purpose. Various
  household appliances are employed to fit up something like a stage,
  and to supply the fitting scenes. Characters dressed in costumes made
  up of handkerchiefs, coats, shawls, table-covers, &amp;c, come on and
  perform an extempore play, founded upon the parts of a word, and its
  <i>whole</i>, as indicated already.  For instance, the events
  explained in the poem given might be <i>acted</i>&mdash;glasses might be
  rung for bells&mdash;something might be said in the course of the dialogues
  about the sound of the bells being delightful to the <i>ear</i>; there
  might be a dance of the villagers, in which a <i>ring</i> might be
  formed; a wedding might be performed, and so on: but for <i>acting
  charades</i> there are many better words, because <i>Ear-ring</i>
  could with difficulty be <i>represented</i> without at once betraying
  the meaning. <a name="fr1">There</a> is a little work entitled "Philosophy and Mirth
  united by Pen and Pencil," and another work, "Our Charades; and How we
  Played Them,"<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> by Jean Francis, which supply a large number of
  these Charades. But the following is the most extensive list of words
  ever published upon which Charades may be founded:<br>

<a name="p55"></a><b><i>55. &nbsp;Chronograms or Chrono-graphs</i></b><br>
<br>
are riddles in which the letters of the Roman notation in a sentence
  or series of words are so arranged as to make up a date. The following
  is a good example:

    <blockquote>My Day Closed Is In Immortality.</blockquote>

  The initials MDCIII. give 1603, the year of Queen Elizabeth's death.
  Sometimes the Chronogram is employed to express a date on coins or
  medals; but oftener it is simply used as a riddle:

 <blockquote>A poet who in
  blindness wrote; another lived in Charles's reign; a third called the
  father of English verse; a Spanish dramatist; the scolding wife of
  Socrates; and the Prince of Latin poets,&mdash;their initials give the year
  of the Great Plague&mdash;MDCLXV.&mdash;1665: Milton, Dryden, Chaucer,
  Lope-de-Vega, Xantippe, Virgil.</blockquote>

The word comes from <i>Chronos</i>,
  time, and <i>gramma</i>, a letter.

<a name="p56"></a><b><i>56. &nbsp;Conundrums</i></b><br>
<br>
These are simple catches, in which the sense is playfully cheated, and
  are generally founded upon words capable of double meaning.  The
  following are examples:

    <blockquote>Where did Charles the First's executioner dine, and what did he<br>
    take? <br>
    <i>He took a chop at the King's Head.</i><br><br>

    When is a plant to be dreaded more than a mad dog? <br>
    <i>When it's madder.</i><br><br>

    What is majesty stripped of its externals? <br>
    It is <i>a jest</i>. <br>
    [The <i>m</i> and the <i>y</i>, externals, are taken away.]<br><br>

    Why is hot bread like a caterpillar? <br>
    <i>Because it's the grub that makes the butter fly.</i><br><br>

    Why did the accession of Victoria throw a greater damp over England
    than the death of King William? <br>
    <i>Because the King was missed</i> (mist) <i>while the Queen was<br>
    reigning</i> (raining).<br><br>

    Why should a gouty man make his will? <br>
    <i>To have his legatees</i> (leg at ease).<br><br>

    Why are bankrupts more to be pitied than idiots? <br>
    <i>Because bankrupts are broken, while idiots are only cracked.</i><br><br>

    Why is the treadmill like a true convert? <br>
    <i>Because it's turning is the result of conviction.</i><br><br>

    When may a nobleman's property be said to be all feathers? <br>
    <i>When his estates are all entails</i> (hen-tails).</blockquote>

<a name="p57"></a><b><i>57. &nbsp;Cryptography, or secret writing</i></b><br>
<br>
from the Greek <i>cryptos</i>, a secret, and <i>graphein</i>, to
  write&mdash;has been largely employed in state despatches, commercial
  correspondence, love epistles, and riddles. The telegraphic codes
  employed in the transmission of news by electric wire, partakes
  somewhat of the cryptographic character, the writer employing certain
  words or figures, the key to which is in the possession of his
  correspondent. The single-word despatch sent by Napier to the
  Government of India, was a sort of cryptographic
  conundrum&mdash;<i>Peccavi</i>, I have sinned (Scinde); and in the agony
  column of the <i>Times</i> there commonly appear paragraphs which look
  puzzling enough until we discover the key-letter or figure. Various
  and singular have been the devices adopted&mdash;as, for instance, the
  writing in the perforations of a card especially prepared, so as only
  to allow the real words of the message to be separated from the mass
  of writing by means of a duplicate card with similar perforations; the
  old Greek mode of writing on the edges of a strip of paper wound round
  a stick in a certain direction, and the substitution of figures or
  signs for letters or words. Where one letter is always made to stand
  for another, the secret of a cryptograph is soon discovered, but when,
  as in the following example, the same letter does not invariably
  correspond to the letter for which it is a substitute, the difficulty
  of deciphering the cryptograph is manifestly increased:

   <blockquote> Ohs ya h sych, oayarsa rr loucys syms<br>
    Osrh srore rrhmu h smsmsmah emshyr snms.</blockquote>

  The translation of this can be made only by the possessor of the key.

    <blockquote>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z<br>
    h u s h m o n e y b y c h a r l e s h r o s s e s q</blockquote>

  "Hush Money, by Charles H. Ross, Esq."&mdash;twenty-six letters which, when
  applied to the cryptograph, will give a couplet from Parnell's
  "Hermit":

    <blockquote>"Far in a wild, unknown to public view,<br>
    From youth to age a reverend hermit grew."</blockquote>

  The employment of figures and signs for letters is the most usual form
  of the cryptograph. From the following jumble we get a portion of
  Hamlet's address to the Ghost:<br>
<br>


<blockquote><img src="images/EI2.gif" width="325" height="189" border="1" alt="cryptography example"></blockquote><br>


  it is easy to write and not very hard to read the entire speech. The
  whole theory of the cryptogram is that each correspondent possesses
  the key to the secret. To confound an outside inquirer the key is
  often varied. A good plan is to take a line from any ordinary book and
  substitute the first twenty-six of its letters for those of the
  alphabet. In your next cryptogram you take the letters from another
  page or another book. It is not necessary to give an example. Enough
  will be seen from what we have written to instruct an intelligent
  inquirer.

<a name="p58"></a><b><i>58. &nbsp; Decapitations and Curtailments</i></b><br>
<br>
  are riddles somewhat of the nature of the Logogriph, which <a href="#p62"><i>see</i></a>.
  In the first, the omission of the successive initials produces new
  words, as&mdash;Prelate, Relate, Elate, Late, Ate. In the curtailment the
  last letter of the word is taken away with a similar result,
  as&mdash;Patent, Paten, Pate, Pat, Pa. Of like kind are the riddles known
  as variations, mutilations, reverses, and counterchanges. A good
  example of the last-named is this:

<blockquote>Charge, Chester, Charge: on, Stanley, on!<br>
Were the last words of Marmion.<br>
Had I but been in Stanley's place,<br>
When Marmion urged him to the chase,<br>
A tear might come on every face."</blockquote>

The answer is onion&mdash;On, I, on.

<a name="p59"></a><b><i>59. &nbsp;Enigmas </i></b><br>
<br>
  are compositions of a different character, based upon <i>ideas</i>,
  rather than upon words, and frequently constructed so as to mislead,
  and to surprise when the solution is made known. Enigmas may be
  founded upon simple catches, like Conundrums, in which form they are
  usually called <b>Riddles</b>, such as:

<blockquote>"Though you set me on foot,<br>
I shall be on my head."</blockquote>

  The answer is, <i>A nail in a shoe</i>. The celebrated Enigma on the
  letter H, by Miss Catherine Fanshawe, but usually attributed to Lord
  Byron, commencing:

<blockquote>"'Twas whispered in heaven, 'twas muttered in hell,<br>
And echo caught faintly the sound as it fell;"</blockquote>

  and given elsewhere in this volume (See <a href="#p215b"><i>par</i>. 215</a>, page 77), is
  an admirable specimen of what may be rendered in the form of an Enigma.

<a name="p60"></a><b><i>60. &nbsp;Hidden Words.</i></b><br>
<br>
  A riddle in which names of towns, persons, rivers, &amp;c, are hidden or
  arranged, without transposition, in the midst of sentences which
  convey no suggestion of their presence. In the following sentence, for
  instance, there are hidden six Christian names:&mdash;Here is hid a name
  the people of Pisa acknowledge: work at each word, for there are worse
  things than to give the last shilling for bottled wine.&mdash;The names are
  Ida, Isaac, Kate, Seth, Ethel, Edwin.  Great varieties of riddles,
  known as Buried Cities, Hidden Towns, &amp;c, are formed on this
  principle, the words being sometimes placed so as to read backwards,
  or from right to left. The example given will, however, sufficiently
  explain the mode of operation.

<a name="p61"></a><b><i>61. &nbsp;Lipogram</i></b><br>
<br>
from <i>leipein</i>, to leave out, and <i>gramma</i>, a letter&mdash;is a
  riddle in which a name or sentence is written without its vowels, as:

    <blockquote>Thprffthpddngsthtng,<br>
    The proof of the pudding is in the eating.<br><br>

    Whnhnorslst ts&mdash;rlftd,<br>
    Dths bt&mdash;sr rtrt fm nfmy.<br><br>

    "When honour's lost 'tis a relief to die,<br>
    Death's but a sure retreat from infamy."</blockquote>

  This riddle sometimes appears as a proverb.

   <blockquote> "Fear's the white feather all cowards wear."<br>
    &mdash;&mdash;s' th wht fthr ll cwrds&mdash;&mdash;</blockquote>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p62"></a><b><i>62. &nbsp;Logogriph</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is a riddle (<i>logos</i>, a word, and <i>griphos</i>, a riddle)
  in which a word is made to undergo several changes. These changes are
  brought about by the addition, subtraction, omission, or substitution
  of a letter or letters. The following, by the late Lord Macaulay, is
  an excellent example:

<blockquote>"Cut off my head, how singular I act:<br>
  Cut off my tail, and plural I appear.<br>
Cut off my head and tail&mdash;most curious fact,<br>
  Although my middle's left, there's nothing there!<br>
What is my head cut off?&mdash;a sounding sea!<br>
  What is my tail cut off?&mdash;a flowing river!<br>
Amid their mingling deaths I fearless play<br>
  Parent of softest sounds, though mute for ever!</blockquote>

The answer is <i>cod</i>. Cut off its head and it is <i>od</i> (odd,
singular); its tail, and it is Co., plural, for company; head and tail,
and it is o, nothing. Its head is a sounding C (sea), its tail a flowing
D (river Dee), and amid their depths the cod may fearless play, parent
of softest <i>sounds</i> yet mute for ever.

<a name="p63"></a><b><i>63. &nbsp;Metagram</i></b><br>
<br>
  a riddle in which the change of the initial letter produces a series
  of words of different meanings; from <i>meta</i>, implying change, and
  <i>gramma</i>, a letter. Thus:

    <blockquote>I cover your head; change my head, and I set you to sleep; change it
    again and again, and with every change comes a new idea.&mdash;Cap, Nap,
    Gap, Sap, Hap, Map, Lap, Pap, Rap, Tap. This kind of riddle is also
    known as word-capping.</blockquote>

<a name="p64"></a><b><i>64. &nbsp;Palindrome</i></b><br>
<br>
  from the Greek <i>palin-dromos</i>, running back again. This is a
  word, sentence, or verse that reads the same both forwards and
  backwards&mdash;as, madam, level, reviver; live on no evil; love your
  treasure and treasure your love; you provoked Harry before Harry
  provoked you; servants respect masters when masters respect servants.
  Numerous examples of Palindrome or reciprocal word-twisting exist in
  Latin and French; but in English it is difficult to get a sentence
  which will be exactly the same when read either way. The best example
  is the sentence which, referring to the first banishment of the Great
  Napoleon, makes him say, as to his power to conquer Europe:

<blockquote>"Able was I ere I saw Elba."</blockquote>

<a name="p65"></a><b><i>65. &nbsp;Puzzles</i></b><br>

  vary much. One of the simplest that we know is this:

<blockquote>Take away half of thirteen and let eight remain.<br>
<br>
    Write XIII on a slate, or on a piece of paper&mdash;rub out the lower
    half of the figures, and VIII will remain.</blockquote>

Upon the principle of the square-words, riddlers form Diagonals,
  Diamonds, Pyramids, Crosses, Stars, &amp;c These specimens will show
  their peculiarities:

are a class of Enigma generally formed by the first, sometimes the
  first and last, letters of words, or of transpositions of letters, or
  additions to words. Dr. Johnson, however, represents Rebus to be a
  word represented by a picture. And putting the Doctor's definition and
  our own explanation together, the reader may glean a good conception
  of the nature of the Rebus of which the following is an example:

<br>
A comparatively modern sort of riddle, in which the letters of each
  word selected reads both across and down.  With four letters the
  making of the riddle is easy, but with five or six the difficulty
  increases. We give an example of each.
<ol type="i">

    <li>Inside, a thought, a liquid gem, a timid creature.</li>

    <li>To run out, odour, to boil, to loosen, unseen essence.</li>

    <li>Compensations, a court favourite, to assist, to bite slightly,
    Spanish money, sarcasms.</li>
</ol>

  With seven or eight letters the riddle becomes exceedingly difficult,
  especially if the selected words are of like character and syllables.

<a name="p71"></a><b><i>71. &nbsp;Chess, Laws of.</i></b><br>
<br>
The rules given below are those which are now universally accepted by
  English players.<br>
<br>

<ol type="i">
<li>The board is to be so placed as to leave a white square at the
    right hand of the player.</li>
</ol>

<ol start=2 type="i">
   <li>Any mistake in placing the board or the men may be rectified
    before the fourth move is completed, but not after.</li>
</ol>

<ol start=3 type="i">
    <li>The players draw lots for the first move, and take the move
    alternately.</li>
</ol>

   <blockquote> [When odds are given, the player giving them moves first. White
    generally moves first; therefore, if black win the move, the board
    is turned. It is usual to play with the white and black men
    alternately.]</blockquote>


<ol start=4 type="i">
    <li>The piece touched must be moved. When the fingers of the player
    have once left the man, it cannot be again removed from the square
    it occupies.</li>
</ol>

    <blockquote>[Except the move be illegal, when the opponent can insist on the
    piece being moved in the proper manner, or for the opposing King to
    be moved.]</blockquote>


<ol start=5 type="i">
    <li>In touching a piece simply to adjust it, the player must notify
    to his adversary that such is his intention.</li>
</ol>


    <blockquote>[It is usual, in such a case, to say <i>J'adoube</i> (I adjust); but
    he may not touch a piece with the intention of moving it, and then,
    when he discover his mistake, say, <i>J'adoube.</i> The phrase is
    simply intended to be used when a piece is displaced or overturned
    by accident.]</blockquote>


<ol start=6 type="i">
    <li>If a player take one of his own men by mistake, or touch a wrong
    man, or one of his opponent's men, or make an illegal move, his
    adversary may compel him to take the man, make the right move, move
    his King, or replace the piece, and make a legal move.</li>
</ol>

<ol start=7 type="i">
    <li>A pawn may be played either one or two squares at a time when
    first moved.</li>
</ol>
   <blockquote> [In the latter case it is liable to be taken <i>en passant</i>, with
    a pawn that could have taken it had it been played only one square.]</blockquote>

<ol start=8 type="i">
    <li>A player cannot castle under any of the following
    circumstances:
<li style="list-style: none">
<ol type="1">
<li>If he has moved either King or Rook.</li>
<li>If the
    King be in check.</li>
<li>If there be any piece between the King and the
    Rook.</li>
<li>If the King, in moving, pass over any square commanded by
    any one of his adversary's forces.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

   <blockquote> [You cannot castle to get out of check.]</blockquote>

<ol start=9 type="i">
    <li>If a player give a check without crying "check," the adversary
    need not take notice of the check. But if two moves only are made
    before the discovery of the mistake, the pieces may be replaced, and
    the game properly played.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=10 type="i">
    <li>If a player say check without actually attacking the King, and
    his adversary move his King or take the piece, the latter may elect
    either to let the move stand or have the pieces replaced and another
    move made.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=11 type="i">
    <li>If, at the end of a game, the players remain, one with a
    superior to an inferior force, or even if they have equal forces,
    the defending player may call upon his adversary to mate in fifty
    moves on each side, or draw the game.</li>
</ol>
    <blockquote>[If one player persist in giving perpetual check, or repeating the
    same move, his opponent may count the moves for the draw; in which
    case touching a piece if reckoned a move.]</blockquote>
<ol start=12 type="i">
    <li>Stalemate, or perpetual check is a drawn game.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=13 type="i">
    <li>Directly a pawn reaches its eighth square it must be exchanged
    for a piece.</li>
</ol>
    <blockquote>[It is usual to change the pawn for a Queen, but it may be replaced
    by a Rook, Bishop, or Knight, without reference to the pieces
    already on the board. In practice it would be changed for a Queen or
    a Knight, seeing that the Queen's moves include those of the Rook
    and Bishop. Thus you may have two or more Queens, three or more
    Rooks, Bishops, or Knights on the board at the end of the game.]</blockquote>
<ol start=14 type="i">
    <li>Should any dispute arise, the question must be submitted to a
    bystander, whose decision is to be considered final.</li>

<a name="p72"></a><b><i>72. &nbsp;Draughts, Rules of the Game.</i></b><br>
<br>
The accepted laws for regulating the game are as follows:<br>
<br>
<ol type="i">
    <li>The board is to be so placed as to have the white or black double
    corners at the right hand of the player.</li>
</ol>

<ol start=2 type="i">
    <li>The first move is taken by chance or agreement, and in all the
    subsequent games of the same sitting, the first move is taken
    alternately. Black generally moves first.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>
    Any action which prevents your adversary from having a full
    view of the board is not allowed, and if persisted in, loses the
    game to the offending player.</li></ol>


<ol start=4 type="i"><li>
The man touched must be moved, but the men may be properly
    adjusted during any part of the game. After they are so placed, if
    either player, when it is his turn to play, touch a man, he must
    move it. If a man be so moved as to be visible on the angle
    separating the squares, the player so touching the man must move it
    to the square indicated.</li></ol>

    <blockquote>[By this it is meant that a player may not move first to one square
    and then to another. Once moved on to a square, the man must remain
    there.]</blockquote>


<ol start=5 type="i"><li>It is optional with the player either to allow his opponent to
    stand the huff, or to compel him to take the offered piece.</li></ol>

   <blockquote> ["Standing the huff" is when a player refuses to take an offered
    piece, but either intentionally or accidentally makes another move.
    His adversary then removes the man that should have taken the piece,
    and makes his own move&mdash;huff and move, as it is called.]</blockquote>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>
    Ten minutes is the longest time allowed to consider a move,
    which if not made within that time, forfeits the game.</li></ol>


<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    It is compulsory upon the player to take all the pieces he can
    legally take by the same series of moves. On making a King, however,
    the latter remains on his square till a move has been made on the
    other side.</li></ol>


<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    All disputes are to be decided by the majority of the
    bystanders present, or by an umpire.</li></ol>


<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    No player may leave the room without the consent of his
    adversary, or he forfeits the game.</li></ol>


<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    A false move must be remedied as soon as it is discovered, or the
    maker of such move loses the game.</li></ol>


<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    When only a small number of men remain toward the end of the
    game, the possessor of the lesser number may call on his opponent to
    win in at least fifty moves, or declare the game drawn. With two
    Kings to one, the game must be won in at most twenty moves on each
    side.</li></ol>


<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    The player who refuses to abide by the rules loses the game. In
    the losing game a player must take all the men he can by his move.</li></ol>

<br>
Great silence and attention should be observed by the players. Four
    persons cut for partners; the two highest are against the two
    lowest. The partners sit opposite to each other, and he who cuts the
    lowest card is entitled to the deal. The ace is the lowest in
    cutting.<br>
<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    <b>Shuffling</b>&mdash;-Each person has a right to shuffle the cards before
    the deal; but it is usual for the elder hand only; and the dealer
    after.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    <b>Cutting</b>.&mdash;The pack is then cut by the right hand adversary; and
    the dealer distributes the cards, one by one, to each of the
    players, beginning with the player on his left, until he comes to
    the last card, which he turns up for trump, and leaves on the table
    till the first trick be played.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    <b>First Play</b>.&mdash;The elder hand, the player on the left of the
    dealer, plays first. The winner of the trick plays again; and so on,
    till all the cards are played out.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    <b>Mistakes</b>.&mdash;No intimations, or signs are permitted between the
    partners. The mistake of one party is the profit of the adversary.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    <b>Collecting Tricks.</b>&mdash;The tricks belonging to each player should be
    turned and collected by one of the partners only. All above six
    tricks reckon towards game.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    <b>Honours</b>.&mdash;The ace, king, queen, and knave of trumps are called
    honours; and when either of the partners hold three separately, or
    between them, they count two points towards the game; and in case
    they have four honours, they count four points.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    <b>Game</b>.&mdash;<i>Long Whist game consists of ten points, Short Whist
    of five points.</i></li></ol><br>

<a name="p74"></a><b><i>74. &nbsp;Terms used in Whist.</i></b><br>
<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
<i>Finessing,</i> is the attempt to gain an advantage; thus:&mdash;If
    you have the best and third best card of the suit led you put on the
    third best, and run the risk of your adversary having the second
    best; if he has it not, which is two to one against him, you are
    then certain of gaining a trick.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    <i>Forcing</i>, is playing the suit of which your partner or
    adversary has not any, and which in order to win he must trump.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    <i>Long Trump,</i> the one or more trumps in your hand when all
    the rest are out.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    <i>Loose Card,</i> a card of no value, and the most proper to
    throw away.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    <i>Points,</i>&mdash;Ten make the game; as many as are gained by
    tricks or honours, so many points are set up to the score of the
    game.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    <i>Quarte</i>, four successive cards in suit.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    <i>Quarte Major</i>, a sequence of ace, king, queen, and knave.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    <i>Quinte</i>, five successive cards in suit.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    <i>Quinte Major,</i> is a sequence of ace, king, queen, knave,
    and ten.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    <i>See-saw,</i> is when each partner trumps a suit, and when they
    play those suits to each other for that purpose.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    <i>Score</i>, is the number of points set up. The following is a
    good method of scoring with coins or counters:

    For Short Whist there are regular markers.</blockquote>


<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    <i>Slam,</i> is when either side win every trick.</li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    <i>Tenance,</i> is possessing the first last and third best
    cards, and being the player; you consequently catch the adversary
    when that suit is played: as, for instance, in case you have ace and
    queen of any suit, and your adversary leads that suit, you must win
    two tricks, by having the best and third best of the suit played,
    and being the last player.</li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    <i>Tierce,</i> three successive cards in suit.</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="i"><li>

    xv. <i>Tierce Major,</i> a sequence of ace, king, and queen.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    Lead from your strong suit, be cautious how you change suits, and
    keep a commanding card to bring it in again.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    Lead through the strong suit and up to the weak; but not in
    trumps; unless very strong in them.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Lead the highest of a sequence; but if you have a quarte or
    cinque to a king, lead the lowest.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Lead through an honour, particularly if the game is against you.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    Lead your best trump, if the adversaries be eight, and you have
    no honour; but not if you have four trumps, unless you have a
    sequence.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    Lead a trump if you have four or five, or a strong hand; but not
    if weak.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    Having ace, king, and two or three small cards, lead ace and
    king if weak in trumps, but a small one if strong in them.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    If you have the last trump, with some winning cards, and one
    losing card only, lead the losing card.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    Return your partner's lead, not the adversaries'; and if you
    hold only three originally, play the best; but you need not return
    it immediately, when you win with a king, queen, or knave, and have
    only small ones, or when you hold a good sequence, a strong suit, or
    five trumps.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    Do not lead from ace queen, or ace knave.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    Do not&mdash;as a rule&mdash;lead an ace, unless you have a king.</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    Do not lead a thirteenth card, unless trumps be out.</li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    Do not trump a thirteenth card, unless you be last player, or
    want the lead.</li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    Keep a small card to return your partner's lead.</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="i"><li>

    Be cautious in trumping a card when strong in trumps,
    particularly if you have a strong suit.</li></ol>

<ol start=16 type="i"><li>

    Having only a few small trumps, make them when you can.</li></ol>

<ol start=17 type="i"><li>

    If your partner refuse to trump a suit, of which he knows you
    have not the best, lead your best trump.</li></ol>

<ol start=18 type="i"><li>

    When you hold all the remaining trumps, play one, and then
    try to put the lead in your partner's hand.</li></ol>

<ol start=19 type="i"><li>

    Remember how many of each suit are out, and what is the best
    card left in each hand.</li></ol>

<ol start=20 type="i"><li>

    Never force your partner if you are weak in trumps, unless you
    have a renounce, or want the odd trick.</li></ol>

<ol start=21 type="i"><li>

    When playing for the odd trick, be cautious of trumping out,
    especially if your partner be likely to trump a suit. Make all the
    tricks you can early, and avoid finessing.</li></ol>

<ol start=22 type="i"><li>

    If you take a trick, and have a sequence, win it with the

    The deal is determined by cutting-in. Cutting-in and cutting-out
    must be by pairs.</li></ol>

   <blockquote> [Less than three cards, above or below, is not a cut. Ace is lowest.
    Ties cut again. Lowest deals. Each player may shuffle, the dealer
    last. The right-hand adversary cuts to dealer.]</blockquote>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>
    iIf a card be exposed, a fresh deal may be demanded.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Dealer must not look at bottom card; and the trump-card must be
    left, face upwards, on the table till the first trick be turned, or
    opponents may call a fresh deal.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Too many or too few cards is a misdeal&mdash;an exposed or face card.
    In either case, a fresh deal may be demanded.</li></ol>

   <blockquote> [In cases of a misdeal, the deal passes to the next player.]</blockquote>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>
    After the first round has been played, no fresh deal can be
    called.</li></ol>

   <blockquote> [If the first player hold fewer than thirteen cards, the other hands
    being right, the deal stands.]</blockquote>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>
    If two cards be dealt to the same player, the dealer may rectify
    his error before dealing another card.</li></ol>

   <blockquote> [The dealer must not touch the cards after they have left his hands;
    but he may count those remaining in the pack if he suspect a
    misdeal, or he may ask the players to count their cards. One partner
    may not deal for another without the consent of opponents.]</blockquote>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>
    If the trump-card be not taken into the dealer's hand at the
    expiration of the first round, it may be treated as an exposed card,
    and called.</li></ol>

    <blockquote>[After this, no one has a right to ask what was the trump-card, but
    he may ask "What are Trumps?"]</blockquote>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>
    If the third hand play before the second, the fourth has a
    right to play before his partner; or if the fourth hand play before
    the second or third, the cards so played must stand, and the second
    be compelled to win the trick if he can.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    If a player lead out of his turn, or otherwise expose a card,
    that card may be <i>called</i>, if the playing of it does not cause
    a revoke.</li></ol>

    <blockquote>[Calling a card is the insisting of its being played when the suit
    comes round, or when it may be played.]</blockquote>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>
    If a player trump by mistake, he may recall his card, and play to
    the suit, if the card be not covered; but he may be compelled to
    play the highest or lowest of the suit led, and to play the exposed
    trump when it is called by his adversaries.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    If, before a trick be turned, a player discover that he has not
    followed suit, he may recall his card; but the card played in error
    can be called when the suit is played.</li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>
    Before he plays, a player may require his partner to "draw his
    card," or he may have each card in the trick claimed before the
    trick be turned.</li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    When a player does not follow suit his partner is allowed to
    ask him whether he has any card of the suit led.</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="i"><li>

    The penalty for a revoke&mdash;either by wrongfully trumping the suit
    led, or by playing a card of another suit&mdash;is the loss of three
    tricks; but no revoke can be claimed till the cards are abandoned,
    and the trick turned.</li></ol>

   <blockquote> [Revokes forfeit three tricks from the hand or score: or opponents
    may add three to their score; partner may ask and correct a trick if
    not turned; the revoking side cannot score out in that deal.]</blockquote>

<ol start=16 type="i"><li>
    No revoke can be claimed after the tricks are gathered up, or
    after the cards are cut for the next deal.</li></ol>

   <blockquote> [The wilful mixing up of the cards in such case loses the game.]</blockquote>

<ol start=17 type="i"><li>
    The proof of a revoke lies with the claimants, who may examine

   <blockquote> [No omission to score honours can be rectified after the cards are
    packed; but an overscore, if proved, must be deducted.]</blockquote>

<ol start=20 type="i"><li>

<br>
  The Game consists of Five Points. One for a Single&mdash;5 to 3 or 4; Two
  for a Double&mdash;5 to 1 or 2; Three for a Triple&mdash;5 to love. A
  Rubber&mdash;two Games successively won, or the two best Games out of
  three&mdash;counts for Two Points.  Thus, if the first Game be won by 5 to
  4, the Points are 1 to love; the second Game won by the opposite side
  by 5 to 1, the Points are then 1 to 2; the third Game won by the side
  which won the first, by 5 to love. The Points are then 6 to 2&mdash;a
  balance of 4. This is arrived at thus: the Single in the first Game,
  1; the Triple in the third Game, 3; the Rubber (two Games of three),
  2; together, 6. From this deduct 2, for the Double gained by the
  opponents in the second Game, which leaves 4, as above. Short Whist is
  usually played for points&mdash;say, a shilling, or a penny, for each
  point; two for the Game, and two for the Rubber.

<a name="p79"></a><b><i>79. &nbsp;Advice to all Players.</i></b><br>
<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    Count, and arrange your cards into suits; but do not always place
    your trumps in one particular part of your hand, or your opponents
    will discover how many you have.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    Attend to the game, and play as though your hand consisted of
    twenty-six instead of thirteen cards.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    In the second round of a suit, win the trick when you can, and
    lead out for your partner's high cards as soon as possible.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Touch only the card you intend to play.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    Retain a high trump as long as you can, to bring back your strong
    suit.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    With a weak hand, always try to secure the seventh or odd trick
    to save the game.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    Attend to the score, and play as if the whole fortune of the
    game depended on yourself.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    Remember the number of trumps out at every stage of the game.
    Note, also, the fall of every court-card in the other suits, so that
    you are never in doubt as to the card that will win the trick.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    Hold the turn-up as long as you can, as by that means you keep
    your adversaries from knowing your strength in trumps.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    Do not force your partner unnecessarily, as by that means you
    sometimes become his adversary instead of his friend.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    When in doubt, play a trump. Play the game in its integrity, and
    recollect that Whist is full of inferences as well as facts.</li></ol>

<a name="p80"></a><b><i>80. &nbsp;Cribbage</i></b><br>
<br>
  The game of Cribbage differs from all other games by its immense
  variety of chances. It is played with the full pack of cards, often by
  four persons, but it is a better game for two. There are also
  different modes of playing&mdash;with five, six, or eight cards; but the
  best games use those with five or six cards.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><p align="right"><i><span style="color: #A82C28">Night is not Dark to the Good.</span></i></p><br>

<a name="p81"></a><b><i>81. &nbsp;Terms Used in Cribbage</i></b><br>
<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    <i>Crib.</i>&mdash;The crib is composed of the cards thrown out by
    each player, and the dealer is entitled to score whatever points are
    made by them.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    <i>Pairs</i> are two similar cards, as two aces or two kings.
    Whether in hand or play they reckon for two points.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    <i>Pairs-Royal</i> are three similar cards, and reckon for six
    points, whether in hand or play.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    <i>Double Pairs-Royal</i> are four similar cards and reckon for
    twelve points, whether in hand or play. The points gained by pairs,
    pairs-royal, and double pairs-royal, in playing, are thus
    effected:&mdash;Your adversary having played a seven and you another,
    constitutes a pair, and entitles you to score two points; your
    antagonist then playing a third seven, makes a pair-royal, and he
    marks six; and your playing a fourth is a double pair-royal, and
    entitles you to twelve points.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    <i>Fifteens</i>.&mdash;Every fifteen reckons for two points, whether
    in hand or play. In hand they are formed either by two cards&mdash;as a
    five and any tenth card, a six and a nine, a seven and an eight, or
    by three cards, as a two, a five, and an eight, two sixes and a
    three. If in play, such cards as together make fifteen are played,
    the player whose card completes that number, scores two points.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    <i>Sequences</i> are three or four more successive cards, and
    reckon for an equal number of points, either in hand or play. In
    playing a sequence, it is of no consequence which card is thrown
    down first; as thus:&mdash;your adversary playing an ace, you a five, he
    a three, you a two, then he a four&mdash;he counts five for the sequence.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    <i>Flush</i>.&mdash;When, the cards are all of one suit, they reckon
    for as many points as there are cards. For a flush in the crib, the
    turned-up card must be of the same suit as those put out.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    <i>Nob</i>.&mdash;The knave of the suit turned up reckons for one
    point; if a knave be turned up, the dealer marks two.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    <i>End Hole</i>.&mdash;The point scored by the last player, if he
    make under thirty-one; if he make thirty-one exactly, he marks two.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    <i>Last</i>.&mdash;Three points taken at the commencement of the game
    of five-card cribbage by the non-dealer.</li></ol>

<a name="p82"></a><b><i>82. &nbsp;The Accepted Laws of Cribbage.</i></b><br>
<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    The players cut for deal. The ace is lowest in cutting. In case
    of a tie, they cut again. The holder of the lowest card deals.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    Not fewer than four cards is a cut; nor must the non-dealer
    touch the pack after he has cut it.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Too many or too few cards dealt constitutes a misdeal, the
    penalty for which is the taking of two points by the non-dealer.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    A faced card, or a card exposed during the act of dealing
    necessitates a new deal, without penalty.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    The dealer shuffles the cards and the non-dealer cuts them for
    the "start."</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

   If the non-dealer touch the cards (except to cut them for the
    turn-up) after they have been cut for the start, he forfeits two
    points.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    In cutting for the start, not fewer than three cards must be
    lifted from the pack or left on the table.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    The non-dealer throws out for the crib before the dealer. A
    card once laid out cannot be recalled, nor must either party touch
    the crib till the hand is played out. Either player confusing the
    crib cards with his hand, is liable to a penalty of three points.</li></ol>

    <blockquote>[In three and four-hand cribbage the left-hand player throws out
    first for the crib, then the next; the dealer last. The usual and
    best way is for the non-dealer to throw his crib over to the
    dealer's side of the board; on these two cards the dealer places his
    own, and hands the pack over to be cut. The pack is then at the
    right side of the board for the next deal.]</blockquote>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>
    The player who takes more points than those to which he is
    entitled, either in play or in reckoning hand or crib, is liable to
    be "pegged;" that is, to be put back as many points as he has
    over-scored, and have the points added to his opponent's side.</li></ol>

   <blockquote> [In pegging you must not remove your opponent's <i>front</i> peg
    till you have given him another. In order "to take him down,'' you
    remove <i>your own back peg</i> and place it <i>where his front peg
    ought to be</i>, you then take his <i>wrongly placed peg</i> and put
    it in <i>front of your own front</i>, as many holes as he has
    forfeited by wrongly scoring.]</blockquote>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>
    No penalty attaches to the taking of too few points in play,
    hand, or crib.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    When a player has once taken his hand or crib, he cannot amend
    his score.</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    When a knave is turned up, "two for his heels" must be scored
    before the dealer's own card be played, or they cannot be taken.</li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    A player cannot demand the assistance of his adversary in
    reckoning hand and crib.</li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    A player may not, except to "peg him," touch his adversary's
    pegs, under a penalty of two points. If the foremost peg has been
    displaced by accident, it must be placed in the hole behind the peg
    standing on the board.</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="i"><li>

    The peg once holed cannot be removed by either player till
    another point or points be gained.</li></ol>

<ol start=16 type="i"><li>

    The player who scores a game as won when, in fact, it is not
    won, loses it.</li></ol>

<ol start=17 type="i"><li>

    A <i>lurch</i>&mdash;scoring the whole sixty-one before your
    adversary has scored thirty-one&mdash;is equivalent to a double game, if
    agreed to previous to the commencement of the game.</li></ol>

<ol start=18 type="i"><li>

    A card that may be legally played cannot be withdrawn after
    it has been once thrown face upwards on the table.</li></ol>

<ol start=19 type="i"><li>

    If a player neglect to score his hand, crib, or any point or
    points of the game, he cannot score them after the cards are packed
    or the next card played.</li></ol>

<ol start=20 type="i"><li>

    The player who throws up his cards and refuses to score,
    forfeits the game.</li></ol>

<ol start=21 type="i"><li>

    If a player neglect to play when he can play a card within the
    prescribed thirty-one, he forfeits two holes.</li></ol>

<ol start=22 type="i"><li>

    Each player's hand and crib must be plainly thrown down on the
    table and not mixed with the pack, under penalty of the forfeiture
    of the game.</li></ol>

    <blockquote>The player who refuses to abide by the rules, loses the game.

<br>
  In this the sixty-one points or holes on the cribbage-board mark the
  game. The player cutting the lowest card deals; after which, each
  player lays out two of the five cards for the crib, which belongs to
  the dealer.  The adversary cuts the remainder of the pack, and the
  dealer turns up and lays upon the crib the uppermost card, the
  turn-up. If it be a knave, he marks two points. The card turned up is
  reckoned by both in counting their hands or crib. After laying out,
  the eldest hand plays a card, which the other should endeavour to
  pair, or find one, the pips of which, reckoned with the first, will
  make fifteen; then the non-dealer plays another card, and so on
  alternately, until the pips on the cards played make thirty-one, or
  the nearest possible number under that.

<br>
  When he whose turn it is to play cannot produce a card that makes
  thirty-one, or comes under that number, he says, "Go," and his
  antagonist scores one, or plays any card or cards he may have that
  will make thirty-one, or under. If he can make exactly thirty-one, he
  takes two points; if not, one. Such cards as remain after this are not
  played, but each player then counts and scores his hand, the
  non-dealer first.  The dealer then marks the points for his hand, and
  also for his crib, each reckoning the cards every way they can
  possibly be varied, and always including the turned-up card.<br>

<a name="p86"></a><b><i>86. &nbsp;Maxims for laying out the Crib Cards.</i></b><br>
<br>
  In laying out cards for the crib, the player should consider not only
  his own hand, but also to whom the crib belongs, as well as the state
  of the game; for what might be right in one situation would be wrong
  in another. Possessing a pair-royal, it is generally advisable to lay
  out the other cards for crib, unless it belongs to the adversary.
  Avoid giving him two fives, a deuce and a trois, five and six, seven
  and eight, five and any other tenth card. When he does not thereby
  materially injure his hand, the player should for his own crib lay out
  close cards, in hope of making a sequence; or two of a suit, in
  expectation of a flush; or cards that of themselves reckoned with
  others will count fifteen. When the antagonist be nearly up, and it
  may be expedient to keep such cards as may prevent him from gaining at
  play. The rule is to baulk your adversary's crib by laying out cards
  not likely to prove of advantage to him, and to lay out favourably for
  your own crib. This applies to a stage of the game when it may be of
  consequence to keep in hand cards likely to tell in play, or when the
  non-dealer would be either out by his hand, or has reason for thinking
  the crib of little moment. A king and a nine is the best baulk, as
  none can form a sequence beyond it; king or queen, with an ace, six,
  seven, eight, or nine, are good ones to put out. Low cards are
  generally the most likely to gain at play; the flushes and sequences,
  particularly if the latter be also flushes, are eligible hands, as
  thereby the player will often be enabled either to assist his own
  crib, or baulk that of the opponent; a knave should never be put out
  for his crib, if it can be retained in hand.

<br>
  differs little from the preceding. They put out but one card each to
  the crib, and when thirty-one, or the nearest to that has been made,
  the next eldest hand leads, and the players go on again in rotation,
  with the remaining cards, till all are played out, before they proceed
  to show hands and crib. For three-handed cribbage triangular boards
  are used.

  is sometimes played, wherein one person sits out, not each game, but
  each deal in rotation. In this the first dealer generally wins.

<a name="p89"></a><b><i>89. &nbsp;Six-Card Cribbage</i></b><br>
<br>
  The two players commence on an equality, without scoring any points
  for the last, retain four cards in hand, and throw out two for crib.
  At this game it is of advantage to the last player to keep as close as
  possible, in hope of coming in for fifteen, a sequence, or pair,
  besides the end hole, or thirty-one. The first dealer is thought to
  have some trifling advantage, and each player may, on the average,

  non-dealer is considered to have the preference, when he gains ten or
  more the first hand, the dealer not making more than his average

<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
This game is played by any number of persons,
    from three, but five or seven make the best game.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    The cards are cut for deal, the holder of the lowest card being
    dealer; after which the deal goes round, from left to right. In case
    of a tie, the players cut again. Ace is lowest, and the court-cards
    and tens are reckoned of the same value,&mdash;namely, ten.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    The left-hand adversary shuffles or makes the pack, and the
    player to the right of the dealer cuts previous to the deal.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    The cards take their usual value, ace highest; then king, queen,
    knave, ten, and so on, down to deuce. The dealer then gives three
    cards, one at a time, face downwards, to each player; and also
    dealing an extra hand, or "miss," which may be thrown on the table
    either as the first or last card of each round.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    A card too many or too few is a misdeal.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    The stakes being settled beforehand, the dealer puts into the
    pool his three halfpence, pence, or sixpences, and the game
    proceeds:</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    The first player on the left of the dealer looks at his hand,
    and declares whether he will play or take the miss. If he decide to
    play, he says, "I play," or "I take the miss;" but he may elect to
    do neither; in which case he places his cards on the pack, and has
    nothing further to do with that round. The next player looks at his
    hand, and says whether he will play or not; and so on, till the turn
    comes to the dealer, who, if only one player stand the chance of the
    loo, may either play or give up the stakes.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>
    In the first round it is usual either to deal a <i>single</i>;
    that is, a round without a <i>miss</i>, when all the players must
    play; or each player puts into the pool a sum equal to that staked
    by the dealer in which latter case a miss is dealt.</li></ol>

<a name="p98"></a><b><i>98. &nbsp;Mode of Play</i></b><br>
<br>
<a name="p98i"></a><ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    When it is seen how many players stand in the round, the elder
    hand plays a card&mdash;his highest trump if he has two or more; if not,
    any card he chooses. The next plays, and, if he can, follows suit or
    heads the trick with a trump. If he can do neither, he throws away
    any card.</li></ol>

<a name="p98ii"></a><ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    And so the round goes on; the highest card of the suit, or the
    highest trump, winning the trick. The winner of the trick then leads
    another card.</li></ol>

<a name="p98iii"></a><ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    The game consists of three tricks, and the pool is divided
    equally among the players possessing them. Thus, if there be three
    pence, shillings, or half-crowns, in the pool, the tricks are a
    penny, sixpence, or half-a-crown each. The three tricks may of
    course be won by a single player, or they may be divided between two
    or three. Each player who fails to win a trick is looed, and pays
    into the next pool the amount determined on as the loo.</li></ol>

<a name="p98iv"></a><ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    When played for a determinate stake, as a penny for the deal and
    three pence for the loo, the game is called <i>Limited Loo</i>. When
    each player is looed for the sum in the pool, it is <i>Unlimited
    Loo</i>.</li></ol>

<a name="p98v"></a><ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    Caution is necessary in playing this game <i>to win</i>. As a
    general rule, the first player should not take the miss, as the
    dealer's stake is necessarily to be added to the loo. Nor the miss
    be taken after two players have "struck in" (declared to play), for
    the chances are that they possess good leading cards.</li></ol>

<a name="p99"></a><b><i>99. &nbsp;Club Law</i></b><br>
<br>
  <i>Another way</i> of playing Loo is for all the parties to play
  whenever a club is turned up as trumps. It is merely another mode of
  increasing the pool.

<a name="p100"></a><b><i>100. &nbsp;Five-Card Loo.</i></b><br>
<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    In principle it is the same as the other game Loo, only instead
    of three, the dealer (having paid his own stake into the pool) gives
    five cards to each player, one by one, face downwards.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    After five cards have been dealt to each player, another is
    turned up for trump; the knave of clubs generally, or sometimes the
    knave of the trump suit, as agreed upon, is the highest card, and is
    styled Pam; the ace of trumps is next in value, and the rest on
    succession, as at Whist. Each player can change all or any of the
    five cards dealt, or throw up his hand, and escape being looed.
    Those who play their cards, either with or without changing, and do
    not gain a trick, are looed. This is also the case with all who have
    stood the game, when a flush or flushes occur; and each, except a
    player holding pam, of an inferior flush, must pay a stake, to be
    given to him who sweeps the board, or divided among the winners at
    the ensuing deal, according to the tricks made. For instance, if
    every one at dealing stakes half-a-crown, the tricks are entitled to
    sixpence a-piece, and whoever is looed must put down half-a-crown,
    exclusive of the deal; sometimes it is settled that each person
    looed shall pay a sum equal to what happens to be on the table at
    the time. Five cards of a suit, or four with pam, make a flush which
    sweeps the board, and yields only to a superior flush, or the elder
    hand. When the ace of trumps is led, it is usual to say, "<i>Pam be
    civil</i>;" the holder of which last-mentioned card must then let
    the ace pass.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Any player with five cards of a suit (a flush) looes all the
    players who stand in the game.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    The rules in this game are the same as in Three Card Loo.</li></ol>

<a name="p101"></a><b><i>101. &nbsp;Put</i></b><br>
<br>
  The game of Put is played with an entire pack of cards, generally by
  two, but sometimes by four persons. At Put the cards have a value
  distinct from that in other games. The best card in the pack is a
  <i>trois</i>, or three; the next a <i>deuce</i>, or two; then the ace,
  king, queen, knave, ten in rotation. The dealer distributes three
  cards to each player, by one at a time; whoever cuts the lowest card
  has the deal, and five points make the game, except when both parties
  say, "<i>I put</i>"&mdash;for then the score is at an end, and the contest
  is determined in favour of the player who may win two tricks out of
  three. When it happens that each player has won a trick, and the third
  is a tie&mdash;that is, covered by a card of equal value&mdash;the whole goes
  for nothing, and the game must begin anew.

  The eldest hand plays a card; and whether the adversary pass it, win
  it, or tie it, has a right to say, "<i>I put</i>," or place his cards
  on the pack. If you accept the first and your opponent decline the
  challenge, you score one; if you prefer the latter, your adversary
  gains a point; but if, before he play, your opponent says, "<i>I
  put</i>," and you do not choose to see him, he is entitled to add one
  to his score. It is sometimes good play to say, "<i>I put</i>," before
  you play a card: this depends on the nature of your hand.

<br>
  is a lively round game, at which several may play, with a complete
  pack of cards, bearing the same value as at whist. A pool is made with
  fish or counters, on which such a value is fixed as the company may
  agree. The highest trump in each deal wins the pool; and should it
  happen that not one trump be dealt, then the company pool again, and
  the event is decided by the succeeding deal. After determining the
  deal, &amp;c, the dealer pools six fish, and every other player four;
  then three cards are given to each, by one at a time, and another
  turned up for trump. The cards are not to be looked at, except in this
  manner: The eldest hand shows the uppermost card, which, if a trump,
  the company may speculate on, or bid for&mdash;the highest bidder buying
  and paying for it, provided the price offered be approved of by the
  seller. After this is settled, if the first card does not prove a
  trump, then the next eldest is to show the uppermost card, and so
  on&mdash;the company speculating as they please, till all are discovered,
  when the possessor of the highest trump, whether by purchase or
  otherwise, gains the pool. To play at speculation well, recollection
  is requisite of what superior cards of that particular suit have
  appeared in the preceding deals, and calculation of the probability of
  the trump offered proving the highest in the deal then undetermined.

<a name="p108"></a><b><i>108. &nbsp;Matrimony</i></b><br>
<br>
  This game is played with an entire pack of cards, by any number of
  persons from five to fourteen. It consists of five chances, usually
  marked on a board, or sheet of paper, as follows:<br>
<br>
<table summary="matrimony" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
<tr align="center" valign="middle">
	<td></td>

<br>
  Matrimony is generally played with counters, and the dealer puts what
  he pleases on each or any chance, the other players depositing each
  the same quantity, less one&mdash;that is, when the dealer stakes twelve,
  the rest of the company lay down eleven each. After this, two cards
  are dealt round to every one, beginning on the left; then to each
  person one other card, which is turned up, and he who so happens to
  get the ace of diamonds sweeps all. <br>
<br>
If it be not turned up, then each
  player shows his hand; and any of them having matrimony, intrigue,
  &amp;c, takes the counters on that point; and when two or more people
  happen to have a similar combination, the oldest hand has the
  preference; and, should any chance not be gained, it stands over to
  the next deal.&mdash;<i>Observe</i>: The ace of diamonds turned up takes
  the whole pool, but when in hand ranks only as any other ace; and if
  not turned up, nor any ace in hand, then the king, or next superior
  card, wins the chance styled best.

  Queen, Knave, and Game; two to Matrimony, two to Intrigue, and six to
  the nine of diamonds, styled the Pope. This dressing is, in some
  companies, at the individual expense of the dealer, though, the
  players usually contribute two stakes each towards the pool. <br>
<br>
The cards
  are then dealt round equally to every player, one turned up for trump,
  and about six or eight left in the stock to form stops. For example,
  if the ten of spades be turned up, the nine becomes a stop. The four
  kings, and the seven of diamonds, are always fixed stops, and the
  dealer is the only person permitted, in the course of the game, to
  refer occasionally to the stock for information what other cards are
  stops in their respective deals. If either ace, king, queen, or knave
  happen to be the turned-up-trump, the dealer may take whatever is
  deposited on that head; but when Pope be turned up, the dealer is
  entitled both to that and the game, besides a stake for every card
  dealt to each player. <br>
<br>
Unless the game be determined by Pope being
  turned up, the eldest hand begins by playing out as many cards as
  possible; first the stops, then Pope, if he have it, and afterwards
  the lowest card of his longest suit&mdash;particularly an ace, for that
  never can be led through. The other players follow, when they can, in
  sequence of the same suit, till a stop occurs. The player having the
  stop becomes eldest hand, and leads accordingly; and so on, until some
  player parts with all his cards, by which he wins the pool (game), and
  becomes entitled besides to a stake for every card not played by the
  others, except from any one holding Pope, which excuses him from
  paying. <br>
<br>
If Pope has been played, then the player having held it is not
  excused. King and Queen form what is called matrimony; queen and
  knave, when in the same hand, make intrigue; but neither these nor
  ace, king, queen, knave, or pope, entitle the holder to the stakes
  deposited thereon, unless played out; and no claim can be allowed
  after the board be dressed for the succeeding deal. In all such cases
  the stakes remain for future determination. Pope Joan needs only a
  little attention to recollect what stops have been made in the course
  of the play. For instance, if a player begin by laying down the eight
  of clubs, then the seven in another hand forms a stop, whenever that
  suit be led from any lower card; or the holder, when eldest, may
  safely lay it down, in order to clear his hand.

<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    The deal and partners are determined by cutting, as at whist, and
    the dealer gives four cards, one at a time, to each player, and
    either regularly as he deals, or by one, two, three, or four at a
    time, lays four more, face upwards, upon the board, and, after the
    first cards are played, four others are dealt to each person, until
    the pack be concluded; but it is only in the first deal that any
    cards are to be turned up.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    The deal is not lost when a card is faced by the dealer, unless
    in the first round, before any of the four cards are turned up upon
    the table; but if a card happen to be faced in the pack, before any
    of the said four be turned up, then the deal begins again.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Any person playing with less than four cards must abide by the
    loss; and should a card be found under the table, the player whose
    number is deficient takes the same.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Each person plays one card at a time, with which he may not only
    take at once every card of the same denomination upon the table, but
    likewise all that will combine therewith; as, for instance, a ten
    takes not only every ten, but also nine and ace, eight and deuce,
    seven and three, six and four, or two fives; and if he clear the
    board before the conclusion of the game, he is to score a point; and
    whenever any player cannot pair or combine, then he is to put down a
    card.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    The tricks are not to be counted before all the cards are played;
    nor may any trick but that last won be looked at, as every mistake
    must be challenged immediately.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    After all the pack is dealt out, the player who obtains the last
    trick sweeps all the cards then remaining unmatched upon the table
    and wins the game.</li></ol>

<a name="p113"></a><b><i>113. &nbsp;Vingt-un</i></b><br>
<br>
  Description of the Game.&mdash;The game of <i>Vingt-un</i>, or twenty-one,
  may be played by two or more persons; and, as the deal is
  advantageous, and often continues long with the same person, it is
  usual to determine it at the commencement by turning up the first ace,
  or knave.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p114"></a><b><i>114. &nbsp;Method of Playing Vingt-un</i></b><br>
<br>
  The cards must all be dealt out in succession, unless a natural
  Vingt-un occur, and in the meantime the pone, or youngest hand, should
  collect those that have been played, and shuffle them together, ready
  for the dealer, against the period when he shall have distributed the
  whole pack. The dealer first gives two cards, one at a time, to each
  player, including himself; then he asks each player in rotation,
  beginning with the eldest hand on the left, whether he stands or
  chooses another card. If he need another card, it must be given from
  off the top of the pack, and afterwards another, or more, if desired,
  till the points of the additional card or cards, added to those dealt,
  exceed or make twenty-one exactly, or such a number less than
  twenty-one as the player thinks fit to stand upon. <br>
<br>
When the points on
  the player's cards exceed twenty-one, he throws the cards on the
  table, face downwards, and pays the stake. The dealer is, in turn,
  entitled to draw additional cards; and, on taking a Vingt-un, receives
  double stakes from all who stand the game, except such other players,
  likewise having twenty-one, between whom it is thereby a drawn game.
  When any adversary has a Vingt-un, and the dealer not, then the
  opponent so having twenty-one, wins double stakes from him. In other
  cases, except a natural Vingt-un happen, the dealer pays single stakes
  to all whose numbers under twenty-one are higher than his own, and
  receives from those who have lower numbers; but nothing is paid or
  received by such players as have similar numbers to the dealer. When
  the dealer draws more than twenty-one, he pays to all who have not
  thrown up. In some companies ties pays the dealer.

<a name="p115"></a><b><i>115. &nbsp;Natural Vingt-un</i></b><br>
<br>
  Twenty-one, when dealt in a player's first two cards, is styled a
  <i>Natural</i>.  It should be declared at once, and entitles the
  holder to double stakes from the dealer, and to the deal, except it be
  agreed to pass the deal round. If the dealer turns up a natural he
  takes double stakes from all the players and retains the deal. If
  there be more than one natural, all after the first receive single
  stakes only. Aces count either eleven or one; court cards, ten; the
  rest according to their points.

<a name="p116"></a><b><i>116. &nbsp;The Odds of natural Vingt-un</i></b><br>
<br>
  depend upon the average number of cards likely to come under or exceed
  twenty-one; for example, if those in hand make fourteen exactly, it is
  seven to six that the one next drawn does not make the number of
  points above twenty-one; but if the points be fifteen, it is seven to
  six against that hand; yet it would not, therefore, always be prudent
  to stand at fifteen, for as the ace may be calculated both ways, it is
  rather above an even bet that the adversary's first two cards amount
  to more than fourteen. A natural Vingt-un may be expected once in
  seven coups when two, and twice in seven when four, people play, and
  so on, according to the number of players.

<a name="p118"></a><b><i>118. &nbsp;Ecarté</i></b><br>
<br>
  This game, which has lately revived in popularity, is played by two
  persons with a pack of cards from which the twos, threes, fours,
  fives, and sixes have been discarded. In the clubs it is usual to play
  with two packs, used alternately. The players cut for deal, the
  highest card deals. The pack is shuffled and the non-dealer cuts. The
  dealer then from the united pack gives five cards to each, beginning
  with his adversary, by twos and threes, or threes and twos; and always
  dealing in the same way throughout the game. The eleventh card is
  turned up for trump. If the turn-up be a king, the dealer marks one
  point; five points being game. The non-dealer looks at his cards, and
  if he be dissatisfied with them, he may propose&mdash;that is, change any
  or all of them for others from the stock, or remainder of the pack on
  the table. Should he propose, he says, "I propose," or "cards," and it
  is in the option of the dealer to give or refuse cards. When he
  decides to give, he says, "I accept," or "How many?" Should he refuse
  to change he says, "I decline," or "Play." The dealer may, if he
  accept the proposal, change any or all the cards in his own hand.
  <br>
<br>
Sometimes a second discard is allowed, but that must be by previous
  agreement. Of course the non-dealer may play without discarding, in
  which case the dealer must play his own hand without changing any of
  his cards. When the hands are arranged the non-dealer plays a card,
  which is won or lost by the playing of a superior card of the suit
  led. The second must follow suit, or win the trick if he can;
  otherwise he may throw any card he chooses. The order in value of the
  cards is&mdash;king, queen, knave, ace, ten, nine, eight, seven. The winner
  of the trick leads for the next trick, and so on, till the five cards
  on each side are played. The winner of three tricks scores one point;
  if he win the whole five tricks&mdash;the <i>rôle</i>&mdash;he scores two
  points; if he hold the king, he names it before playing his first
  card&mdash;"I mark king." Should the non-dealer play without proposing, and
  fail to make three tricks, his adversary marks two points; should the
  dealer refuse to accept and fail to win three tricks, his opponent
  scores two. The game is five up; that is, the player who first marks
  five points, wins. The score is marked by two cards, a three and a
  two, or by counters. The deal is taken alternately; but when the play
  is for rubbers it is usual to cut for deal at the end of each rubber.

<a name="p122"></a><b><i>122. &nbsp;Bézique</i></b><br>
<br>
  This fashionable game is played with two packs of cards, from which
  the twos, threes, fours, fives, and sixes, have been discarded. The
  sixty-four cards of both packs, shuffled well together, are then dealt
  out, eight to each player, by threes, twos, and threes; the
  seventeenth turned up for trump, and the rest left, face downwards, on
  the table. If the trump card be a seven, the dealer scores ten points.
  An incorrect deal or an exposed card necessitates a new deal, which
  passes to the other player. A trump card takes any card of another
  suit. Except trumping, the higher card, whether of the same suit or
  not, takes the trick&mdash;the ace ranking highest, the ten next, and then
  the king, queen, knave, nine, &amp;c When two cards of equal value are
  played, the first wins. <br>
<br>
<i>Some players require the winning card to be
  of the same suit as that led, unless trumped.</i> After each trick is
  taken, an additional card is drawn by each player from the top of the
  pack&mdash;the taker of the last trick drawing first, and so on till all
  the pack is exhausted, including the trump card. Players are not
  obliged to follow suit or trump until all the cards have been drawn
  from the pack. Tricks are of no value, except for the aces and tens
  they may contain. Tricks should not be looked at till the end of the
  deal, except by mutual consent. When a player plays without drawing,
  he must draw two cards next time, and his opponent scores ten. When a
  player draws out of turn, his opponent scores ten, if he has not drawn
  a card himself. When a player draws two cards instead of one, his
  opponent may decide which card is to be returned to the pack&mdash;it
  should not be placed at the top, but towards the middle of the pack. A
  player discovering his opponent holding more than eight cards, while
  he only holds eight, adds 100 to his score. Should both have more than
  their proper number there is no penalty, but each must play without
  drawing.

<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    Immediately after taking a trick, and then only, a player can
    make a Declaration; but he must do so before drawing another card.
     Only one Declaration can be made after each trick.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    If, in making a declaration, a player put down a wrong card or
    cards, either in addition to or in the place of any card or cards of
    that declaration, he is not allowed to score until he has taken
    another trick. Moreover, he must resume the cards, subject to their
    being called for as "faced" cards.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    The seven of trumps may be exchanged for the trump card, and
    for this exchange ten is scored. This exchange is made immediately
    after he has taken a trick, but he may make a declaration at the
    same time, the card exchanged not being used in such declaration.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Whenever the seven of trumps is played, except in the last eight
    tricks, the player scores ten for it, no matter whether he wins the
    trick or not.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    When all the cards are drawn from the pack, the players take up
    their eight cards. No more declarations can he made, and the play
    proceeds as at Whist, the ten ranking higher than the king, and the
    ace highest.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    In the last eight tricks the player is obliged to follow suit,
    and he must win the trick if possible, either by playing a higher
    card, or, if he has not a card of the same suit, by playing a trump.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    A player who revokes in the last eight tricks, or omits to take
    when he can, forfeits the eight tricks to his opponent.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    The last trick is the thirty-second, for which the winner
    scores ten. The game may be varied by making the last trick the
    twenty-fourth&mdash;the next before the last eight tricks. It is an
    unimportant point, but one that should be agreed upon before the
    game is commenced.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    After the last eight tricks are played, each player examines his
    cards, and for each ace and ten that he holds he scores ten.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    The non-dealer scores aces and tens first; and in case of a tie,
    the player scoring the highest number of points, less the aces and
    tens in the last deal, wins the game. If still a tie, the taker of
    the last trick wins.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    All cards played in error are liable to be called for as "faced"
    cards at any period of the game, except during the last eight
    tricks.</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    In counting forfeits a player may either add the points to his
    own score or deduct them from the score of his opponent.</li></ol>

<a name="p127"></a><b><i>127. &nbsp;Cautions in Bezique.</i></b><br>
<br>
  In playing Bézique, it is best to keep your tens till you can make
  them count; to retain your sequence cards as long as possible; to
  watch your opponent's play; to declare a royal marriage previous to
  declaring a sequence or double bezique; to make sure of the last trick
  but one in order to prevent your opponent from declaring; to declare
  as soon as you have an opportunity.

<a name="p128"></a><b><i>128. &nbsp;Three-Handed Bezique</i></b><br>
<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    The above rules hold good in the case of three-handed
    games&mdash;treble bézique counting 1,500. An extra pack of cards is
    required for the third other player; so that, in the case of three,
    the trump card is the twenty-fifth.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    The game is always played from left to right, the first player
    on the left of the dealer commencing. Three-handed bézique is
    sometimes played with two packs of cards, suppressing an eight, thus
    rendering them divisible by three.</li></ol>

<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    Four-handed Bezique may be played by partners decided either by
    choice or cutting.  Partners sit opposite each other, one collecting
    the tricks of both, and the other keeping the score, or each may
    keep his own score, which is preferable.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    A player may make a declaration immediately after his partner
    has taken a trick, and may inquire of his partner if he has anything
    to declare, before drawing.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Declarations must be made by each player separately, as in
    two-handed bézique.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    The above descriptions will serve to sufficiently acquaint the
    reader with the rules and modes of play adopted in this excellent
    game. Bézique is said to be of Swedish origin, and to have been
    introduced to English players through the medium of some Indian
    officers who had learned it of a Scandinavian comrade. Variations in
    the play occur in different companies. These, however, having been
    indicated above, need not be more particularly noted.</li></ol>

<a name="p130"></a><b><i>130. &nbsp;Napoleon</i></b><br>
<br>
  This popular game is played by four, five, or six persons with a full
  pack of cards, which take the same value as in Whist. The object of
  the game is to make tricks, which are paid to or received from the
  dealer at a fixed rate, a penny or more a trick, as previously
  arranged. The deal being decided in the usual way, the pack is cut and
  five cards are dealt one at a time to each player, beginning at the
  left. After every round the deal passes. Each player looks at his
  cards, the one to the left of the dealer being the first to declare.
  When he thinks he can make two or three tricks he says, "I go two," or
  "I go three." The next may perhaps think he can make four tricks; and
  if the fourth believes he can do better he declares Napoleon, and
  undertakes to win the whole five tricks. The players declare or pass
  in the order in which they sit; and a declaration once made cannot be
  recalled. <br>
<br>
The game then, proceeds. The first card played is the trump
  suit; and to win the trick, a higher card than that led in each suit
  must be played. The winner of the first trick leads for the second,
  and so on till each of the five tricks are played out. Each player
  must follow suit, but he is not bound to head the trick or to trump.
  Each card as played remains face upwards on the table. Supposing the
  stake to be a penny a trick, the declarer, if he win all the tricks he
  declared, receives from each of his adversaries a penny for each of
  the declared tricks; but if he fail to win the required number, he
  pays to each of them a penny a trick. For Napoleon he receives double
  stakes from each player; but failing to win the five tricks, he pays
  them single stakes. The game, though simple, requires good judgment
  and memory to play it well. In some companies it is varied by the
  introduction of a Wellington, which is a superior call after the
  Napoleon, and takes triple stakes; or a Sedan, in which the player
  undertakes to lose all his tricks. This declaration takes precedence
  of all the others. Each player may Pass, or decline to make a
  declaration; and when all the players pass, the deal is void.
  Occasionally a pool or kitty is made by each dealer paying a half
  stake; or the players may purchase new cards from the pack. In either
  case, the pool is taken by the winner of the first Napoleon, or
  divided according to arrangement at the close of the play. The best
  play in Napoleon is not to win tricks, but to co-operate in defeating
  the declaring hand.

  A game for two players, once very fashionable in France and of some

<a name="p133"></a><b><i>133. &nbsp;Lansquenet</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is a game for a large company, much played in France, where it is
  the custom to mix three, four, or more packs of cards together. In
  England it is played with one pack, after the following plan:&mdash;The
  dealer, who has rather an advantage, begins by shuffling the cards,
  and having them cut by any of the party. He then deals two cards on
  his left hand, turning them up; then one for himself, and a fourth,
  which he places in the middle of the table for the company, called the
  <i>rejouissance</i>.  Upon this card any or all of the company, except
  the dealer, may stake their counter or money, either a limited or
  unlimited sum, as may be agreed on, which the dealer is obliged to
  answer, by staking a sum equal to the whole put upon it by different
  players.  He continues dealing, and turning the cards upwards, one by
  one, till two of a sort appear: for instance, two aces, two deuces,
  &amp;c, which, in order to separate, and that no person may mistake for
  single cards, he places on each side of his own card; and as often as
  two, three, or the fourth card of a sort comes up, he always places
  them, as before, on each side of his own.

Any single card the company
  have a right to take and put their money upon, unless the dealer's own
  card happens to be double, which often occurs by this card being the
  same as one of the two cards which the dealer first of all dealt out
  on his left-hand. Thus he continues dealing till he brings either
  their cards, or his own. As long as his own card remains undrawn he
  wins; and whichever card comes up first, loses. If he draw or deal out
  the two cards on his left, which are called the hand-cards, before his
  own, he is entitled to deal again; the advantage of which is no other
  than being exempted from losing when he draws a similar card to his
  own, immediately after he has turned up one for himself. This game is
  often played more simply without the <i>rejouissance</i> card, giving
  every person round the table a card to put his money on. Sometimes it
  is played by dealing only two cards, one for the dealer, and another
  for the company. &mdash;Generally Lansquenet is played with counters
  instead of money. With counters at (say) a penny a dozen, it is a
  lively and amusing game.

<a name="p134"></a><b><i>134. &nbsp;Quinze or Fifteen</i></b><br>
<br>
  is played by two persons. The cards are shuffled by both players, and
  when they have cut for deal (which falls to the lot of him who cuts
  the lowest), the dealer has the liberty to shuffle them again. When
  this is done, the adversary cuts them; after which, the dealer gives
  one card to his opponent, and one to himself. Should the dealer's
  adversary not approve of his card, he is entitled to have as many
  cards given to him, one after the other, as will make fifteen, or come
  nearest to that number; which are usually given from the top of the,
  pack: for example&mdash;if he should have a deuce, and draw a five, which
  amounts to seven, he must continue going on, in expectation of coming
  nearer to fifteen. If he draw an eight, which will make just fifteen,
  he, as being eldest hand, is sure of winning the game. But if he
  overdraw himself, and make more than fifteen, he loses, unless the
  dealer should happen to do the same; which circumstance constitutes a
  drawn game; and the stakes are consequently doubled. In this manner
  they persevere, until one of them has won the game, by standing and
  being nearest to fifteen. At the end of each game the cards are packed
  and shuffled, and the players again cut for deal. The advantage is
  invariably or the side of the elder hand.

<a name="p135"></a><b><i>135. &nbsp;Solitaire</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is a game for one person, played on a board pierced with
  thirty-seven holes, in each one of which is placed a marble or peg.
  The art or motive of the game is to remove one marble and then to
  shift the rest about, so as to bring the last marble to the hole
  whence the first was removed. One marble or man takes any other over
  which it can leap into a vacant hole beyond; or any number of men in
  succession, so long as there is a hole into which it can go. An
  example of a game played will better explain the method, than any
  amount of verbal instruction.<br>
<br>
  Remove the marble from the centre hole; then bring the marble from 1
  in the upper limb of the diagram, to the centre, jumping over and
  taking the piece between. By following the direction of the figures,
  it will be found that the last place arrived at will be the centre
  from which you started. With practice and patience the Solitaire
  player will be able to start from and return to any hole on the board.<br>

<br>
  A game of mingled chance and skill, played on a board marked with
  points, and generally to be found inside the box draughtboard. The
  board has twenty-four points, coloured alternately red and blue; the
  implements of play are fifteen draught-men on each side, and the
  movements of the men are determined by the throw of two dice; each
  player being provided with a dice box and dies. It is an elaborate
  game to explain on paper, and would occupy too much space to be given

  This game is played by two or four persons, with twenty-eight pieces
  of oblong ivory, plain at the back, but on the face divided by a black
  line in the middle, and indented with spots, from one to a double-six,
  which pieces are a double-blank, ace-black, double-ace, deuce-blank,

<a name="p138"></a><b><i>138. &nbsp;Method of Play</i></b><br>
<br>
  At the commencement of the game the dominoes are well mixed together,
  with their faces upon the table. Each player draws one, and if four
  play, those who choose the two highest are partners against these who
  take the two lowest. Drawing the latter also serves to determine who
  is to lay down the first piece&mdash;a great advantage. Afterwards each
  player takes seven pieces at random. The eldest hand having laid down
  one, the next must pair him at either end of the piece he may choose,
  according to the number of pips, or the blank in the compartment of
  the piece; but whenever any one cannot match the part, either of the
  domino last put down, or of that unpaired at the other end of the row,
  then he says, "<i>Go</i>;" and the next is at liberty to play. Thus
  they play alternately, either until one party has played all his
  pieces, and thereby won the game, or till the game be <i>blocked</i>;
  that is, when neither party can play, by matching the pieces where
  unpaired at either end; then that player wins who has the smallest
  number of pips on the pieces remaining in his hand. It is to the
  advantage of every player to dispossess himself as early as possible
  of the heavy pieces, such as a double-six, five, four, &amp;c Sometimes,
  when two persons play, they take each only three or five pieces, and
  agree to <i>play</i> or <i>draw</i>, i.e., when one cannot come in, or
  pair the pieces upon the board at the end unmatched, he draws from the
  pieces in stock till he finds one to suit. There are various other
  ways of playing dominoes, but they are all dependent on the matching
  of the pips.

<a name="p146"></a><b><i>146. &nbsp;The Mazurka. </i></b><br>
<br>
  This dance is of Polish origin&mdash;first introduced into England by the
  Duke of Devonshire, on his return from Russia. It consists of twelve
  movements; and the first eight bars are played (as in quadrilles)
  before the first movement commences.

<a name="p147"></a><b><i>147. &nbsp;The Redowa Waltz </i></b><br>
<br>
is composed of: three parts, distinct from each other. 1st, The
  Pursuit. 2nd, The waltz called Redowa. 3rd, The waltz a Deux Temps,
  executed to a peculiar measure, and which, by a change of the rhythm,
  assumes a new character. The middle of the floor must he reserved for
  the dancers who execute the promenade, called the pursuit, while those
  who dance the waltz turn in a circle about the room. The position of
  the gentleman is the same as for the waltz. The gentleman sets out
  with the left foot, and the lady with the right. In the pursuit the
  position is different, the gentleman and his partner face, and take
  each other by the hand. They advance or fall back at pleasure, and
  balance in advance and backwards. To advance, the step of the pursuit
  is made by a glissade forward, without springing, <i>coupé</i> with
  the hind foot, and <i>jeté</i> on it. You recommence with the other
  foot, and so on throughout. The retiring step is made by a sliding
  step of the foot backwards, without spring, <i>jeté</i> with the front
  foot, and <i>coupé</i> with the one behind. It is necessary to advance
  well upon the sliding step, and to spring lightly in the two others,
  <i>sur place</i>, balancing equally in the <i>pas de poursuite</i>,
  which is executed alternately by the left in advance, and the right
  backwards. The lady should follow all the movements of her partner,
  falling back when he advances, and advancing when he falls back. Bring
  the shoulders a little forward at each sliding step, for they should
  always follow the movement of the leg as it advances or retreats; but
  this should not be too marked. When the gentleman is about to waltz,
  he should take the lady's waist, as in the ordinary waltz. The step of
  the Redowa, in turning, may be thus described. For the
  gentleman&mdash;<i>jete</i> of the left foot, passing before the lady.
  <i>Glissade</i> of the right foot behind to the fourth position
  aside&mdash;the left foot is brought to the third position behind&mdash;then the
  <i>pas de basque</i> is executed by the right foot, bringing it
  forward, and you recommence with the left. The <i>pas de basque</i>
  should be made in three very equal beats, as in the Mazurka. The lady
  performs the same steps as the gentleman, beginning by the <i>pas de
  basque</i> with the right foot. To waltz à deux temps to the measure
  of the Redowa, we should make each step upon each beat of the bar, and
  find ourselves at every two bars, the gentleman with his left foot
  forwards, and the lady with her right, that is to say, we should make
  one whole and one half step to every bar. The music is rather slower
  than for the ordinary waltz.

<br>
  The gentleman takes the lady's left hand with his right, moving one
  bar to the left by <i>glissade</i>, and two hops on his left foot,
  while the lady does the same to the right, on her right foot; at the
  second bar they repeat the same with the other foot&mdash;this is repeated
  for sixteen bars; they then waltz sixteen bars, <i>glissade</i> and
  two hops, taking care to occupy the time of two bars to get quite
  round. The gentleman now takes both hands of the lady, and makes the
  grand square&mdash;moving three bars to his left&mdash;at the fourth bar making
  two beats while turning the angle; his right foot is now moved forward
  to the other angle three bars&mdash;at the fourth, beat again while turning
  the angle; the same repeated for sixteen bars&mdash;the lady having her
  right foot forward when the gentleman has his left toot forward; the
  waltz is again repeated; after which several other steps are
  introduced, but which must needs be seen to be understood.

<br>
<i>First Waltz.</i>
  The gentleman hops the left foot well forward, then hack; and
  <i>glissades</i> half round.  He then hops the right foot forward and

  reverse feet. <br>
<br>
<i>Third.</i> The gentleman raises up the left foot,
  steps it lightly on the ground forward, then strikes the right heel
  smartly twice, and <i>glissades</i> half round. The same is then done
  with the other foot. The lady begins with the right foot.

<a name="p151"></a><b><i>151. &nbsp;Valse a Deux Temps.</i></b><br>
<br>
  This waltz contains, like the common waltz, three times, but
  differently divided. The first time consists of a gliding step; the
  second a chassez, including two times in one. A chassez is performed
  by bringing one leg near the other, then moving it forward, backward,
  right, left, and round. The gentleman begins by sliding to the left
  with his left foot, then performing a chassez towards the left with
  his right foot without turning at all during the first two times. He
  then slides backwards with his right leg, turning half round; after
  which he puts his left leg behind, to perform a chassez forward,
  turning then half round for the second time. The lady waltzes in the
  same manner, except that the first time she slides to the right with
  the right foot, and also performs the chassez on the right, and
  continues the same as the gentleman, except that she slides backwards
  with her right foot when the gentleman slides with his left foot to
  the left; and when the gentleman slides with his right foot backwards,
  she slides with the left foot to the left. To perform this waltz
  gracefully, care must be taken to avoid jumping, but merely to slide,
  and keep the knees slightly bent.

<br>
     There are a variety of other steps of a fancy character, but they can
  only be understood with the aid of a master, and even when well
  studied, must be introduced with care. The polka should be danced with
  grace and elegance, eschewing all <i>outré</i> and ungainly steps and
  gestures, taking care that the leg is not lifted too high, and that
  the dance is not commenced in too abrupt a manner. Any number of
  couples may stand up, and it is the privilege of the gentleman to form
  what figure he pleases, and vary it as often as his fancy and taste
  may dictate. <br>

  The gentleman holds the lady precisely as in the polka. Beginning with
  the left foot, he slides it forward, then brings up the right foot to
  the place of the left, slides the left foot forward, and springs or
  hops on this foot. This movement is repeated to the right. He begins
  with the right foot, slides it forward, brings up the left foot to the
  place of the right foot, slides the right foot forward again, and hops
  upon it. The gentleman springs twice on the left foot, turning half
  round; twice on the right foot; twice <i>encore</i> on the left foot,
  turning half round; and again twice on the right foot, turning half
  round. Beginning again, he proceeds as before. The lady begins with
  the right foot, and her step is the same in principle as the
  gentleman's. Vary, by a <i>reverse turn</i>; or by going in a straight
  line round the room. Double, if you like, each part, by giving four
  bars to the first part, and four bars to the second part. The
  <i>time</i> may be stated as precisely the same as in the polka; but
  let it not be forgotten that <i>La Schottische</i> ought to be danced
  <i>much slower</i>.

The trouble that is all your own:<br>
    Live it down!<br><br>

What though men <i>evil</i> call your <i>good!</i><br>
So <b>Christ</b> Himself, misunderstood,<br>
Was nailed unto a cross of wood!<br>
And now shall you for lesser pain,<br>
Your inmost soul for ever stain,<br>
By rendering evil back again?<br>
    Live it down!</blockquote>

<a name="p161"></a><b><i>161. &nbsp;Errors in Speaking</i></b><br>
<br>
  There are several kinds of errors in speaking. The most objectionable
  of them are those in which words are employed that are unsuitable to
  convey the meaning intended. Thus, a person wishing to express his
  intention of going to a given place, says, "I <i>propose</i> going,"
  when, in fact, he <i>purposes</i> going. The following affords an
  amusing illustration of this class of error:&mdash;A venerable matron was
  speaking of her son, who, she said, was quite stage-struck. "In fact,"
  remarked the old lady, "he is going to a <i>premature</i> performance
  this evening!" Considering that most <i>amateur</i> performances are
  <i>premature</i>, it cannot be said that this word was altogether
  misapplied; though, evidently, the maternal intention was to convey
  quite another meaning.

<a name="p162"></a><b><i>162. &nbsp;Other Errors </i></b><br>
<br>
  arise from the substitution of sounds similar to the words which
  should be employed; that is, spurious words instead of genuine ones.
  Thus, some people say "renumerative," when they mean "remunerative." A
  nurse, recommending her mistress to have a <i>perambulator</i> for her
  child, advised her to purchase a <i>preamputator!</i>

<a name="p163"></a><b><i>163. &nbsp;Other Errors (2)</i></b><br>
<br>
  are occasioned by imperfect knowledge of the English grammar: thus,
  many people say, "Between you and I," instead of "Between you and
  <i>me</i>." And there are numerous other departures from the rules of
  grammar, which will be pointed out hereafter.

  An ould man found, one day, a young gentleman's portmantle, as he were

  said, "Mally, here's a roul of lither, look, see, I suppoase some poor

  "Jan, I'ave saaved away a little money, by the bye, and as thee
  caan't read or write, thee shu'st go to scool" (he were then nigh

<br>
  Persons bred in these localities, and in Ireland and Scotland, retain
  more or less of their provincialisms; and, therefore, when they move
  into other districts, they become conspicuous for their peculiarities
  of speech. Often they appear vulgar and uneducated, when they are not
  so. It is, therefore, desirable for all persons to approach the
  recognised standard of correctness as nearly as possible.

  To correct these errors by a systematic course of study would involve

  numerous Rules and Hints, in a concise and simple form, which will be
  of great assistance to inquirers.  These Rules and Hints will be
  founded upon the authority of scholars, the usages of the bar, the

<a name="p181"></a><b><i>181. &nbsp;Rules and Hints for Correct Speaking.</i></b><br>
<br>
<ol start=1 type="1"><li>
    <i>Who</i> and <i>whom</i> are used in relation to persons, and
    <i>which</i> in relation to things. But it was once common to say,
    "the man <i>which.</i>" This should now be avoided. It is now usual
    to say, "Our Father <i>who</i> art in heaven," instead of
    "<i>which</i> art in heaven."</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="1"><li>

    <i>Whose</i> is, however, sometimes applied to things as well as
    to persons. We may therefore say, "The country <i>whose</i>
    inhabitants are free." Grammarians differ in opinion upon this
    subject, but general usage justifies the rule.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="1"><li>

    <i>Thou</i> is employed in solemn discourse, and you in common
    language. <i>Ye</i> (plural) is also used in serious addresses, and
    you in familiar language.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="1"><li>

    The uses of the word <i>It</i> are various, and very perplexing
    to the uneducated. It is not only used to imply persons, but things,
    and even, ideas, and therefore, in speaking or writing, its
    assistance is constantly required. The perplexity respecting this
    word arises from the fact that in using it in the construction of a
    long sentence, sufficient care is not taken to ensure that when
    <i>it</i> is employed it really points out or refers to the object
    intended. For instance, "It was raining when John set out in his
    cart to go to the market, and he was delayed so long that it was
    over before he arrived." Now what is to be understood by this
    sentence? Was the rain over? or the market? Either or both might be
    inferred from the construction of the sentence, which, therefore,
    should be written thus:&mdash; "It was raining when John set out in his
    cart to go to the market, and he was delayed so long that the market
    was over before he arrived."</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="1"><li>

    <i>Rule</i>.&mdash;After writing a sentence always look through it,
    and see that wherever the word It is employed, it refers to or
    carries the mind back to the object which it is intended to point
    out.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="1"><li>

    The general distinction between <i>This</i> and <i>That</i> may
    be thus defined: <i>this</i> denotes an object present or near, in
    time or place, <i>that</i> something which is absent.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="1"><li>

    <i>These</i> refers, in the same manner, to present objects,
    while <i>those</i> refers to things that are remote.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="1"><li>

    <i>Who</i> changes, under certain conditions, into <i>whose</i>
    and <i>whom</i>.  But <i>that</i> and <i>which</i> always remain the
    same.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="1"><li>

    <i>That</i> may be applied to nouns or subjects of all sorts; as,
    the <i>girl that</i> went to school, the <i>dog that</i> bit me, the
    <i>ship that</i> went to London, the <i>opinion that</i> he
    entertains.</li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="1"><li>

    The misuse of these pronouns gives rise to more errors in
    speaking and writing than any other cause.</li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="1"><li>

    When you wish to distinguish between two or more persons, say,
    "<i>Which</i> is the happy man?"&mdash;not <i>who</i>&mdash;"<i>Which</i> of
    those ladies do you admire?"</li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="1"><li>

    Instead of "<i>Who</i> do you think him to be?"&mdash;say,
    "<i>Whom</i> do you think him to be?"</li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="1"><li>

    <i>Whom</i> should I see?</li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="1"><li>

    To <i>whom</i> do you speak?</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="1"><li>

    <i>Who</i> said so?</li></ol>

<ol start=16 type="1"><li>

    <i>Who</i> gave it to you?</li></ol>

<ol start=17 type="1"><li>

    Of <i>whom</i> did you procure them?</li></ol>

<ol start=18 type="1"><li>

    <i>Who</i> was <i>he</i>?</li></ol>

<ol start=19 type="1"><li>

    <i>Who</i> do men say that <i>I</i> am?</li></ol>

<ol start=20 type="1"><li>

    <i>Whom</i> <a name="frp181f1">do</a> they represent <i>me</i> to be<a href="#p181f1"><sup>1</sup></a>?</li></ol>

<ol start=21 type="1"><li>

    In many instances in which <i>who</i> is used as an
    interrogative, it does not become <i>whom</i>; as "<i>Who</i> do you
    speak to?" "<i>Who</i> do you expect?" "<i>Who</i> is she married
    to?" "<i>Who</i> is this reserved for?" "<i>Who</i> was it made by?" Such sentences are found in the writings of our best authors, and
    it would be presumptuous to consider them as ungrammatical. If the
    word <i>whom</i> should be preferred, then it would be best to say,
    "For <i>whom</i> is this reserved?" &amp;c</li></ol>

<ol start=22 type="1"><li>

    Instead of "After <i>which</i> hour," say "After <i>that</i>
    hour."</li></ol>

<ol start=23 type="1"><li>

    <i>Self</i> should never be added to <i>his, their, mine, or
    thine.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=24 type="1"><li>

    <i>Each</i> is used to denote every individual of a number.</li></ol>

<ol start=25 type="1"><li>

    <i>Every</i> denotes all the individuals of a number.</li></ol>

<ol start=26 type="1"><li>

    <i>Either</i> and <i>or</i> denote an alternative: "I will take
    <i>either</i> road, at your pleasure;" "I will take this <i>or</i>
    that."</li></ol>

<ol start=27 type="1"><li>

    <i>Neither</i> means <i>not either</i>; and <i>nor</i> means
    <i>not the other</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=28 type="1"><li>

    <i>Either</i> is sometimes used for <i>each</i>&mdash;"Two thieves
    were crucified, on <i>either</i> side one."</li></ol>

<ol start=29 type="1"><li>

    "Let <i>each</i> esteem others as good as themselves," should
    be, "Let <i>each</i> esteem others as good as <i>himself</i>."</li></ol>

<ol start=30 type="1"><li>

    "There are bodies <i>each</i> of which <i>are</i> so small,"
    should be, "each of which <i>is</i> so small."</li></ol>

<ol start=31 type="1"><li>

    Do not use double superlatives, such as <i>most straightest</i>,
    <i>most highest</i>, <i>most finest</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=32 type="1"><li>

    The term <i>worser</i> has gone out of use; but <i>lesser</i> is
    still retained.</li></ol>

<ol start=33 type="1"><li>

    The use of such words as <i>chiefest</i>, <i>extremest</i>, &amp;c,
    has become obsolete, because they do not give any superior force to
    the meanings of the primary words, <i>chief</i>, <i>extreme</i>, &amp;c</li></ol>

<ol start=34 type="1"><li>

    Such expressions as <i>more impossible</i>, <i>more
    indispensable</i>, <i>more universal</i>, <i>more
    uncontrollable</i>, <i>more unlimited</i>, &amp;c, are objectionable,
    as they really enfeeble the meaning which it is the object of the
    speaker or writer to strengthen.  For instance, <i>impossible</i>
    gains no strength by rendering it <i>more</i> impossible. This class
    of error is common with persons who say, "A <i>great large</i>
    house," "A <i>great big</i> animal," "A <i>little small</i> foot,"
    "A <i>tiny little</i> hand."</li></ol>

<ol start=35 type="1"><li>

    <i>Here</i>, <i>there</i>, and <i>where</i>, originally denoting
    place, may now, by common consent, he used to denote other meanings;
    such as, "<i>There</i> I agree with you," "<i>Where</i> we differ,"
    "We find pain <i>where</i> we expected pleasure," "<i>Here</i> you
    mistake me."</li></ol>

<ol start=36 type="1"><li>

    <i>Hence</i>, <i>whence</i>, and <i>thence</i>, denoting
    departure, &amp;c, may be used without the word <i>from</i>. The idea
    of <i>from</i> is included in the word <i>whence</i>&mdash;therefore it
    is unnecessary to say "<i>From whence</i>."</li></ol>

<ol start=37 type="1"><li>

    <i>Hither</i>, <i>thither</i>, and <i>whither</i>, denoting to a
    place, have generally been superseded by <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>,
    and <i>where</i>. But there is no good reason why they should not be
    employed. If, however, they are used, it is unnecessary to add the
    word <i>to</i>, because that is implied&mdash;"<i>Whither</i> are you
    going?" "<i>Where</i> are you going?" Each of these sentences is
    complete. To say, "Where are you going <i>to</i>?" is redundant.</li></ol>

<ol start=38 type="1"><li>

    Two <i>negatives</i> destroy each other, and produce an
    affirmative. "<i>Nor</i> did he <i>not</i> observe them," conveys
    the idea that he <i>did</i> observe them.</li></ol>

<ol start=39 type="1"><li>

    But negative assertions are allowable.  "His manners are not
    unpolite," which implies that his manners are, in some degree,
    marked by politeness.</li></ol>

<ol start=40 type="1"><li>

    Instead of "I <i>had</i> rather walk," say "I <i>would</i>
    rather walk."</li></ol>

<ol start=41 type="1"><li>

    Instead of "I <i>had better</i> go," say "It were better that I
    should go."</li></ol>

<ol start=42 type="1"><li>

    Instead of "I doubt not <i>but</i> I shall be able to go," say
    "I doubt not that I shall be able to go."</li></ol>

<ol start=43 type="1"><li>

    Instead of "Let you and <i>I</i>," say "Let you and me."</li></ol>

    Instead of "I am not so tall as <i>him</i>," say "I am not so

<a name="p182"></a><b><i>182. &nbsp;Pronunciation</i></b><br>
<br>
  Accent is a particular stress or force of the voice upon certain
  syllables or words. This mark ' in printing denotes the syllable upon
  which the stress or force of the voice should he placed.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><p align="right"><i><span style="color: #A82C28">There are 9,000 Cells in a Square Foot of Honeycomb.</span></i></p><br>

<a name="p183"></a><b><i>183. &nbsp;A Word may have more than One Accent. </i></b><br>
<br>
  Take as an instance aspiration. In uttering this word we give a marked
  emphasis of the voice upon the first and third syllables, and
  therefore those syllables are said to be accented. The first of these
  accents is less distinguishable than the second, upon which we dwell
  longer, therefore the second accent in point of order is called the
  primary, or chief accent of the word.

<a name="p184"></a><b><i>184. &nbsp;When the full Accent falls on a Vowel</i></b><br>
<br>
  that vowel should have a long sound, as in <i>vo'cal;</i> but when
  it, falls on or after a consonant, the preceding vowel has a short
  sound, as in <i>hab'it</i>.

<a name="p185"></a><b><i>185. &nbsp;To obtain a Good Knowledge of Pronunciation</i></b><br>
<br>
  it is advisable for the reader to listen to the examples given by good
  speakers, and by educated persons. We learn the pronunciation of
  words, to a great extent, by <i>imitation</i>, just as birds acquire
  the notes of other birds which may be near them.

<a name="p186"></a><b><i>186. &nbsp;Double Meaning</i></b><br>
<br>
  But it will be very important to bear in mind that there are many
  words having a double meaning or application, and that the difference
  of meaning is indicated by the difference of the accent. Among these
  words, <i>nouns</i> are distinguished from <i>verbs</i> by this means:
  <i>nouns</i> are mostly accented on the first syllable, and
  <i>verbs</i> on the last.
<br>

<a name="p187"></a><b><i>187. &nbsp;Noun signifies Name</i></b><br>
<br>
  <i>Nouns</i> are the names of persons and things, as well as of things
  not material and palpable, but of which we have a conception and
  knowledge, such as <i>courage</i>, <i>firmness</i>, <i>goodness</i>,
  <i>strength</i>; and <i>verbs</i> express <i>actions, movements,</i>
  &amp;c If the word used signifies that anything has been done, or is
  being done, or is, or is to be done, then that word is a <i>verb</i>.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><p align="right"><i><span style="color: #A82C28">It would Take 27,600 Spiders to Produce 1 lb. of Web</span></i></p><br>

<a name="p188"></a><b><i>188. &nbsp;Examples of the above.</i></b><br>
<br>
  Thus when we say that anything is "an <b>in</b>'sult," that word is a
  <i>noun</i>, and is accented on the first syllable; but when we say he
  did it "to in<b>sult</b>sult' another person," the word in<b>sult</b>' implies
  <i>acting</i>, and becomes a verb, and should be accented on the last
  syllable. The effect is, that, in speaking, you should employ a
  different pronunciation in the use of the same word, when uttering
  such sentences as these:&mdash;"What an<b> in</b>'sult!" "Do you mean to in<b>sult</b>'
  me?" In the first sentence the stress of voice must be laid upon the
  first syllable, <i><b>in</b>'</i>, and in the latter case upon the second
  syllable, <i><b>sult</b>'</i>.

<br>
  A list of nearly all the words that are liable to this variation is
  given in the following page. It will be noticed that those in the
  first column, having the accent on the first syllable, are mostly
  nouns; and that those in the second column, which have the accent on
  the second and final syllable, are mostly verbs:<br>

<br>
  The most objectionable error of the Cockney, that of substituting the
  <i>v</i> for the <i>w</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>, is, we believe,
  pretty generally abandoned. Such sentences as "Are you going to Vest
  Vickkam?" "This is wery good weal," &amp;c, were too intolerable to be
  retained. Moreover, there has been a very able schoolmaster at work
  during the past forty years. This schoolmaster is no other than the
  loquacious Mr. <i>Punch</i>, from whose works we quote a few admirable
  exercises:<br>

    wooden leg, as come with&mdash;" "No, no&mdash;not that party. The party, you

    told me as he can't agree with that other party, and he says that if
    another party can't be found to make it all square, he shall look
    out for a party as will."&mdash;(<i>And so on for half an hour.</i>)</li></ol>

 Londoners who desire to correct the defects of their utterance
    cannot do better than to exercise themselves frequently upon those
    words respecting which they have been in error.

<a name="p193"></a><b><i>193. &nbsp;Hints for the Correction of the Irish Brogue</i></b><br>
<br>
  According to the directions given by Mr. B. H. Smart, an Irishman
  wishing to throw off the brogue of his mother country should avoid
  hurling out his words with a superfluous quantity of breath. It is not
  <i>broadher</i> and <i>widher</i> that he should say, but the
  <i>d</i>, and every other consonant, should be neatly delivered by the
  tongue, with as little riot, clattering, or breathing as possible.
  Next let him drop the roughness or rolling of the <i>r</i> in all
  places but the beginning of syllables; he must not say <i>stor-rum</i>
  and <i>far-rum</i>, but let the word be heard in one smooth syllable.
  He should exercise himself until he can convert <i>plaze</i> into
  <i>please</i>, <i>planty</i> into <i>plenty</i>, <i>Jasus</i> into
  <i>Jesus</i>, and so on. He should modulate his sentences, so as to
  avoid directing his accent all in one manner&mdash;from the acute to the
  grave. Keeping his ear on the watch for good examples, and exercising
  himself frequently upon them, he may become master of a greatly
  improved utterance.

<a name="p194"></a><b><i>194. &nbsp;Hints for Correcting the Scotch Brogue.</i></b><br>
<br>
  The same authority remarks that as an Irishman uses the closing accent
  of the voice too much, so a Scotchman has the contrary habit, and is
  continually drawling his tones from the grave to the acute, with an
  effect which, to southern ears, is suspensive in character. The smooth
  guttural <i>r</i> is as little heard in Scotland as in Ireland, the
  trilled <i>r</i> taking its place. The substitution of the former
  instead of the latter must be a matter of practice. The peculiar sound
  of the <i>u</i>, which in the north so of ten borders on the French
  <i>u</i>, must be compared with the several sounds of the letter as
  they are heard in the south; and the long quality which a Scotchman is
  apt to give to the vowels that ought to be essentially short, must he
  clipped. In fact, aural observation and lingual exercise are the only
  sure means to the end; so that a Scotchman going to a well for a
  bucket of water, and finding a countryman bathing therein, would not
  exclaim, "Hey, Colin, dinna ye ken the water's for drink, and nae for
  bathin'?"

  it is scarcely necessary to say much, as the foregoing advice applies
  to them. One militiaman  exclaimed to another, "Jim, you hain't in
  step" "Bain't I?" exclaimed the other; "well, change yourn!" Whoever
  desires knowledge must strive for it. It must not be dispensed with
  after the fashion of Tummus and Jim, who held the following dialogue
  upon a vital question:&mdash;<i>Tummus</i>. "I zay, Jim, be you a
  purtectionist?" <i>Jim</i>. "E'as I be." <i>Tummus</i>. "Wall, I zay,
  Jim, what <i>be</i> purtection?" <i>Jim</i>. " Loa'r, Tummus, doan't

<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    <b>C</b> before <i>a, o</i>, and <i>u</i>, and in some other situations,
    is a close articulation, like <i>k</i>. Before <i>e, i</i>, and
    <i>y, c</i> is precisely equivalent to <i>s</i> in <i>same,
    this</i>; as in <i>cedar, civil, cypress, capacity</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    <b>E</b> final indicates that the preceding vowel is long; as in hate,
    mete, sire, robe, lyre, abate, recede, invite, remote, intrude.</li></ol>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    <b>E</b> final indicates that <i>c</i> preceding has the sound of
    <i>s</i>; as in <i>lace, lance;</i> and that <i>g</i> preceding has
    the sound of <i>j</i>, as in <i>charge, page, challenge</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    <b>E</b> final, in proper English words, never forms a syllable, and in
    the most-used words, in the terminating unaccented syllable it is
    silent. Thus, <i>motive, genuine, examine, granite</i>, are
    pronounced <i>motiv, genuin, examin, granit</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    <b>E</b> final, in a few words of foreign origin, forms a syllable; as
    <i>syncope, simile</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    <b>E</b> final is silent after <i>l</i> in the following
    terminations,&mdash;<i>ble, cle, dle, fle, gle, kle, ple, tle, zle;</i>
    as in <i>able, manacle, cradle, ruffle, mangle, wrinkle, supple,
    rattle, puzzle</i>, which are pronounced <i>a'bl, mana'cl, cra'dl,
    ruf'fl man'gl, wrin'kl, sup'pl, puz'zl</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    <b>E</b> is usually silent in the termination <i>en</i>; as in
    <i>token, broken;</i> pronounced <i>tokn, brokn</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    <b>ous</b>, in the termination of adjectives and their derivatives,
    is pronounced <i>us;</i> as in <i>gracious, pious, pompously</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    <b>ce, ci, ti</b> before a vowel, have the sound of <i>sh;</i> as in
    <i>cetaceous, gracious, motion, partial, ingratiate;</i> pronounced
    <i>cetashus, grashus, moshun, parshal, ingrashiate.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    <b>si</b>, after an accented vowel, is pronounced like <i>zh;</i> as in
    <i>Ephesian, confusion;</i> pronounced <i>Ephezhan, confuzhon</i></li></ol>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    When <b>ci</b> or <b>ti</b> precede similar combinations, as in
    pron<i>u</i>n<i>ci</i>a<i>ti</i>on, nego<i>ti</i>a<i>ti</i>on, they
    should be pronounced <i>ze</i> instead of <i>she</i>, to prevent a
    repetition of the latter syllable; as <i>pronunceashon</i> instead of
    <i>pronunsheashon.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    <b>gh</b>, both in the middle and at the end of words ia silent; as in
    <i>caught, bought, fright, nigh, sigh;</i> pronounced <i>caut, baut,
    frite, ni, si.</i> In the following exceptions, however, <i>gh</i>
    are pronounced as <i>f:&mdash;cough, chough, clough, enough, laugh,
    rough, slough, tough, trough.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    When <b>wh</b> begins a word, the aspirate <i>h</i> precedes <i>w</i>
    in pronunciation; as in <i>what, whiff, whale;</i> pronounced
    <i>hwat, hwiff, hwale, w</i> having precisely the sound of
    <i>oo</i>, French <i>ou</i>. In the following words <i>w</i> is
    silent:&mdash;<i>who, whom, whose, whoop, whole.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    <b>h</b> after <i>r</i> has no sound or use; as in <i>rheum,
    rhyme</i>; pronounced <i>reum, ryme</i>.</li></ol>

<ol start=15 type="i"><li>

    <b>h</b> should be sounded in the middle of words; as in
    fore<i>h</i>ead, ab<i>h</i>or, be<i>h</i>old, ex<i>h</i>aust,
    in<i>h</i>abit, un<i>h</i>orse.</li></ol>

<ol start=16 type="i"><li>

    H should always be sounded except in the following
    words:&mdash;heir, herb, honest, honour, hospital, hostler, hour, humour,
    and humble, and all their derivatives,&mdash;such as humorously, derived
    from humour.</li></ol>

<ol start=17 type="i"><li>

    <b>k</b> and <b>g</b> are silent before <i>n</i>; as <i>know, gnaw;</i>
    pronounced <i>no, naw.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=18 type="i"><li>

    <b>w</b> before <i>r</i> is silent; as in <i>wring, wreath;</i>
    pronounced <i>ring, reath.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=19 type="i"><li>

    <b>b</b> after <i>m</i> is silent; as in <i>dumb, numb;</i> pronounced
    <i>dum, num.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=20 type="i"><li>

    <b>L</b> before <i>k</i> is silent; as in <i>balk, walk, talk;</i>
    pronounced <i>bauk, wauk, tauk.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=21 type="i"><li>

    <b>ph</b> has the sound of <i>f;</i> as in <i>philosophy;</i>
    pronounced <i>filosofy.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=22 type="i"><li>

    <b>ng</b> has two sounds, one as in <i>anger</i>, the other as in
    <i>fin-ger.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=23 type="i"><li>

    <b>n</b>after <i>m</i>, and closing a syllable, is silent; as in
    <i>hymn, condemn.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=24 type="i"><li>

    <b>p</b>before <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> is mute; as in <i>psalm,
    pseudo, ptarmigan;</i> pronounced <i>sarm, sudo, tarmigan.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=25 type="i"><li>

    <b>r</b> has two sounds, one strong and vibrating, as at the
    beginning of words and syllables, such as <i>robber, reckon,
    error;</i> the other as at the terminations of words, or when
    succeeded by a consonant, as <i>farmer, morn.</i></li></ol>

<ol start=26 type="i"><li>

    Before the letter <b>r</b>, there is a slight sound of <i>e</i>
    between the vowel and the consonant. Thus, <i>bare, parent,
    apparent, mere, mire, more, pure, pyre,</i> are pronounced nearly
    <i>baer, paerent, appaerent, me-er,mier, moer,puer, pyer.</i> This
    pronunciation proceeds from the peculiar articulation of <i>r</i>,
    and it occasions a slight change of the sound of <i>a</i>, which can
    only be learned by the ear.</li></ol>

<ol start=27 type="i"><li>

    There are other rules of pronunciation affecting the
    combinations of vowels, &amp;c; but as they are more difficult to
    describe, and as they do not relate to errors which are commonly
    prevalent, we shall content ourselves with giving examples of them
    in the following list of words. When, a syllable in any word in this
    list is printed in <b>bold</b>, the accent or stress of voice should be
    laid on that syllable.</li></ol>

    Punctuation teaches the method of placing <i>Points</i>, in written

<a name="p205"></a><b><i>205. &nbsp;Misplacing</i></b><br>
<br>
of even so slight a point, or pause, as the comma, will often alter
  the meaning of a sentence. The contract made for lighting the town of
  Liverpool, during the year 1819, was thrown void by the misplacing of
  a comma in the advertisements, thus:

    <blockquote>"The lamps at present are about 4,050, and have in general two
    spouts each, composed of not less than twenty threads of cotton."  </blockquote>

  The contractor would have proceeded to furnish each lamp with the said
  twenty threads, but this being but half the usual quantity, the
  commissioners discovered that the difference arose from the comma
  following instead of preceding the word <i>each.</i> The parties
  agreed to annul the contract, and a new one was ordered.

    <blockquote>Death waits not for storm nor sunshine. Within a dwelling in one of
    the upper streets, respectable in appearance, and furnished with

  book, instead of John, his book; or to show the omission of parts of
  words, as Glo'ster, for Gloucester&mdash;tho' for though. These
  abbreviations should be avoided as much as possible. Cobbett says the
  apostrophe "ought to be called the mark of <i>laziness</i> and
  vulgarity." The first use, however, of which we gave an example, is a
  necessary and proper one.

<a name="p214"></a><b><i>214. &nbsp;Hints upon Spelling</i></b><br>
<br>
The following rules will be found of great assistance in writing,
  because they relate to a class of words about the spelling of which
  doubt and hesitation are frequently felt:<br>
<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    All words of one syllable ending in <i>l</i>, with a single vowel
    before it, have double <i>l</i> at the close; as, <i>mill</i>,
    <i>sell</i>.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    All words of one syllable ending in <i>l</i>, with a double
    vowel before it, have one <i>l</i> only at the close: as,
    <i>mail</i>, <i>sail</i>.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Words of one syllable ending in <i>l</i>, when compounded,
    retain but one <i>l</i> each; as, <i>fulfil</i>, <i>skilful</i>.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Words of more than one syllable ending in <i>l</i> have one
    <i>l</i> only at the close; as, <i>delightful</i>, <i>faithful</i>;
    except <i>befall</i>, <i>downfall</i>, <i>recall</i>, <i>unwell</i>,
    &amp;c.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    All derivatives from words ending in <i>l</i> have one <i>l</i>
    only; as, <i>equality</i>, from <i>equal</i>; <i>fulness</i>, from
    <i>full</i>; except they end in <i>er</i> or <i>ly</i>; as,
    <i>mill</i>, <i>miller</i>; <i>full</i>, <i>fully</i>.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    All participles in <i>ing</i> from verbs ending in <i>e</i> lose
    the <i>e</i> final; as <i>have, having; amuse, amusing;</i> unless
    they come from verbs ending in double <i>e</i>, and then they
    retain, both; as, <i>see, seeing; agree, agreeing.</i></li></ol><br>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    All adverbs in <i>ly</i> and nouns in <i>ment</i> retain the
    <i>e</i> final of the primitives; as, <i>brave, bravely; refine,
    refinement;</i> except <i>acknowledgment, judgment,</i> &amp;c.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    All derivatives from words ending in <i>er</i> retain the
    <i>e</i> before the <i>r;</i> as, <i>refer, reference;</i> except
    <i>hindrance,</i> from <i>hinder; remembrance</i> from <i>remember;
    disastrous</i> from <i>disaster; monstrous</i> from <i>monster;
    wondrous</i> from <i>wonder; cumbrous</i> from <i>cumber,</i> &amp;c.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=9 type="i"><li>

    Compound words, if both end not in <i>i</i>, retain their
    primitive parts entire; as, <i>millstone, changeable, graceless;</i>
    except <i>always, also, deplorable, although, almost, admirable,</i>
    &amp;c.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    All words of one syllable ending in a consonant, with a single
    vowel before it, double that consonant in derivatives; as, <i>sin,
    sinner; ship, shipping; big, bigger; glad, gladder,</i> &amp;c.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    Words of one syllable ending in a consonant, with a double vowel
    before it, do not double the consonant in derivatives: as, <i>sleep,
    sleepy; troop, troopers.</i></li></ol><br>

<ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    All words of more than one syllable ending in a single
    consonant, preceded by a single vowel, and accented on the last
    syllable, double that consonant in derivatives; as, <i>commit,
    committee; compel, compelled; appal, appalling; distil,
    distiller.</i></li></ol><br>

<ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    Nouns of one syllable ending in <i>y</i> preceded by a
    consonant, change <i>y</i> into <i>ies</i> in the plural; and verbs
    ending in <i>y</i>, preceded by a consonant, change <i>y</i> into
    <i>ies</i> in the third person singular of the present tense, and
    into <i>ied</i> in the past tense and past participle, as, <i>fly,
    flies; I apply, he applies; we reply, we replied, or have
    replied.</i> If the <i>y</i> be preceded by a vowel, this rule is
    not applicable; as <i>key, keys; I play, he plays;</i> we have
    <i>enjoyed</i> ourselves.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    Compound words whose primitives end in <i>y</i> change <i>y</i>
    into <i>i</i>; as, <i>beauty, Beautiful; lovely, loveliness.</i></li></ol>

<a name="p215"></a><b><i>215. &nbsp;H or no H? That is the Question.</i></b><br>
<br>
Few things point so directly to the want of <i>cultivation</i> as the
  misuse of the letter H by persons in conversation. We hesitate to
  assert that this common defect in speaking indicates the absence of
  <i>education</i>&mdash;for, to our surprise, we have heard even educated
  persons frequently commit this common, and vulgar error. Now, for the
  purpose of assisting those who desire to improve their mode of
  speaking, we intend to tell a little story about our next door
  neighbour, Mrs. Alexander Hitching,&mdash;or, as she frequently styled
  herself, with an air of conscious dignity, Mrs. <b>Halexander 'Itching</b>.
  Her husband was a post-captain of some distinction, seldom at home,
  and therefore Mrs. A. H. (or, as she rendered it, Mrs. H. I.) felt it
  incumbent upon herself to represent her own dignity, and the dignity
  of her husband also. Well, this Mrs. Hitching was a next-door
  neighbour of ours&mdash;a most agreeable lady in many respects, middle
  aged, good looking, uncommonly fond of talking, of active, almost of
  fussy habits, very good tempered and good natured, but with a most
  unpleasant habit of misusing the letter H to such a degree that our
  sensitive nerves have often been shocked when in her society. But we
  must beg the reader, if Mrs. H. should be an acquaintance of his, not
  to breathe a word of our having written this account of her&mdash;or there
  would be no limit to her "<i>h</i>indignation." And, as her family is
  very numerous, it will be necessary to keep the matter as quiet as can
  be, for it will scarcely be possible to mention the subject anywhere,
  without "'orrifying" some of her relations, and instigating them to
  make Mrs. H. become our "<i>h</i>enemy," instead of remaining, as we
  wish her to do, our intimate friend.<br>
<br>
  One morning, Mrs. H. called upon me, and asked me to take a walk,
  saying that it was her <i>h</i>object to look out for an 'ouse, as her
  lease had nearly terminated; and as she had often heard her dear
  'Itching say that he would like to settle in the neighbourhood of
  'Ampstead 'Eath, she should like me to assist her by my judgment in
  the choice of a residence.

"I shall he most happy to accompany you," I said.<br>
<br>
    "I knew you would," said she; "and I am sure a <i>h</i>our or two in
    your society will give me pleasure. It's so long since we've 'ad a
    gossip. Besides which, I want a change of <i>h</i>air."<br>
<br>
    I glanced at her peruke, and for a moment laboured under the idea
    that she intended to call at her hairdresser's; but I soon
    recollected.<br>
<br>
    "I suppose we had better take the <i>h</i>omnibus," she remarked,
    "and we can get out at the foot of the 'ill."<br>
<br>
    I assented, and in a few minutes we were in the street, in the line
    of the omnibus, and one of those vehicles soon appearing&mdash;<br>
<br>
    "Will you 'ail it?" inquired she.<br>
<br>
    So I hailed it at once, and we got in. Now Mrs. H. was so fond of
    talking that the presence of strangers never restrained her&mdash;a fact
    which I have often had occasion to regret. She was no sooner within
    the omnibus than she began remarking upon <i>h</i>inconveaience of
    such vehicles, because of their smallness, and the <i>h</i>insolence
    of many of the conductors. She thought that the proprietors ought
    only to 'ire men upon whose civility they could depend. Then she
    launched out into larger topics&mdash;said she thought that the
    <i>H</i>emperor of <i>H</i>austria&mdash;(here I endeavoured to interrupt
    her by asking whether she had any idea of the part of Hampstead she
    would like; but she would complete her remarks by saying) &mdash;must be
    as 'appy as the days are long, now that the <i>H</i>empress had
    presented him with a <i>hare</i> to the throne! (Some of the
    passengers smiled, and turning round, looked out of the windows.)<br>
<br>
    I much wished for our arrival at the spot where we should alight,
    for she commenced a story about an 'andsome young nephew of hers,
    who was a distinguished <i>h</i>officer of the <i>h</i>army. This
    was suggested to her, no doubt, by the presence in the omnibus of a
    fine-looking young fellow with a moustache. She said that at present
    her nephew was stationed in <i>h</i>ireland; but he expected soon to
    be <i>h</i>ordered to South <i>H</i>africa.<br>
<br>
    The gentleman with the moustache seemed much amused, and smilingly
    asked her whether her nephew was at all <i>h</i>ambitious? I saw
    that he (the gentleman with the moustache) was jesting, and I would
    have given anything to have been released from the unpleasant
    predicament I was in. But what was more annoyance when Mrs. H.
    proceeded to say to this youth, whose face was radiant with humour,
    that it was the 'ight of her nephew's <i>h</i>ambition to serve his
    country in the <i>h</i>our of need; and then she proceeded to ask
    her fellow-traveller his opinion, of the <i>h</i>upshot of the
    war&mdash;remarking that she 'oped it would soon be <i>h</i>over!<br>
<br>
    At this moment I felt so nervous that I pulled out my handkerchief,
    and endeavoured to create a diversion by making a loud nasal noise,
    and remarking that I thought the wind very cold, when an accident
    happened which took us all by surprise: one of the large wheels of
    the minibus dropped off, and all the passeigers were jostled down
    into a corner but, fortunately without serious injury. Mrs. H.,
    however, happening to be under three or four persons, raised a loud
    cry for "'elp! 'elp!" She was speedily got out, when she assured us
    that she was not 'urt; but she was in such a state of
    <i>h</i>agitation that she wished to be taken to a chemist's shop,
    to get some <i>h</i>aromatic vinegar, or some <i>Hoe</i> de Cologne!
    The chemist was exceedingly polite to her, for which she said she
    could never express her <i>h</i>obligations&mdash;an assertion which
    seemed to me to be literally true. It was some time before she
    resumed her accustomed freedom of conversation; but as we ascended
    the hill she explained to me that she should like to take the house
    as tenant from '<i>ear</i> to <i>'ear!</i>&mdash;but she thought
    landlords would <i>h</i>object to such an agreement, as when they
    got a good tenant they liked to 'old 'im as long as they could. She
    expressed an opinion that 'Amstead must be very 'ealthy, because it
    was so 'igh <i>h</i>up.<br>
<br>
    We soon reached the summit of the hill, and turned through a lane
    which led towards the Heath, and in which villas and cottages were
    smiling on each side. "Now, there's a <i>h</i>elegant little place!"
    she exclaimed, "just suited to my <i>h</i>ideas&mdash;about <i>h</i>eight
    rooms and a <i>h</i>oriel <i>h</i>over the <i>h</i>entrance." But it
    was not to let&mdash;so we passed on.<br>
<br>
    Presently, she saw something likely to suit her, and as there was a
    bill in the window, "To be let&mdash;Enquire Within," she gave a loud
    rat-a-tat-tat at the door.<br>
<br>
    The servant opened it.<br>
<br>
    "I see this 'ouse is to let."<br>
<br>
    "Yes, ma'am, it is; will you walk in?"<br>
<br>
    "'Ow many rooms are there?"<br>
<br>
    "Eleven, ma'am; but if you will step in, mistress will speak to
    you."<br>
<br>
    A very graceful lady made her appearance at the parlour door, and
    invited us to step in. I felt exceedingly nervous, for I at once
    perceived that the lady of the house spoke with that accuracy and
    taste which is one of the best indications of refinement.<br>
<br>
    "The house <i>is</i> to let&mdash;and a very pleasant residence we have
    found it."<br>
<br>
    "'Ave you <i>h</i>occupied it long?"<br>
<br>
    "Our family has resided here for more than nine years."<br>
<br>
    "Then, I suppose, your lease 'as run <i>h</i>out!"<br>
<br>
    "No! we have it for five years longer: but my brother, who is a
    clergyman, has been appointed to a living in Yorkshire, and for his
    sake, and for the pleasure of his society, we desire to remove."<br>
<br>
    "Well&mdash;there's nothing like keeping families together for the sake
    of 'appiness. Now there's my poor dear 'Itching" [There she paused,
    as if somewhat affected, and some young ladies who were in the room
    drew their heads together, and appeared to consult about their
    needlework; but I saw, by dimples upon their cheeks, which they
    could not conceal, that they were smiling], "'e's 'itherto been
    <i>h</i>at 'ome so seldom, that I've 'ardly <i>h</i>ever known what
    'appiness <i>h</i>is."<br>
<br>
    I somewhat abruptly broke in upon the conversation, by suggesting
    that she had better look through the house, and inquire the
    conditions of tenancy. We consequently went through the various
    rooms, and in every one of them she had "an <i>h</i>objection to
    this," or "a 'atred for that," or would give "an 'int which might be
    useful" to the lady when she removed. The young ladies were heard
    tittering very much whenever Mrs. H. broke out, in a loud voice,
    with her imperfect elocution, and I felt so much annoyed, that I
    determined to cure her of her defective speaking.<br>
<br>
    <a name="p215b">In</a> the evening, after returning home, we were sitting by the fire,
    feeling comfortable and chatty, when I proposed to Mrs. Hitching the
    following enigma from the pen of the late Henry Mayhew:

<blockquote>The Vide Vorld you may search, and my fellow not find;<br>
I dwells in a Wacuum, deficient in Vind;<br>
In the Wisage I'm seen&mdash;in the Woice I am heard,<br>
And yet I'm inwisible, gives went to no Vurd.<br>
I'm not much of a Vag, for I'm vanting in Vit;<br>
But distinguished in Werse for the Wollums I've writ.<br>
I'm the head of all Willains, yet far from the Vurst&mdash;<br>
I'm the foremost in Wice, though in Wirtue the first.<br>
I'm not used to Veapons, and ne'er goes to Vor;<br>
Though in Walour inwincible&mdash;in Wictory sure;<br>
The first of all Wiands and Wictuals is mine&mdash;<br>
Rich in Wen'son and Weal, but deficient in Vine.<br>
To Wanity given, I in Welwets abound;<br>
But in Voman, in Vife, and in Vidow ain't found:<br>
Yet conspicuous in Wirgins, and I'll tell you, between us,<br>
To persons of taste I'm a bit of a Wenus;<br>
Yet none take me for Veal&mdash;or for Voe in its stead,<br>
For I ranks not among the sweet Voo'd, Vun, and Ved!</blockquote>

Before the recital of the enigma was half completed, Mrs. Hitching
  laughed heartily&mdash;she saw, of course, the meaning of it&mdash;that it was a
  play upon the Cockney error of using the V instead of the W, and the
  latter instead of the V. Several times, as I proceeded, she exclaimed
  "<i>H</i>excellent! <i>h</i>excellent!" and when I had finished, she
  remarked that is was very "<i>h</i>ingenious," and enough to
  "<i>h</i>open the <i>h</i>eyes" of the Cockneys to their stupid and
  vulgar manner of speaking.<br>
<br>
  <a name="p215a">A</a> more difficult and delicate task lay before me. I told her that as
  she was so much pleased with the first enigma, I would submit another
  by the same author. I felt very nervous, but determined to proceed:

<blockquote>I dwells in the Herth, and I breathes in the Hair;<br>
If you searches the Hocean, you'll find that I'm there.<br>
The first of all Hangels, in Holympus am Hi,<br>
Yet I'm banished from 'Eaven, expelled from on 'Igh.<br>
But though on this Horb I am destined to grovel,<br>
I'm ne'er seen in an 'Ouse, in an 'Ut, nor an 'Ovel;<br>
Not an 'Oss nor an 'Unter e'er bears me, alas!<br>
But often I'm found on the top of a Hass.<br>
I resides in a Hattic, and loves not to roam,<br>
And yet I'm invariably absent from 'Ome.<br>
Though 'ushed in the 'Urricane, of the Hatmosphere part,<br>
I enters no 'Ed, I creeps into no 'Art.<br>
Only look, and you'll see in the Heye I appear,<br>
Only 'ark, and you'll 'ear me just breathe in the Hear;<br>
Though in sex not an 'E, I am (strange paradox!)<br>
Not a bit of an 'Eifer, but partly a Hox.<br>
Of Heternity Hi'm the beginning! And, mark,<br>
Though I goes not with Noah, I am first in the Hark.<br>
I'm never in 'Ealth&mdash;have with Fysic no power;<br>
I dies in a Month, but comes back In a Hour!</blockquote>

  In re-citing the above I strongly emphasized the misplaced <i>h</i>'s.
  After a brief pause, Mrs. Hitchings exclaimed, "Very good; very
  clever." I then determined to complete my task by repeating the
  following enigma upon the same letter written by Miss Catherine
  Fanshawe and often erroneously attributed to Byron:

<blockquote>'Twas whispered in heaven, 'twas muttered in hell,<br>
And echo caught faintly the sound as it fell;<br>
On the confines of earth 'twas permitted to rest,<br>
And the depths of the ocean its presence confessed.<br>
'Twill be found in the sphere when 'tis riven asunder,<br>
Be seen in the lightning, and heard in the thunder.<br>
'Twas allotted to man with his earliest breath,<br>
Attends at his birth, and awaits him in death;<br>
It presides o'er his happiness, honour, and health,<br>
Is the prop of his house, and the end of his wealth.<br>
In the heaps of the miser 'tis hoarded with care,<br>
But is sure to be lost on his prodigal heir.<br>
It begins every hope, every wish it must bound,<br>
With the husbandman toils, with the monarch is crowned.<br>
Without it the soldier and seaman may roam,<br>
But woe to the wretch who expels it from home.<br>
In the whispers of conscience its voice will be found,<br>
Nor e'en in the whirlwind of passion be drowned.<br>
'Twill not soften the heart, and though deaf to the ear,<br>
'Twill make it acutely and instantly hear.<br>
But in shade let it rest, like a delicate flower&mdash;<br>
Oh, breathe on it softly&mdash;it dies in an hour.</blockquote>

She was much pleased, but seemed thoughtful, and once or twice in
  conversation checked herself, and corrected herself in the
  pronunciation of words that were difficult to her.<br>
<br>
  <a name="p215c">A</a> few days afterwards., I called upon her, and upon being introduced
  to the parlour to wait for her appearance, I saw lying upon her table
  the following:

  I am happy to say that it is now a pleasure to hear Mrs. Hitching's
  conversation. I only hope that others may improve as she has done.

<br>
  There are many talkers, but few who know how to converse agreeably.
  Speak distinctly, neither too rapidly nor too slowly. Accommodate the
  pitch of your voice to the hearing of the person with whom you are
  conversing. Never speak with your mouth full. Tell your jokes, and
  laugh afterwards. Dispense with superfluous words&mdash;such as, "Well, I
  should think," etc.

  limits of propriety. Her lips will readily yield to a pleasant smile;
  she will not love to hear herself talk; her tones will bear the
  impress of sincerity, and her eyes kindle with animation as she
  speaks. The art of pleasing is, in truth, the very soul of good
  breeding; for the precise object of the latter is to render us
  agreeable to all with whom we associate&mdash;to make us, at the same time,
  esteemed and loved.

  Some Men have a Mania for Greek and Latin quotations: this is
  peculiarly to be avoided. It is like pulling up the stones from a tomb

If you feel your Intellectual Superiority to any one with whom you are
  conversing, do not seek to bear him down: it would be an inglorious
  triumph, and a breach of good manners. Beware, too, of speaking
  lightly of subjects which bear a sacred character.

<br>
  It is a Common Idea that the art of writing and the art of
  conversation are one; this is a great mistake. A man of genius may be
  a very dull talker.

<a name="p222"></a><b><i>222. &nbsp;Interesting Conversation</i></b><br>
<br>
  The two grand modes of making your conversation interesting, are to
  enliven it by recitals calculated to affect and impress your hearers,
  and to intersperse it with anecdotes and smart things. Count Antoine
  Rivarol, who lived from 1757 to 1801, was a master in the latter mode.

<a name="p223"></a><b><i>223. &nbsp;Composition</i></b><br>
<br>
If you would write to any purpose, you must be perfectly free from
  without, in the first place, and yet more free from within. Give
  yourself the natural rein; think on no pattern, no patron, no paper,
  no press, no public; think on nothing, but follow your own impulses.
  Give yourself as you are, what you are, and how you see it. Everyman
  sees with his own eyes, or does not see at all. This is
  incontrovertibly true. Bring out what you have. If you have nothing,
  be an honest beggar rather than a respectable thief. Great care and
  attention should be devoted to epistolary correspondence, as nothing
  exhibits want of taste and judgment so much as a slovenly letter.
  Since the establishment of the penny postage it is recognised as a
  rule that all letters should be prepaid; indeed, many persons make a
  point of never taking in an unpaid letter. The following hints may be
  worthy of attention:

<a name="p225"></a><b><i>225. &nbsp;Direction</i></b><br>

<a name="p226"></a><b><i>226. &nbsp;Postal District</i></b><br>
<br>
  If the Address be in London add the letters of the postal district in
  which it happens to be, for this also saves trouble in the General
  Post Office. Thus in writing to the publishers of "Enquire Within,"
  whose house of business is in the East Central (E.C.) postal district,
  address your letter to Messrs. Houlston and Sons, Paternoster Square,
  London, E.C.

  At the head of your Letter, in the right-hand corner, put your address

  or even the fourth time in the course of a day.

  you were speaking; this is the best rule. Do not revert three or four

<a name="p229"></a><b><i>229. &nbsp;Signature</i></b><br>
<br>
  Let your signature be written as plainly as possible (many mistakes
  will be avoided, especially in writing to strangers), and without any
  flourishes, as these do not add in any way to the harmony of your
  letter. We have seen signatures that have been almost impossible to
  decipher, being a mere mass of strokes, without any form to indicate
  letters. This is done chiefly by the ignorant, and would lead one to
  suppose that they were ashamed of signing what they had written.

<a name="p236"></a><b><i>236. &nbsp;Addresses of Letters.</i></b><br>
<br>
  As this branch of epistolary correspondence is one of the most
  important, we subjoin a few additional hints which letter writers
  generally would do well to attend to.<br>
<br>
<a name="p236i"></a><ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    When writing several letters, place each in its envelope, and
    address it as soon as it is written. Otherwise awkward mistakes may
    occur, your correspondents receiving letters not intended for them.
    If there be a town of the same name as that to which you are writing
    existing in another county, specify the county which you mean or,
    the address.  Thus, Richmond, <i>Yorkshire</i>.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p236ii"></a><ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    When the person to whom you are writing is visiting or residing
    at the house of another person, it is considered vulgar to put "at
    Mr. So-and-So's," but simply "Mr. So-and-So's," <i>at</i> being
    understood.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p236iii"></a><ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    It is more respectful to write the word "Esquire" in full. The
    &mdash;&mdash; substituted for initials is vulgar, and pardonable only in
    extreme cases; if the Christian name or initials of your
    correspondent do not occur to you at the moment, endeavour to
    ascertain them by inquiry.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p236iv"></a><ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    When addressing a gentleman with the prefix "Mr.," the Christian
    name or initials should always follow, being more polite, as well as
    avoiding confusion where persons of the same surname may reside in
    one house.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p236v"></a><ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    In addressing a letter to two or more unmarried ladies, write
    "The Misses Johnson," and not "The <i>Miss Johnsons</i>;" and,
    lastly, always write an address clearly and legibly, so that it may
    not be delayed in delivery, nor be missent.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Give to the written page an ample margin <i>all round</i>; or
    fold down the left hand side to the extent of one-fourth the width
    of the entire paper so as to leave a broad margin on the left side
    of the paper.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p248"></a><b><i>248. &nbsp;Hints to those who have Pianofortes</i></b><br>
<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
  Damp is very injurious to a pianoforte; it ought therefore to be
  placed in a dry place, and not exposed to draughts.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

  Keep your piano free from dust, and do not allow needles, pins, or
  bread to be placed upon it, especially if the key-board is exposed, as
  such articles are apt to get inside and produce a jarring or whizzing
  sound.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

  Do not load the top of a piano with books, music, &amp;c., as the
  tone is thereby deadened, and the disagreeable noise alluded to in the
  last paragraph is often produced likewise.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

  Have your piano tuned about every two months; whether it is used
  or not, the strain is always upon it, and if it is not kept up to
  concert pitch it will not stand in tune when required, which it will
  do if it be attended to regularly.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

 An upright instrument sounds better if placed about two inches from
  the wall.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

  When not in use keep the piano locked.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

  To make the polish look nice, rub it with an old silk
  handkerchief, being careful first of all to dust off any small
  particles, which otherwise are apt to scratch the surface.</li></ol><br>

<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

  Should any of the notes keep down when struck, it is a sure sign
  that there is damp somewhere, which has caused the small note upon
  which the key works to swell.</li></ol>

<a name="p274"></a><b><i>274. &nbsp;Kitchen Garden</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is one of the most important parts of general domestic economy,
  whenever the situation of a house and the size of the garden will
  permit the members of a family to avail themselves of the advantages
  it offers. It is, indeed, much to be regretted that small plots of
  ground, in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis more especially,
  are too often converted into flower gardens and shrubberies, or used
  as mere play-grounds for children, when they might more usefully be
  employed in raising vegetables for the family. With a little care and
  attention, a kitchen garden, though small, might be rendered not only
  useful, but, in fact, as ornamental as a modern grass lawn; and the
  same expense incurred to make the ground a laboratory of sweets, might
  suffice to render it agreeable to the palate as well as to the
  olfactory nerves, and that even without offending the most delicate
  optics. It is only in accordance with our plan to give the hint and to
  put before the reader such novel points as may facilitate the proposed
  arrangement. <br>
<br>
It is one objection to the formation of a kitchen garden
  in front of the dwelling, or in sight of the drawing-room and parlour,
  that its very nature makes it rather an eyesore than otherwise at all
  seasons. This, however, may be readily got over by a little attention
  to neatness and good order, for the vegetables themselves, if properly
  attended to, may be made really ornamental; but then, in cutting the
  plants for use, the business must be done neatly&mdash;all useless leaves
  cleared from the ground, the roots no longer wanted taken up, and the
  ravages of insects guarded against by sedulous extirpation. It will
  also be found a great improvement, where space will admit of it, to
  surround the larger plots of ground, in which the vegetables are
  grown, with flower borders stocked with herbaceous plants and others,
  such as annuals and bulbs in due order of succession, or with neat
  espaliers, with fruit trees, or even gooseberry and currant bushes,
  trained along them, instead of being suffered to grow in a state of
  ragged wildness, as is too often the case.

<a name="p275"></a><b><i>275. &nbsp;Artificial  Mushroom Beds</i></b><br>
<br>
  Mushrooms may be grown in pots, boxes, or hampers. Each box may be
  about three feet long, one and a half broad, and seven inches in
  depth. Let each box be half filled with manure in the form of fresh
  horse-dung from the stables, the fresher the better, but if wet, it
  should be allowed to dry for three or four days before it is put into
  the boxes. When the manure has been placed in the box it should be
  well beaten down. After the second or third day, if the manure has
  begun to generate heat, break each brick of mushroom spawn (which may
  be obtained from any seedsman) into pieces about three inches square,
  then lay the pieces about four inches apart upon the surface of the
  manure in the box; here they are to lie for six days, when it will
  probably be found that the side of the spawn next to the manure has
  begun to run in the manure below; then add one and a half inch more of
  fresh manure on the top of the spawn in the box, and beat it down as
  formerly. In the course of a fortnight, when you find that the spawn
  has run through the manure, the box will be ready to receive the mould
  on the top; this mould must be two and a half inches deep, well beaten
  down, and the surface made quite even. <br>
<br>
In the space of five or six
  weeks the mushrooms will begin to come up; if the mould then seems
  dry, give it a gentle watering with lukewarm water. The box will
  continue to produce from six weeks to two months, if duly attended to
  by giving a little water when dry, for the mushrooms need neither
  <i>light</i> nor <i>free air</i>. If cut as button mushrooms each box
  will yield from twenty-four to forty-eight pints, according to the
  season and other circumstances. They may be kept in dry dark cellars,
  or any other places where the frost will not reach them. By preparing
  in succession of boxes, mushrooms may be had all the year
  through.&mdash;They may be grown without the manure, and be of a finer
  flavour. Take a little straw, and lay it carefully in the bottom of
  the mushroom box, about an inch thick, or rather more. Then take some
  of the spawn bricks and break them down&mdash;each brick into about ten
  pieces, and lay the fragments on the straw, as close to each other as
  they will lie. Cover them up with mould three and a half inches deep,
  and well pressed down. When the surface appears dry give a little
  tepid water, as directed for the mode of raising them described above,
  but this method needs about double the quantity of water that the
  former does, owing to having no moisture in the bottom, while the
  other has the manure. The mushrooms will begin to start in a month or
  five weeks, sometimes sooner, sometimes later, according to the heat
  of the place where the boxes are situated.

<a name="p276"></a><b><i>276. &nbsp;Dwarf Plants</i></b><br>
<br>
  The following method of producing miniature trees is taken from an
  article on this subject in <i>Gardening Illustrated</i>.

<blockquote>"Take an
  orange, and having cut a hole in the peel about the size of a
  shilling, take out the juice and pulp. Fill the skin thus emptied with
  some cocoa-nut fibre, fine moss, and charcoal, just stiffened with a
  little loam, and then put an acorn or a date stone, or the seed or
  kernel of any tree that it is proposed to obtain in a dwarfed form in
  this mixture, just about the centre of the hollow orange peel. Place
  the orange peel in a tumbler or vase in a window, and occasionally
  moisten the contents with a little water through the hole in the peel,
  and sprinkle the surface apparent through the hole with some fine
  woodashes. In due time the tree will push up its stem through the
  compost and the roots will push through the orange peel. The roots
  must then be cut off flush with the peel, and this process must be
  repeated at frequent intervals for about two years and a half. The
  stem of the tree will attain the height of four or five inches and
  then assume a stunted gnarled appearance, giving it the appearance of
  an old tree. When the ends of the roots are cut for the last time, the
  orange peel, which, curiously enough, does not rot, must be painted
  black and varnished."</blockquote>

The writer of the article saw this process
  carried out by a Chinaman that he had in his service, and the trees
  thrived and presented a healthy appearance for eight years, when the
  Chinaman left his employ and took the trees with him. He tried the
  plan which has been described but failed, but he was successful with
  an acorn and a datestone which were planted each in a thumb-pot in a
  mixture of peat and loam. The dwarfing was effected by turning the
  plants out of the pots at intervals of six weeks and pinching off the
  ends of the roots that showed themselves behind the compost. This
  shows that the production of dwarf plants is chiefly due to a constant
  and systematic checking of the root growth.

<br>
  Toads are among the best friends the gardener has; for they live
  almost exclusively on the most destructive kinds of vermin. Unsightly,
  therefore, though they may be, they should on all accounts be
  encouraged; they should never be touched nor molested in any way; on
  the contrary, places of shelter should be made for them, to which they
  may retire from the burning heat of the sun. If you have none in your
  garden, it will be quite worth your while to search for them in your
  walks, and bring them home, taking care to handle them tenderly, for
  although they have neither the will nor the power to injure you, a
  very little rough treatment will injure them; no cucumber or melon
  frame should be without one or two.

<br>
Slugs and snails  are great enemies to every kind of garden plant, whether flower or
  vegetable; they wander in the night to feed, and return at daylight to
  their haunts. In order to catch them lay cabbage leaves about the
  ground, especially on the beds which they frequent.  Every morning
  examine these leaves, and you will find a great many taking refuge
  beneath, and these may be killed by sprinkling them with a little lime
  or salt. These minerals are very annoying to snails and slugs; a pinch
  of salt kills them, and they will not touch fresh lime. It is a common
  practice to sprinkle lime over young crops, and along the edges of
  beds, about rows of peas and beans, lettuces and other vegetables; but
  when it has been on the ground some days, or has been moistened by
  rain, it loses its strength.

  Dip a piece of wool or cotton in oil, and slightly tie it round the

  stakes, trees, &amp;c., by encircling them with a broad ring of tar, which
  may be renewed as often as may be necessary. Small pots inverted and
  placed on the top of stakes form a useful trap for slugs, snails,
  earwigs, &amp;c., which crawl into them for shelter in the early morning,
  and may thus be caught and destroyed. When it is sought to take
  earwigs by this means, the bottom of each pot should be filled with a
  wisp of hay or dried grass, or a little cotton wool.

<br>
  Before taking a house, be careful to calculate that the rent is not
  too high in proportion to your means; for remember that the rent is a
  claim that must be paid with but little delay, and that the landlord
  has greater power over your property than any other creditor. It is
  difficult to assign any fixed proportion between income and rental to
  suit all cases, but a reasonable basis for the settlement of this
  point may be found in the assertion that while not less than one-tenth
  of a man's entire income need be set apart for rent, not more than a
  sixth, or at the very utmost a fifth should be devoted to this
  purpose, and this amount ought to include parochial rates and taxes.

Having determined the amount of rent
  which you can afford to pay, be careful to select the best and most

  that selection let the following matters be carefully considered:

<a name="p293"></a><b><i>293. &nbsp;First&mdash;Carefully regard the Healthfulness of the Situation</i></b><br>
<br>
  Find out the nature of the sub-soil on which the house stands&mdash;for
  example, a gravel or chalk subsoil is better than a subsoil of clay,
  because the former admits of a speedy escape of the surplus water in
  time of heavy and continuous rain, while the latter does not. Avoid
  the neighbourhood of graveyards, and of factories giving forth
  unhealthy vapours. Avoid low and damp districts, the course of canals,
  and localities of reservoirs of water, gas works, &amp;c. Make inquiries
  as to the drainage of the neighbourhood, and inspect the drainage and
  water supply of the premises. A house standing on an incline is likely
  to be better drained than one standing upon the summit of a hill, or
  on a level below a hill. Endeavour to obtain a position where the
  direct sunlight falls upon the house, for this is absolutely essential
  to health; and give preference to a house the openings of which are
  sheltered from the north and east winds.

<a name="p295"></a><b><i>295. &nbsp;Examine the House in Detail</i></b><br>
<br>
  Having considered these material and leading features, examine the

  the windows that are broken; whether the chimneys smoke; whether they
  have been recently swept; whether the paper on the walls is damaged,
  especially in the lower parts, and the corners, by the skirtings;
  whether the locks, bolts, handles of doors, and window fastenings are
  in proper condition; make a list of the fixtures; ascertain whether
  all rates and taxes have been paid by the previous tenant, and whether
  the person from whom you take the house is the original landlord, or
  his agent or tenant. And do not commit yourself by the signing of any
  agreement until you are satisfied upon all these points, <i>and see

If you are about to furnish a house,
  buy merely enough to get along with at first, and add other things by
  degrees. It is only by experience that you can tell what will be the
  wants of your family. If you spend all your money, you will find you
  have purchased many things you do not actually want, and have no means
  left to get many things which you do want. If you have enough, and
  more than enough, to get everything suitable to your situation, do not
  think you must spend all, you may be able to lay out in furniture,
  merely because you happen to have it. Begin humbly. As riches
  increase, it is easy and pleasant to increase in comforts; but it is
  always painful and inconvenient to decrease. Neatness, tastefulness,
  and good sense may be shown in the management of a small household,
  and the arrangement of a little furniture, as well as upon a larger
  scale. The consideration which many purchase by living beyond their
  income, and, of course, living upon others, is not worth the trouble
  it costs. It does not, in fact, procure a man valuable friends, or
  extensive influence.

<a name="p321"></a><b><i>321. &nbsp;Organization</i></b><br>
<br>
  There is an excellent and simple contrivance for designating the exact
  places allotted to all these articles in a very complete tool closet.

<a name="p322"></a><b><i>322. &nbsp;Outlined Tools</i></b><br>
<br>
On the closet wall, directly under the large nails that support the
  tools, is drawn with a small brush dipped in black paint or ink, a
  representation in outline of the tool or instrument belonging to that
  particular place.

<a name="p323"></a><b><i>323. &nbsp;Examples of Outlining</i></b><br>

  For instance, under each saw is sketched the outline of that saw,

  So that when any tool that has been taken away for use is brought back
  to the closet, the exact spot to which it belongs can be found in a

  a box and looking for them again when they are wanted, is thus
  prevented.

<br>
  Wrapping paper may be piled on the floor under the large shelf.  It
  can be bought at a low price by the ream, at the large paper
  warehouses; and every house should keep a supply of it in several
  varieties. For instance, coarse brown paper for common purposes, which
  is strong, thick, and in large sheets, is useful for packing heavy
  articles; and equally so for keeping silks, ribbons, blondes, &amp;c., as
  it preserves their colours.

  The following method is recommended to prevent the effect of damp

  Another mode of preventing the ill effects of damp in walls on

  and shellac, in the proportion of 1/4 lb. of the latter to a quart of the
  former. The smell of the mixture is unpleasant, but it wears off in a
  short time, and the wall is covered with a hard coating utterly
  impervious to damp, and to which the wall paper can be attached in the

  which consists of scrubbing the floors with dry brushes, may be
  resorted to, and will be found more effective than can at first be

  a pound of virgin wax, boiling the whole for half an hour, then suffer
  it to cool, when the wax will float on the surface. Put the wax into a
  mortar, and triturate it with a marble pestle, adding soft water to it

<a name="p374"></a><b><i>374. &nbsp;Carpets</i></b><br>
<br>
  If the corner of a carpet becomes loose and prevents the door opening,
  or trips every one up that enters the room, nail it down at once. A
  dog's-eared carpet marks the sloven as well as the dog's-eared book.
  An English gentleman, travelling some years ago in Ireland, took a
  hammer and tacks with him, because he found dog's-eared carpets at all
  the inns where he rested. At one of these inns he tacked down the
  carpet, which, as usual, was loose near the door, and soon afterwards
  rang for his dinner. While the carpet was loose the door could not be
  opened without a hard push; so when the waiter came up, he just
  unlatched the door, and then going back a couple of yards, he rushed
  against it, as his habit was, with a sudden spring, to force it open.
  But the wrinkles of the carpet were no longer there to stop it, and
  not meeting with the expected resistance, the unfortunate waiter fell
  full length into the room. It had never entered his head that so much
  trouble might be saved by means of a hammer and half a dozen tacks,
  until his fall taught him that makeshift is a very unprofitable kind
  of shift. There are a good many houses in England where a similar
  practical lesson might be of service.

  Take a pail of cold water, and add to it three gills of ox-gall. Rub
  it into the carpet with a soft brush. It will raise a lather, which
  must be washed off with clear cold water. Rub dry with a clean cloth.
  Before nailing down a carpet after the floor has been washed, be
  certain that the floor is quite dry, or the nails will rust and injure
  the carpet. Fuller's earth is used for cleaning carpets, and weak
  solutions of alum or soda are used for reviving the colours. The crumb
  of a hot wheaten loaf rubbed over a carpet has been found effective.

  Cut into eight half quarters a quartern loaf, two days old; it must be

  than the upper stroke had extended, till the bottom be finished. This

  then take a clean cloth, and rub the glass well once more, and finish
  by rubbing it with a silk handkerchief. If the glass be very large,
  clean one-half at a time, as otherwise the spirit of wine will dry
  before it can be rubbed off. If the frames are not varnished, the
  greatest care is necessary to keep them quite dry, so as not to touch
  them with the sponge, as this will discolour or take off the gilding.
  To clean the frames, take a little raw cotton in the state of wool,
  and rub the frames with it; this will take off all the dust and dirt
  without injuring the gilding. If the frames are well varnished, rub
  them with spirit of wine, which will take out all spots, and give them

  expensive article, where a much cheaper one would serve the purpose
  better. I ordered half a dozen pounds of both sorts, but took the
  precaution of changing the papers on which the prices were marked
  before giving them into the hands of Betty. "Well, Betty, which soap
  do you find washes best?" "Oh, please sir, the dearest, in the blue

  you shall always have it then;" and thus the unsuspecting Betty saved

  Allowing children to talk incessantly is a mistake. We do not mean to
  say that they should be restricted from talking in proper seasons, but
  they should be taught to know when it is proper for them to cease.

<a name="p47410"></a><ol start=10 type="i"><li>

    In cold weather a leg of mutton improves by being hung three,
    four, or five weeks.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47411"></a><ol start=11 type="i"><li>

    When meat is hanging, change its position frequently, to equally
    distribute the juices.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47412"></a><ol start=12 type="i"><li>

    There is much more injury done by admitting visitors to
    invalids than is generally supposed.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47413"></a><ol start=13 type="i"><li>

    Matches, out of the reach of children, should be kept in every
    bedroom. They are cheap enough.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47414"></a><ol start=14 type="i"><li>

    Apple and suet dumplings are lighter when boiled in a net than
    a cloth. Skim the pot well.</li></ol><br>

    When you dry salt for the table, do not place it in the salt

<a name="p47420"></a><ol start=20 type="i"><li>

    Never put away plate, knives and forks, &amp;c., uncleaned, or great
    inconvenience will arise when the articles are wanted.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47421"></a><ol start=21 type="i"><li>

    Feather beds should be opened every third year, the ticking
    well dusted, soaped, and waxed, the feathers dressed and returned.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47422"></a><ol start=22 type="i"><li>

    Persons of defective sight, when threading a needle, should
    hold it over something white, by which the sight will be assisted.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47423"></a><ol start=23 type="i"><li>

    In mending sheets and shirts, put in pieces sufficiently
    large, or in the first washing the thin parts give way, and the work
    done is of no avail.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47424"></a><ol start=24 type="i"><li>

    When reading by candle-light, place the candle behind you,
    that the rays may pass over your shoulder on to the book. This will
    relieve the eyes.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47425"></a><ol start=25 type="i"><li>

   A wire fire-guard, for each fire-place in a house, costs
    little, and greatly diminishes the risk to life and property. Fix
    them before going to bed.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47426"></a><ol start=26 type="i"><li>

    In winter, get the work forward by daylight, to prevent
    running about at night with candles. Thus you escape grease spots,
    and risks of fire.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47427"></a><ol start=27 type="i"><li>

    Be at much pains to keep your children's feet dry and warm.
    Don't bury their bodies in heavy flannels and wools, and leave their
    arms and legs naked.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47428"></a><ol start=28 type="i"><li>

    Apples and pears, cut into quarters and stripped of the
    rind, baked with a little water and sugar, and eaten with boiled
    rice, are capital food for children.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47429"></a><ol start=29 type="i"><li>

    A leather strap, with a buckle to fasten, is much more
    commodious than a cord for a box in general use for short distances;
    cording and uncording is a tedious job.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47430"></a><ol start=30 type="i"><li>

    After washing, overlook linen, and stitch on buttons, hooks and
    eyes, &amp;c.; for this purpose keep a "house-wife's friend," full of
    miscellaneous threads, cottons, buttons: hooks, &amp;c.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47431"></a><ol start=31 type="i"><li>

    For ventilation open your windows both at top and bottom. The
    fresh air rushed in one way, while the foul escapes the other. This
    is letting in your friend and expelling your enemy.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47432"></a><ol start=32 type="i"><li>

    There is not any real economy in purchasing cheap calico for
    night-shirts. Cheap calico soon wears into holes, and becomes
    discoloured in washing.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47433"></a><ol start=33 type="i"><li>

    Sitting to sew by candle-light at a table with a dark cloth
    on it is injurious to the eyesight. When no other remedy presents
    itself, put a sheet of white paper before you.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47434"></a><ol start=34 type="i"><li>

    Persons very commonly complain of indigestion; how can it be
    wondered at, when they seem, by their habit of swallowing their food
    wholesale, to forget for what purpose they are provided with teeth.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47435"></a><ol start=35 type="i"><li>

    Never allow your servants to put wiped knives on your table,
    for, generally speaking, you may see that that have been wiped with
    a dirty cloth. If a knife is brightly cleaned, they are compelled to
    use a clean cloth.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47436"></a><ol start=36 type="i"><li>

    There is not anything gained in economy by having very young
    and inexperienced servants at low wages; the cost of what they
    break, waste, and destroy, is more than an equivalent for higher
    wages, setting aside comfort and respectability.</li></ol><br>

<a name="p47437"></a><ol start=37 type="i"><li>

    No article in dress tarnishes so readily as black crape
    trimmings, and few things injure it more than damp; therefore, to
    preserve its beauty on bonnets, a lady in nice mourning should in
    her evening walks, at all seasons of the year, take as her companion
    an old parasol to shade her crape.</li></ol>

<br>
  Spread a sheet of thin leather with the ointment of ammoniacum with
  mercury, and cut out a place for the mouth, eyes, and nostrils. This
  forms what is called a mask, and, after anointing the eyelids with a
  little blue ointment, it should be applied to the face, and allowed to
  remain for three days for the distinct kind, and four days for the
  running variety. <i>Apply before</i> the spots fill with matter, although
  it will answer sometimes even after they have become pustulous. It may
  be applied to any part in the same way.

<a name="p584"></a><b><i>584. &nbsp;Another Method</i></b><br>
<br>
Another method,
  and one more reliable, is that of touching every pustule, or poc, on
  the face or bosom with a camel-hair pencil dipped in a weak solution
  of lunar caustic (<i>nitrate of silver</i>), made in the proportion of two
  grains of nitrate of silver to one ounce of distilled water.  The time
  for application is about the seventh day, while each pustule is filled
  with a limpid fluid, or before suppuration takes place, the lotion
  arresting that action, and by preventing the formation of matter,
  saving the skin from being pitted; a result that follows from the
  conversion of the adipose tissue into pus.

<a name="p585"></a><b><i>585. &nbsp;A Third Method </i></b><br>
<br>
  of effecting the same purpose is by passing a fine needle through each

<br>
  A fourth and much more simple method of preventing pitting from
  small-pox is to lightly touch every part of the face with a feather
  dipped in sweet oil. It also tends to prevent this disfigurement to
  cause the light in the patient's apartment by day to assume a yellow

<a name="p652"></a><b><i>652. &nbsp;Medicines (Aperient)</i></b><br>
<br>
  In the spring time of the year, the judicious use of aperient
  medicines is much to be commended.

<a name="p653"></a><b><i>653. &nbsp;Spring Aperients</i></b><br>
<br>
For children, an excellent medicine is<br>
<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
Brimstone and treacle, prepared by mixing an ounce and a half of
    sulphur, and half an ounce of cream of tartar, with eight ounces of
    treacle; and, according to the age of the child, giving from a small
    teaspoonful to a dessertspoonful, early in the morning, two or three
    times a week.</li></ol><br>

  As this sometimes produces sickness, the following may be used:<br>
<br>

<ol start=2 type="i"><li>
    Take of powdered Rochelle salts one drachm and a half, powdered
    jalap and powdered rhubarb each fifteen grains, ginger two grains,
    mix. <i>Dose</i>, for a child above five years, one <i>small</i> teaspoonful;
    above ten years, a <i>large</i> teaspoonful; above fifteen, half the
    whole, or two teaspoonfuls: and for a person above twenty, three
    teaspoonfuls, or the whole, as may be required by the habit of the
    person.</li></ol><br>


  This medicine may be dissolved in warm water, mint, or common tea. The
  powder can be kept for use in a wide-mouthed bottle, and be in
  readiness for any emergency. The druggist may be directed to treble or
  quadruple the quantities, as convenient.

<a name="p654"></a><b><i>654. &nbsp;Aperient Pills.</i></b><br>
<br>
 To some adults all liquid medicines produce such nausea that pills are
  the only form in which aperients can be exhibited; the following is a
  useful formula:<br>
<br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>

    Take of compound rhubarb pill a drachm and one scruple, of
    powdered ipecacuanha ten grains, and of extract of hyoscyamus one
    scruple; mix, and beat into a mass, and divide into twenty-four
    pills; take one or two, or if of a very costive habit, <i>three</i> at
    bedtime.</li></ol><br>


<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    For persons requiring a more powerful aperient, the same
    formula, with twenty grains of compound extract of colocynth, will
    form a good purgative pill. The mass receiving this addition must be
    divided into thirty, instead of twenty-four pills.</li></ol>

<br>
The common aperient medicine known as black draught is made in the
  following manner:<br><br>

<ol start=1 type="i"><li>

    Take of senna leaves six drachms, bruised ginger half a drachm,
    sliced liquorice root four drachms, Epsom salts two and a half
    ounces, boiling water half an imperial pint. Keep this standing on
    the hob or near the fire for three hours, then strain, and after
    allowing it to grow cool, add of sal volatile one drachm and a half,
    of tincture of senna, and of tincture of cardamoms, each half an
    ounce. This mixture will keep a long time in a cool place. <i>Dose</i>, a
    wineglassful for an adult; and two tablespoonfuls for young persons
    about fifteen years of age. It is not a suitable medicine for
    children.</li></ol>

<br>
  When you open your box containing the scales and weights, you will
  observe that there are several square pieces of brass, of different
  sizes and thicknesses, and stamped with a variety of characters. These
  are the weights, which may now be explained.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p662"></a><b><i>662. &nbsp;Troy Weight</i></b><br>
<br>
  Medicines are made up by <i>troy</i> weight, although drugs are bought by
  <i>avoirdupois</i> weight.  There are twelve ounces to the pound troy, which
  is marked <b>lb</b>.; the ounce, which contains eight drachms, is marked <img src="images/EI9.gif" width="18" height="25" border="1" alt="ounce"> <b>i</b>; the drachm, containing
  three scruples, is marked <img src="images/EI10.gif" width="17" height="20" border="1" alt="drachm"> <b>i</b>; and the
  scruple of twenty grains is marked <img src="images/EI11.gif" width="18" height="21" border="1" alt="scruple"> <b>i</b>. The grain weights are marked
  by little circles, thus:

<blockquote><img src="images/EI8.gif" width="150" height="53" border="1" alt="five grains"></blockquote>

  Each of the grain weights, in addition to the circles denoting their
  several weights, bears also the stamp of a crown. Care must be taken
  not to mistake this for one of the numerals. Besides these weights
  there are others marked <img src="images/EI11.gif" width="18" height="21" border="1" alt="scruple"> ss, which means half a scruple;
  <img src="images/EI10.gif" width="17" height="20" border="1" alt="drachm"> ss, meaning half a drachm; and <img src="images/EI9.gif" width="18" height="25" border="1" alt="ounce"> ss, meaning half an
  ounce. When there are ounces, drachms, or scruples, the number of them
  is shown by Roman figures, thus:&mdash;i. ii. iii. iv. v., &amp;c., and
  prescriptions are written in this style.

<br>
  These quantities refer to ordinary sized spoons and vessels. Some cups
  hold half as much more, and some tablespoons contain six drachms. A
  medicine glass, which is graduated so as to show the number of
  spoonfuls it contains, should be kept in every family.

<br>
  <b>To powder substances</b>.&mdash;Place the substance in the mortar, and strike
  it <i>gently</i> with direct perpendicular blows of the pestle, until it
  separates into several pieces, then remove all but a small portion,
  which bruise gently at first, and rub the pestle round and round the
  mortar, observing that the circles described by the pestle should
  gradually decrease in diameter, and then increase again, because by
  this means every part of the powder is subjected to the process of
  pulverization. In powdering substances, making emulsions, and whenever
  using a mortar, the pestle should always travel <i>from the right to the
  left</i>.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p667"></a><b><i>667. &nbsp;Preparation and Assistance</i></b><br>
<br>
  Some substances require to be prepared in a particular manner before
  they can be powdered, or to be assisted by adding some other body. For
  example, camphor powders more easily when a few drops of spirits of
  wine are added to it; mace, nutmegs, and such oily aromatic substances
  are better for the addition of a little white sugar; resins and
  gum-resins should be powdered in a cold place, and if they are
  intended to be dissolved, a little fine well-washed white sand mixed
  with them assists the process of powdering. Tough roots, like gentian
  and calumba, should be cut into thin slices; and fibrous roots, like
  ginger, cut slanting, otherwise the powder will be full of small
  fibres. Vegetable matter, such as peppermint, loosestrife, senna, &amp;c.,
  requires to be dried before it is powdered.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p668"></a><b><i>668. &nbsp;Care of the Mortar</i></b><br>
<br>
  Be careful not to pound too hard in glass, porcelain, or Wedgwood-ware
  mortar; they are intended only for substances that pulverize easily,
  and for the purpose of mixing or incorporating medicines.  Never use
  acids in a marble mortar, and be sure that you do not powder galls or
  any other astringent substances in any but a brass mortar.

<a name="p669"></a><b><i>669. &nbsp;Sifting</i></b><br>
<br>
  Sifting is frequently required for powdered substances, and this is
  usually done by employing a fine sieve, or tying the powder up in a
  piece of muslin, and striking it against the left hand over a piece of
  paper.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p670"></a><b><i>670. &nbsp;Filtering</i></b><br>
<br>
  Filtering is frequently required for the purpose of obtaining clear
  fluids, such as infusions, eye-washes, and other medicines; and it is,
  therefore, highly important to know how to perform this simple
  operation. First of all take a square piece of white blotting paper,
  and double it over so as to form an angular cup. Open out this filter
  paper very carefully, and having placed it in a funnel, moisten it
  with a little water. Then place the funnel in the neck of the bottle,
  and pour the liquid gently down the side of the paper, otherwise the
  fluid is apt to burst the paper.

<a name="p671"></a><b><i>671. &nbsp;Maceration</i></b><br>
<br>
  Maceration is another process that is frequently required to be
  performed in making up medicines, and consists simply in immersing the
  medicines in <i>cold water</i> or spirits for a certain time.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p672"></a><b><i>672. &nbsp;Digestion</i></b><br>
<br>
  Digestion resembles maceration, except that the process is assisted by
  a gentle heat. The ingredients are placed in a flask, such as salad
  oil is sold in, which should be fitted with a plug of tow or wood, and
  have a piece of wire twisted round the neck. The flask is held by
  means of the wire over the flame of a spirit lamp, or else placed in
  some sand warmed in an old iron saucepan over the fire, care being
  taken not to place more of the flask below the sand than the portion
  occupied by the ingredients.

<a name="p673"></a><b><i>673. &nbsp;Infusion</i></b><br>
<br>
  Infusion is one of the most frequent operations required in making up
  medicines, its object being to extract the aromatic and volatile
  principles of substances, that would be lost by decoction, or
  digestion; and to extract the soluble from the insoluble parts of
  bodies. Infusions may be made with cold water, in which case they are
  weaker, but more pleasant.  The general method employed consists in
  slicing, bruising, or rasping the ingredients first, then placing them
  in a common jug (which should be as globular as possible), and pouring
  boiling water over them. Cover the jug with a cloth folded six or
  eight times, but if there be a lid to the jug so much the better. When
  the infusion has stood the time directed, hold a piece of <i>very
  coarse</i> linen over the spout, and pour the liquid through it into
  another jug.

<a name="p674"></a><b><i>674. &nbsp;Decoction</i></b><br>
<br>
  Decoction, or boiling, is employed to extract the mucilaginous or
  gummy parts of substances, their bitter, astringent, or other
  qualities, and is nothing more than boiling the ingredients in a
  saucepan with the lid slightly raised. Be sure never to use an iron
  saucepan for astringent decoctions, such as oak-bark, galls, &amp;c., as
  they will turn the saucepan black, and spoil the decoction. The
  enamelled saucepans are very useful for decoctions, but an excellent
  plan is to put the ingredients into a jar and boil the jar, thus
  preparing it by a water bath, as it is technically termed; or by using
  a common pipkin, which answers still better. No decoction should be
  allowed to boil for more than ten minutes.

<a name="p675"></a><b><i>675. &nbsp;Extracts</i></b><br>
<br>
  Extracts are made by evaporating the liquors obtained by infusion or
  decoction, but these can be bought much cheaper and better of chemists
  and druggists, and so can tinctures, confections, cerates and
  plasters, and syrups: but as every one is not always in the
  neighbourhood of druggists, we shall give recipes for those most
  generally useful, and the method of making them.

<a name="p678"></a><b><i>678. &nbsp;Temperament</i></b><br>
<br>
  Persons of a phlegmatic temperament bear stimulants and purgatives
  better than those of a sanguine temperament, therefore the latter
  require smaller doses.

<a name="p679"></a><b><i>679. &nbsp;Habits</i></b><br>
<br>
  Purgatives never act so well upon persons accustomed to take them as
  upon those who are not, therefore it is better to change the form of
  purgative from pill to potion, powder to draught, or aromatic to
  saline. Purgatives should never be given when there is an irritable
  state of the bowels.

<br>
  Castor oil may be taken in milk, coffee, or spirit, such as brandy;
  but the best method of covering the nauseous flavour is to put a
  tablespoonful of strained orange juice in a wineglass, pour the castor
  oil into the centre of the juice, and then squeeze a few drops of
  lemon juice upon the top of the oil. The wineglass should first be
  dipped, rim downwards, into water, so that the interior may be wetted.
  Cod liver oil may be taken, like castor oil, in orange juice.
  Peppermint water neutralizes, to a great extent, the nauseous taste of
  Epsom salts; a strong solution of extract of liquorice, that of aloes;
  milk, that of cinchona bark; and cloves that of senna.

<a name="p686"></a><b><i>686. &nbsp;An Excellent Way to Prevent the Taste of Medicines </i></b><br>
<br>
An excellent way to prevent the taste of medicines
  is to have the medicine in a glass, as usual, and a tumbler of water
  by the side of it; take the medicine, and retain it in the mouth,
  which should be kept closed, and if drinking the water be then
  commenced, the taste of the medicine is washed away. Even the
  bitterness of quinine and aloes may be prevented by this means. If the
  nostrils are firmly compressed by the thumb and finger of the left
  hand, while taking a nauseous draught, and so retained till the mouth
  has been washed out with water, the disagreeable taste of the medicine
  will be almost imperceptible.

<a name="p691"></a><b><i>691. &nbsp;General Stimulants</i></b><br>
<br>
  General stimulants are subdivided into two classes, diffusible and
  permanent stimulants: the first comprising narcotics and
  antispasmodics, and the second tonics and astringents.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p692"></a><b><i>692. &nbsp;Narcotics</i></b><br>
<br>
  Narcotics are medicines which stupefy and diminish the activity of the
  nervous system. Given in small doses, they generally act as
  stimulants, but an increased dose produces a sedative effect. Under
  this head are included alcohol, camphor, ether, the hop, and opium.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p693"></a><b><i>693. &nbsp;Alcohol</i></b><br>
<br>
  Alcohol, or rectified spirit, is a very powerful stimulant, and is
  never used as a remedy without being diluted to the degree called
  proof spirit; and even then it is seldom used internally. It is <i>used
  externally</i> in restraining bleeding, when there is not any vessel of
  importance wounded. It is also used as a lotion to burns, and is
  applied by dipping a piece of lint into the spirit, and laying it over
  the part. Freely diluted (one part to eighteen) with water, it forms a
  useful eye-wash in the last stage of ophthalmia.<br>
<br>
  <i>Used internally</i>, it acts as a very useful stimulant when diluted and
  taken moderately, increasing the general excitement, and giving energy
  to the muscular fibres; hence it becomes very useful in certain cases
  of debility, especially in habits disposed to create acidity; and in
  the low stage of typhus fevers.<br>
<br>
  <i>Dose</i>.&mdash;It is impossible to fix anything like a dose for this remedy,
  as much will depend upon the individual; but diluted with water and
  sweetened with sugar, from half an ounce to two ounces may be given
  three or four times a day. In cases of extreme debility, however, much
  will depend upon the disease.<br>
<br>
  <i>Caution</i>.&mdash;Remember that alcohol is an irritant <i>poison</i>, and that
  daily indulgence in its use originates dyspepsia, or indigestion, and
  many other serious complaints. Of all kinds of spirits the best as a
  tonic and stomachic is <i>brandy</i>.

<a name="p694"></a><b><i>694. &nbsp;Camphor</i></b><br>
<br>
  Camphor is not a very steady stimulant, as its effect is transitory;
  but in large doses it acts as a narcotic, abating pain and inducing
  sleep. In moderate doses it operates as a diaphoretic, diuretic,
  antispasmodic, increasing the heat of the body, allaying irritation
  and spasm.<br>
<br>
  It is <i>used externally</i> as a liniment when dissolved in oil, alcohol,
  or acetic acid, being employed to allay rheumatic pains; and it is
  also useful as an embrocation in sprains, bruises, chilblains, and,
  when combined with opium, it has been advantageously employed in
  flatulent colic, and severe diarrh&oelig;a, being rubbed over the bowels.<br>
<br>
  <i>When reduced to a fine powder</i>, by the addition of a little spirit of
  wine and friction, it is very useful as a local stimulant to indolent
  ulcers, especially when they discharge a foul kind of matter; a pinch
  is taken between the finger and thumb, and sprinkled into the ulcer,
  which is then dressed as usual.<br>
<br>
  <i>When dissolved in oil of turpentine</i>, a few drops placed in a hollow
  tooth and covered with jeweller's wool, or scraped lint, give almost
  instant relief to toothache. <br>
<br>
<i>Used internally</i>, it is apt to excite
  nausea, and even vomiting, especially when given in the solid form.<br>
<br>
  <i>As a stimulant</i> it is of great service in all low fevers, malignant
  measles, malignant sore throat, and confluent small-pox; and when
  combined with opium and bark, it is extremely useful in checking the
  progress of malignant ulcers, and gangrene.<br>
<br>
  <i>As a narcotic</i> it is very useful, because it allays pain and
  irritation, without increasing the pulse very much.<br>
<br>
  <i>When powdered and sprinkled</i> upon the surface of a blister, it
  prevents the cantharides acting in a peculiar and painful manner upon
  the bladder.<br>
<br>
  <i>Combined with senna</i>, it increases its purgative properties; and it
  is also used to correct the nausea produced by squills, and the
  irritating effects of drastic purgatives and mezereon.<br>
<br>
  <i>Dose</i>, from four grains to half a scruple, repeated at short
  intervals when used in small doses, and long intervals when employed
  in large doses.<br>
<br>
  <i>Doses of the various preparations</i>.&mdash;Camphor mixture, from half an
  ounce to three ounces; compound tincture of camphor (<i>paregoric
  elixir</i>), from fifteen minims to two drachms.<br>
<br>
  <i>Caution</i>.&mdash;When given in an overdose it acts as a poison, producing
  vomiting, giddiness, delirium, convulsions, and sometimes death. Opium
  is the best antidote for camphor, whether in excess or taken as a
  poison. <br>
<br>
<i>Mode of exhibition</i>.&mdash;It may be rubbed up with almond
  emulsion, or mucilage, or the yolk of eggs, and by this means
  suspended in water, or combined with chloroform as a mixture, in which
  form it is a valuable stimulant in cholera and other diseases. (<i>See</i>
  Mixtures, <a href="#p556">556</a>-<a href="#p564">564</a>).

<br>
  Sulphuric Ether is used <i>externally</i> both as a stimulant and a
  refrigerant. In the former case its evaporation is prevented by
  covering a rag moistened with it with oiled silk, in order to relieve
  headache; and in the latter case it is allowed to evaporate, and thus
  produce coldness: hence it is applied over scalded surfaces by means
  of rags dipped in it.<br>
<br>
  <i>As a local application</i>, it has been found to afford almost instant
  relief in earache, when combined with almond oil, and dropped into the
  ear.<br>
<br>
  It is used <i>internally</i> as a stimulant and narcotic in low fevers and
  cases of great exhaustion.<br>
<br>
  <i>Dose</i>, from fifteen minims to half a drachm, repeated at short
  intervals, as its effects soon pass off. Give in a little camphor
  julep, or water.

<a name="p697"></a><b><i>697. &nbsp;Nitric Ether </i></b><br>
<br>
Nitric Ether is a refrigerant, diuretic, and antispasmodic, well known
  as "<i>sweet spirit of nitre</i>."<br>
<br>
  <i>Used externally</i>, its evaporation relieves headache, and it is
  sometimes applied to burns. It is used <i>internally</i> to relieve nausea,
  flatulence, and thirst in fevers; also as a diuretic.<br>
<br>
  <i>Dose</i>, from ten minims to one drachm. The smaller dose taken in a
  little warm water or gruel is useful as a sudorific in cases of cold
  and chill, to induce and promote the proper action of the skin which
  has been checked. If a larger dose be taken, it acts as a diuretic and
  not as a sudorific, and so fails to produce the desired effect.

<br>
  The Hop is a narcotic, tonic, and diuretic; it reduces the frequency
  of the pulse, and does not affect the head, like most anodynes.<br>
<br>
  <i>Used externally</i>, it acts as an anodyne and discutient, and is useful
  as a fomentation for painful tumours, rheumatic pains in the joints,

<a name="p700"></a><b><i>700. &nbsp;Opium</i></b><br>
<br>
  Opium is a stimulant, narcotic, and anodyne.<br>
<br>
  <i>Used externally</i> it acts almost as well as when taken into the
  stomach, and without affecting the head or causing nausea. Applied to
  irritable ulcers in the form of tincture, it promotes their cure, and
  allays pain. Cloths dipped in a strong solution, and applied over
  painful bruises, tumours, or inflamed joints, allay pain. A small
  piece of solid opium stuffed into a hollow tooth relieves toothache. A
  weak solution of opium forms a valuable collyrium in ophthalmia.  Two
  drops of the wine of opium dropped into the eye acts as an excellent
  stimulant in bloodshot eye; or after long-continued inflammation, it
  is useful in strengthening the eye. Applied as a liniment, in
  combination with ammonia and oil, or with camphorated spirit, it
  relieves muscular pain. When combined with oil of turpentine, it is
  useful as a liniment in spasmodic colic.<br>
<br>
  <i>Used internally</i>, it acts as a very powerful stimulant: then as a
  sedative, and finally as an anodyne and narcotic, allaying pain in the
  most extraordinary manner, by acting directly upon the nervous system.
  In acute rheumatism it is a most excellent medicine when combined with
  calomel and tartrate of antimony; but its exhibition requires the
  judicious care of a medical man.<br>
<br>
  <i>Doses of the various preparations.</i>&mdash;. <i>Confection of opium</i>, from
  five grains to half a drachm; <i>extract of opium</i>, from one to five
  grains (this is a valuable form, as it does not produce so much after
  derangement of the nervous system as solid opium); <i>pills of soap and
  opium</i>, from five to ten grains; <i>compound ipecacuanha powder</i>
  ("Dover's Powder"), from ten to fifteen grains; <i>compound kino
  powder</i>, from five to fifteen grains; <i>wine of opium</i>, from ten minims
  to one drachm. <br>
<br>
<i>Caution</i>.&mdash;Opium is a powerful <i>poison</i> when taken in
  too large a quantity (<i>See</i> <b>Poisons</b>, <i>pars</i>. <a href="EWpart2.html#p1340">1340</a>-<a href="EWpart2.html#p1367">1367</a>), and thus
  should be used with extreme caution. It is on this account that we
  have omitted some of its preparations. The best antidote for opium is
  camphor.

<br>
  Ipecacuanha is an emetic, diaphoretic, and expectorant.<br>
<br>
  It is <i>used internally</i> to excite vomiting, in doses of from ten to
  twenty grains of the powder, or one to one and a half ounce of the
  infusion, every half hour until vomiting takes place. To make it act
  well and easily, the patient should drink half pints of warm water
  after each dose of the infusion. As a diaphoretic, it should be given
  in doses of three grains, mixed with some soft substance, such as
  crumbs of bread, and repeated every four hours.<br>
<br>
  <i>Dose</i> of the <i>wine,</i> from twenty minims to one drachm as a
  diaphoretic, and from one drachm to one and a half ounces as an
  emetic.<br>
<br>
  <i>Caution.</i>&mdash;Do not give more than the doses named above, because,
  although a safe emetic, yet it is an acrid narcotic poison.

<a name="p731"></a><b><i>731. &nbsp;Mustard</i></b><br>
<br>

  Mustard is too well known to require describing. It is an emetic,
  diuretic, stimulant, and rubefacient.<br>
<br>
  It is <i>used externally</i> as a poultice. Mustard poultices are made of
  the powder, bread crumbs, and water; or of one part of mustard to two
  of flour; or, especially for children, of linseed meal, mixed with a
  little of the powder, or having some of the powder slightly sprinkled
  on the surface. Sometimes a little vinegar is added under the idea
  that it increases the strength of the poultice, but this is not
  necessary. In all cases where a stimulant is required, such as sore
  throats, rheumatic pains in the joints, cholera, cramps in the
  extremities, diarrh&oelig;a, and many other diseases. When applied it
  should not he left on too long, as it is apt to cause ulceration of
  the part. From ten to thirty minutes is quite long enough.<br>
<br>
  When <i>used internally</i> as an emetic, a large teaspoonful mixed with a
  tumbler of warm water generally operates quickly and safely,
  frequently when other emetics have failed. In dropsy it is sometimes
  given in the form of whey, which is made by boiling half an ounce of
  the bruised seeds in a pint of milk, and straining off the curd.<br>
<br>
  From three to four ounces of this is to be taken for a dose three
  times a day.

<a name="p766"></a><b><i>766. &nbsp;Epispastics and Rubefacients</i></b><br>

<a name="p767"></a><b><i>767. &nbsp; Cantharides, or Spanish flies</i></b><br>
<br>
  Cantharides, or Spanish flies, when used internally, are diuretic and
  stimulant; and epispastic and rubefacient when applied externally.<br>
<br>
  <i>Mode of application.</i>&mdash;A portion of the blistering plaster is spread
  with the thumb upon brown paper, linen, or leather, to the size
  required; its surface then <i>slightly</i> moistened with olive oil and
  sprinkled with camphor, and the plaster applied by a <i>light</i> bandage:
  or it is spread on adhesive plaster, and attached to the skin by the
  adhesive margin of the plaster.<br>
<br>
  <i>Caution.</i>&mdash;If a blister is to be applied to the head, shave it at
  least ten hours before it is put on; it is better to place a thin
  piece of gauze, wetted with vinegar, between the skin and the blister.
  If a distressing feeling be experienced about the bladder, give warm
  and copious draughts of linseed tea, milk, or decoction of quince
  seeds, and apply warm fomentations of milk and water to the blistered
  surface. The <i>period required</i> for a <i>blister</i> to remain on varies
  from eight to ten hours for adults, and from twenty minutes to two
  hours for children: as soon as it is removed, if the blister is not
  raised, apply a "spongio-piline" poultice, and it will then rise
  properly. When it is required to act as a rubefacient, the blister
  should remain on from one to three hours for adults, and from fifteen
  to forty minutes for children.<br>
<br>
  <i>To dress a blister.</i>&mdash;Cut the bag of cuticle containing the scrum at
  the lowest part, by snipping it with the scissors, so as to form an
  opening like this&mdash;<b>V</b>; and then apply a piece of calico, spread with
  spermaceti or some other dressing. Such is the ordinary method; but a
  much better and more expeditious plan, and one that prevents all pain
  and inconvenience in the healing, is, after cutting the blister as
  directed above, to immediately cover it with a warm bread and water
  poultice for about an hour and a half, and on the removal of the
  poultice to dust the raw surface with violet powder; apply a
  handkerchief to retain the powder, and lastly dust the part every two
  hours. It will be healed in twelve hours.<br>
<br>
  <i>Caution.</i>&mdash;Never attempt to take cantharides internally, except under
  the advice of a medical man, as it is a poison, and requires extreme
  caution in its use.

<a name="p800"></a><b><i>800. &nbsp;Rules</i></b><br>
<br>
  The following rules should be attended to in applying dressings:<br>
<br>
<ol start=1 type="i"><li>
    Always prepare the new dressing before removing the old one.</li></ol><br>


<ol start=2 type="i"><li>

    Always have hot and cold water at hand, and a vessel to place
    the foul dressings in.</li></ol><br>


<ol start=3 type="i"><li>

    Have one or more persons at hand ready to assist, and, to
    prevent confusion, tell each person what they are to do before you
    commence; thus, one is to wash out and hand the sponges, another to
    heat the adhesive plaster, or hand the bandages and dressings, and,
    if requisite, a third to support the limb, &amp;c.</li></ol><br>


<ol start=4 type="i"><li>

    Always stand on the outside of a limb to dress it.</li></ol><br>


<ol start=5 type="i"><li>

    Place the patient in as easy a position as possible, so as not to
    fatigue him.</li></ol><br>


<ol start=6 type="i"><li>

    Arrange the bed <i>after</i> changing the dressings; but in some
    cases you will have to do so before the patient is placed on it.</li></ol><br>


<ol start=7 type="i"><li>

    Never be in a hurry when applying dressings, do it quietly.</li></ol><br>


<ol start=8 type="i"><li>

    When a patient requires moving from one bed to another, the
    best way is for one person to stand on each <i>side</i> of the patient,
    and each to place an arm behind his back, while he passes his arms
    over their necks, then let their other arms be passed under his
    thighs, and by holding each other's hands, the patient can be raised
    with ease, and removed to another bed. If the leg is injured, a
    third person should steady it; and if the arm, the same precaution
    should be adopted. Sometimes a stout sheet is passed under the
    patient, and by several people holding the sides, thy patient is
    lifted without any fatigue or much disturbance.</li></ol>

<a name="p802"></a><b><i>802. &nbsp;Uses of Scraped Lint</i></b><br>
<br>
  This is made into various shapes for particular purposes. When it is
  screwed up into a conical or wedge-like shape, it is called a <i>tent</i>,
  and is used to dilate fistulous openings, so as to allow the matter to
  escape freely; and to plug wounds, so as to promote the formation of a
  clot of blood, and thus arrest bleeding. When rolled into little
  balls, called <i>boulettes</i>, it is used for absorbing matter in
  cavities, or blood in wounds. Another useful form is made by rolling a
  mass of scraped lint into a long roll, and then tying it in the middle
  with a piece of thread; the middle is then doubled and pushed into a
  deep-seated wound, so as to press upon the bleeding vessel, while the
  ends remain loose and assist in forming a clot; or it is used in
  deep-seated ulcers to absorb the matter and keep the edges apart. This
  form is called the <i>bourdonnet</i>. Another form is called the <i>pelote</i>,
  which is merely a ball of scraped lint tied up in a piece of linen
  rag, commonly called a dabber. This is used in the treatment of
  protrusion of the navel in children.

  are required. They are used to confine dressings in their places, and
  to apply an equal pressure on parts. They should be free from darns,
  hems, and knots. Ordinary compresses are square, oblong, and
  triangular. Compresses are also graduated by placing square pieces of
  folded cloth on one another, so arranged that they decrease in size

<a name="p809"></a><b><i>809. &nbsp;Poultices</i></b><br>
<br>
  Poultices are usually made of linseed meal, oatmeal, or bread, either
  combined with water or other fluids; sometimes they are made of
  carrots, charcoal, potatoes, yeast, and linseed meal, mustard, &amp;c.,
  but the best and most economical kind of poultice is a fabric made of
  sponge and wool felted together, and backed by Indian rubber, called
  "spongio piline."<br>
<br>
  The method of using this poultice is as follows:&mdash; A piece of the
  material of the required form and size is cut off, and the edges are
  pared or bevelled off with a pair of scissors, so that the caoutchouc
  may come in contact with the surrounding skin, in order to prevent
  evaporation of the fluid used; for, as it only forms the vehicle, the
  various poultices generally used can be employed with much less
  expenditure of time and money, and increased cleanliness.<br>
<br>
  For example,&mdash;a <i>vinegar</i> poultice is made by moistening the fabric
  with distilled vinegar; an <i>alum</i> poultice, by using a strong solution
  of alum; a <i>charcoal</i> poultice, by sprinkling powdered charcoal on the
  moistened surface of the material; a <i>yeast</i> poultice, by using warmed
  yeast, and moistening the fabric with hot water, which is to be well
  squeezed out previous to the absorption of the yeast; a <i>beer</i>
  poultice, by employing warm porter-dregs or strong beer as the fluid;
  and a <i>carrot</i> poultice, by using the expressed and evaporated liquor
  of boiled carrots.<br>
<br>
  Spongio-piline costs about one farthing a square inch, and may be
  obtained of the chemist. As a fomentation it is most invaluable, and
  by moistening the material with compound camphor liniment or
  hartshorn, it acts the same as a mustard poultice.

<a name="p810"></a><b><i>810. &nbsp;Mustard Poultices</i></b><br>
<br>
  These may be made of the mustard powder alone, or in combination with
  bread crumbs, or linseed meal. When mustard only is used, the powder
  should be moistened with water, and the paste thus produced spread on
  a piece of linen, and covered with muslin to intervene between the
  mustard and the skin. When mixed with linseed the powder and the meal
  may be incorporated before water is added, or the meal may be
  moistened and spread on linen for application, and the mustard be then
  strewn on the surface, more or less thickly according to the age of
  the patient. Rigollot's Mustard leaves, which can be procured from any
  chemist, are now much used in the place of mustard poultices. They
  only require wetting before application, and are both clean and
  economical.

<br>
  Bandages are strips of calico, linen, flannel, muslin, elastic
  webbing, bunting, or some other substance, of various lengths, and
  from one to six inches wide, free from hems or darns, soft and
  unglazed. They are better after they have been washed. Their uses are

<a name="p812"></a><b><i>812. &nbsp; Simple and Compound Bandages</i></b><br>
<br>
  Bandages are simple and compound; the former are simple slips rolled
  up tightly like a roll of ribbon. There is also another simple kind,
  which is rolled from both ends&mdash;this is called a double-headed
  bandage. The compound bandages are formed of many pieces.

  Bandages for the head should be two inches wide and five yards long;
  for the neck, two inches wide, and three yards long; for the arm, two
  inches wide, and seven yards long; for the leg, two inches and a half

<a name="p814"></a><b><i>814. &nbsp;To Apply a Single-Headed Bandage</i></b><br>
<br>
  To apply a single-headed bandage, lay the <i>outside of the end</i> near to
  the part to be bandaged, and hold the roll between the little, ring
  and middle fingers, and the palm of the left hand, using the thumb and
  forefinger of the same hand to guide it, and the right hand to keep it
  firm, and pass the bandage partly round the leg towards the left hand.
  It is sometimes necessary to reverse this order, and therefore it is
  well to be able to use both hands.<br>
<br>
  Particular parts require a different method of applying bandages, and
  therefore it is necessary to describe the most useful separately; and
  there are different ways of putting on the same bandage, which consist
  in the manner the folds or turns are made. For example, the <i>circular</i>
  bandage is formed by horizontal turns, each of which overlaps the one
  made before it; the <i>spiral</i> consists of spiral turns; the <i>oblique</i>
  follows a course oblique or slanting to the centre of the limb; and
  the <i>recurrent</i> folds back again to the part whence it started.

<br>
  To confine the ends of bandages some persons use pins, others slit the
  end for a short distance, and tie the two strips into a knot, and some
  use a strip of adhesive plaster. Always place the point of a pin in
  such a position that it cannot prick the patient, or the person
  dressing the limb, or be liable to be drawn out by using the limb;
  therefore, as a general rule, turn the head of the pin from the free
  end of the bandage, of towards the upper part of the limb. The best
  mode is to <i>sew</i> the bandage on. A few stitches will hold it more
  securely than pins can.

<a name="p819"></a><b><i>819. &nbsp;The Recurrent Bandage</i></b><br>
<br>
  The recurrent bandage is the best kind of bandage that we can employ
  for general purposes.  The method of putting it on the leg is as
  follows: &mdash;Apply the end of the bandage that is free, with the outside
  of it next the skin, and hold this end with the finger and thumb of
  the left hand, while some one supports the heel of the patient; then
  with the right hand pass the bandage over the piece you are holding,
  and keep it crossed thus, until you can place your right forefinger
  upon the spot where it crosses the other bandage, where it must be
  kept firm. Now hold the roll of the bandage in your left hand, with
  the palm turned upwards, and <i>taking care to keep that part of the
  bandage between your right forefinger, and the roll in your left hand,
  quite slack</i>; turn your left hand over, and bring the bandage down
  upon the leg; then pass the roll under the leg towards your right
  hand, and repeat this until the leg is bandaged up to the knee, taking
  care <i>not to drag</i> the bandage at any time during the process of
  bandaging. When you arrive at the knee, pass the bandage round the leg
  in circles just below the knee, and pin it as usual.<br>
<br>
  Bandaging is very easy, and if you once see any one apply a bandage
  properly, and attend to these rules, there will not be any difficulty;
  but bear one thing in mind, without which you will never put on a
  bandage even decently; and that is, <i>never to drag</i> or pull at a
  bandage, but make the turns while it is slack, and you have your right
  forefinger placed upon the point where it is to be folded down. When a
  limb is properly bandaged, the folds should run in a line
  corresponding to the shin-bone. Use, to retain dressings, and for
  varicose veins.

  When a person receives a severe contusion of the leg or foot, or
  breaks his leg, or has painful ulcers over the leg, or is unable from
  some cause to bear the pressure of the bedclothes, it is advisable to
  know how to keep them from hurting the leg. This may be done by
  bending up a fire-guard, or placing a chair, resting upon the edge of
  its back and front of the seat, over the leg, or putting a box on each
  side of it, and placing a plank ever them; but the best way is to make
  a <i>cradle</i>, as it is called. This is done by getting three pieces of
  wood, and three pieces of iron wire, and passing the wire or hoop
  through the wood. This can be placed to any height, and is very useful
  in all cases where pressure cannot be borne.  Wooden hoops cut in
  halves answer better than the wire.

  for want of all these, take some bones out of a pair of stays, and run
  them through a stout piece of rug, protecting the leg with a fold of
  rug, linen, &amp;c. A still better splint or set of splints can be
  extemporized by cutting a sheet of thick pasteboard into proper sized
  slips, then passing each piece through a basin of hot water to soften
  it. It is then applied to the fractured limb like an ordinary splint,
  when it hardens as it dries, taking the exact shape of the part to

  Bleeding is sometimes necessary at once in certain accidents, such as
  concussion, and therefore it is well to know how to do this. First of
  all, bind up the arm above the elbow with a piece of bandage or a
  handkerchief pretty firmly, then place your finger over one of the
  veins at the bend of the arm, and feel if there is any pulsation; if
  there is, try another vein, and if it does not pulsate or beat, choose
  that one.  Now rub the arm from the wrist towards the elbow, place the
  left thumb upon the vein, and hold the lancet as you would a pen, and
  nearly at right angles to the vein, taking care to prevent its going
  in too far, by keeping the thumb near to the point, and resting the
  hand upon the little finger. Now place the point of the lancet on the
  vein, push it suddenly inwards, depress the elbow, and raise the hand
  upwards and outwards, so as to <i>cut obliquely across</i> the vein.<br>
<br>
  When sufficient blood is drawn off, which is known by feeling the
  pulse at the wrist, and near the thumb, bandage the arm. If the pulse
  feel like a piece of cord, more blood should be taken away, but if it
  is soft, and can be easily pressed, the bleeding should be stopped.
  When you bandage the arm, place a piece of lint over the opening made
  by the lancet, and pass a bandage lightly but firmly around the arm,
  so as to cross it over the bend of the elbow, in form of a figure 8.

<br>
  Dry cupping is performed by throwing a piece of paper dipped into
  spirit of wine, and ignited, into a wineglass, and placing it over the
  part, such as the neck, temples, &amp;c. It thus draws the flesh into the
  glass, and causes a determination of blood to the part, which is
  useful in headache, and many other complaints. This is an excellent
  method of extracting the poison from wounds made by adders, mad dogs,
  fish, &amp;c.

<a name="p841"></a><b><i>841. &nbsp;Ordinary Cupping</i></b><br>
<br>
  Ordinary cupping is performed the same as dry cupping, with this
  exception, that the part is scarified or scratched with a lancet, so
  as to cause the blood to flow; or by the application of a
  scarificator, which makes by one action from seven to twenty-one light
  superficial cuts.  Then the glass is placed over it again with the
  lighted paper in it, and when sufficient blood has been taken away,
  the parts are then sponged, and a piece of sticking plaster placed
  over them.

<a name="p842"></a><b><i>842. &nbsp;Leeches and their Application</i></b><br>
<br>
  The leech used for medical purposes is called the <i>hirudo medicinalis</i>
  to distinguish it from other varieties, such as the horse-leech and
  the Lisbon leech. It varies from two to four inches in length, and is
  of a blackish brown colour, marked on the back with six yellow spots,
  and edged with a yellow line on each side. Formerly leeches were
  supplied by Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and other fenny countries, but
  latterly most of the leeches are procured from France, where they are
  now becoming scarce.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p843"></a><b><i>843. &nbsp;When Leeches are Applied</i></b><br>
<br>
  When leeches are applied to a part, it should be thoroughly freed from
  down or hair by shaving, and all liniments, &amp;c., carefully and
  effectually cleaned away by washing. If the leech is hungry it will
  soon bite, but sometimes great difficulty is experienced in getting
  them to fasten.  When this is the case, roll the leech into a little
  porter, or moisten the surface with a little blood, or milk, or sugar
  and water. Leeches may be applied by holding them over the part with a
  piece of linen cloth, or by means of an inverted glass, under which
  they must be placed.

<a name="p844"></a><b><i>844. &nbsp;When applied to the Gums</i></b><br>
<br>
  When applied to the gums, care should be taken to use a leech glass,
  as they are apt to creep down the patient's throat: a large swan's
  quill will answer the purpose of a leech glass. When leeches are
  gorged they will drop off themselves; never <i>tear</i> them off from a
  person, but just dip the point of a moistened finger into some salt
  and touch them with it.

<a name="p845"></a><b><i>845. &nbsp;Quantity Removed</i></b><br>
<br>
  Leeches are supposed to abstract about two drachms of blood, or six
  leeches draw about an ounce; but this is independent of the bleeding
  after they have come off, and more blood generally flows then than
  during the time they are sucking.  The total amount of blood drawn and
  subsequently lost by each leech-bite, is nearly half an ounce.

<a name="p846"></a><b><i>846. &nbsp;After Leeches Come Away</i></b><br>
<br>
  After leeches come away, encourage the bleeding by flannels dipped in
  hot water and wrung out dry, and then apply a warm spongiopiline
  poultice. If the bleeding is not to be encouraged, cover the bites
  with a rag dipped in olive oil, or spread with spermaceti ointment,
  having previously sponged the parts clean.

<a name="p847"></a><b><i>847. &nbsp;When Bleeding Continues</i></b><br>
<br>
  When bleeding continues from leech-bites, and it is desirable to stop
  it, apply pressure with the fingers over the part, or dip a rag in a
  strong solution of alum and lay over them, or use the tincture of
  sesquichloride of iron, or apply a leaf of matico to them, placing the
  under surface of the leaf next to the skin, or touch each bite with a
  finely-pointed piece of lunar caustic, or lay a piece of lint soaked
  in the extract of lead over the bites; and if all these tried in
  succession fail, pass a fine needle through a fold of the skin so as
  to include the bite, and twist a piece of thread round it.  Be sure
  never to allow any one to go to sleep with leech-bites bleeding,
  without watching them carefully; and never apply too many to children;
  or place them where their bites can be compressed if necessary. In
  other words, <i>never apply leeches to children except over a bone</i>.

<a name="p848"></a><b><i>848. &nbsp;After Leeches have been Used</i></b><br>
<br>
  After leeches have been used they should be placed in water containing
  sixteen per cent. of salt, which facilitates the removal of the blood
  they contain; and they should afterwards be placed one by one in
  warm water, and the blood forced out by _gentle_ pressure. The leeches
  should then be thrown into fresh water, which is to be renewed every
  twenty-four hours: they may then be re-applied after an interval of
  eight or ten days, and be disgorged a second time. The best plan,
  however, is to empty the leech by drawing the thumb and forefinger of
  the right hand along its body from the tail to the mouth, the leech
  being firmly held at the sucker extremity by the fingers of the left
  hand. By this means, with a few minutes' rest between each
  application, the same leech may be used four or five times in
  succession.

Pure atmospheric air is composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and a <i>very</i>

  The skin is a highly-organized membrane, full of minute pores, cells,

<a name="p925"></a><b><i>925. &nbsp;Hom&oelig;opathy</i></b><br>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>
<a name="p926"></a><b><i>926. &nbsp;Principle of Hom&oelig;opathy</i></b><br>
<br>
  As hom&oelig;opathy is now practised so widely and, indeed, preferred to
  the older system in many families, the Domestic Pharmacop&oelig;ia could
  scarcely lay claim to be considered complete without a brief mention
  of the principal remedies used and recommended by hom&oelig;opathic
  practitioners, and the disorders for which these remedies are
  specially applicable. The principle of hom&oelig;opathy is set forth in the
  Latin words "<i>similia similibus curantur</i>," the meaning of which is
  "likes are cured by likes."<br>
<br>
  The meaning of this is simply that the hom&oelig;opathist in order to cure
  a disease, administers a medicine which would produce in a perfectly
  healthy subject, symptoms <i>like</i>, but not <i>identical</i> with or the
  <i>same</i> as, the symptoms to counteract which the medicine is given. The
  hom&oelig;opathic practitioner, therefore, first makes himself thoroughly
  acquainted with the symptoms that are exhibited by the sufferer;
  having ascertained these, in order to neutralize them and restore the
  state of the patient's health to a state of equilibrium, so to speak,
  he administers preparations that would produce symptoms of a like
  character in persons in good health.<br>
<br>
  It is not said, be it remembered, that the drug can produce in a
  healthy person the disease from which the patient is suffering: it is
  only advanced by hom&oelig;opathists that the drug given has the power of
  producing in a person in health, symptoms similar to those of the
  disease under which the patient is languishing, and that the correct
  mode of treatment is to counteract the disease symptoms by the
  artificial production of similar symptoms by medicinal means, or in
  other words, to suit the medicine to the disorder, by a previously
  acquired knowledge of the effects of the drug, by experiment on a
  healthy person.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p927"></a><b><i>927. &nbsp;Allopathy</i></b><br>
<br>
  Allopathy is the name given to the older treatment of disorders, and
  the name is obtained from the fact, that the drugs given, do not
  produce symptoms corresponding to those of the disease for whose
  relief they are administered as in hom&oelig;opathy. The introduction of
  the term is contemporary with hom&oelig;opathy itself. It was merely given
  to define briefly the distinction that exists between the rival modes
  of treatment, and it has been accepted and adopted by all medical men
  who have no faith in hom&oelig;opathy, and the treatment that its followers
  prescribe.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><p align="right"><i><span style="color: #A82C28">Deep Rivers Flow with Silent Majesty.</span></i></p><br>

<a name="p928"></a><b><i>928. &nbsp;Comparison</i></b><br>
<br>
  Allopathic treatment is said to be experimental, while homeopathic
  treatment is based on certainty, resulting from experience. The
  allopathist tries various drugs, and if one medicine or one
  combination of drugs fails, tries another; but the hom&oelig;opathist
  administers only such medicaments as may be indicated by the symptoms
  of the patient. If two drugs are given, as is frequently, and perhaps
  generally, the case, it is because the symptoms exhibited are of such
  a character that they cannot be produced in a healthy person by the
  action of one and the same drug, and, consequently cannot be
  counteracted or neutralized by the action of a single drug.
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a> / <a href="EWIndex.html">Index</a></p><hr width="25%" align="right"><br><br>

<a name="p929"></a><b><i>929. &nbsp;Hom&oelig;opathic Medicines</i></b><br>
<br>
  Hom&oelig;opathic medicines are given in the form of globules or tinctures,
  the latter being generally preferred by homeopathic practitioners.
  When contrasted with the doses of drugs given by allopathists, the
  small doses administered by hom&oelig;opathists must at first sight appear
  wholly in adequate to the purpose for which they are given; but
  hom&oelig;opathists, whose dilution and trituration diffuse the drug given
  throughout the vehicle in which it is administered, argue that by this
  <i>extension of its surface</i> the active power of the drug is greatly
  increased; and that there is reason in this argument is shown by the
  fact that large doses of certain drugs administered for certain
  purposes will pass through the system without in any way affecting
  those organs, which will be acted on most powerfully by the very same
  drugs when administered in much smaller doses. Thus a small dose of
  sweet spirit of nitre will act on the skin and promote perspiration,
  but a large dose will act as a diuretic only, and exert no influence
  on the skin.

<a name="p938"></a><b><i>938. &nbsp;Tincture of Camphor</i></b><br>
<br>
  Tincture of camphor is one of the most useful of the hom&oelig;opathic
  remedies in all cases of colic, diarrh&oelig;a, etc.  In ordinary cases
  fifteen drops on sugar may be taken every quarter of an hour until the
  pain is allayed. In more aggravated cases, and in cases of cholera, a
  few drops may be taken at intervals of from two to five minutes.  A
  dose of fifteen drops of camphor on sugar tends to counteract a chill
  if taken soon after premonitory symptoms show themselves, and act as a
  prophylactic against cold.

<a name="p939"></a><b><i>939. &nbsp;Colic or Stomach-Ache</i></b><br>
<br>
  This disorder is indicated by griping pains in the bowels, which
  sometimes extends upwards into and over the region of the chest.
  Sometimes the pain is attended with vomiting and cold perspiration. A
  warm bath is useful, and hot flannels, or a jar or bottle filled with
  hot water should be applied to the abdomen.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>.  Aconitum napellus, especially when the abdomen is tender
  to the touch, and the patient is feverish; Belladonna for severe
  griping and spasmodic pains; Bryonia for bilious colic and diarrh&oelig;a;
  Chamomilla for children.

<a name="p940"></a><b><i>940. &nbsp;Constipation</i></b><br>
<br>
  Women are more subject than men to this confined state of the bowels,
  which will, in many cases yield to exercise, plain nutritious diet,
  with vegetables and cooked fruit, and but little bread, and an enema
  of milk and water, or thin gruel if it is some time since there has
  been any action of the bowels.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Bryonia, especially for rheumatic patients, and disturbed
  state of the stomach; Nux vomica, for persons of sedentary habits,
  especially males; Pulsatilla, for women; Sulphur, for constipation
  that is habitual or of long continuance.

<a name="p941"></a><b><i>941. &nbsp;Convulsions</i></b><br>
<br>
  For convulsions arising from whatever cause, a warm bath is desirable,
  and a milk and water enema, if the child's bowels are confined.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Belladonna and Chamomilla, if the convulsions are caused
  by teething, with Aconitum napellus if the little patient be feverish;
  Aconitum napellus, Cina, and Belladonna, for convulsions caused by
  worms; Aconite and Coff&oelig;a, when they arise from fright; Ipecacuanha
  and Nux vomica, when they have been caused by repletion, or food that
  is difficult of digestion.

<a name="p942"></a><b><i>942. &nbsp;Cough</i></b><br>
<br>
  For this disorder, a light farinaceous diet is desirable, with plenty
  of out-door exercise and constant use of the sponging-bath.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Aconitum napellus, for a hard, dry, hacking cough;
  Antimonium, for cough with wheezing and difficulty of expectoration;
  Belladonna, for spasmodic cough, with tickling in the throat, or sore
  throat; Bryonia, for hard, dry cough, with expectorations streaked
  with blood; ipecacuanha, for children.

<a name="p943"></a><b><i>943. &nbsp;Croup</i></b><br>
<br>
  As this disorder frequently and quickly terminates fatally, recourse
  should be had to a duly qualified practitioner as soon as possible.
  The disease lies chiefly in the larynx and bronchial tubes, and is
  easily recognisable by the sharp, barking sound of the cough. A warm
  bath and mustard poultice will often tend to give relief.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Aconitum napellus, in the earlier stages of the disorder,
  and spongia and Hepar sulphuris, in the more advanced stages, the
  latter medicine being desirable when the cough is not so violent and
  the breathing easier.

<a name="p944"></a><b><i>944. &nbsp;Diarrh&oelig;a</i></b><br>
<br>
  The <i>medicines</i> to be used in this disorder are those which are
  mentioned under colic and bilious attacks.

<a name="p945"></a><b><i>945. &nbsp;Dysentery</i></b><br>
<br>
  Dysentery is somewhat similar to diarrh&oelig;a, but the symptoms are more
  aggravated in character, and the evacuations are chiefly mucus
  streaked with blood. As a local remedy hot flannels or a stone jar
  filled with hot water and wrapped in flannel, should be applied to the
  abdomen.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Colocynthis and Mercurius in alternation.

<a name="p946"></a><b><i>946. &nbsp;Dyspepsia</i></b><br>
<br>
  Dyspepsia or Indigestion arises from weakness of the digestive organs.<br><br>


  <i>Symptoms</i>. Chief among these are habitual costiveness, heartburn and
  nausea, disinclination to eat, listlessness and weakness, accompanied
  with fatigue after walking, &amp;c., restlessness and disturbed sleep at
  night, bad taste in the mouth, with white tongue, especially in the
  morning, accompanied at times with fulness in the region of the
  stomach, and flatulence which causes disturbance of the heart.<br>
<br>
  The causes of indigestion are too numerous to be mentioned here, but
  they may be inferred when it is said that scrupulous attention must be
  paid to diet (see <i>par</i>. <a href="#p961">961</a>); that meals should be taken at regular
  and not too long intervals; that warm drinks, stimulants, and tobacco
  should be avoided; that early and regular hours should be kept, with a
  cold or chilled sponge bath every morning; and that measures should be
  taken to obtain a fair amount of exercise, and to provide suitable
  occupation for both body and mind during the day.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Arnica montana for persons who are nervous and irritable,
  and suffer much from headache; Bryonia for persons who are bilious and
  subject to rheumatism, and those who are listless, disinclined to eat,
  and have an unpleasant bitter taste in the mouth; Hepar sulphuris for
  chronic indigestion and costiveness, attended with tendency to vomit
  in the morning; Mercurius in cases of flatulence, combined with
  costiveness; Nux vomica for indigestion that makes itself felt from 2
  a.m. to 4 a.m., or thereabouts, with loss of appetite and nausea in
  the morning, and for persons with a tendency to piles, and those who
  are engaged in sedentary occupations; Pulsatilla for women generally,
  and Chamomilla for children.

<a name="p947"></a><b><i>947. &nbsp;Fevers</i></b><br>
<br>
For all fevers of a serious character, such as scarlet fever, typhus
  fever, typhoid fever, gastric fever, intermittent fever, or ague, &amp;c.,
  it is better to send at once for a medical man. In cases of ordinary
  fever, indicated by alternate flushes and shivering, a hot dry skin,
  rapid pulse, and dry foul tongue, the patient should have a warm bath,
  take but little nourishment, and drink cold water. <br>
<br>

   <i>Medicine</i>. Aconitum napellus.

<br>
  This disorder, which arises from, and is a symptom of, indigestion,
  frequently affects respiration, and causes disturbance and quickened
  action of the heart. The patient should pay attention to diet, as for
  dyspepsia.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. China and Nux vomica; Pulsatilla for women, and
  Chamomilla for children. See <a href="#p946">Dyspepsia</a> (946).

<a name="p949"></a><b><i>949. &nbsp;Headache</i></b><br>
<br>
  This disorder proceeds from so many various causes, which require
  different treatment, that it is wiser to apply at once to a regular
  hom&oelig;opathic practitioner, and especially in headache of frequent
  occurrence.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Nux vomica when headache is caused by indigestion;
  Pulsatilla being useful for women; Belladonna and Ignatia, for sick
  headache; Aconitum napellus and Arsenicum for nervous headache.

<a name="p950"></a><b><i>950. &nbsp;Heartburn</i></b><br>
<br>
  For this unpleasant sensation of heat, arising from the stomach,

  a good medicine. Pulsatilla may be taken by women.

<a name="p952"></a><b><i>952. &nbsp;Measles</i></b><br>
<br>
  This complaint, which seldom attacks adults, is indicated in its early
  stage by the usual accompaniments and signs of a severe cold in the
  head&mdash;namely, sneezing, running from the nose and eyelids, which are
  swollen. The sufferer also coughs, does not care to eat, and feels
  sick and restless. About four days after the first appearance of these
  premonitory symptoms, a red rash comes out over the face, neck, and
  body, which dies away, and finally disappears in about five days. The
  patient should be kept warm, and remain in one room during the
  continuance of the disorder, and especially while the rash is out,
  lest, through exposure to cold in any way, the rash may be checked and
  driven inwards.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Aconitum napellus, and Pulsatilla, which are sufficient
  for all ordinary cases. If there be much fever, Belladonna; and if the
  rash be driven in by a chill, Bryonia.

<a name="p953"></a><b><i>953. &nbsp;Mumps</i></b><br>
<br>
  This disorder is sometimes consequent on measles. It is indicated by
  the swelling of the glands under the ears and lower jaw. It is far
  more painful than dangerous. Fomenting with warm water is useful.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Mercurius generally; Belladonna may be used when mumps
  follow an attack of measles.

<a name="p954"></a><b><i>954. &nbsp;Nettlerash</i></b><br>
<br>
This rash, so called because in appearance it resembles the swelling
  and redness caused by the sting of a nettle, is generally produced by
  a disordered state of the stomach.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>.  Aconitum napellus, Nux vomica, or Pulsatilla, in
  ordinary cases; Arsenicum is useful if there be much fever; Belladonna
  if the rash is accompanied with headache.

<a name="p956"></a><b><i>956. &nbsp;Sprains</i></b><br>
<br>
  Apply to the part affected a lotion formed of one part of tincture of

  consequence of the irritation produced by it, a lotion of tincture of
  Calendula may be used in the proportion of one part of the tincture to
  four of water.

<a name="p957"></a><b><i>957. &nbsp;Teething</i></b><br>
<br>
  Infants and very young children frequently experience much pain in the
  mouth during dentition, and especially when the tooth is making its
  way through the gum. The child is often feverish, the mouth and gums
  hot and tender, and the face flushed.  There is also much running from
  the mouth, and the bowels are disturbed, being in some cases confined,
  and in others relaxed, approaching to diarrh&oelig;a.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. These are Aconitum napellus, in ordinary cases; Nux
  vomica, when the bowels are confined; Chamomilla, when the bowels are
  relaxed; Mercurius, if the relaxed state of the bowels has deepened
  into diarrh&oelig;a; Belladonna, if there be symptoms of disturbance of the
  brain.

<a name="p958"></a><b><i>958. &nbsp;Whooping-Cough</i></b><br>
<br>
  This disease is sometimes of long duration, for if it shows itself in
  the autumn or winter months, the little patient will frequently retain
  the cough until May or even June, when it disappears with the return
  of warmer weather. Change of air when practicable is desirable,
  especially when the cough has been of long continuance.<br>
<br>
  In this cough there are three stages. In the first the symptoms are
  those of an ordinary cold in the head and cough. In the second the
  cough becomes hard, dry and rapid, and the inhalation of the air,
  after or during the paroxysm of coughing produces the peculiar sound
  from which the disease is named. In the final stage the cough occurs
  at longer intervals, and the paroxysms are less violent and ultimately
  disappear. In this stage the disease is subject to fluctuation, the
  cough again increasing in frequency of occurrence and intensity if the
  patient has been unduly exposed to cold or damp, or if the weather is
  very changeable.<br>
<br>
  Children suffering from whooping-cough should have a light nourishing
  diet and only go out when the weather is mild and warm.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines</i>. Aconitum napellus in the very commencement of the
  disorder, followed by Ipecacuanha and Nux vomica when the second stage
  is just approaching and during its continuance. These medicines may be
  continued if necessary during the third stage.

<a name="p959"></a><b><i>959. &nbsp;Worms</i></b><br>
<br>
  The presence of worms is indicated by irritation of the membrane of
  the nose, causing the child to thrust its finger into the nostrils; by
  irritation of the lower part of the body; by thinness, excessive
  appetite and restlessness in sleep. Children suffering from worms
  should eat meat freely and not take so much bread, vegetables, and
  farinaceous food as children generally do. They should have as much
  exercise as possible in the open air, and be sponged with cold water
  every morning. The worms that mostly trouble children are the thread
  worms, which are present chiefly in the lower portion of the
  intestines, and the round worm.<br>
<br>
  <i>Medicines, &amp;c.</i>. Administer an injection of weak salt-and-water, and
  give Aconitum napellus, to be followed by Ignatia and Sulphur in the
  order in which they are here given. These are the usual remedies for
  thread worms. For round worms, whose presence in the stomach is
  indicated by great thinness, sickness and discomfort, and pain in the
  stomach, Aconitum napellus, Cina, Ignatia and Sulphur are given.

<a name="p960"></a><b><i>960. &nbsp;Extent of Doses in Hom&oelig;opathy</i></b><br>
<br>
  Hom&oelig;opathic medicines are given in the form of globules, pilules, or
  tincture, the last-named being generally preferred. The average doses
  for adults are from half a drop to one drop of the tincture given in a
  tablespoonful of water, from two to four pilules, or from three to six
  globules. In using the tincture it is usual to measure out a few
  tablespoonfuls of water and to add to it a certain number of drops
  regulated by the quantity of water that is used. For children medicine
  is mixed at the same strength, but a less quantity is given. The
  proper quantity for a dose is always given in books and manuals for
  the hom&oelig;opathic treatment of disease. Small cases of the principal
  medicines used in hom&oelig;opathy can be procured from most chemists, and
  with each case a little book showing the symptoms and treatment of all
  ordinary complaints is usually given.

<a name="p961"></a><b><i>961. &nbsp;Diet in Hom&oelig;opathy</i></b><br>
<br>
  The articles of food that are chiefly recommended when attention to
  diet is necessary are stale bread, beef, mutton, poultry, fresh game,
  fish, chiefly cod and flat fish, avoiding mackerel, &amp;c., eggs and
  oysters. Rice, sago, tapioca, and arrowroot are permitted, as are also
  potatoes, carrots, turnips, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, French
  beans, and broad beans. Water, milk, cocoa, and chocolate may be
  drunk. It is desirable to avoid all things that are not specified in
  the foregoing list. Ripe fruit may be eaten, but unripe fruit, unless
  cooked should be scrupulously avoided.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
