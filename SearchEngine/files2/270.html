      MY LORD,

    <p>
      The dignity of the subject of this little Treatise, not any
      persuasion of its merits as a literary composition,
      encourages me to offer it to your Lordship's patronage. The
      cause of freedom has always been found sufficient, in every
      age and country, to attract the notice of the generous and
      humane; and it is therefore, in a more peculiar manner,
      worthy of the attention and favour of a personage, who
      holds a distinguished rank in that illustrious island, the
      very air of which has been determined, upon a late
      investigation of its laws, to be an antidote against
      slavery. I feel a satisfaction in the opportunity, which
      the publication of this treatise affords me, of
      acknowledging your Lordship's civilities, which can only be
      equalled by the respect, with which I am,
    </p>

      THE PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <br>

    <p>
      As the subject of the following work has fortunately become
      of late a topick of conversation, I cannot begin the
      preface in a manner more satisfactory to the feelings of
      the benevolent reader, than by giving an account of those
      humane and worthy persons, who have endeavoured to draw
      upon it that share of the publick attention which it has
      obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the well disposed individuals, of different nations
      and ages, who have humanely exerted themselves to suppress
      the abject personal slavery, introduced in the original
      cultivation of the <i>European</i> colonies in the western
      world, <i>Bartholomew de las Casas</i>, the pious bishop of
      <i>Chiapa</i>, in the fifteenth century, seems to have been
      the first. This amiable man, during his residence in
      <i>Spanish America</i>, was so sensibly affected at the
      treatment which the miserable Indians underwent that he
      returned to <i>Spain</i>, to make a publick remonstrance
      before the celebrated emperor <i>Charles</i> the fifth,
      declaring, that heaven would one day call him to an account
      for those cruelties, which he then had it in his power to
      prevent. The speech which he made on the occasion, is now
      extant, and is a most perfect picture of benevolence and
      piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his intreaties, by opposition of avarice, were rendered
      ineffectual: and I do not find by any books which I have
      read upon the subject, that any other person interfered
      till the last century, when <i>Morgan Godwyn</i>, a
      <i>British</i> clergyman, distinguished himself in the
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present age has also produced some zealous and able
      opposers of the <i>colonial</i> slavery. For about the
      middle of the present century, <i>John Woolman</i> and
      <i>Anthony Benezet</i>, two respectable members of the
      religious society called Quakers, devoted much of their
      time to the subject. The former travelled through most
      parts of <i>North America</i> on foot, to hold
      conversations with the members of his own sect, on the
      impiety of retaining those in a state of involuntary
      servitude, who had never given them offence. The latter
      kept a free school at <i>Philadelphia</i>, for the
      education of black people. He took every opportunity of
      pleading in their behalf. He published several treatises
      against slavery,<a name="FNanchor001"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_001"><sup>[001]</sup></a> and gave an hearty
      proof of his attachment to the cause, by leaving the whole
      of his fortune in support of that school, to which he had
      so generously devoted his time and attention when alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till this time it does not appear, that any bodies of men,
      had collectively interested themselves in endeavouring to
      remedy the evil. But in the year 1754, the religious
      society, called Quakers, publickly testified their
      sentiments upon the subject,<a name="FNanchor002"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_002"><sup>[002]</sup></a> declaring, that
      "to live in ease and plenty by the toil of those, whom
      fraud and violence had put into their power, was neither
      consistent with Christianity nor common justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Impressed with these sentiments, many of this society
      immediately liberated their slaves; and though such a
      measure appeared to be attended with considerable loss to
      the benevolent individuals, who unconditionally presented
      them with their freedom, yet they adopted it with pleasure:
      nobly considering, that to possess a little, in an
      honourable way, was better than to possess much, through
      the medium of injustice. Their example was gradually
      followed by the rest. A general emancipation of the slaves
      in the possession of Quakers, at length took place; and so
      effectually did they serve the cause which they had
      undertaken, that they denied the claim of membership in
      their religious community, to all such as should hereafter
      oppose the suggestions of justice in this particular,
      either by retaining slaves in their possession, or by being
      in any manner concerned in the slave trade: and it is a
      fact, that through the vast tract of North America, there
      is not at this day a single slave in the possession of an
      acknowledged Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though this measure appeared, as has been observed
      before, to be attended with considerable loss to the
      benevolent individuals who adopted it, yet, as virtue
      seldom fails of obtaining its reward, it became ultimately
      beneficial. Most of the slaves, who were thus
      unconditionally freed, returned without any solicitation to
      their former masters, to serve them, at stated wages; as
      free men. The work, which they now did, was found to better
      done than before. It was found also, that, a greater
      quantity was done in the same time. Hence less than the
      former number of labourers was sufficient. From these, and
      a variety of circumstances, it appeared, that their
      plantations were considerably more profitable when worked
      by free men, than when worked, as before, by slaves; and
      that they derived therefore, contrary to their
      expectations, a considerable advantage from their
      benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animated by the example of the Quakers, the members of
      other sects began to deliberate about adopting the same
      measure. Some of those of the church of England, of the
      Roman Catholicks, and of the Presbyterians and
      Independants, freed their slaves; and there happened but
      one instance, where the matter was debated, where it was
      not immediately put in force. This was in
      <i>Pennsylvania</i>. It was agitated in the synod of the
      Presbyterians there, to oblige their members to liberate
      their slaves. The question was negatived by a majority of
      but one person; and this opposition seemed to arise rather
      from a dislike to the attempt of forcing such a measure
      upon the members of that community, than from any other
      consideration. I have the pleasure of being credibly
      informed, that the manumission of slaves, or the employment
      of free men in the plantations, is now daily gaining ground
      in North America. Should slavery be abolished there, (and
      it is an event, which, from these circumstances, we may
      reasonably expect to be produced in time) let it be
      remembered, that the Quakers will have had the merit of its
      abolition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor have their brethren here been less assiduous in the
      cause. As there are happily no slaves in this country, so
      they have not had the same opportunity of shewing their
      benevolence by a general emancipation. They have not
      however omitted to shew it as far as they have been able.
      At their religious meetings they have regularly inquired if
      any of their members are concerned in the iniquitous
      <i>African</i> trade. They have appointed a committee for
      obtaining every kind of information on the subject, with a
      view to its suppression, and, about three or four years
      ago, petitioned parliament on the occasion for their
      interference and support. I am sorry to add, that their
      benevolent application was ineffectual, and that the
      reformation of an evil, productive of consequences equally
      impolitick and immoral, and generally acknowledged to have
      long disgraced our national character, is yet left to the
      unsupported efforts of piety morality and justice, against
      interest violence and oppression; and these, I blush to
      acknowledge, too strongly countenanced by the legislative
      authority of a country, the basis of whose government is
      <i>liberty</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more clearly shewn, than that an
      inexhaustible mine of wealth is neglected in <i>Africa</i>,
      for prosecution of this impious traffick; that, if proper
      measures were taken, the revenue of this country might be
      greatly improved, its naval strength increased, its
      colonies in a more flourishing situation, the planters
      richer, and a trade, which is now a scene of blood and
      desolation, converted into one, which might be prosecuted
      with <i>advantage</i> and <i>honour</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such have been the exertions of the Quakers in the cause of
      humanity and virtue. They are still prosecuting, as far as
      they are able, their benevolent design; and I should stop
      here and praise them for thus continuing their humane
      endeavours, but that I conceive it to be unnecessary. They
      are acting consistently with the principles of religion.
      They will find a reward in their own consciences; and they
      will receive more real pleasure from a single reflection on
      their conduct, than they can possibly experience from the
      praises of an host of writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In giving this short account of those humane and worthy
      persons, who have endeavoured to restore to their fellow
      creatures the rights of nature, of which they had been
      unjustly deprived, I would feel myself unjust, were I to
      omit two zealous opposers of the <i>colonial</i> tyranny,
      conspicuous at the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is Mr. <i>Granville Sharp</i>. This Gentleman has
      particularly distinguished himself in the cause of freedom.
      It is a notorious fact, that, but a few years since, many
      of the unfortunate black people, who had been brought from
      the colonies into this country, were sold in the metropolis
      to merchants and others, when their masters had no farther
      occasion for their services; though it was always
      understood that every person was free, as soon as he landed
      on the British shore. In consequence of this notion, these
      unfortunate black people, refused to go to the new masters,
      to whom they were consigned. They were however seized, and
      forcibly conveyed, under cover of the night, to ships then
      lying in the <i>Thames</i>, to be retransported to the
      colonies, and to be delivered again to the planters as
      merchantable goods. The humane Mr. <i>Sharpe</i>, was the
      means of putting a stop to this iniquitous traffick.
      Whenever he gained information of people in such a
      situation, he caused them to be brought on shore. At a
      considerable expence he undertook their cause, and was
      instrumental in obtaining the famous decree in the case of
      <i>Somersett</i>, that as soon as any person whatever set
      his foot in this country, he came under the protection of
      the <i>British</i> laws, and was consequently free. Nor did
      he interfere less honourably in that cruel and disgraceful
      case, in the summer of the year 1781, when <i>an hundred
      and thirty two</i> negroes, in their passage to the
      colonies, were thrown into the sea alive, to defraud the
      underwriters; but his pious endeavours were by no means
      attended with the same success. To enumerate his many
      laudable endeavours in the extirpation of tyranny and
      oppression, would be to swell the preface into a volume:
      suffice it to say, that he has written several books on the
      subject, and one particularly, which he distinguishes by
      the title of "<i>A Limitation of Slavery</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The second is the <i>Rev. James Ramsay</i>. This gentleman
      resided for many years in the <i>West-Indies</i>, in the
      clerical office. He perused all the colonial codes of law,
      with a view to find if there were any favourable clauses,
      by which the grievances of slaves could be redressed; but
      he was severely disappointed in his pursuits. He published
      a treatise, since his return to England, called <i>An Essay
      on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the
      British Sugar Colonies</i>, which I recommend to the
      perusal of the humane reader. This work reflects great
      praise upon the author, since, in order to be of service to
      this singularly oppressed part of the human species, he
      compiled it at the expence of forfeiting that friendship,
      which he had contracted with many in those parts, during a
      series of years, and at the hazard, as I am credibly
      informed, of suffering much, in his private property, as
      well as of subjecting himself to the ill will and
      persecution of numerous individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Essay <i>on the Treatment and Conversion of African
      Slaves</i>, contains so many important truths on the
      colonial slavery, and has come so home to the planters,
      (being written by a person who has a thorough knowledge of
      the subject) as to have occasioned a considerable alarm.
      Within the last eight months, two publications have
      expressly appeared against it. One of them is intitled
      "<i>Cursory Remarks</i> on Mr. Ramsay's Essay;" the other
      an "<i>Apology for Negroe Slavery</i>." On each of these I
      am bound, as writing on the subject, to make a few remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>cursory remarker</i> insinuates, that Mr. Ramsay's
      account of the treatment is greatly exaggerated, if not
      wholly false. To this I shall make the following reply. I
      have the honour of knowing several disinterested gentlemen,
      who have been acquainted with the West Indian islands for
      years. I call them disinterested, because they have neither
      had a concern in the <i>African</i> trade, nor in the
      <i>colonial</i> slavery: and I have heard these unanimously
      assert, that Mr. <i>Ramsay's</i> account is so far from
      being exaggerated, or taken from the most dreary pictures
      that he could find, that it is absolutely below the truth;
      that he must have omitted many instances of cruelty, which
      he had seen himself; and that they only wondered, how he
      could have written with so much moderation upon the
      subject. They allow the <i>Cursory Remarks</i> to be
      excellent as a composition, but declare that it is
      perfectly devoid of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the <i>cursory remarker</i> does not depend so much on
      the circumstances which he has advanced, (nor can he, since
      they have no other existence than in his own, brain) as on
      the instrument <i>detraction</i>. This he has used with the
      utmost virulence through the whole of his publication,
      artfully supposing, that if he could bring Mr.
      <i>Ramsay's</i> reputation into dispute, his work would
      fall of course, as of no authenticity. I submit this simple
      question to the reader. When a writer, in attempting to
      silence a publication, attacks the character of its author,
      rather than the principles of the work itself, is it not a
      proof that the work itself is unquestionable, and that this
      writer is at a loss to find an argument against it?
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is something so very ungenerous in this mode of
      replication, as to require farther notice. For if this is
      the mode to be adopted in literary disputes, what writer
      can be safe? Or who is there, that will not be deterred
      from taking up his pen in the cause of virtue? There are
      circumstances in every person's life, which, if given to
      the publick in a malevolent manner, and without
      explanation, might essentially injure him in the eyes of
      the world; though, were they explained, they would be even
      reputable. The <i>cursory remarker</i> has adopted this
      method of dispute; but Mr. <i>Ramsay</i> has explained
      himself to the satisfaction of all parties, and has refuted
      him in every point. The name of this <i>cursory
      remarker</i> is <i>Tobin</i>: a name, which I feel myself
      obliged to hand down with detestation, as far as I am able;
      and with an hint to future writers, that they will do
      themselves more credit, and serve more effectually the
      cause which they undertake, if on such occasions they
      attack the work, rather than the character of the writer,
      who affords them a subject for their lucubrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is this the only circumstance, which induces me to take
      such particular notice of the <i>Cursory Remarks</i>. I
      feel it incumbent upon me to rescue an injured person from
      the cruel aspersions that have been thrown upon him, as I
      have been repeatedly informed by those, who have the
      pleasure of his acquaintance, that his character is
      irreproachable. I am also interested myself. For if such
      detraction is passed over in silence, my own reputation,
      and not my work, may be attacked by an anonymous hireling
      in the cause of slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Apology for Negroe Slavery</i> is almost too
      despicable a composition to merit a reply. I have only
      therefore to observe, (as is frequently the case in a bad
      cause, or where writers do not confine themselves to truth)
      that the work refutes itself. This writer, speaking of the
      slave-trade, asserts, that people are never kidnapped on
      the coast of <i>Africa</i>. In speaking of the treatment of
      slaves, he asserts again, that it is of the very mildest
      nature, and that they live in the most comfortable and
      happy manner imaginable. To prove each of his assertions,
      he proposes the following regulations. That the
      <i>stealing</i> of slaves from <i>Africa</i> should be
      felony. That the <i>premeditated murder</i> of a slave by
      any person on board, should come under the same
      denomination. That when slaves arrive in the colonies,
      lands should be allotted for their provisions, <i>in
      proportion to their number</i>, or commissioners should see
      that a <i>sufficient</i> quantity of <i>sound wholesome</i>
      provisions is purchased. That they should not work on
      <i>Sundays</i> and <i>other</i> holy-days. That extra
      labour, or <i>night-work, out of crop</i>, should be
      prohibited. That a <i>limited number</i> of stripes should
      be inflicted upon them. That they should have
      <i>annually</i> a suit of clothes. That old infirm slaves
      should be <i>properly cared for</i>, &amp;c.-Now it can
      hardly be conceived, that if this author had tried to
      injure his cause, or contradict himself, he could not have
      done it in a more effectual manner, than by this proposal
      of these salutary regulations. For to say that slaves are
      honourably obtained on the coast; to say that their
      treatment is of the mildest nature, and yet to propose the
      above-mentioned regulations as necessary, is to refute
      himself more clearly, than I confess myself to be able to
      do it: and I have only to request, that the regulations
      proposed by this writer, in the defence of slavery, may be
      considered as so many proofs of the assertions contained in
      my own work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall close my account with an observation, which is of
      great importance in the present case. Of all the
      publications in favour of the slave-trade, or the
      subsequent slavery in the colonies, there is not one, which
      has not been written, either by a chaplain to the African
      factories, or by a merchant, or by a planter, or by a
      person whose interest has been connected in the cause which
      he has taken upon him to defend. Of this description are
      Mr. <i>Tobin</i>, and the <i>Apologist for Negroe
      Slavery</i>. While on the other hand those, who have had as
      competent a knowledge of the subject, but not the <i>same
      interest</i> as themselves, have unanimously condemned it;
      and many of them have written their sentiments upon it, at
      the hazard of creating an innumerable host of enemies, and
      of being subjected to the most malignant opposition. Now,
      which of these are we to believe on the occasion? Are we to
      believe those, who are parties concerned, who are
      interested in the practice?-But the question does not admit
      of a dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning my own work, it seems proper to observe, that
      when, the original Latin Dissertation, as the title page
      expresses, was honoured by the University of Cambridge with
      the first of their annual prizes for the year 1785, I was
      waited upon by some gentlemen of respectability and
      consequence, who requested me to publish it in English. The
      only objection which occurred to me was this; that having
      been prevented, by an attention to other studies, from
      obtaining that critical knowledge of my own language, which
      was necessary for an English composition, I was fearful of
      appearing before the publick eye: but that, as they
      flattered me with the hope, that the publication of it
      might be of use, I would certainly engage to publish it, if
      they would allow me to postpone it for a little time, till
      I was more in the habit of writing. They replied, that as
      the publick attention was now excited to the case of the
      unfortunate <i>Africans</i>, it would be serving the cause
      with double the effect, if it were to be published within a
      few months. This argument prevailed. Nothing but this
      circumstance could have induced me to offer an English
      composition to the inspection of an host of criticks: and I
      trust therefore that this circumstance will plead much with
      the benevolent reader, in favour of those faults, which he
      may find in the present work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus promised to publish it, I was for some time
      doubtful from which of the copies to translate. There were
      two, the original, and an abridgement. The latter (as these
      academical compositions are generally of a certain length)
      was that which was sent down to Cambridge, and honoured
      with the prize. I was determined however, upon consulting
      with my friends, to translate from the former. This has
      been faithfully done with but few<a name=
      "FNanchor003"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_003"><sup>[003]</sup></a> additions. The reader
      will probably perceive the Latin idiom in several passages
      of the work, though I have endeavoured, as far as I have
      been able, to avoid it. And I am so sensible of the
      disadvantages under which it must yet lie, as a
      translation, that I wish I had written upon the subject,
      without any reference at all to the original copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will perhaps be asked, from what authority I have
      collected those facts, which relate to the colonial
      slavery. I reply, that I have had the means of the very
      best of information on the subject; having the pleasure of
      being acquainted with many, both in the naval and military
      departments, as well as with several others, who have been
      long acquainted with <i>America</i> and the
      <i>West-Indian</i> islands. The facts therefore which I
      have related, are compiled from the disinterested accounts
      of these gentlemen, all of whom, I have the happiness to
      say, have coincided, in the minutest manner, in their
      descriptions. It mud be remarked too, that they were
      compiled, not from what these gentlemen heard, while they
      were resident in those parts, but from what they actually
      <i>saw</i>. Nor has a single instance been taken from any
      book whatever upon the subject, except that which is
      mentioned in the 235th page; and this book was published in
      <i>France</i>, in the year 1777, by <i>authority</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now the pleasure to say, that the accounts of these
      disinterested gentlemen, whom I consulted on the occasion,
      are confirmed by all the books which I have ever perused
      upon slavery, except those which have been written by
      <i>merchants, planters, &amp;c</i>. They are confirmed by
      Sir <i>Hans Sloane's</i> Voyage to Barbadoes; <i>Griffith
      Hughes's</i> History of the same island, printed 1750; an
      Account of North America, by <i>Thomas Jeffries</i>, 1761;
      all <i>Benezet's</i> works, &amp;c. &amp;c. and
      particularly by Mr. <i>Ramsay's</i> Essay on the Treatment
      and Conversion of the African Slaves in the British Sugar
      Colonies; a work which is now firmly established; and, I
      may add in a very extraordinary manner, in consequence of
      the controversy which this gentleman has sustained with the
      <i>Cursory Remarker</i>, by which several facts which were
      mentioned in the original copy of my own work, before the
      controversy began, and which had never appeared in any work
      upon the subject, have been brought to light. Nor has it
      received less support from a letter, published only last
      week, from Capt. J.S. Smith, of the Royal Navy, to the Rev.
      Mr. Hill; on the former of whom too high encomiums cannot
      be bestowed, for standing forth in that noble and
      disinterested manner, in behalf of an injured character.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now only to solicit the reader again, that he will
      make a favourable allowance for the present work, not only
      from those circumstances which I have mentioned, but from
      the consideration, that only two months are allowed by the
      University for these their annual compositions. Should he
      however be unpropitious to my request, I must console
      myself with the reflection, (a reflection that will always
      afford me pleasure, even amidst the censures of the great,)
      that by undertaking the cause of the unfortunate
      <i>Africans</i>, I have undertaken, as far as my abilities
      would permit, the cause of injured innocence.

    <p>
      When civilized, as well as barbarous nations, have been
      found, through a long succession of ages, uniformly to
      concur in the same customs, there seems to arise a
      presumption, that such customs are not only eminently
      useful, but are founded also on the principles of justice.
      Such is the case with respect to <i>Slavery</i>: it has had
      the concurrence of all the nations, which history has
      recorded, and the repeated practice of ages from the
      remotest antiquity, in its favour. Here then is an
      argument, deduced from the general consent and agreement of
      mankind, in favour of the proposed subject: but alas! when
      we reflect that the people, thus reduced to a state of
      servitude, have had the same feelings with ourselves; when
      we reflect that they have had the same propensities to
      pleasure, and the same aversions from pain; another
      argument seems immediately to arise in opposition to the
      former, deduced from our own feelings and that divine
      sympathy, which nature has implanted in our breasts, for
      the most useful and generous of purposes. To ascertain the
      truth therefore, where two such opposite sources of
      argument occur; where the force of custom pleads strongly
      on the one hand, and the feelings of humanity on the other;
      is a matter of much importance, as the dignity of human
      nature is concerned, and the rights and liberties of
      mankind will be involved in its discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be necessary, before this point can be determined,
      to consult the History of Slavery, and to lay before the
      reader, in as concise a manner as possible, a general view
      of it from its earliest appearance to the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first, whom we shall mention here to have been reduced
      to a state of servitude, may be comprehended in that class,
      which is usually denominated the <i>Mercenary</i>. It
      consisted of free-born citizens, who, from the various
      contingencies of fortune, had become so poor, as to have
      recourse for their support to the service of the rich. Of
      this kind were those, both among the Egyptians and the
      Jews, who are recorded in the sacred writings.<a name=
      "FNanchor004"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_004"><sup>[004]</sup></a> The Grecian
      <i>Thetes</i><a name="FNanchor005"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_005"><sup>[005]</sup></a> also were of this
      description, as well as those among the Romans, from whom
      the class receives its appellation, the
      <i>Mercenarii</i>.<a name="FNanchor006"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_006"><sup>[006]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may observe of the above-mentioned, that their situation
      was in many instances similar to that of our own servants.
      There was an express contract between the parties; they
      could, most of them, demand their discharge, if they were
      ill used by their respective masters; and they were treated
      therefore with more humanity than those, whom we usually
      distinguish in our language by the appellation of
      <i>Slaves</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this class of servants was composed of men, who had been
      reduced to such a situation by the contingencies of
      fortune, and not by their own misconduct; so there was
      another among the ancients, composed entirely of those, who
      had suffered the loss of liberty from their own imprudence.
      To this class may be reduced the Grecian <i>Prodigals</i>,
      who were detained in the service of their creditors, till
      the fruits of their labour were equivalent to their debts;
      the <i>delinquents</i>, who were sentenced to the oar; and
      the German <i>enthusiasts</i>, as mentioned by Tacitus, who
      were so immoderately charmed with gaming, as, when every
      thing else was gone, to have staked their liberty and their
      very selves. "The loser," says he, "goes into a voluntary
      servitude, and though younger and stronger than the person
      with whom he played, patiently suffers himself to be bound
      and sold. Their perseverance in so bad a custom is stiled
      honour. The slaves, thus obtained, are immediately
      exchanged away in commerce, that the winner may get rid of
      the scandal of his victory."
    </p>
    <p>
      To enumerate other instances, would be unnecessary; it will
      be sufficient to observe, that the servants of this class
      were in a far more wretched situation, than those of the
      former; their drudgery was more intense; their treatment
      more severe; and there was no retreat at pleasure, from the
      frowns and lashes of their despotick masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having premised this, we may now proceed to a general
      division of slavery, into <i>voluntary</i> and
      <i>involuntary</i>. The <i>voluntary</i> will comprehend
      the two classes, which we have already mentioned; for, in
      the first instance, there was a <i>contract</i>, founded on
      <i>consent</i>; and, in the second, there was a
      <i>choice</i> of engaging or not in those practices, the
      known consequences of which were servitude. The
      <i>involuntary</i>; on the other hand, will comprehend
      those, who were forced, without any such <i>condition</i>
      or <i>choice</i>, into a situation, which as it tended to
      degrade a part of the human species, and to class it with
      the brutal, must have been, of all human situations, the
      most wretched and insupportable. These are they, whom we
      shall consider solely in the present work. We shall
      therefore take our leave of the former, as they were
      mentioned only, that we might state the question with
      greater accuracy, and, be the better enabled to reduce it
      to its proper limits.

      The first that will be mentioned, of the
      <i>involuntary</i>, were <i>prisoners of war</i>.<a name=
      "FNanchor007"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_007"><sup>[007]</sup></a> "It was a law,
      established from time immemorial among the nations of
      antiquity, to oblige those to undergo the severities of
      servitude, whom victory had thrown into their hands."
      Conformably with this, we find all the Eastern nations
      unanimous in the practice. The same custom prevailed among
      the people of the West; for as the Helots became the slaves
      of the Spartans, from the right of conquest only, so
      prisoners of war were reduced to the same situation by the
      rest of the inhabitants of Greece. By the same principles
      that actuated these, were the Romans also influenced. Their
      History will confirm the fact: for how many cities are
      recorded to have been taken; how many armies to have been
      vanquished in the field, and the wretched survivors, in
      both instances, to have been doomed to servitude? It
      remains only now to observe, in shewing this custom to have
      been universal, that all those nations which assisted in
      overturning the Roman Empire, though many and various,
      adopted the same measures; for we find it a general maxim
      in their polity, that whoever should fall into their hands
      as a prisoner of war, should immediately be reduced to the
      condition of a slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may here, perhaps, be not unworthy of remark, that the
      <i>involuntary</i> were of greater antiquity than the
      <i>voluntary</i> slaves. The latter are first mentioned in
      the time of Pharaoh: they could have arisen only in a state
      of society; when property, after its division, had become
      so unequal, as to multiply the wants of individuals; and
      when government, after its establishment, had given
      security to the possessor by the punishment of crimes.
      Whereas the former seem to be dated with more propriety
      from the days of Nimrod; who gave rise probably to that
      inseparable idea of <i>victory</i> and <i>servitude</i>,
      which we find among the nations of antiquity, and which has
      existed uniformly since, in one country or another, to the
      present day.<a name="FNanchor008"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_008"><sup>[008]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Add to this, that they might have arisen even in a state of
      nature, and have been coequal with the quarrels of mankind.

      But it was not victory alone, or any presupposed right,
      founded in the damages of war, that afforded a pretence for
      invading the liberties of mankind: the honourable light, in
      which <i>piracy</i> was considered in the uncivilized ages
      of the world, contributed not a little to the
      <i>slavery</i> of the human species. Piracy had a very
      early beginning. "The Grecians,"<a name=
      "FNanchor009"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_009"><sup>[009]</sup></a> says Thucydides, "in
      their primitive state, as well as the contemporary
      barbarians, who inhabited the sea coasts and islands, gave
      themselves wholly to it; it was, in short, their only
      profession and support." The writings of Homer are
      sufficient of themselves to establish this account. They
      shew it to have been a common practice at so early a period
      as that of the Trojan war; and abound with many lively
      descriptions of it; which, had they been as groundless as
      they are beautiful, would have frequently spared the sigh
      of the reader of sensibility and reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piracies, which were thus practised in the early ages,
      may be considered as <i>publick</i> or <i>private</i>. In
      the former, whole crews embarked for the benefit<a name=
      "FNanchor010"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_010"><sup>[010]</sup></a> of their respective
      tribes. They made descents on the sea coasts, carried off
      cattle, surprized whole villages, put many of the
      inhabitants to the sword, and carried others into slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the latter, individuals only were concerned, and the
      emolument was their own. These landed from their ships,
      and, going up into the country, concealed themselves in the
      woods and thickets; where they waited every opportunity of
      catching the unfortunate shepherd or husbandman alone. In
      this situation they sallied out upon him, dragged him on
      board, conveyed him to a foreign market, and sold him for a
      slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this kind of piracy Ulysses alludes, in opposition to
      the former, which he had been just before mentioning, in
      his question to Eumoeus.
    </p>
    "Did pirates wait, till all thy friends were gone,<br>
    To catch thee singly with thy flocks alone;<br>
    Say, did they force thee from thy fleecy care,<br>
    And from thy fields transport and sell thee here?"<a name=
    "FNanchor011"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_011"><sup>[011]</sup></a><br>

    <p>
      But no picture, perhaps, of this mode of depredation, is
      equal to that, with which Xenophon<a name=
      "FNanchor012"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_012"><sup>[012]</sup></a> presents us in the
      simple narrative of a dance. He informs us that the Grecian
      army had concluded a peace with the Paphlagonians, and that
      they entertained their embassadors in consequence with a
      banquet, and the exhibition of various feats of activity.
      "When the Thracians," says he, "had performed the parts
      allotted them in this entertainment, some Aenianian and
      Magnetian soldiers rose up, and, accoutred in their proper
      arms, exhibited that dance, which is called <i>Karpoea</i>.
      The figure of it is thus. One of them, in the character of
      an husbandman, is seen to till his land, and is observed,
      as he drives his plough, to look frequently behind him, as
      if apprehensive of danger. Another immediately appears in
      fight, in the character of a robber. The husbandman, having
      seen him previously advancing, snatches up his arms. A
      battle ensues before the plough. The whole of this
      performance is kept in perfect time with the musick of the
      flute. At length the robber, having got the better of the
      husbandman, binds him, and drives him off with his team.
      Sometimes it happens that the husbandman subdues the
      robber: in this case the scene is only reversed, as the
      latter is then bound and driven, off by the former."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to observe, that this dance was a
      representation of the general manners of men, in the more
      uncivilized ages of the world; shewing that the husbandman
      and shepherd lived in continual alarm, and that there were
      people in those ages, who derived their pleasures and
      fortunes from <i>kidnapping</i> and <i>enslaving</i> their
      fellow creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may now take notice of a circumstance in this narration,
      which will lead us to a review of our first assertion on
      this point, "that the honourable light, in which
      <i>piracy</i> was considered in the times of barbarism,
      contributed not a little to the <i>slavery</i> of the human
      species." The robber is represented here as frequently
      defeated in his attempts, and as reduced to that deplorable
      situation, to which he was endeavouring to bring another.
      This shews the frequent difficulty and danger of his
      undertakings: people would not tamely resign their lives or
      liberties, without a struggle. They were sometimes
      prepared; were superior often, in many points of view, to
      these invaders of their liberty; there were an hundred
      accidental circumstances frequently in their favour. These
      adventures therefore required all the skill, strength,
      agility, valour, and every thing, in short, that may be
      supposed to constitute heroism, to conduct them with
      success. Upon this idea piratical expeditions first came
      into repute, and their frequency afterwards, together with
      the danger and fortitude, that were inseparably connected
      with them, brought them into such credit among the
      barbarous nations of antiquity, that of all human
      professions, piracy was the most honourable.<a name=
      "FNanchor013"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_013"><sup>[013]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The notions then, which were thus annexed to piratical
      expeditions, did not fail to produce those consequences,
      which we have mentioned before. They afforded an
      opportunity to the views of avarice and ambition, to
      conceal themselves under the mask of virtue. They excited a
      spirit of enterprize, of all others the most irresistible,
      as it subsisted on the strongest principles of action,
      emolument and honour. Thus could the vilest of passions be
      gratified with impunity. People were robbed, stolen,
      murdered, under the pretended idea that these were
      reputable adventures: every enormity in short was
      committed, and dressed up in the habiliments of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the notions of men in the less barbarous ages, which
      followed, became more corrected and refined, the practice
      of piracy began gradually to disappear. It had hitherto
      been supported on the grand columns of <i>emolument</i> and
      <i>honour</i>. When the latter therefore was removed, it
      received a considerable shock; but, alas! it had still a
      pillar for its support! <i>avarice</i>, which exists in all
      states, and which is ready to turn every invention to its
      own ends, strained hard for its preservation. It had been
      produced in the ages of barbarism; it had been pointed out
      in those ages as lucrative, and under this notion it was
      continued. People were still stolen; many were intercepted
      (some, in their pursuits of pleasure, others, in the
      discharge of their several occupations) by their own
      countrymen; who previously laid in wait for them, and sold
      them afterwards for slaves; while others seized by
      merchants, who traded on the different coasts, were torn
      from their friends and connections, and carried into
      slavery. The merchants of Thessaly, if we can credit
      Aristophanes<a name="FNanchor014"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_014"><sup>[014]</sup></a> who never spared the
      vices of the times, were particularly infamous for the
      latter kind of depredation; the Athenians were notorious
      for the former; for they had practised these robberies to
      such an alarming degree of danger to individuals, that it
      was found necessary to enact a law,<a name=
      "FNanchor015"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_015"><sup>[015]</sup></a> which punished
      kidnappers with death.-But this is sufficient for our
      present purpose; it will enable us to assert, that there
      were two classes of <i>involuntary</i> slaves among the
      ancients, "of those who were taken publickly in a state of
      war, and of those who were privately stolen in a state of
      innocence and peace." We may now add, that the children and
      descendents of these composed a third.

    <p>
      It will be proper to say something here concerning the
      situation of the unfortunate men, who were thus doomed to a
      life of servitude. To enumerate their various employments,
      and to describe the miseries which they endured in
      consequence, either from the severity, or the long and
      constant application of their labour, would exceed the
      bounds we have proposed to the present work. We shall
      confine ourselves to their <i>personal treatment</i>, as
      depending on the power of their masters, and the protection
      of the law. Their treatment, if considered in this light,
      will equally excite our pity and abhorrence. They were
      beaten, starved, tortured, murdered at discretion: they
      were dead in a civil sense; they had neither name nor
      tribe; were incapable of a judicial process; were in short
      without appeal. Poor unfortunate men! to be deprived of all
      possible protection! to suffer the bitterest of injuries
      without the possibility of redress! to be condemned
      unheard! to be murdered with impunity! to be considered as
      dead in that state, the very members of which they were
      supporting by their labours!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet such was their general situation: there were two places
      however, where their condition, if considered in this point
      of view, was more tolerable. The &AElig;gyptian slave,
      though perhaps of all others the greatest drudge, yet if he
      had time to reach the temple<a name="FNanchor016"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_016"><sup>[016]</sup></a> of Hercules,
      found a certain retreat from the persecution of his master;
      and he received additional comfort from the reflection,
      that his life, whether he could reach it or not, could not
      be taken with impunity. Wise and salutary law!<a name=
      "FNanchor017"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_017"><sup>[017]</sup></a> how often must it have
      curbed the insolence of power, and stopped those passions
      in their progress, which had otherwise been destructive to
      the slave!
    </p>
    <p>
      But though the persons of slaves were thus greatly secured
      in &AElig;gypt, yet there was no place so favourable to
      them as Athens. They were allowed a greater liberty of
      speech;<a name="FNanchor018"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_018"><sup>[018]</sup></a> they had their
      convivial meetings, their amours, their hours of
      relaxation, pleasantry, and mirth; they were treated, in
      short, with so much humanity in general, as to occasion
      that observation of Demosthenes, in his second Philippick,
      "that the condition of a slave, at Athens, was preferable
      to that of a free citizen, in many other countries." But if
      any exception happened (which was sometimes the case) from
      the general treatment described; if persecution took the
      place of lenity, and made the fangs of servitude more
      pointed than before,<a name="FNanchor019"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_019"><sup>[019]</sup></a> they had then their
      temple, like the &AElig;gyptian, for refuge; where the
      legislature was so attentive, as to examine their
      complaints, and to order them, if they were founded in
      justice, to be sold to another master. Nor was this all:
      they had a privilege infinitely greater than the whole of
      these. They were allowed an opportunity of working for
      themselves, and if their diligence had procured them a sum
      equivalent with their ransom, they could immediately, on
      paying it down,<a name="FNanchor020"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_020"><sup>[020]</sup></a> demand their freedom
      for ever. This law was, of all others, the most important;
      as the prospect of liberty, which it afforded, must have
      been a continual source of the most pleasing reflections,
      and have greatly sweetened the draught, even of the most
      bitter slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then, to the eternal honour of &AElig;gypt and Athens,
      they were the only places that we can find, where slaves
      were considered with any humanity at all. The rest of the
      world seemed to vie with each other, in the debasement and
      oppression of these unfortunate people. They used them with
      as much severity as they chose; they measured their
      treatment only by their own passion and caprice; and, by
      leaving them on every occasion, without the possibility of
      an appeal, they rendered their situation the most
      melancholy and intolerable, that can possibly be conceived.

    <h2>
      <a href="#PART_I.">CHAP. V.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      As we have mentioned the barbarous and inhuman treatment
      that generally fell to the lot of slaves, it may not be
      amiss to inquire into the various circumstances by which it
      was produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first circumstance, from whence it originated, was the
      <i>commerce</i>: for if men could be considered as
      <i>possessions</i>; if, like <i>cattle</i>, they could be
      <i>bought</i> and <i>sold</i>, it will not be difficult to
      suppose, that they could be held in the same consideration,
      or treated in the same manner. The commerce therefore,
      which was begun in the primitive ages of the world, by
      classing them with the brutal species, and by habituating
      the mind to consider the terms of <i>brute</i> and
      <i>slave</i> as <i>synonimous</i>, soon caused them to be
      viewed in a low and despicable light, and as greatly
      inferiour to the human species. Hence proceeded that
      treatment, which might not unreasonably be supposed to
      arise from so low an estimation. They were tamed, like
      beasts, by the stings of hunger and the lash, and their
      education was directed to the same end, to make them
      commodious instruments of labour for their possessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <i>treatment</i>, which thus proceeded in the ages of
      barbarism, from the low estimation, in which slaves were
      unfortunately held from the circumstances of the commerce,
      did not fail of producing, in the same instant, its
      <i>own</i> effect. It depressed their minds; it numbed
      their faculties; and, by preventing those sparks of genius
      from blazing forth, which had otherwise been conspicuous;
      it gave them the appearance of being endued with inferiour
      capacities than the rest of mankind. This effect of the
      <i>treatment</i> had made so considerable a progress, as to
      have been a matter of observation in the days of Homer.
    </p>
    For half <i>his</i> senses Jove conveys away,<br>
    <i>Whom</i> once he dooms to see the <i>servile</i> day.<a
    name="FNanchor021"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_021"><sup>[021]</sup></a><br>

    <p>
      Thus then did the <i>commerce</i>, by classing them
      originally with <i>brutes</i>, and the consequent
      <i>treatment</i>, by cramping their <i>abilities</i>, and
      hindering them from becoming <i>conspicuous</i>, give to
      these unfortunate people, at a very early period, the most
      unfavourable <i>appearance</i>. The rising generations, who
      received both the commerce and treatment from their
      ancestors, and who had always been accustomed to behold
      their <i>effects</i>, did not consider these <i>effects</i>
      as <i>incidental</i>: they judged only from what they saw;
      they believed the <i>appearances</i> to be <i>real</i>; and
      hence arose the combined principle, that slaves were an
      <i>inferiour</i> order of men, and perfectly void of
      <i>understanding</i>. Upon this <i>principle</i> it was,
      that the former treatment began to be fully confirmed and
      established; and as this <i>principle</i> was handed down
      and disseminated, so it became, in succeeding ages, an
      <i>excuse</i> for any severity, that despotism might
      suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may observe here, that as all nations had this excuse in
      common, as arising from the <i>circumstances</i>
      above-mentioned, so the Greeks first, and the Romans
      afterwards, had an <i>additional excuse</i>, as arising
      from their own <i>vanity</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The former having conquered Troy, and having united
      themselves under one common name and interest, began, from
      that period, to distinguish the rest of the world by the
      title of <i>barbarians</i>; inferring by such an
      appellation, "that they were men who were only noble in
      their own country; that they had no right, from their
      <i>nature</i>, to authority or command; that, on the
      contrary, so low were their capacities, they were
      <i>destined</i> by nature <i>to obey</i>, and to live in a
      state of perpetual drudgery and subjugation."<a name=
      "FNanchor022"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_022"><sup>[022]</sup></a> Conformable with this
      opinion was the treatment, which was accordingly prescribed
      to a <i>barbarian</i>. The philosopher Aristotle himself,
      in the advice which he gave to his pupil Alexander, before
      he went upon his Asiatick expedition, intreated him to "use
      the Greeks, as it became a <i>general</i>, but the
      <i>barbarians</i>, as it became a <i>master</i>; consider,
      says he, the former as <i>friends</i> and
      <i>domesticks</i>; but the latter, as <i>brutes</i> and
      <i>plants</i>;"<a name="FNanchor023"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_023"><sup>[023]</sup></a> inferring that the
      Greeks, from the superiority of their capacities, had a
      <i>natural</i> right to dominion, and that the rest of the
      world, from the inferiority of their own, were to be
      considered and treated as the <i>irrational</i> part of the
      creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if we consider that this was the treatment, which they
      judged to be absolutely proper for people of this
      description, and that their slaves were uniformly those,
      whom they termed <i>barbarians</i>; being generally such,
      as were either kidnapped from <i>Barbary</i>, or purchased
      from the <i>barbarian</i> conquerors in their wars with one
      another; we shall immediately see, with what an additional
      excuse their own vanity had furnished them for the sallies
      of caprice and passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      To refute these cruel sentiments of the ancients, and to
      shew that their slaves were by no means an inferiour order
      of beings than themselves, may perhaps be considered as an
      unnecessary task; particularly, as having shewn, that the
      causes of this inferiour appearance were <i>incidental</i>,
      arising, on the one hand, from the combined effects of the
      <i>treatment</i> and <i>commerce</i>, and, on the other,
      from <i>vanity</i> and <i>pride</i>, we seem to have
      refuted them already. But we trust that some few
      observations, in vindication of these unfortunate people,
      will neither be unacceptable nor improper.

      How then shall we begin the refutation? Shall we say with
      Seneca, who saw many of the slaves in question, "What is a
      <i>knight</i>, or a <i>libertine</i>, or a <i>slave</i>?
      Are they not names, assumed either from <i>injury</i> or
      <i>ambition</i>?" Or, shall we say with him on another
      occasion, "Let us consider that he, whom we call our slave,
      is born in the same manner as ourselves; that he enjoys the
      same sky, with all its heavenly luminaries; that he
      breathes, that he lives, in the same manner as ourselves,
      and, in the same manner, that he expires." These
      considerations, we confess, would furnish us with a
      plentiful source of arguments in the case before us; but we
      decline their assistance. How then shall we begin? Shall we
      enumerate the many instances of fidelity, patience, or
      valour, that are recorded of the <i>servile</i> race? Shall
      we enumerate the many important services, that they
      rendered both to the individuals and the community, under
      whom they lived? Here would be a second source, from whence
      we could collect sufficient materials to shew, that there
      was no inferiority in their nature. But we decline to use
      them. We shall content ourselves with some few instances,
      that relate to the <i>genius</i> only: we shall mention the
      names of those of a <i>servile</i> condition, whose
      writings, having escaped the wreck of time, and having been
      handed down even to the present age, are now to be seen, as
      so many living monuments, that neither the Grecian, nor
      Roman genius, was superiour to their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first, whom we shall mention here, is the famous
      &AElig;sop. He was a Phrygian by birth, and lived in the
      time of Croesus, king of Lydia, to whom he dedicated his
      fables. The writings of this great man, in whatever light
      we consider them, will be equally entitled to our
      admiration. But we are well aware, that the very mention of
      him as a writer of fables, may depreciate him in the eyes
      of some. To such we shall propose a question, "Whether this
      species of writing has not been more beneficial to mankind;
      or whether it has not produced more important events, than
      any other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the first consideration, it is evident that
      these fables, as consisting of plain and simple
      transactions, are particularly easy to be understood; as
      conveyed in images, they please and seduce the mind; and,
      as containing a <i>moral</i>, easily deducible on the side
      of virtue; that they afford, at the same time, the most
      weighty precepts of philosophy. Here then are the two grand
      points of composition, "a manner of expression to be
      apprehended by the lowest capacities, and, (what is
      considered as a victory in the art) an happy conjunction of
      utility and pleasure."<a name="FNanchor024"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_024"><sup>[024]</sup></a> Hence Quintilian
      recommends them, as singularly useful, and as admirably
      adapted, to the puerile age; as a just gradation between
      the language of the nurse and the preceptor, and as
      furnishing maxims of prudence and virtue, at a time when
      the speculative principles of philosophy are too difficult
      to be understood. Hence also having been introduced by most
      civilized nations into their system of education, they have
      produced that general benefit, to which we at first
      alluded. Nor have they been of less consequence in
      maturity; but particularly to those of inferiour
      capacities, or little erudition, whom they have frequently
      served as a guide to conduct them in life, and as a medium,
      through which an explanation might be made, on many and
      important occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the latter consideration, which is easily
      deducible from hence, we shall only appeal to the wonderful
      effect, which the fable, pronounced by Demosthenes against
      Philip of Macedon, produced among his hearers; or to the
      fable, which was spoken by Menenius Agrippa to the Roman
      populace; by which an illiterate multitude were brought
      back to their duty as citizens, when no other species of
      oratory could prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these truly <i>ingenious</i>, and <i>philosophical</i>
      works of &AElig;sop, we shall add those of his imitator
      Phoedrus, which in purity and elegance of style, are
      inferiour to none. We shall add also the Lyrick
      <i>Poetry</i> of Alcman, which is no <i>servile</i>
      composition; the sublime <i>Morals</i> of Epictetus, and
      the incomparable <i>comedies</i> of Terence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then does it appear, that the <i>excuse</i> which was
      uniformly started in defence of the <i>treatment</i> of
      slaves, had no foundation whatever either in truth or
      justice. The instances that we have mentioned above, are
      sufficient to shew, that there was no inferiority, either
      in their <i>nature</i>, or their understandings: and at the
      same time that they refute the principles of the ancients,
      they afford a valuable lesson to those, who have been
      accustomed to form too precipitate a judgment on the
      abilities of men: for, alas! how often has <i>secret
      anguish</i> depressed the spirits of those, whom they have
      frequently censured, from their gloomy and dejected
      appearance! and how often, on the other hand, has their
      judgment resulted from their own <i>vanity</i> and
      <i>pride</i>!

    </h2>
    <p>
      We proceed now to the consideration of the <i>commerce</i>:
      in consequence of which, people, endued with the same
      feelings and faculties as ourselves, were made subject to
      the laws and limitations of <i>possession</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This commerce of the human species was of a very early
      date. It was founded on the idea that men were
      <i>property</i>; and, as this idea was coeval with the
      first order of <i>involuntary</i> slaves, it must have
      arisen, (if the date, which we previously affixed to that
      order, be right) in the first practices of barter. The
      Story of Joseph, as recorded in the sacred writings, whom
      his brothers sold from an envious suspicion of his future
      greatness, is an ample testimony of the truth of this
      conjecture. It shews that there were men, even at that
      early period, who travelled up and down as merchants,
      collecting not only balm, myrrh, spicery, and other wares,
      but the human species also, for the purposes of traffick.
      The instant determination of the brothers, on the first
      sight of the merchants, <i>to sell him</i>, and the
      immediate acquiescence of these, who purchased him for a
      foreign market, prove that this commerce had been then
      established, not only in that part of the country, where
      this transaction happened, but in that also, whither the
      merchants were then travelling with their camels, namely,
      &AElig;gypt: and they shew farther, that, as all customs
      require time for their establishment, so it must have
      existed in the ages, previous to that of Pharaoh; that is,
      in those ages, in which we fixed the first date of
      <i>involuntary</i> servitude. This commerce then, as
      appears by the present instance, existed in the earliest
      practices of barter, and had descended to the
      &AElig;gyptians, through as long a period of time, as was
      sufficient to have made it, in the times alluded to, an
      established custom. Thus was &AElig;gypt, in those days,
      the place of the greatest resort; the grand emporium of
      trade, to which people were driving their merchandize, as
      to a centre; and thus did it afford, among other
      opportunities of traffick, the <i>first market</i> that is
      recorded, for the sale of the human species.
    </p>
    <p>
      This market, which was thus supplied by the constant
      concourse of merchants, who resorted to it from various
      parts, could not fail, by these means, to have been
      considerable. It received, afterwards, an additional supply
      from those piracies, which we mentioned to have existed in
      the uncivilized ages of the world, and which, in fact, it
      greatly promoted and encouraged; and it became, from these
      united circumstances, so famous, as to have been known,
      within a few centuries from the time of Pharaoh, both to
      the Grecian colonies in Asia, and the Grecian islands.
      Homer mentions Cyprus and &AElig;gypt as the common markets
      for slaves, about the times of the Trojan war. Thus
      Antinous, offended with Ulysses, threatens to send him to
      one of these places, if he does not instantly depart from
      his table.<a name="FNanchor025"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_025"><sup>[025]</sup></a> The same poet also, in
      his hymn to Bacchus,<a name="FNanchor026"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_026"><sup>[026]</sup></a> mentions them again,
      but in a more unequivocal manner, as the common markets for
      slaves. He takes occasion, in that hymn, to describe the
      pirates method of scouring the coast, from the circumstance
      of their having kidnapped Bacchus, as a noble youth, for
      whom they expected an immense ransom. The captain of the
      vessel, having dragged him on board, is represented as
      addressing himself thus, to the steersman:
    </p>
    "Haul in the tackle, hoist aloft the sail,<br>
    Then take your helm, and watch the doubtful gale!<br>
    To mind the captive prey, be our's the care,<br>
    While you to <i>&AElig;gypt</i> or to <i>Cyprus</i>
    steer;<br>
    There shall he go, unless his friends he'll tell,<br>
    Whose ransom-gifts will pay us full as well."<br>

    <p>
      It may not perhaps be considered as a digression, to
      mention in few words, by itself, the wonderful concordance
      of the writings of Moses and Homer with the case before us:
      not that the former, from their divine authority, want
      additional support, but because it cannot be unpleasant to
      see them confirmed by a person, who, being one of the
      earliest writers, and living in a very remote age, was the
      first that could afford us any additional proof of the
      circumstances above-mentioned. &AElig;gypt is represented,
      in the first book of the sacred writings, as a market for
      slaves, and, in the <a name="FNanchor027"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_027"><sup>[027]</sup></a>second, as famous for
      the severity of its servitude. <a name="FNanchor028"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_028"><sup>[028]</sup></a>The same line,
      which we have already cited from Homer, conveys to us the
      same ideas. It points it out as a market for the human
      species, and by the epithet of "<i>bitter</i> &AElig;gypt,"
      (<a name="FNanchor029"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_029"><sup>[029]</sup></a>which epithet is
      peculiarly annexed to it on this occasion) alludes in the
      strongest manner to that severity and rigour, of which the
      sacred historian transmitted us the first account.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to return. Though &AElig;gypt was the first market
      recorded for this species of traffick; and though
      &AElig;gypt, and Cyprus afterwards, were particularly
      distinguished for it, in the times of the Trojan war; yet
      they were not the only places, even at that period, where
      men were bought and sold. The Odyssey of Homer shews that
      it was then practised in many of the islands of the
      &AElig;gean sea; and the Iliad, that it had taken place
      among those Grecians on the continent of Europe, who had
      embarked from thence on the Trojan expedition. This appears
      particularly at the end of the seventh book. A fleet is
      described there, as having just arrived from Lemnos, with a
      supply of wine for the Grecian camp. The merchants are
      described also, as immediately exposing it to sale, and as
      receiving in exchange, among other articles of barter,
      "<i>a number of slaves</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      It will now be sufficient to observe, that, as other states
      arose, and as circumstances contributed to make them known,
      this custom is discovered to have existed among them; that
      it travelled over all Asia; that it spread through the
      Grecian and Roman world; was in use among the barbarous
      nations, which overturned the Roman empire; and was
      practised therefore, at the same period, throughout all
      Europe.

    </h2>
    <p>
      This <i>slavery</i> and <i>commerce</i>, which had
      continued for so long a time, and which was thus practised
      in Europe at so late a period as that, which succeeded the
      grand revolutions in the western world, began, as the
      northern nations were settled in their conquests, to
      decline, and, on their full establishment, were abolished.
      A difference of opinion has arisen respecting the cause of
      their abolition; some having asserted, that they were the
      necessary consequences of the <i>feudal system</i>; while
      others, superiour both in number and in argument, have
      maintained that they were the natural effects of
      <i>Christianity</i>. The mode of argument, which the former
      adopt on this occasion, is as follows. "The multitude of
      little states, which sprang up from one great one at this
      &AElig;ra, occasioned infinite bickerings and matter for
      contention. There was not a state or seignory, which did
      not want all the hands they could muster, either to defend
      their own right, or to dispute that of their neighbours.
      Thus every man was taken into the service: whom they armed
      they must trust: and there could be no trust but in free
      men. Thus the barrier between the two natures was thrown
      down, and <i>slavery</i> was no more heard of, in the
      <i>west</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      That this was not the <i>necessary</i> consequence of such
      a situation, is apparent. The political state of Greece, in
      its early history, was the same as that of Europe, when
      divided, by the feudal system, into an infinite number of
      small and independent kingdoms. There was the same matter
      therefore for contention, and the same call for all the
      hands that could be mustered: the Grecians, in short, in
      <i>heroick</i>, were in the same situation in these
      respects as the <i>feudal barons</i> in the <i>Gothick</i>
      times. Had this therefore been a <i>necessary</i> effect,
      there had been a cessation of servitude in Greece, in those
      ages, in which we have already shewn that it existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with respect to <i>Christianity</i>, many and great are
      the arguments, that it occasioned so desirable an event. It
      taught, "that all men were originally equal; that the Deity
      was no respecter of persons, and that, as all men were to
      give an account of their actions hereafter, it was
      necessary that they should be free." These doctrines could
      not fail of having their proper influence on those, who
      first embraced <i>Christianity</i>, from a
      <i>conviction</i> of its truth; and on those of their
      descendents afterwards, who, by engaging in the
      <i>crusades</i>, and hazarding their lives and fortunes
      there, shewed, at least, an <i>attachment</i> to that
      religion. We find them accordingly actuated by these
      principles: we have a positive proof, that the <i>feudal
      system</i> had no share in the honour of suppressing
      slavery, but that <i>Christianity</i> was the only cause;
      for the greatest part of the <i>charters</i> which were
      granted for the freedom of slaves in those times (many of
      which are still extant) were granted, "<i>pro amore Dei,
      pro mercede anim&aelig;</i>." They were founded, in short,
      on religious considerations, "that they might procure the
      favour of the Deity, which they conceived themselves to
      have forfeited, by the subjugation of those, whom they
      found to be the objects of the divine benevolence and
      attention equally with themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      These considerations, which had thus their first origin in
      <i>Christianity</i>, began to produce their effects, as the
      different nations were converted; and procured that general
      liberty at last, which, at the close of the twelfth
      century, was conspicuous in the west of Europe. What a
      glorious and important change! Those, who would have had
      otherwise no hopes, but that their miseries would be
      terminated by death, were then freed from their servile
      condition; those, who, by the laws of war, would have had
      otherwise an immediate prospect of servitude from the hands
      of their imperious conquerors, were then <i>exchanged</i>;
      a custom, which has happily descended to the present day.
      Thus, "a numerous class of men, who formerly had no
      political existence, and were employed merely as
      instruments of labour, became useful citizens, and
      contributed towards augmenting the force or riches of the
      society, which adopted them as members;" and thus did the
      greater part of the Europeans, by their conduct on this
      occasion, assert not only liberty for themselves, but for
      their fellow-creatures also.

      But if men therefore, at a time when under the influence of
      religion they exercised their serious thoughts, abolished
      slavery, how impious must they appear, who revived it; and
      what arguments will not present themselves against their
      conduct!<a name="FNanchor030"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_030"><sup>[030]</sup></a> The Portuguese, within
      two centuries after its suppression in Europe, in imitation
      of those <i>piracies</i>, which we have shewn to have
      existed in the <i>uncivilized</i> ages of the world, made
      their descents on Africa, and committing depredations on
      the coast,<a name="FNanchor031"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_031"><sup>[031]</sup></a> <i>first</i> carried
      the wretched inhabitants into slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This practice, however trifling and partial it might appear
      at first, soon became serious and general. A melancholy
      instance of the depravity of human nature; as it shews,
      that neither the laws nor religion of any country, however
      excellent the forms of each, are sufficient to bind the
      consciences of some; but that there are always men, of
      every age, country, and persuasion, who are ready to
      sacrifice their dearest principles at the shrine of gain.
      Our own ancestors, together with the Spaniards, French, and
      most of the maritime powers of Europe, soon followed the
      <i>piratical</i> example; and thus did the Europeans, to
      their eternal infamy, renew a custom, which their
      <i>own</i> ancestors had so lately exploded, from a
      <i>conscientiousness</i> of its <i>impiety</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Africans, terrified at these repeated
      depredations, fled in confusion from the coast, and sought,
      in the interiour parts of the country, a retreat from the
      persecution of their invaders. But, alas, they were
      miserably disappointed! There are few retreats, that can
      escape the penetrating eye of avarice. The Europeans still
      pursued them; they entered their rivers; sailed up into the
      heart of the country; surprized the unfortunate Africans
      again; and carried them into slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this conduct, though successful at first, defeated
      afterwards its own ends. It created a more general alarm,
      and pointed out, at the same instant, the best method of
      security from future depredations. The banks of the rivers
      were accordingly deserted, as the coasts had been before;
      and thus were the <i>Christian</i> invaders left without a
      prospect of their prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this situation however, expedients were not wanting.
      They now formed to themselves the resolution of settling in
      the country; of securing themselves by fortified ports; of
      changing their system of force into that of pretended
      liberality; and of opening, by every species of bribery and
      corruption, a communication with the natives. These plans
      were put into immediate execution. The Europeans erected
      their forts;<a name="FNanchor032"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_032"><sup>[032]</sup></a> landed their
      merchandize; and endeavoured, by a peaceable deportment, by
      presents, and by every appearance of munificence, to seduce
      the attachment and confidence of the Africans. These
      schemes had the desired effect. The gaudy trappings of
      European art, not only caught their attention, but excited
      their curiosity: they dazzled the eyes and bewitched the
      senses, not only of those, to whom they were given, but of
      those, to whom they were shewn. Thus followed a speedy
      intercourse with each other, and a confidence, highly
      favourable to the views of avarice or ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now time for the Europeans to embrace the
      opportunity, which this intercourse had thus afforded them,
      of carrying their schemes into execution, and of fixing
      them on such a permanent foundation, as should secure them
      future success. They had already discovered, in the
      different interviews obtained, the chiefs of the African
      tribes. They paid their court therefore to these, and so
      compleatly intoxicated their senses with the luxuries,
      which they brought from home, as to be able to seduce them
      to their designs. A treaty of peace and commerce was
      immediately concluded: it was agreed, that the kings, on
      their part, should, from this period, sentence <i>prisoners
      of war</i> and <i>convicts</i> to <i>European
      servitude</i>; and that the Europeans should supply them,
      in return, with the luxuries of the north. This agreement
      immediately took place; and thus begun that
      <i>commerce</i>, which makes so considerable a figure at
      the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But happy had the Africans been, if those only, who had
      been justly convicted of crimes, or taken in a just war,
      had been sentenced to the severities of servitude! How many
      of those miseries, which afterwards attended them, had been
      never known; and how would their history have saved those
      sighs and emotions of pity, which must now ever accompany
      its perusal. The Europeans, on the establishment of their
      western colonies, required a greater number of slaves than
      a strict adherence to the treaty could produce. The princes
      therefore had only the choice of relinquishing the
      commerce, or of consenting to become unjust. They had long
      experienced the emoluments of the trade; they had acquired
      a taste for the luxuries it afforded; and they now beheld
      an opportunity of gratifying it, but in a more extentive
      manner. <i>Avarice</i> therefore, which was too powerful
      for <i>justice</i> on this occasion, immediately turned the
      scale: not only those, who were fairly convicted of
      offences, were now sentenced to servitude, but even those
      who were <i>suspected</i>. New crimes were invented, that
      new punishments might succeed. Thus was every appearance
      soon construed into reality; every shadow into a substance;
      and often virtue into a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such also was the case with respect to prisoners of war.
      Not only those were now delivered into slavery, who were
      taken in a state of publick enmity and injustice, but those
      also, who, conscious of no injury whatever, were taken in
      the <i>arbitrary</i> skirmishes of these <i>venal</i>
      sovereigns. War was now made, not as formerly, from the
      motives of retaliation and defence, but for the sake of
      obtaining prisoners alone, and the advantages resulting
      from their sale. If a ship from Europe came but into sight,
      it was now considered as a sufficient motive for a war, and
      as a signal only for an instantaneous commencement of
      hostilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the African kings could be capable of such
      injustice, what vices are there, that their consciences
      would restrain, or what enormities, that we might not
      expect to be committed? When men once consent to be unjust,
      they lose, at the same instant with their virtue, a
      considerable portion of that sense of shame, which, till
      then, had been found a successful protector against the
      sallies of vice. From that awful period, almost every
      expectation is forlorn: the heart is left unguarded: its
      great protector is no more: the vices therefore, which so
      long encompassed it in vain, obtain an easy victory: in
      crouds they pour into the defenceless avenues, and take
      possession of the soul: there is nothing now too vile for
      them to meditate, too impious to perform. Such was the
      situation of the despotick sovereigns of Africa. They had
      once ventured to pass the bounds of virtue, and they soon
      proceeded to enormity. This was particularly conspicuous in
      that general conduct, which they uniformly observed, after
      any unsuccessful conflict. Influenced only by the venal
      motives of European traffick, they first made war upon the
      neighbouring tribes, contrary to every principle of
      justice; and if, by the flight of the enemy, or by other
      contingencies, they were disappointed of their prey, they
      made no hesitation of immediately turning their arms
      against their own subjects. The first villages they came
      to, were always marked on this occasion, as the first
      objects of their avarice. They were immediately surrounded,
      were afterwards set on fire, and the wretched inhabitants
      seized, as they were escaping from the flames. These,
      consisting of whole families, fathers, brothers, husbands,
      wives, and children, were instantly driven in chains to the
      merchants, and consigned to slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these calamities, which thus arose from the tyranny of
      the kings, we may now subjoin those, which arose from the
      avarice of private persons. Many were kidnapped by their
      own countrymen, who, encouraged by the merchants of Europe,
      previously lay in wait for them, and sold them afterwards
      for slaves; while the seamen of the different ships, by
      every possible artifice, enticed others on board, and
      transported them to the regions of servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these practices are in full force at the present day, it
      appears that there are four orders of <i>involuntary</i>
      slaves on the African continent; of <a name=
      "FNanchor033"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_033"><sup>[033]</sup></a><i>convicts</i>; of
      <i>prisoners of war</i>; of those, who are publickly seized
      by virtue of the <i>authority</i> of their prince; and of
      those, who are privately <i>kidnapped</i> by individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains only to observe on this head, that in the sale
      and purchase of these the African commerce or <i>Slave
      Trade</i> consists; that they are delivered to the
      merchants of Europe in exchange for their various
      commodities; that these transport them to their colonies in
      the west, where their <i>slavery</i> takes place; and that
      a fifth order arises there, composed of all such as are
      born to the native Africans, after their transportation and
      slavery have commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus explained as much of the history of modern
      servitude, as is sufficient for the prosecution of our
      design, we should have closed our account here, but that a
      work, just published, has furnished us with a singular
      anecdote of the colonists of a neighbouring nation, which
      we cannot but relate. The learned <a name=
      "FNanchor034"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_034"><sup>[034]</sup></a>author, having
      described the method which the Dutch colonists at the Cape
      make use of to take the Hottentots and enslave them, takes
      occasion, in many subsequent parts of the work, to mention
      the dreadful effects of the practice of slavery; which, as
      he justly remarks, "leads to all manner of misdemeanours
      and wickedness. Pregnant women," says he, "and children in
      their tenderest years, were not at this time, neither
      indeed are they ever, exempt from the effects of the hatred
      and spirit of vengeance constantly harboured by the
      colonists, with respect to the <a name="FNanchor035"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_035"><sup>[035]</sup></a>Boshies-man
      nation; <i>excepting such indeed as are marked out to be
      carried away into bondage</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does a colonist at any time get sight of a Boshies-man, he
      takes fire immediately, and spirits up his horse and dogs,
      in order to hunt him with more ardour and fury than he
      would a wolf, or any other wild beast? On an open plain, a
      few colonists on horseback are always sure to get the
      better of the greatest number of Boshies-men that can be
      brought together; as the former always keep at the distance
      of about an hundred, or an hundred and fifty paces (just as
      they find it convenient) and charging their heavy fire-arms
      with a very large kind of shot, jump off their horses, and
      rest their pieces in their usual manner on their ramrods,
      in order that they may shoot with the greater certainty; so
      that the balls discharged by them will sometimes, as I have
      been assured, go through the bodies of six, seven, or eight
      of the enemy at a time, especially as these latter know no
      better than to keep close together in a body."-
    </p>
    <p>
      "And not only is the capture of the Hottentots considered
      by them merely as a party of pleasure, but in cold blood
      they destroy the bands which nature has knit between their
      husbands, and their wives and children, &amp;c."
    </p>
    <p>
      With what horrour do these passages seem to strike us! What
      indignation do they seem to raise in our breasts, when we
      reflect, that a part of the human species are considered as
      <i>game</i>, and that <i>parties of pleasure</i> are made
      for their <i>destruction</i>! The lion does not imbrue his
      claws in blood, unless called upon by hunger, or provoked
      by interruption; whereas the merciless Dutch, more savage
      than the brutes themselves, not only murder their
      fellow-creatures without any provocation or necessity, but
      even make a diversion of their sufferings, and enjoy their
      pain.

    <p>
      As we explained the History of Slavery in the first part of
      this Essay, as far as it was necessary for our purpose, we
      shall now take the question into consideration, which we
      proposed at first as the subject of our inquiry, viz. how
      far the commerce and slavery of the human species, as
      revived by some of the nations of Europe in the persons of
      the unfortunate Africans, and as revived, in a great
      measure, on the principles of antiquity, are consistent
      with the laws of nature, or the common notions of equity,
      as established among men.
    </p>
    <p>
      This question resolves itself into two separate parts for
      discussion, into <i>the African commerce (as explained in
      the history of slavery)</i> and <i>the subsequent slavery
      in the colonies, as founded on the equity of the
      commerce</i>. The former, of course, will be first
      examined. For this purpose we shall inquire into the rise,
      nature, and design of government. Such an inquiry will be
      particularly useful in the present place; it will afford us
      that general knowledge of subordination and liberty, which
      is necessary in the case before us, and will be found, as
      it were, a source, to which we may frequently refer for
      many and valuable arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that mankind were originally free, and that they
      possessed an equal right to the soil and produce of the
      earth. For proof of this, we need only appeal to the
      <i>divine</i> writings; to the <i>golden age</i> of the
      poets, which, like other fables of the times, had its
      origin in truth; and to the institution of the
      <i>Saturnalia</i>, and of other similar festivals; all of
      which are so many monuments of this original equality of
      men. Hence then there was no rank, no distinction, no
      superiour. Every man wandered where he chose, changing his
      residence, as a spot attracted his fancy, or suited his
      convenience, uncontrouled by his neighbour, unconnected
      with any but his family. Hence also (as every thing was
      common) he collected what he chose without injury, and
      enjoyed without injury what he had collected. Such was the
      first situation of mankind;<a name="FNanchor036"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_036"><sup>[036]</sup></a> a state of
      <i>dissociation</i> and <i>independence</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dissociated state it is impossible that men could
      have long continued. The dangers to which they must have
      frequently been exposed, by the attacks of fierce and
      rapacious beasts, by the proedatory attempts of their own
      species, and by the disputes of contiguous and independent
      families; these, together with their inability to defend,
      themselves, on many such occasions, must have incited them
      to unite. Hence then was <i>society</i> formed on the grand
      principles of preservation and defence: and as these
      principles began to operate, in the different parts of the
      earth, where the different families had roamed, a great
      number of these <i>societies</i> began to be formed and
      established; which, taking to themselves particular names
      from particular occurrences, began to be perfectly distinct
      from one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the individuals, of whom these societies were composed,
      had associated only for their defence, so they experienced,
      at first, no change in their condition. They were still
      independent and free; they were still without discipline or
      laws; they had every thing still in common; they pursued
      the same, manner of life; wandering only, in <i>herds</i>,
      as the earth gave them or refused them sustenance, and
      doing, as a <i>publick body</i>, what they had been
      accustomed to do as <i>individuals</i> before. This was the
      exact situation of the Get&aelig; and Scythians,<a name=
      "FNanchor037"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_037"><sup>[037]</sup></a> of the Lybians and
      Goetulians<a name="FNanchor038"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_038"><sup>[038]</sup></a> of the Italian
      Aborigines,<a name="FNanchor039"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_039"><sup>[039]</sup></a> and of the Huns and
      Alans.<a name="FNanchor040"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_040"><sup>[040]</sup></a> They had left their
      original state of <i>dissociation</i>, and had stepped into
      that, which has been just described. Thus was the second
      situation of men a state of <i>independent society</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus joined themselves together, and having formed
      themselves into several large and distinct bodies, they
      could not fail of submitting soon to a more considerable
      change. Their numbers must have rapidly increased, and
      their societies, in process of time, have become so
      populous, as frequently to have experienced the want of
      subsistence, and many of the commotions and tumults of
      intestine strife. For these inconveniences however there
      were remedies to be found. <i>Agriculture</i> would furnish
      them with that subsistence and support, which the earth,
      from the rapid increase of its inhabitants, had become
      unable spontaneously to produce. An <i>assignation</i> of
      <i>property</i> would not only enforce an application, but
      excite an emulation, to labour; and <i>government</i> would
      at once afford a security to the acquisitions of the
      industrious, and heal the intestine disorders of the
      community, by the introduction of laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such then were the remedies, that were gradually applied.
      The <i>societies</i>, which had hitherto seen their
      members, undistinguished either by authority or rank,
      admitted now of magistratical pre-eminence. They were
      divided into tribes; to every tribe was allotted a
      particular district for its support, and to every
      individual his particular spot. The Germans,<a name=
      "FNanchor041"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_041"><sup>[041]</sup></a> who consisted of many
      and various nations, were exactly in this situation. They
      had advanced a step beyond the Scythians, Goetulians, and
      those, whom we described before; and thus was the third
      situation of mankind a state of <i>subordinate society</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a href="#PART_II.">CHAP. II.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      As we have thus traced the situation of man from unbounded
      liberty to subordination, it will be proper to carry our
      inquiries farther, and to consider, who first obtained the
      pre-eminence in these <i>primoeval societies</i>, and by
      what particular methods it was obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only two ways, by which such an event could have
      been produced, by <i>compulsion</i> or <i>consent</i>. When
      mankind first saw the necessity of government, it is
      probable that many had conceived the desire of ruling. To
      be placed in a new situation, to be taken from the common
      herd, to be the first, distinguished among men, were
      thoughts, that must have had their charms. Let us suppose
      then, that these thoughts had worked so unusually on the
      passions of any particular individual, as to have driven
      him to the extravagant design of obtaining the preeminence
      by force. How could his design have been accomplished? How
      could he forcibly have usurped the jurisdiction at a time,
      when, all being equally free, there was not a single
      person, whose assistance he could command? Add to this,
      that, in a state of universal liberty, force had been
      repaid by force, and the attempt had been fatal to the
      usurper.
    </p>
    <p>
      As <i>empire</i> then could never have been gained at first
      by <i>compulsion</i>, so it could only have been obtained
      by <i>consent</i>; and as men were then going to make an
      important sacrifice, for the sake of their <i>mutual</i>
      happiness, so he alone could have obtained it, (not whose
      <i>ambition</i> had greatly distinguished him from the
      rest) but in whose <i>wisdom, justice, prudence</i>, and
      <i>virtue</i>, the whole community could confide.
    </p>
    <p>
      To confirm this reasoning, we shall appeal, as before, to
      facts; and shall consult therefore the history of those
      nations, which having just left their former state of
      <i>independent society</i>, were the very people that
      established <i>subordination</i> and <i>government</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commentaries of C&aelig;sar afford us the following
      accounts of the ancient Gauls. When any of their kings,
      either by death, or deposition, made a vacancy in the regal
      office, the whole nation was immediately convened for the
      appointment of a successor. In these national conventions
      were the regal offices conferred. Every individual had a
      voice on the occasion, and every individual was free. The
      person upon whom the general approbation appeared to fall,
      was immediately advanced to pre-eminence in the state. He
      was uniformly one, whose actions had made him eminent;
      whose conduct had gained him previous applause; whose
      valour the very assembly, that elected him, had themselves
      witnessed in the field; whose prudence, wisdom and justice,
      having rendered him signally serviceable, had endeared him
      to his tribe. For this reason, their kingdoms were not
      hereditary; the son did not always inherit the virtues of
      the sire; and they were determined that he alone should
      possess authority, in whose virtues they could confide. Nor
      was this all. So sensible were they of the important
      sacrifice they had made; so extremely jealous even of the
      name of superiority and power, that they limited, by a
      variety of laws, the authority of the very person, whom
      they had just elected, from a confidence of his integrity;
      Ambiorix himself confessing, "that his people had as much
      power over him, as he could possibly have over his people."
    </p>
    <p>
      The same custom, as appears from Tacitus, prevailed also
      among the Germans. They had their national councils, like
      the Gauls; in which the regal and ducal offices were
      confirmed according to the majority of voices. They elected
      also, on these occasions, those only, whom their virtue, by
      repeated trial, had unequivocally distinguished from the
      rest; and they limited their authority so far, as neither
      to leave them the power of inflicting imprisonment or
      stripes, nor of exercising any penal jurisdiction. But as
      punishment was necessary in a state of civil society, "it
      was permitted to the priests alone, that it might appear to
      have been inflicted, by the order of the gods, and not by
      any superiour authority in man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The accounts which we have thus given of the ancient
      Germans and Gauls, will be found also to be equally true of
      those people, which had arrived at the same state of
      subordinate society. We might appeal, for a testimony of
      this, to the history of the Goths; to the history of the
      Franks and Saxons; to, the history, in short, of all those
      nations, from which the different governments, now
      conspicuous in Europe, have undeniably sprung. And we might
      appeal, as a farther proof, to the Americans, who are
      represented by many of the moderns, from their own ocular
      testimony, as observing the same customs at the present
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains only to observe, that as these customs prevailed
      among the different nations described, in their early state
      of subordinate society, and as they were moreover the
      customs of their respective ancestors, it appears that they
      must have been handed down, both by tradition and use, from
      the first introduction of <i>government</i>.

      We may now deduce those general maxims concerning
      <i>subordination</i>, and <i>liberty</i>, which we
      mentioned to have been essentially connected with the
      subject, and which some, from speculation only, and without
      any allusion to facts, have been bold enough to deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears first, that <i>liberty</i> is a <i>natural</i>,
      and <i>government</i> an <i>adventitious</i> right, because
      all men were originally free.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears secondly, that government is a <i>contract</i><a
      name="FNanchor042"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_042"><sup>[042]</sup></a> because, in these
      primeval subordinate societies, we have seen it voluntarily
      conferred on the one hand, and accepted on the other. We
      have seen it subject to various restrictions. We have seen
      its articles, which could then only be written by tradition
      and use, as perfect and binding as those, which are now
      committed to letters. We have seen it, in short, partaking
      of the <i>federal</i> nature, as much as it could in a
      state, which wanted the means of recording its
      transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appear thirdly, that the grand object of the
      <i>contrast</i>, is the <i>happiness</i> of the people;
      because they gave the supremacy to him alone, who had been
      conspicuous for the splendour of his abilities, or the
      integrity of his life: that the power of the multitude
      being directed by the <i>wisdom</i> and <i>justice</i> of
      the prince, they might experience the most effectual
      protection from injury, the highest advantages of society,
      the greatest possible <i>happiness</i>.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Having now collected the materials that are necessary for
      the prosecution of our design, we shall immediately enter
      upon the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any man had originally been endued with power, as with
      other faculties, so that the rest of mankind had discovered
      in themselves an <i>innate necessity</i> of obeying this
      particular person; it is evident that he and his
      descendants, from the superiority of their nature, would
      have had a claim upon men for obedience, and a natural
      right to command: but as the right to empire is
      <i>adventitious</i>; as all were originally free; as nature
      made every man's body and mind <i>his own</i>; it is
      evident that no just man can be consigned to
      <i>slavery</i>, without his own <i>consent</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither can men, by the same principles, be considered as
      lands, goods, or houses, among <i>possessions</i>. It is
      necessary that all <i>property</i> should be inferiour to
      its <i>possessor</i>. But how does the <i>slave</i> differ
      from his <i>master</i>, but by <i>chance</i>? For though
      the mark, with which the latter is pleased to brand him,
      shews, at the first sight, the difference of their
      <i>fortune</i>; what mark can be found in his
      <i>nature</i>, that can warrant a distinction?
    </p>
    <p>
      To this consideration we shall add the following, that if
      men can justly become the property of each other, their
      children, like the offspring of cattle, must inherit their
      <i>paternal</i> lot. Now, as the actions of the father and
      the child must be thus at the sole disposal of their common
      master, it is evident, that the <i>authority</i> of the
      one, as a <i>parent</i>, and the <i>duty</i> of the other,
      as a <i>child</i>, must be instantly annihilated; rights
      and obligations, which, as they are sounded in nature, are
      implanted in our feelings, and are established by the voice
      of God, must contain in their annihilation a solid argument
      to prove, that there cannot be any <i>property</i> whatever
      in the <i>human species</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may consider also, as a farther confirmation, that it is
      impossible, in the nature of things, that <i>liberty</i>
      can be <i>bought</i> or <i>sold</i>! It is neither
      <i>saleable</i>, nor <i>purchasable</i>. For if any one man
      can have an absolute property in the liberty of another,
      or, in other words, if he, who is called a <i>master</i>,
      can have a <i>just</i> right to command the actions of him,
      who is called a <i>slave</i>, it is evident that the latter
      cannot be accountable for those crimes, which the former
      may order him to commit. Now as every reasonable being is
      accountable for his actions, it is evident, that such a
      right cannot <i>justly</i> exist, and that human liberty,
      of course, is beyond the possibility either of <i>sale</i>
      or <i>purchase</i>. Add to this, that, whenever you sell
      the liberty of a man, you have the power only of alluding
      to the <i>body</i>: the <i>mind</i> cannot be confined or
      bound: it will be free, though its mansion be beset with
      chains. But if, in every sale of the <i>human species</i>,
      you are under the necessity of considering your slave in
      this abstracted light; of alluding only to the body, and of
      making no allusion to the mind; you are under the necessity
      also of treating him, in the same moment, as a
      <i>brute</i>, and of abusing therefore that nature, which
      cannot otherwise be considered, than in the double capacity
      of <i>soul</i> and <i>body</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some person, perhaps, will make an objection to one of
      the former arguments. "If men, from <i>superiority</i> of
      their nature, cannot be considered, like lands, goods, or
      houses, among possessions, so neither can cattle: for being
      endued with life, motion, and sensibility, they are
      evidently <i>superiour</i> to these." But this objection
      will receive its answer from those observations which have
      been already made; and will discover the true reason, why
      cattle are justly to be estimated as property. For first,
      the right to empire over brutes, is <i>natural</i>, and not
      <i>adventitious</i>, like the right to empire over men.
      There are, secondly, many and evident signs of the
      <i>inferiority</i> of their nature; and thirdly, their
      liberty can be bought and sold, because, being void of
      reason, they cannot be <i>accountable</i> for their
      actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might stop here for a considerable time, and deduce many
      valuable lessons from the remarks that have been made, but
      that such a circumstance might be considered as a
      digression. There is one, however, which, as it is so
      intimately connected with the subject, we cannot but
      deduce. We are taught to treat men in a different manner
      from brutes, because they are so manifestly superiour in
      their nature; we are taught to treat brutes in a different
      manner from stones, for the same reason; and thus, by
      giving to every created thing its due respect, to answer
      the views of Providence, which did not create a variety of
      natures without a purpose or design.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if these things are so, how evidently against reason,
      nature, and every thing human and divine, must they act,
      who not only force men into <i>slavery</i>, against their
      own <i>consent</i>; but treat them altogether as
      <i>brutes</i>, and make the <i>natural liberty</i> of man
      an article of publick commerce! and by what arguments can
      they possibly defend that commerce, which cannot be carried
      on, in any single instance, without a flagrant violation of
      the laws of nature and of God?

    </h2>
    <p>
      That we may the more accurately examine the arguments that
      are advanced on this occasion, it will be proper to divide
      the <i>commerce</i> into two parts; first, as it relates to
      those who <i>sell</i>, and secondly, as it relates to those
      who <i>purchase</i>, the <i>human species</i> into slavery.
      To the former part of which, having given every previous
      and necessary information in the history of servitude, we
      shall immediately proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us inquire first, by what particular right the
      <i>liberties</i> of the harmless people are invaded by the
      <i>prince</i>. "By the <i>right of empire</i>," it will be
      answered; "because he possesses dominion and power by their
      own approbation and consent." But subjects, though under
      the dominion, are not the <i>property</i>, of the prince.
      They cannot be considered as his <i>possessions</i>. Their
      <i>natures</i> are both the same; they are both born in the
      same manner; are subject to the same disorders; must apply
      to the same remedies for a cure; are equally partakers of
      the grave: an <i>incidental</i> distinction accompanies
      them through life, and this-is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may add to this, that though the prince possesses
      dominion and power, by the consent and approbation of his
      subjects, he possesses it only for the most <i>salutary</i>
      ends. He may tyrannize, if he can: he may alter the
      <i>form</i> of his government: he cannot, however, alter
      its <i>nature</i> and <i>end</i>. These will be immutably
      the same, though the whole system of its administration
      should be changed; and he will be still bound to
      <i>defend</i> the lives and properties of his subjects, and
      to make them <i>happy</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does he defend those therefore, whom he invades at
      discretion with the sword? Does he protect the property of
      those, whose houses and effects he consigns at discretion
      to the flames? Does he make those happy, whom he seizes, as
      they are trying to escape the general devastation, and
      compels with their wives and families to a wretched
      <i>servitude?</i> He acts surely, as if the use of empire
      consisted in violence and oppression; as if he, that was
      most exalted, ought, of necessity, to be most unjust. Here
      then the voice of <i>nature</i> and <i>justice</i> is
      against him. He breaks that law of <i>nature</i>, which
      ordains, "that no just man shall be given into slavery,
      against his own <i>consent</i>:" he violates the first law
      of <i>justice</i>, as established among men, "that no
      person shall do harm to another without a previous and
      sufficient <i>provocation</i>;" and he violates also the
      sacred condition of <i>empire</i>, made with his ancestors,
      and necessarily understood in every species of government,
      "that, the power of the multitude being given up to the
      wisdom and justice of the prince, they may experience, in
      return, the most effectual protection from injury, the
      highest advantages of society, the greatest possible
      <i>happiness</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      But if kings then, to whom their own people have granted
      dominion and power, are unable to invade the liberties of
      their harmless subjects, without the highest
      <i>injustice</i>; how can those private persons be
      justified, who treacherously lie in wait for their
      fellow-creatures, and sell them into slavery? What
      arguments can they possibly bring in their defence? What
      treaty of empire can they produce, by which their innocent
      victims ever resigned to them the least portion of their
      <i>liberty</i>? In vain will they plead the
      <i>antiquity</i> of the custom: in vain will the
      <i>honourable</i> light, in which <i>piracy</i> was
      considered in the ages of barbarism, afford them an excuse.
      Impious and abandoned men! ye invade the liberties of
      those, who, (with respect to your impious selves) are in a
      state of <i>nature</i>, in a state of original
      <i>dissociation</i>, perfectly <i>independent</i>,
      perfectly <i>free</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears then, that the two orders of slaves, which have
      been mentioned in the history of the African servitude, "of
      those who are publickly seized by virtue of the authority
      of their prince; and of those, who are privately kidnapped
      by individuals," are collected by means of violence and
      oppression; by means, repugnant to <i>nature</i>, the
      principles of <i>government</i>, and the common notions of
      <i>equity</i>, as established among men.

    <h2>
      <a href="#PART_II.">CHAP. VI.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      We come now to the third order of <i>involuntary</i>
      slaves, "to convicts." The only argument that the sellers
      advance here, is this, "that they have been found guilty of
      offences, and that the punishment is just." But before the
      equity of the sentence can be allowed two questions must be
      decided, whether the punishment is <i>proportioned</i> to
      the offence, and what is its particular <i>object</i> and
      <i>end</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      To decide the first, we may previously observe, that the
      African servitude comprehends <i>banishment</i>, a
      <i>deprivation</i> of <i>liberty</i>, and many
      <i>corporal</i> sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      On <i>banishment</i>, the following observations will
      suffice. Mankind have their <i>local</i> attachments. They
      have a particular regard for the spot, in which they were
      born and nurtured. Here it was, that they first drew their
      infant-breath: here, that they were cherished and
      supported: here, that they passed those scenes of
      childhood, which, free from care and anxiety, are the
      happiest in the life of man; scenes, which accompany them
      through life; which throw themselves frequently into their
      thoughts, and produce the most agreeable sensations. These
      then are weighty considerations; and how great this regard
      is, may be evidenced from our own feelings; from the
      testimony of some, who, when remote from their country,
      and, in the hour of danger and distress, have found their
      thoughts unusually directed, by some impulse or other, to
      their native spot; and from the example of others, who,
      having braved the storms and adversities of life, either
      repair to it for the remainder of their days, or desire
      even to be conveyed to it, when existence is no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But separately from these their <i>local</i>, they have
      also their <i>personal</i> attachments; their regard for
      particular men. There are ties of blood; there are ties of
      friendship. In the former case, they must of necessity be
      attached: the constitution of their nature demands it. In
      the latter, it is impossible to be otherwise, since
      friendship is founded on an harmony of temper, on a
      concordance of sentiments and manners, on habits of
      confidence, and a mutual exchange of favours.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may now mention, as perfectly distinct both from their
      <i>local</i> and <i>personal</i>, the <i>national</i>
      attachments of mankind, their regard for the whole body of
      the people, among whom they were born and educated. This
      regard is particularly conspicuous in the conduct of such,
      as, being thus <i>nationally</i> connected, reside in
      foreign parts. How anxiously do they meet together! how
      much do they enjoy the fight of others of their countrymen,
      whom fortune places in their way! what an eagerness do they
      show to serve them, though not born on the same particular
      spot, though not connected by consanguinity or friendship,
      though unknown to them before! Neither is this affection
      wonderful, since they are creatures of the same education;
      of the same principles; of the same manners and habits;
      cast, as it were, in the same mould; and marked with the
      same impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      If men therefore are thus separately attached to the
      several objects described, it is evident that a separate
      exclusion from either must afford them considerable pain.
      What then must be their sufferings, to be forced for ever
      from their country, which includes them all? Which contains
      the <i>spot</i>, in which they were born and nurtured;
      which contains their <i>relations</i> and <i>friends</i>;
      which contains the whole body of the <i>people</i>, among
      whom they were bred and educated. In these sufferings,
      which arise to men, both in bidding, and in having bid,
      adieu to all that they esteem as dear and valuable,
      <i>banishment</i> consists in part; and we may agree
      therefore with the ancients, without adding other
      melancholy circumstances to the account, that it is no
      inconsiderable punishment of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the <i>loss</i> of <i>liberty</i>, which is
      the second consideration in the punishment, it is evident
      that men bear nothing worse; that there is nothing, that
      they lay more at heart; and that they have shewn, by many
      and memorable instances, that even death is to be
      preferred. How many could be named here, who, having
      suffered the <i>loss</i> of <i>liberty</i>, have put a
      period to their existence! How many, that have willingly
      undergone the hazard of their lives to destroy a tyrant!
      How many, that have even gloried to perish in the attempt!
      How many bloody and publick wars have been undertaken (not
      to mention the numerous <i>servile</i> insurrections, with
      which history is stained) for the cause of <i>freedom</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      But if nothing is dearer than <i>liberty</i> to men, with
      which, the barren rock is able to afford its joys, and
      without which, the glorious fun shines upon them but in
      vain, and all the sweets and delicacies of life are
      tasteless and unenjoyed; what punishment can be more severe
      than the loss of so great a blessing? But if to this
      <i>deprivation</i> of <i>liberty</i>, we add the agonizing
      pangs of <i>banishment</i>; and if to the complicated
      stings of both, we add the incessant <i>stripes,
      wounds</i>, and <i>miseries</i>, which are undergone by
      those, who are sold into this horrid <i>servitude</i>; what
      crime can we possibly imagine to be so enormous, as to be
      worthy of so great a punishment?
    </p>
    <p>
      How contrary then to reason, justice, and nature, must
      those act, who apply this, the severest of human
      punishments, to the most insignificant offence! yet such is
      the custom with the Africans: for, from the time, in which
      the Europeans first intoxicated the African princes with
      their foreign draughts, no crime has been committed, no
      shadow of a crime devised, that has not immediately been
      punished with <i>servitude</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for what purpose is the punishment applied? Is it
      applied to amend the manners of the criminal, and thus
      render him a better subject? No, for if you banish him, he
      can no longer be a subject, and you can no longer therefore
      be solicitous for his morals. Add to this, that if you
      banish him to a place, where he is to experience the
      hardships of want and hunger (so powerfully does hunger
      compel men to the perpetration of crimes) you force him
      rather to corrupt, than amend his manners, and to be
      wicked, when he might otherwise be just.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it applied then, that others may be deterred from the
      same proceedings, and that crimes may become less frequent?
      No, but that <i>avarice</i> may be gratified; that the
      prince may experience the emoluments of the sale: for,
      horrid and melancholy thought! the more crimes his subjects
      commit, the richer is he made; the more <i>abandoned</i>
      the subject, the <i>happier</i> is the prince!
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither can we allow that the punishment thus applied,
      tends in any degree to answer <i>publick happiness</i>; for
      if men can be sentenced to slavery, right or wrong; if
      shadows can be turned into substances, and virtues into
      crimes; it is evident that none can be happy, because none
      can be secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the punishment is infinitely greater than the
      offence, (which has been shewn before) and if it is
      inflicted, neither to amend the criminal, nor to deter
      others from the same proceedings, nor to advance, in any
      degree, the happiness of the publick, it is scarce
      necessary to observe, that it is totally unjust, since it
      is repugnant to <i>reason</i>, the dictates of
      <i>nature</i>, and the very principles of
      <i>government</i>.

    </h2>
    <p>
      We come now to the fourth and last order of slaves, to
      <i>prisoners of war</i>. As the <i>sellers</i> lay a
      particular stress on this order of men, and infer much,
      from its <i>antiquity</i>, in support of the justice of
      their cause, we shall examine the principle, on which it
      subsisted among the ancients. But as this principle was the
      same among all nations, and as a citation from many of
      their histories would not be less tedious than unnecessary,
      we shall select the example of the Romans for the
      consideration of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law, by which prisoners of war were said to be
      sentenced to servitude, was the <i>law of nations.</i><a
      name="FNanchor043"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_043"><sup>[043]</sup></a> It was so called from
      the universal concurrence of nations in the custom. It had
      two points in view, the <i>persons</i> of the
      <i>captured</i>, and their <i>effects</i>; both of which it
      immediately sentenced, without any of the usual forms of
      law, to be the property of the <i>captors</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principle, on which the law was established, was the
      <i>right of capture</i>. When any of the contending parties
      had overcome their opponents, and were about to destroy
      them, the right was considered to commence; a right, which
      the victors conceived themselves to have, to recall their
      swords, and, from the consideration of having saved the
      lives of the vanquished, when they could have taken them by
      the laws of war, to commute <i>blood</i> for
      <i>service</i>. Hence the Roman lawyer, Pomponius, deduces
      the etymology of <i>slave</i> in the Roman language. "They
      were called <i>servi</i>,<a name="FNanchor044"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_044"><sup>[044]</sup></a>, says he from the
      following circumstance. It was usual with our commanders to
      take them prisoners, and sell them: now this circumstance
      implies, that they must have been previously
      <i>preserved</i>, and hence the name." Such then was the
      <i>right of capture</i>. It was a right, which the
      circumstance of <i>taking</i> the vanquished, that is, of
      <i>preserving</i> them alive, gave the conquerors to their
      persons. By this right, as always including the idea of a
      previous preservation from death, the vanquished were said
      <i>to be slaves</i>;<a name="FNanchor045"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_045"><sup>[045]</sup></a> and, "as all slaves,"
      says Justinian, "are themselves in the power of others, and
      of course can have nothing of their own, so their effects
      followed the condition of their persons, and became the
      property of the captors."
    </p>
    <p>
      To examine this right, by which the vanquished were said to
      be slaves, we shall use the words of a celebrated Roman
      author, and apply them to the present case.<a name=
      "FNanchor046"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_046"><sup>[046]</sup></a> "If it is lawful,"
      says he, "to deprive a man of his life, it is certainly not
      inconsistent with nature to rob him;" to rob him of his
      liberty. We admit the conclusion to be just, if the
      supposition be the same: we allow, if men have a right to
      commit that, which is considered as a greater crime, that
      they have a right, at the same instant, to commit that,
      which is considered as a less. But what shall we say to the
      <i>hypothesis</i>? We deny it to be true. The voice of
      nature is against it. It is not lawful to kill, but on
      <i>necessity</i>. Had there been a necessity, where had the
      wretched captive survived to be broken with chains and
      servitude? The very act of saving his life is an argument
      to prove, that no such necessity existed. The
      <i>conclusion</i> is therefore false. The captors had no
      right to the <i>lives</i> of the captured, and of course
      none to their <i>liberty</i>: they had no right to their
      <i>blood</i>, and of course none to their <i>service</i>.
      Their right therefore had no foundation in justice. It was
      founded on a principle, contrary to the law of nature, and
      of course contrary to that law, which people, under
      different governments, are bound to observe to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarce necessary to observe, as a farther testimony
      of the injustice of the measure, that the Europeans, after
      the introduction of Christianity, exploded this principle
      of the ancients, as frivolous and false; that they spared
      the lives of the vanquished, not from the sordid motives of
      <i>avarice</i>, but from a conscientiousness, that homicide
      could only be justified by <i>necessity</i>; that they
      introduced an <i>exchange</i> of prisoners, and, by many
      and wise regulations, deprived war of many of its former
      horrours.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the advocates for slavery, unable to defend themselves
      against these arguments, have fled to other resources, and,
      ignorant of history, have denied that the <i>right of
      capture</i> was the true principle, on which slavery
      subsisted among the ancients. They reason thus. "The
      learned Grotius, and others, have considered slavery as the
      just consequence of a private war, (supposing the war to be
      just and the opponents in a state of nature), upon the
      principles of <i>reparation</i> and <i>punishment</i>. Now
      as the law of nature, which is the rule of conduct to
      individuals in such a situation, is applicable to members
      of a different community, there is reason to presume, that
      these principles were applied by the ancients to their
      prisoners of war; that their <i>effects</i> were
      confiscated by the right of <i>reparation</i>, and their
      <i>persons</i> by the right of <i>punishment</i>."-
    </p>
    <p>
      But, such a presumption is false. The <i>right of
      capture</i> was the only argument, that the ancients
      adduced in their defence. Hence Polybius; "What must they,
      (the Mantinenses) suffer, to receive the punishment they
      deserve? Perhaps it will be said, <i>that they must be
      sold, when they are taken, with their wives and children
      into slavery</i>: But this is not to be considered as a
      punishment, since even those suffer it, by the laws of war,
      who have done nothing that is base." The truth is, that
      both the <i>offending</i> and the <i>offended</i> parties,
      whenever they were victorious, inflicted slavery alike. But
      if the <i>offending</i> party inflicted slavery on the
      persons of the vanquished, by what right did they inflict
      it? It must be answered from the presumption
      before-mentioned, "by the right of <i>reparation</i>, or of
      <i>punishment:</i>" an answer plainly absurd and
      contradictory, as it supposes the <i>aggressor</i> to have
      a <i>right</i>, which the <i>injured</i> only could
      possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither is the argument less fallacious than the
      presumption, in applying these principles, which in a
      <i>publick</i> war could belong to the <i>publick</i> only,
      to the persons of the <i>individuals</i> that were taken.
      This calls us again to the history of the ancients, and, as
      the rights of reparation and punishment could extend to
      those only, who had been injured, to select a particular
      instance for the consideration of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Romans had been injured without a previous
      provocation by the conduct of Hannibal at Saguntum, we may
      take the treaty into consideration, which they made with
      the Carthaginians, when the latter, defeated at Zama, sued
      for peace. It consisted of three articles.<a name=
      "FNanchor047"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_047"><sup>[047]</sup></a> By the first, the
      Carthaginians were to be free, and to enjoy their own
      constitution and laws. By the second, they were to pay a
      considerable sum of money, as a reparation for the damages
      and expence of war: and, by the third, they were to deliver
      up their elephants and ships of war, and to be subject to
      various restrictions, as a punishment. With these terms
      they complied, and the war was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then did the Romans make that distinction between
      <i>private</i> and <i>publick</i> war, which was necessary
      to be made, and which the argument is fallacious in not
      supposing. The treasury of the vanquished was marked as the
      means of <i>reparation</i>; and as this treasury was
      supplied, in a great measure, by the imposition of taxes,
      and was, wholly, the property of the <i>publick</i>, so the
      <i>publick</i> made the reparation that was due. The
      <i>elephants</i> also, and <i>ships of war</i>, which were
      marked as the means of <i>punishment</i>, were
      <i>publick</i> property; and as they were considerable
      instruments of security and defence to their possessors,
      and of annoyance to an enemy, so their loss, added to the
      restrictions of the treaty, operated as a great and
      <i>publick</i> punishment. But with respect to the
      Carthaginian prisoners, who had been taken in the war, they
      were retained in <i>servitude:</i> not upon the principles
      of <i>reparation</i> and <i>punishment</i>, because the
      Romans had already received, by their own confession in the
      treaty, a sufficient satisfaction: not upon these
      principles, because they were inapplicable to
      <i>individuals:</i> the legionary soldier in the service of
      the injured, who took his prisoner, was not the person, to
      whom the <i>injury had been done</i>, any more than the
      soldier in the service of the aggressors, who was taken,
      was the person, who had <i>committed the offence:</i> but
      they were retained in servitude by the <i>right of
      capture</i>; because, when both parties had sent their
      military into the field to determine the dispute, it was at
      the <i>private</i> choice of the legionary soldier
      before-mentioned, whether he would spare the life of his
      conquered opponent, when he was thought to be entitled to
      take it, if he had chosen, by the laws of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      To produce more instances, as an illustration of the
      subject, or to go farther into the argument, would be to
      trespass upon the patience, as well as understanding of the
      reader. In <i>a state of nature</i>, where a man is
      supposed to commit an injury, and to be unconnected with
      the rest of the world, the act is <i>private</i>, and the
      right, which the injured acquires, can extend only to
      <i>himself:</i> but in <i>a state of society</i>, where any
      member or members of a particular community give offence to
      those of another, and they are patronized by the state, to
      which they belong, the case is altered; the act becomes
      immediately <i>publick</i>, and the <i>publick</i> alone
      are to experience the consequences of their injustice. For
      as no particular member of the community, if considered as
      an individual, is guilty, except the person, by whom the
      injury was done, it would be contrary to reason and
      justice, to apply the principles of <i>reparation</i> and
      <i>punishment</i>, which belong to the people as a
      collective body, to any individual of the community, who
      should happen to be taken. Now, as the principles of
      <i>reparation</i> and <i>punishment</i> are thus
      inapplicable to the prisoners, taken in a <i>publick</i>
      war, and as the <i>right of capture</i>, as we have shewn
      before, is insufficient to intitle the victors to the
      <i>service</i> of the vanquished, it is evident that
      <i>slavery</i> cannot justly exist at all, since there are
      no other maxims, on which it can be founded, even in the
      most equitable wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if these things are so; if slavery cannot be defended
      even in the most <i>equitable</i> wars, what arguments will
      not be found against that servitude, which arises from
      those, that are <i>unjust?</i> Which arises from those
      African wars, that relate to the present subject? The
      African princes, corrupted by the merchants of Europe, seek
      every opportunity of quarrelling with one another. Every
      spark is blown into a flame; and war is undertaken from no
      other consideration, than that <i>of procuring slaves:</i>
      while the Europeans, on the other hand, happy in the
      quarrels which they have thus excited, supply them with
      arms and ammunition for the accomplishment of their horrid
      purpose. Thus has Africa, for the space of two hundred
      years, been the scene of the most iniquitous and bloody
      wars; and thus have many thousands of men, in the most
      iniquitous manner, been sent into servitude.

    </h2>
    <p>
      We shall beg leave, before we proceed to the arguments of
      the <i>purchasers</i>, to add the following observations to
      the substance of the three preceding chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two orders of men, of those who are privately
      kidnapped by individuals, and of those who are publickly
      seized by virtue of the authority of their prince, compose
      together, at least,<a name="FNanchor048"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_048"><sup>[048]</sup></a> nine tenths of the
      African slaves, they cannot contain, upon a moderate
      computation, less than ninety thousand men annually
      transported: an immense number, but easily to be credited,
      when we reflect that thousands are employed for the purpose
      of stealing the unwary, and that these diabolical practices
      are in force, so far has European <i>injustice</i> been
      spread, at the distance of a thousand miles from the
      factories on the coast. The <i>slave merchants</i>, among
      whom a quantity of European goods is previously divided,
      travel into the heart of the country to this amazing
      distance. Some of them attend the various markets, that are
      established through so large an extent of territory, to
      purchase the kidnapped people, whom the
      <i>slave-hunters</i> are continually bringing in; while the
      rest, subdividing their merchandize among the petty
      sovereigns with whom they deal, receive, by an immediate
      exertion of fraud and violence, the stipulated number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, will any man assert, in opposition to the arguments
      before advanced, that out of this immense body of men, thus
      annually collected and transported, there is even
      <i>one</i>, over whom the original or subsequent seller can
      have any power or right? Whoever asserts this, in the first
      instance, must, contradict his own feelings, and must
      consider <i>himself</i> as a just object of prey, whenever
      any daring invader shall think it proper to attack
      <i>him</i>. And, in the second instance, the very idea
      which the African princes entertain of their villages, as
      <i>parks</i> or <i>reservoirs</i>, stocked only for their
      own convenience, and of their subjects, as <i>wild
      beasts</i>, whom they may pursue and take at pleasure, is
      so shocking, that it need only be mentioned, to be
      instantly reprobated by the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order of slaves, which is next to the former in respect
      to the number of people whom it contains, is that of
      prisoners of war. This order, if the former statement be
      true, is more inconsiderable than is generally imagined;
      but whoever reflects on the prodigious slaughter that is
      constantly made in every African skirmish, cannot be
      otherwise than of this opinion: he will find, that where
      <i>ten</i> are taken, he has every reason to presume that
      an <i>hundred</i> perish. In some of these skirmishes,
      though they have been begun for the express purpose of
      <i>procuring slaves</i>, the conquerors have suffered but
      few of the vanquished to escape the fury of the sword; and
      there have not been wanting instances, where they have been
      so incensed at the resistance they have found, that their
      spirit of vengeance has entirely got the better of their
      avarice, and they have murdered, in cool blood, every
      individual, without discrimination, either of age or sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following<a name="FNanchor049"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_049"><sup>[049]</sup></a> is an account of one
      of these skirmishes, as described by a person, who was
      witness to the scene. "I was sent, with several others, in
      a small sloop up the river Niger, to purchase slaves: we
      had some free negroes with us in the practice; and as the
      vessels are liable to frequent attacks from the negroes on
      one side of the river, or the Moors on the other, they are
      all armed. As we rode at anchor a long way up the river, we
      observed a large number of negroes in huts by the river's
      side, and for our own safety kept a wary eye on them. Early
      next morning we saw from our masthead a numerous body
      approaching, with apparently but little order, but in close
      array. They approached very fast, and fell furiously on the
      inhabitants of the town, who seemed to be quite
      <i>surprized</i>, but nevertheless, as soon as they could
      get together, fought stoutly. They had some fire-arms, but
      made very little use of them, as they came directly to
      close fighting with their spears, lances, and sabres. Many
      of the invaders were mounted on small horses; and both
      parties fought for about half an hour with the fiercest
      animosity, exerting much more courage and perseverance than
      I had ever before been witness to amongst them. The women
      and children of the town clustered together to the water's
      edge, running shrieking up and down with terrour, waiting
      the event of the combat, till their party gave way and took
      to the water, to endeavour to swim over to the Barbary
      side. They were closely pursued even into the river by the
      victors, who, though they came for the purpose of
      <i>getting slaves</i>, gave no quarter, <i>their cruelty
      even prevailing over their avarice</i>. They made no
      prisoners, but put all to the sword without mercy. Horrible
      indeed was the carnage of the vanquished on this occasion,
      and as we were within two or three hundred yards of them,
      their cries and shrieks affected us extremely. We had got
      up our anchor at the beginning of the fray, and now stood
      close in to the spot, where the victors having followed the
      vanquished into the water, were continually dragging out
      and murdering those, whom by reason of their wounds they
      easily overtook. The very children, whom they took in great
      numbers, did not escape the massacre. Enraged at their
      barbarity, we fired our guns loaden with grape shot, and a
      volley of small arms among them, which effectually checked
      their ardour, and obliged them to retire to a distance from
      the shore; from whence a few round cannon shot soon removed
      them into the woods. The whole river was black over with
      the heads of the fugitives, who were swimming for their
      lives. These poor wretches, fearing <i>us</i> as much as
      their conquerors, dived when we fired, and cried most
      lamentably for mercy. Having now effectually favoured their
      retreat, we stood backwards and forwards, and took up
      several that were wounded and tired. All whose wounds had
      disabled them from swimming, were either butchered or
      drowned, before we got up to them. With a justice and
      generosity, <i>never I believe before heard of among
      slavers</i>, we gave those their liberty whom we had taken
      up, setting them on shore on the Barbary side, among the
      poor residue of their companions, who had survived the
      slaughter of the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall make but two remarks on this horrid instance of
      African cruelty. It adds, first, a considerable weight to
      the statements that have been made; and confirms, secondly,
      the conclusions that were drawn in the preceding chapter.
      For if we even allow the right of capture to be just, and
      the principles of reparation and punishment to be
      applicable to the individuals of a community, yet would the
      former be unjust, and the latter inapplicable, in the
      present case. Every African war is a robbery; and we may
      add, to our former expression, when we said, "that thus
      have many thousands of men, in the most iniquitous manner,
      been sent into servitude," that we believe there are few of
      this order, who are not as much the examples of injustice,
      as the people that have been kidnapped; and who do not
      additionally convey, when we consider them as prisoners of
      war, an idea of the most complicated scene of murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order of <i>convicts</i>, as it exists almost solely
      among those princes, whose dominions are contiguous to the
      European factories, is from this circumstance so
      inconsiderable, when compared with either of the preceding,
      that we should not have mentioned it again, but that we
      were unwilling to omit any additional argument that
      occurred against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been shewn already, that the punishment of slavery
      is inflicted from no other motive, than that of gratifying
      the <i>avarice</i> of the prince, a confederation so
      detestable, as to be sufficient of itself to prove it to be
      unjust; and that it is so disproportionate, from its
      <i>nature</i>, to the offence, as to afford an additional
      proof of its injustice. We shall add now, as a second
      argument, its disproportion from its <i>continuance:</i>
      and we shall derive a third from the consideration, that,
      in civil society, every violation of the laws of the
      community is an offence against the <i>state</i>.<a name=
      "FNanchor050"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_050"><sup>[050]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us suppose then an African prince, disdaining for once
      the idea of emolument: let us suppose him for once inflamed
      with the love of his country, and resolving to punish from
      this principle alone, "that by exhibiting an example of
      terrour, he may preserve that <i>happiness of the
      publick</i>, which he is bound to secure and defend by the
      very nature of his contract; or, in other words, that he
      may answer the end of government." If actuated then by this
      principle, he should adjudge slavery to an offender, as a
      just punishment for his offence, for whose benefit must the
      convict labour? If it be answered, "for the benefit of the
      state," we allow that the punishment, in whatever light it
      is considered, will be found to be equitable: but if it be
      answered, "for the benefit of any <i>individual whom he
      pleases to appoint</i>," we deny it to be just. The state<a
      name="FNanchor051"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_051"><sup>[051]</sup></a> alone is considered to
      have been injured, and as <i>injuries cannot possibly be
      transferred</i>, the state alone can justly receive the
      advantages of his labour. But if the African prince, when
      he thus condemns him to labour for the benefit of an
      <i>unoffended individual</i>, should at the same time
      sentence him to become his <i>property</i>; that is, if he
      should make the person and life of the convict at the
      absolute disposal of him, for whom he has sentenced him to
      labour; it is evident that, in addition to his former
      injustice, he is usurping a power, which no ruler or rulers
      of a state can possess, and which the great Creator of the
      universe never yet gave to any order whatever of created
      beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this reasoning is true, and that civilized nations
      have considered it as such, will be best testified by their
      practice. We may appeal here to that <i>slavery</i>, which
      is now adjudged to delinquents, as a punishment, among many
      of the states of Europe. These delinquents are sentenced to
      labour at the <i>oar</i>, to work in <i>mines</i>, and on
      <i>fortifications</i>, to cut and clear <i>rivers</i>, to
      make and repair <i>roads</i>, and to perform other works of
      national utility. They are employed, in short, in the
      <i>publick</i> work; because, as the crimes they have
      committed are considered to have been crimes against the
      publick, no individual can justly receive the emoluments of
      their labour; and they are neither <i>sold</i>, nor made
      capable of being <i>transferred</i>, because no government
      whatsoever is invested with such a power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then may that slavery, in which only the idea of
      <i>labour</i> is included, be perfectly equitable, and the
      delinquent will always receive his punishment as a man;
      whereas in that, which additionally includes the idea of
      <i>property</i>, and to undergo which, the delinquent must
      previously change his nature, and become a <i>brute</i>;
      there is an inconsistency, which no arguments can
      reconcile, and a contradiction to every principle of
      nature, which a man need only to appeal to his own feelings
      immediately to evince. And we will venture to assert, from
      the united observations that have been made upon the
      subject, in opposition to any arguments that may be
      advanced, that there is scarcely one of those, who are
      called African convicts, on whom the prince has a right to
      inflict a punishment at all; and that there is no one
      whatever, whom he has a power of sentencing to labour for
      the benefit of an unoffended individual, and much less whom
      he has a right to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now fully examined the arguments of the
      <i>sellers</i>,<a name="FNanchor052"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_052"><sup>[052]</sup></a> and having made such
      additional remarks as were necessary, we have only to add,
      that we cannot sufficiently express our detestation at
      their conduct. Were the reader coolly to reflect upon the
      case of but <i>one</i> of the unfortunate men, who are
      annually the victims of <i>avarice</i>, and consider his
      situation in life, as a father, an husband, or a friend, we
      are sure, that even on such a partial reflection, he must
      experience considerable pain. What then must be his
      feelings, when he is told, that, since the slave-trade
      began, <i>nine millions</i> <a name="FNanchor053"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_053"><sup>[053]</sup></a> of men have been
      torn from their dearest connections, and sold into slavery.
      If at this recital his indignation should arise, let him
      consider it as the genuine production of nature; that she
      recoiled at the horrid thought, and that she applied
      instantly a torch to his breast to kindle his resentment;
      and if, during his indignation, she should awaken the sigh
      of sympathy, or seduce the tear of commiseration from his
      eye, let him consider each as an additional argument
      against the iniquity of the <i>sellers</i>.

    </h2>
    <p>
      It remains only now to examine by what arguments those, who
      <i>receive</i> or <i>purchase</i> their fellow-creatures
      into slavery, defend the <i>commerce</i>. Their first plea
      is, "that they receive those with propriety, who are
      convicted of crimes, because they are delivered into their
      hands by <i>their own magistrates</i>." But what is this to
      you <i>receivers</i>? Have the unfortunate <i>convicts</i>
      been guilty of injury to <i>you</i>? Have they broken
      <i>your</i> treaties? Have they plundered <i>your</i>
      ships? Have they carried <i>your</i> wives and children
      into slavery, that <i>you</i> should thus retaliate? Have
      they offended <i>you</i> even by word or gesture?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the African convicts are innocent with respect to
      you; if you have not even the shadow of a claim upon their
      persons; by what right do you receive them? "By the laws of
      the Africans," you will say; "by which it is positively
      allowed."-But can <i>laws</i> alter the nature of vice?
      They may give it a sanction perhaps: it will still be
      immutably the same, and, though dressed in the outward
      habiliments of <i>honour</i>, will still be
      <i>intrinsically base</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas! you do not only attempt to defend yourselves by
      these arguments, but even dare to give your actions the
      appearance of lenity, and assume <i>merit</i> from your
      <i>baseness</i>! and how first ought you particularly to
      blush, when you assert, "that prisoners of war are only
      purchased from the hands of their conquerors, <i>to deliver
      them from death</i>." Ridiculous defence! can the most
      credulous believe it? You entice the Africans to war; you
      foment their quarrels; you supply them with arms and
      ammunition, and all-from the <i>motives of benevolence</i>.
      Does a man set fire to an house, for the purpose of
      rescuing the inhabitants from the flames? But if they are
      only purchased, to <i>deliver them from death</i>; why,
      when they are delivered into your hands, as protectors, do
      you torture them with hunger? Why do you kill them with
      fatigue? Why does the whip deform their bodies, or the
      knife their limbs? Why do you sentence them to death? to a
      death, infinitely more excruciating than that from which
      you so kindly saved them? What answer do you make to this?
      for if you had not humanely preserved them from the hands
      of their conquerors, a quick death perhaps, and that in the
      space of a moment, had freed them from their pain: but on
      account of your <i>favour</i> and <i>benevolence</i>, it is
      known, that they have lingered years in pain and agony, and
      have been sentenced, at last, to a dreadful death for the
      most insignificant offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither can we allow the other argument to be true, on
      which you found your merit; "that you take them from their
      country for their own convenience; because Africa, scorched
      with incessant heat, and subject to the most violent rains
      and tempests, is unwholesome, and unfit to be inhabited."
      Preposterous men! do you thus judge from your own feelings?
      Do you thus judge from your own constitution and frame? But
      if you suppose that the Africans are incapable of enduring
      their own climate, because you cannot endure it yourselves;
      why do you receive them into slavery? Why do you not
      measure them here by the same standard? For if you are
      unable to bear hunger and thirst, chains and imprisonment,
      wounds and torture, why do you not suppose them incapable
      of enduring the same treatment? Thus then is your argument
      turned against yourselves. But consider the answer which
      the Scythians gave the &AElig;gyptians, when they contended
      about the antiquity of their original,<a name=
      "FNanchor054"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_054"><sup>[054]</sup></a> "That nature, when
      she first distinguished countries by different degrees of
      heat and cold, tempered the bodies of animals, at the same
      instant, to endure the different situations: that as the
      climate of Scythia was severer than that of &AElig;gypt, so
      were the bodies of the Scythians harder, and as capable of
      enduring the severity of their atmosphere, as the
      &AElig;gyptians the temperateness of their own."
    </p>
    <p>
      But you may say perhaps, that, though they are capable of
      enduring their own climate, yet their situation is
      frequently uncomfortable, and even wretched: that Africa is
      infested with locusts, and insects of various kinds; that
      they settle in swarms upon the trees, destroy the verdure,
      consume the fruit, and deprive the inhabitants of their
      food. But the same answer may be applied as before; "that
      the same kind Providence, who tempered the body of the
      animal, tempered also the body of the tree; that he gave it
      a quality to recover the bite of the locust, which he sent;
      and to reassume, in a short interval of time, its former
      glory." And that such is the case experience has shewn: for
      the very trees that have been infested, and stripped of
      their bloom and verdure, so surprizingly quick is
      vegetation, appear in a few days, as if an insect had been
      utterly unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may add to these observations, from the testimony of
      those who have written the History of Africa from their own
      inspection, that no country is more luxurious in prospects,
      none more fruitful, none more rich in herds and flocks, and
      none, where the comforts of life, can be gained with so
      little trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you say again, as a confirmation of these your former
      arguments, (by which you would have it understood, that the
      Africans themselves are sensible of the goodness of your
      intentions) "that they do not appear to go with you against
      their will." Impudent and base assertion! Why then do you
      load them with chains? Why keep you your daily and nightly
      watches? But alas, as a farther, though a more melancholy
      proof, of the falsehood of your assertions, how many, when
      on board your ships, have put a period to their existence?
      How many have leaped into the sea? How many have pined to
      death, that, even at the expence of their lives, they might
      fly from your <i>benevolence</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you call them obstinate then, because they refuse your
      favours? Do you call them ungrateful, because they make you
      this return? How much rather ought you receivers to blush!
      How much rather ought you receivers to be considered as
      abandoned and execrable; who, when you usurp the dominion
      over those, who are as free and independent as yourselves,
      break the first law of justice, which ordains, "that no
      person shall do harm to another, without a previous
      provocation;" who offend against the dictates of nature,
      which commands, "that no just man shall be given or
      received into slavery against his own consent;" and who
      violate the very laws of the empire that you assume, by
      consigning your subjects to misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as a famous Heathen philosopher observes, from whose
      mouth you shall be convicted,<a name="FNanchor055"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_055"><sup>[055]</sup></a> "there is a
      considerable difference, whether an injury is done, during
      any perturbation of mind, which is generally short and
      momentary; or whether it is done with any previous
      meditation and design; for, those crimes, which proceed
      from any sudden commotion of the mind, are less than those,
      which are studied and prepared," how great and enormous are
      your crimes to be considered, who plan your African voyages
      at a time, when your reason is found, and your senses are
      awake; who coolly and deliberately equip your vessels; and
      who spend years, and even lives, in the traffick of
      <i>human liberty</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the arguments of those, who <i>sell</i> or
      <i>deliver</i> men into slavery, (as we have shewn before)
      and of those, who <i>receive</i> or <i>purchase</i> them,
      (as we have now shewn) are wholly false; it is evident that
      this <i>commerce</i>, is not only beyond the possibility of
      defence, but is justly to be accounted wicked, and justly
      impious, since it is contrary to the principles of
      <i>law</i> and <i>government</i>, the dictates of
      <i>reason</i>, the common maxims of <i>equity</i>, the laws
      of <i>nature</i>, the admonitions of <i>conscience</i>,
      and, in short, the whole doctrine of <i>natural
      religion</i>.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Having confined ourselves wholly, in the second part of
      this Essay, to the consideration of the <i>commerce</i>, we
      shall now proceed to the consideration of the
      <i>slavery</i> that is founded upon it. As this slavery
      will be conspicuous in the <i>treatment</i>, which the
      unfortunate Africans uniformly undergo, when they are put
      into the hands of the <i>receivers</i>, we shall describe
      the manner in which they are accustomed to be used from
      this period.
    </p>
    <p>
      To place this in the clearest, and most conspicuous point
      of view, we shall throw a considerable part of our
      information on this head into the form of a narrative: we
      shall suppose ourselves, in short, on the continent of
      Africa, and relate a scene, which, from its agreement with
      unquestionable facts, might not unreasonably be presumed to
      have been presented to our view, had we been really there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And first, let us turn our eyes to the cloud of dust that
      is before us. It seems to advance rapidly, and, accompanied
      with dismal shrieks and yellings, to make the very air,
      that is above it, tremble as it rolls along. What can
      possibly be the cause? Let us inquire of that melancholy
      African, who seems to walk dejected near the shore; whose
      eyes are stedfastly fixed on the approaching object, and
      whose heart, if we can judge from the appearance of his
      countenance, must be greatly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" says the unhappy African, "the cloud that you see
      approaching, is a train of wretched slaves. They are going
      to the ships behind you. They are destined for the English
      colonies, and, if you will stay here but for a little time,
      you will see them pass. They were last night drawn up upon
      the plain which you see before you, where they were branded
      upon the breast with an <i>hot iron</i>; and when they had
      undergone the whole of the treatment which is customary on
      these occasions, and which I am informed that you
      Englishmen at home use to the <i>cattle</i> which you buy,
      they were returned to their prison. As I have some dealings
      with the members of the factory which you see at a little
      distance, (though thanks to the Great Spirit, I never dealt
      in the <i>liberty</i> of my fellow creatures) I gained
      admittance there. I learned the history of some of the
      unfortunate people, whom I saw confined, and will explain
      to you, if my eye should catch them as they pass, the real
      causes of their servitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely were these words spoken, when they came distinctly
      into sight. They appeared to advance in a long column, but
      in a very irregular manner. There were three only in the
      front, and these were chained together. The rest that
      followed seemed to be chained by pairs, but by pressing
      forward, to avoid the lash of the drivers, the breadth of
      the column began to be greatly extended, and ten or more
      were observed abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were making these remarks, the intelligent African
      thus resumed his discourse. "The first three whom you
      observe, at the head of the train, to be chained together,
      are prisoners of war. As soon as the ships that are behind
      you arrived, the news was dispatched into the inland
      country; when one of the petty kings immediately assembled
      his subjects, and attacked a neighbouring tribe. The
      wretched people, though they were surprized, made a
      formidable resistance, as they resolved, almost all of
      them, rather to lose their lives, than survive their
      liberty. The person whom you see in the middle, is the
      father of the two young men, who are chained to him on each
      side. His wife and two of his children were killed in the
      attack, and his father being wounded, and, on account of
      his age, <i>incapable of servitude</i>, was left bleeding
      on the spot where this transaction happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With respect to those who are now passing us, and are
      immediately behind the former, I can give you no other
      intelligence, than that some of them, to about the number
      of thirty, were taken in the same skirmish. Their tribe was
      said to have been numerous before the attack; these however
      are <i>all that are left alive</i>. But with respect to the
      unhappy man, who is now opposite to us, and whom you may
      distinguish, as he is now looking back and wringing his
      hands in despair, I can inform you with more precision. He
      is an unfortunate convict. He lived only about five days
      journey from the factory. He went out with his king to
      hunt, and was one of his train; but, through too great an
      anxiety to afford his royal master diversion, he roused the
      game from the covert rather sooner than was expected. The
      king, exasperated at this circumstance, immediately
      sentenced him to slavery. His wife and children, fearing
      lest the tyrant should extend the punishment to themselves,
      <i>which is not unusual</i>, fled directly to the woods,
      where they were all devoured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The people, whom you see close behind the unhappy convict,
      form a numerous body, and reach a considerable way. They
      speak a language, which no person in this part of Africa
      can understand, and their features, as you perceive, are so
      different from those of the rest, that they almost appear a
      distinct race of men. From this circumstance I recollect
      them. They are the subjects of a very distant prince, who
      agreed with the <i>slave merchants, for a quantity of
      spirituous liquors</i>, to furnish him with a stipulated
      number of slaves. He accordingly surrounded, and set fire
      to one of his own villages in the night, and seized these
      people, who were unfortunately the inhabitants, as they
      were escaping from the flames. I first saw them as the
      merchants were driving them in, about two days ago. They
      came in a large body, and were tied together at the neck
      with leather thongs, which permitted them to walk at the
      distance of about a yard from one another. Many of them
      were loaden with elephants teeth, which had been purchased
      at the same time. All of them had bags, made of skin, upon
      their shoulders; for as they were to travel, in their way
      from the great mountains, through barren sands and
      inhospitable woods for many days together, they were
      obliged to carry water and provisions with them.
      Notwithstanding this, many of them perished, some by
      hunger, but the greatest number by fatigue, as the place
      from whence they came, is at such an amazing distance from
      this, and the obstacles, from the nature of the country, so
      great, that the journey could scarcely be completed in
      seven moons."
    </p>
    <p>
      When this relation was finished, and we had been looking
      stedfastly for some time on the croud that was going by, we
      lost sight of that peculiarity of feature, which we had
      before remarked. We then discovered that the inhabitants of
      the depopulated village had all of them passed us, and that
      the part of the train, to which we were now opposite, was a
      numerous body of kidnapped people. Here we indulged our
      imagination. We thought we beheld in one of them a father,
      in another an husband, and in another a son, each of whom
      was forced from his various and tender connections, and
      without even the opportunity of bidding them adieu. While
      we were engaged in these and other melancholy reflections,
      the whole body of slaves had entirely passed us. We turned
      almost insensibly to look at them again, when we discovered
      an unhappy man at the end of the train, who could scarcely
      keep pace with the rest. His feet seemed to have suffered
      much from long and constant travelling, for he was limping
      painfully along.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This man," resumes the African. "has travelled a
      considerable way. He lived at a great distance from hence,
      and had a large family, for whom he was daily to provide.
      As he went out one night to a neighbouring spring, to
      procure water for his thirsty children, he was kidnapped by
      two <i>slave hunters</i>, who sold him in the morning to
      some country merchants for a <i>bar of iron</i>. These
      drove him with other slaves, procured almost in the same
      manner, to the nearest market, where the English merchants,
      to whom the train that has just now passed us belongs,
      purchased him and two others, by means of their travelling
      agents, for a <i>pistol</i>. His wife and children have
      been long waiting for his return. But he is gone for ever
      from their sight: and they must be now disconsolate, as
      they must be certain by his delay, that he has fallen into
      the hands of the <i>Christians</i>".
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, as I have mentioned the name of
      <i>Christians</i>, a name, by which the Europeans
      distinguish themselves from us, I could wish to be informed
      of the meaning which such an appellation may convey. They
      consider themselves as <i>men</i>, but us unfortunate
      Africans, whom they term <i>Heathens</i>, as the
      <i>beasts</i> that serve us. But ah! how different is the
      fact! What is <i>Christianity</i>, but a system of
      <i>murder</i> and <i>oppression</i>? The cries and yells of
      the unfortunate people, who are now soon to embark for the
      regions of servitude, have already pierced my heart. Have
      you not heard me sigh, while we have been talking? Do you
      not see the tears that now trickle down my cheeks? and yet
      these hardened <i>Christians</i> are unable to be moved at
      all: nay, they will scourge them amidst their groans, and
      even smile, while they are torturing them to death. Happy,
      happy Heathenism! which can detest the vices of
      Christianity, and feel for the distresses of mankind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But" we reply, "You are totally mistaken:
      <i>Christianity</i> is the most perfect and lovely of moral
      systems. It blesses even the hand of persecution itself,
      and returns good for evil. But the people against whom you
      so justly declaim; are not <i>Christians</i>. They are
      <i>infidels</i>. They are <i>monsters</i>. They are out of
      the common course of nature. Their countrymen at home are
      generous and brave. They support the sick, the lame, and
      the blind. They fly to the succour of the distressed. They
      have noble and stately buildings for the sole purpose of
      benevolence. They are in short, of all nations, the most
      remarkable for humanity and justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why then," replies the honest African, "do they suffer
      this? Why is Africa a scene of blood and desolation? Why
      are her children wrested from her, to administer to the
      luxuries and greatness of those whom they never offended?
      And why are these dismal cries in vain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" we reply again, "can the cries and groans, with
      which the air now trembles, be heard across this extensive
      continent? Can the southern winds convey them to the ear of
      Britain? If they could reach the generous Englishman at
      home, they would pierce his heart, as they have already
      pierced your own. He would sympathize with you in your
      distress. He would be enraged at the conduct of his
      countrymen, and resist their tyranny."-
    </p>
    <p>
      But here a shriek unusually loud, accompanied with a
      dreadful rattling of chains, interrupted the discourse. The
      wretched Africans were just about to embark: they had
      turned their face to their country, as if to take a last
      adieu, and, with arms uplifted to the sky, were making the
      very atmosphere resound with their prayers and
      imprecations.

      The foregoing scene, though it may be said to be imaginary,
      is strictly consistent with fact. It is a scene, to which
      the reader himself may have been witness, if he has ever
      visited the place, where it is supposed to lie; as no
      circumstance whatever has been inserted in it, for which
      the fullest and most undeniable evidence cannot be
      produced. We shall proceed now to describe, in general
      terms, the treatment which the wretched Africans undergo,
      from the time of their embarkation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the African slaves, who are collected from various
      quarters, for the purposes of sale, are delivered over to
      the <i>receivers</i>, they are conducted in the manner
      above described to the ships. Their situation on board is
      beyond all description: for here they are crouded, hundreds
      of them together, into such a small compass, as would
      scarcely be thought sufficient to accommodate twenty, if
      considered as <i>free men</i>. This confinement soon
      produces an effect, that may be easily imagined. It
      generates a pestilential air, which, co-operating with, bad
      provisions, occasions such a sickness and mortality among
      them, that not less than <i>twenty thousand</i><a name=
      "FNanchor056"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_056"><sup>[056]</sup></a> are generally taken
      off in every yearly transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus confined in a pestilential prison, and almost entirely
      excluded from the chearful face of day, it remains for the
      sickly survivors to linger out a miserable existence, till
      the voyage is finished. But are no farther evils to be
      expected in the interim particularly if we add to their
      already wretched situation the indignities that are daily
      offered them, and the regret which they must constantly
      feel, at being for ever forced from their connexions? These
      evils are but too apparent. Some of them have resolved,
      and, notwithstanding the threats of the <i>receivers</i>,
      have carried their resolves into execution, to starve
      themselves to death. Others, when they have been brought
      upon deck for air, if the least opportunity has offered,
      have leaped into the sea, and terminated their miseries at
      once. Others, in a fit of despair, have attempted to rise,
      and regain their liberty. But here what a scene of
      barbarity has constantly ensued. Some of them have been
      instantly killed upon the spot; some have been taken from
      the hold, have been bruised and mutilated in the most
      barbarous and shocking manner, and have been returned
      bleeding to their companions, as a sad example of
      resistance; while others, tied to the ropes of the ship,
      and mangled alternately with the whip and knife, have been
      left in that horrid situation, till they have expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not the only inhuman treatment which they are
      frequently obliged to undergo; for if there should be any
      necessity, from tempestuous weather, for lightening the
      ship; or if it should be presumed on the voyage, that the
      provisions will fall short before the port can be made,
      they are, many of them, thrown into the sea, without any
      compunction of mind on the part of the <i>receivers</i>,
      and without any other regret for their loss, than that
      which <i>avarice</i> inspires. Wretched survivors! what
      must be their feelings at such a sight! how must they
      tremble to think of that servitude which is approaching,
      when the very <i>dogs</i> of the <i>receivers</i> have been
      retained on board, and preferred to their unoffending
      countrymen. But indeed so lightly are these unhappy people
      esteemed, that their lives have been even taken away upon
      speculation: there has been an instance, within the last
      five years, of <i>one hundred and thirty two</i> of them
      being thrown into the sea, because it was supposed that, by
      this <i>trick</i>, their value could be recovered from the
      insurers.<a name="FNanchor057"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_057"><sup>[057]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the ship should arrive safe at its destined port, a
      circumstance which does not always happen, (for some have
      been blown up, and many lost) the wretched Africans do not
      find an alleviation of their sorrow. Here they are again
      exposed to sale. Here they are again subjected to the
      inspection of other brutal <i>receivers</i>, who examine
      and treat them with an inhumanity, at which even avarice
      should blush. To this mortifying circumstance is added
      another, that they are picked out, as the purchaser
      pleases, without any consideration whether the wife is
      separated from her husband, or the mother from her son: and
      if these cruel instances of separation should happen; if
      relations, when they find themselves about to be parted,
      should cling together; or if filial, conjugal, or parental
      affection, should detain them but a moment longer in each
      other's arms, than these <i>second receivers</i> should
      think sufficient, the lash instantly severs them from their
      embraces.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot close our account of the treatment, which the
      wretched Africans undergo while in the hands of the
      <i>first receivers</i>, without mentioning an instance of
      wanton, barbarity, which happened some time ago;
      particularly as it may be inserted with propriety in the
      present place, and may give the reader a better idea of the
      cruelties, to which they are continually exposed, than any
      that he may have yet conceived. To avoid making a mistake,
      we shall take the liberty that has been allowed us, and
      transcribe it from a little manuscript account, with which
      we have been favoured by a person of the strictest
      integrity, and who was at that time in the place where the
      transaction happened.<a name="FNanchor058"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_058"><sup>[058]</sup></a> "Not long after,"
      says he, (continuing his account) "the perpetrator of a
      cruel murder, committed in open day light, in the most
      publick part of a town, which was the seat of government,
      escaped every other notice than the curses of a few of the
      more humane witnesses of his barbarity. An officer of a
      Guinea ship, who had the care of a number of new slaves,
      and was returning from the <i>sale-yard</i> to the vessel
      with such as remained unsold; observed a stout fellow among
      them rather slow in his motions, which he therefore
      quickened with his rattan. The slave soon afterwards fell
      down, and was raised by the same application. Moving
      forwards a few yards, he fell down again; and this being
      taken as a proof of his sullen perverse spirit, the enraged
      officer furiously repeated his blows, till he expired at
      his feet. The brute coolly ordered some of the surviving
      slaves to carry the dead body to the water's side, where,
      without any ceremony or delay, being thrown into the sea,
      the tragedy was supposed to have been immediately finished
      by the not more inhuman sharks, with which the harbour then
      abounded. These voracious fish were supposed to have
      followed the vessels from the coast of Africa, in which ten
      thousand slaves were imported in that one season, being
      allured by the stench, and daily fed by the dead carcasses
      thrown overboard on the voyage."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the reader should observe here, that cattle are better
      protected in this country, than slaves in the colonies, his
      observation will be just. The beast which is driven to
      market, is defended by law from the goad of the driver;
      whereas the wretched African, though an human being, and
      whose feelings receive of course a double poignancy from
      the power of reflection, is unnoticed in this respect in
      the colonial code, and may be goaded and beaten till he
      expires.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may now take our leave of the <i>first receivers</i>.
      Their crime has been already estimated; and to reason
      farther upon it, would be unnecessary. For where the
      conduct of men is so manifestly impious, there can be no
      need, either of a single argument or a reflection; as every
      reader of sensibility will anticipate them in his own
      feelings.

    </h2>
    <p>
      When the wretched Africans are thus put into the hands of
      the <i>second receivers</i>, they are conveyed to the
      plantations, where they are totally considered as
      <i>cattle</i>, or <i>beasts of labour</i>; their very
      children, if any should be born to them in that situation,
      being previously destined to the condition of their
      parents. But here a question arises, which, will interrupt
      the thread of the narration for a little time, viz. how far
      their descendants, who compose the fifth order of slaves,
      are justly reduced to servitude, and upon what principles
      the <i>receivers</i> defend their conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authors have been at great pains to inquire, why, in the
      ancient servitude, the child has uniformly followed the
      condition of the mother. But we conceive that they would
      have saved themselves much trouble, and have done
      themselves more credit, if instead of, endeavouring to
      reconcile the custom with <i>heathen</i> notions, or their
      own laboured conjectures, they had shewn its inconsistency
      with reason and nature, and its repugnancy to common
      justice. Suffice it to say, that the whole theory of the
      ancients, with respect to the descendants slaves, may be
      reduced to this principle, "that as the parents, by
      becoming <i>property</i>, were wholly considered as
      <i>cattle</i>, their children, like <i>the progeny of
      cattle</i>, inherited their parental lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such also is the excuse of the tyrannical <i>receivers</i>
      before-mentioned. They allege, that they have purchased the
      parents, that they can sell and dispose of them as they
      please, that they possess them under the same laws and
      limitations as their cattle, and that their children, like
      the progeny of these, become their property <i>by
      birth</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the absurdity of the argument will immediately appear.
      It depends wholly on the supposition, that the parents are
      <i>brutes</i>. If they are <i>brutes</i>, we shall
      instantly cease to contend: if they are <i>men</i>, which
      we think it not difficult to prove, the argument must
      immediately fall, as we have already shewn that there
      cannot justly be any <i>property</i> whatever in the
      <i>human species</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has appeared also, in the second part of this Essay,
      that as nature made, every man's body and mind <i>his
      own</i>, so no <i>just</i> person can be reduced to slavery
      against his own <i>consent</i>. Do the unfortunate
      offspring ever <i>consent</i> to be slaves?-They are slaves
      from their birth.-Are they <i>guilty</i> of crimes, that
      they lose their freedom?-They are slaves when they cannot
      speak.-Are their <i>parents</i> abandoned? The crimes of
      the parents cannot justly extend to the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then must the tyrannical <i>receivers</i>, who presume
      to sentence the children of slaves to servitude, if they
      mean to dispute upon the justice of their cause; either
      allow them to have been <i>brutes</i> from their birth, or
      to have been guilty of crimes at a time, when they were
      incapable of offending the very <i>King of Kings</i>.

      But to return to the narration. When the wretched Africans
      are conveyed to the plantations, they are considered as
      <i>beasts of labour</i>, and are put to their respective
      work. Having led, in their own country, a life of indolence
      and ease, where the earth brings forth spontaneously the
      comforts of life, and spares frequently the toil and
      trouble of cultivation, they can hardly be expected to
      endure the drudgeries of servitude. Calculations are
      accordingly made upon their lives. It is conjectured, that
      if three in four survive what is called the
      <i>seasoning</i>, the bargain is highly favourable. This
      seasoning is said to expire, when the two first years of
      their servitude are completed: It is the time which an
      African must take to be so accustomed to the colony, as to
      be able to endure the common labour of a plantation, and to
      be put into the <i>gang</i>. At the end of this period the
      calculations become verified, twenty thousand<a name=
      "FNanchor059"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_059"><sup>[059]</sup></a> of those, who are
      annually imported, dying before the seasoning is over. This
      is surely an horrid and awful consideration: and thus does
      it appear, (and let it be remembered, that it is the lowest
      calculation that has been ever made upon the subject) that
      out of every annual supply that is shipped from the coast
      of Africa, <i>forty thousand lives</i><a name=
      "FNanchor060"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_060"><sup>[060]</sup></a> are regularly
      expended, even before it can be said, that there is really
      any additional stock for the colonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the seasoning is over, and the survivors are thus
      enabled to endure the usual task of slaves, they are
      considered as real and substantial supplies. From this
      period<a name="FNanchor061"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_061"><sup>[061]</sup></a> therefore we shall
      describe their situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are summoned at five in the morning to begin their
      work. This work may be divided into two kinds, the culture
      of the fields, and the collection of grass for cattle. The
      last is the most laborious and intolerable employment; as
      the grass can only be collected blade by blade, and is to
      be fetched frequently twice a day at a considerable
      distance from the plantation. In these two occupations they
      are jointly taken up, with no other intermission than that
      of taking their subsistence twice, till nine at night. They
      then separate for their respective huts, when they gather
      sticks, prepare their supper, and attend their families.
      This employs them till midnight, when they go to rest. Such
      is their daily way of life for rather more than half the
      year. They are <i>sixteen</i> hours, including two
      intervals at meals, in the service of their masters: they
      are employed <i>three</i> afterwards in their own necessary
      concerns; <i>five</i> only remain for sleep, and their day
      is finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the remaining portion of the year, or the time of
      crop, the nature, as well as the time of their employment,
      is considerably changed. The whole gang is generally
      divided into two or three bodies. One of these, besides the
      ordinary labour of the day, is kept in turn at the mills,
      that are constantly going, during the whole of the night.
      This is a dreadful encroachment upon their time of rest,
      which was before too short to permit them perfectly to
      refresh their wearied limbs, and actually reduces their
      sleep, as long as this season lasts, to about three hours
      and an half a night, upon a moderate computation.<a name=
      "FNanchor062"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_062"><sup>[062]</sup></a> Those who can keep
      their eyes open during their nightly labour, and are
      willing to resist the drowsiness that is continually coming
      upon them, are presently worn out; while some of those, who
      are overcome, and who feed the mill between asleep and
      awake, suffer, for thus obeying the calls of nature, by the
      loss of a limb.<a name="FNanchor063"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_063"><sup>[063]</sup></a> In this manner they
      go on, with little or no respite from their work, till the
      crop season is over, when the year (from the time of our
      first description) is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support<a name="FNanchor064"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_064"><sup>[064]</sup></a> a life of such
      unparalleled drudgery, we should at least expect: to find,
      that they were comfortably clothed, and plentifully fed.
      But sad reverse! they have scarcely a covering to defend
      themselves against the inclemency of the night. Their
      provisions are frequently bad, and are always dealt out to
      them with such a sparing hand, that the means of a bare
      livelihood are not placed within the reach of four out of
      five of these unhappy people. It is a fact, that many of
      the disorders of slaves are contracted from eating the
      vegetables, which their little spots produce, before they
      are sufficiently ripe: a clear indication, that the calls
      of hunger are frequently so pressing, as not to suffer them
      to wait, till they can really enjoy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, situation, of a want of the common necessaries of
      life, added to that of hard and continual labour, must be
      sufficiently painful of itself. How then must the pain be
      sharpened, if it be accompanied with severity! if an
      unfortunate slave does not come into the field exactly at
      the appointed time, if, drooping with sickness or fatigue,
      he appears to work unwillingly, or if the bundle of grass
      that he has been collecting, appears too small in the eye
      of the overseer, he is equally sure of experiencing the
      whip. This instrument erases the skin, and cuts out small
      portions of the flesh at almost every stroke; and is so
      frequently applied, that the smack of it is all day long in
      the ears of those, who are in the vicinity of the
      plantations. This severity of masters, or managers, to
      their slaves, which is considered only as common
      discipline, is attended with bad effects. It enables them
      to behold instances of cruelty without commiseration, and
      to be guilty of them without remorse. Hence those many acts
      of deliberate mutilation, that have taken place on the
      slightest occasions: hence those many acts of inferiour,
      though shocking, barbarity, that have taken place without
      any occasion at all: the very slitting<a name=
      "FNanchor065"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_065"><sup>[065]</sup></a> of ears has been
      considered as an operation, so perfectly devoid of pain, as
      to have been performed for no other reason than that for
      which a brand is set upon cattle, <i>as a mark of
      property</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not the only effect, which this severity
      produces: for while it hardens their hearts, and makes them
      insensible of the misery of their fellow-creatures, it
      begets a turn for wanton cruelty. As a proof of this, we
      shall mention one, among the many instances that occur,
      where ingenuity has been exerted in contriving modes of
      torture. "An iron coffin, with holes in it, was kept by a
      certain colonist, as an auxiliary to the lash. In this the
      poor victim of the master's resentment was inclosed, and
      placed sufficiently near a fire, to occasion extreme pain,
      and consequently shrieks and groans, until the revenge of
      the master was satiated, without any other inconvenience on
      his part, than a temporary suspension of the slave's
      labour. Had he been flogged to death, or his limbs
      mutilated, the interest of the brutal tyrant would have
      suffered a more irreparable loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In mentioning, this instance, we do not mean to insinuate,
      that it is common. We know that it was reprobated by many.
      All that we would infer from it is, that where men are
      habituated to a system of severity, they become <i>wantonly
      cruel</i>, and that the mere toleration of such an
      instrument of torture, in any country, is a clear
      indication, <i>that this wretched class of men do not there
      enjoy the protection of any laws, that may be pretended to
      have been enacted in their favour</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such then is the general situation of the unfortunate
      Africans. They are beaten and tortured at discretion. They
      are badly clothed. They are miserably fed. Their drudgery
      is intense and incessant and their rest short. For scarcely
      are their heads reclined, scarcely have their bodies a
      respite from the labour of the day, or the cruel hand of
      the overseer, but they are summoned to renew their sorrows.
      In this manner they go on from year to year, in a state of
      the lowest degradation, without a single law to protect
      them, without the possibility of redress, without a hope
      that their situation will be changed, unless death should
      terminate the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having described the general situation of these unfortunate
      people, we shall now take notice of the common consequences
      that are found to attend it, and relate them separately, as
      they result either from long and painful <i>labour</i>, a
      <i>want</i> of the common necessaries of life, or continual
      <i>severity</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oppressed by a daily task of such immoderate labour as
      human nature is utterly unable to perform, many of them run
      away from their masters. They fly to the recesses of the
      mountains, where they choose rather to live upon any thing
      that the soil affords them, nay, the very soil itself, than
      return to that <i>happy situation</i>, which is represented
      by the <i>receivers</i>, as the condition of a slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sometimes happens, that the manager of a mountain
      plantation, falls in with one of these; he immediately
      seizes him, and threatens to carry him to his former
      master, unless he will consent to live on the mountain and
      cultivate his ground. When his plantation is put in order,
      he carries the delinquent home, abandons him to all the
      suggestions of despotick rage, and accepts a reward for his
      <i>honesty</i>. The unhappy wretch is chained, scourged,
      tortured; and all this, because he obeyed the dictates of
      nature, and wanted to be free. And who is there, that would
      not have done the same thing, in the same situation? Who is
      there, that has once known the charms of liberty; that
      would not fly from despotism? And yet, by the impious laws
      of the <i>receivers</i>, the absence<a name=
      "FNanchor066"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_066"><sup>[066]</sup></a> of six months from the
      lash of tyranny is-<i>death</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this law is even mild, when compared with another
      against the same offence, which was in force sometime ago,
      and which we fear is even now in force, in some of those
      colonies which this account of the treatment comprehends.
      "Advertisements have frequently appeared there, offering a
      reward for the apprehending of fugitive slaves either alive
      or <i>dead</i>. The following instance was given us by a
      person of unquestionable veracity, under whose own
      observation it fell. As he was travelling in one of the
      colonies alluded to, he observed some people in pursuit of
      a poor wretch, who was seeking in the wilderness an asylum
      from his labours. He heard the discharge of a gun, and soon
      afterwards stopping at an house for refreshment, the head
      of the fugitive, still reeking with blood, was brought in
      and laid upon a table with exultation. The production of
      such a trophy was the proof <i>required by law</i> to
      entitle the heroes to their reward." Now reader determine
      if you can, who were the most execrable; the rulers of the
      state in authorizing murder, or the people in being bribed
      to commit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of the common consequences of that immoderate
      share of labour, which is imposed upon them; nor is that,
      which is the result of a scanty allowance of food, less to
      be lamented. The wretched African is often so deeply
      pierced by the excruciating fangs of hunger, as almost to
      be driven to despair. What is he to do in such a trying
      situation? Let him apply to the <i>receivers</i>. Alas! the
      majesty of <i>receivership</i> is too sacred for the
      appeal, and the intrusion would be fatal. Thus attacked on
      the one hand, and shut out from every possibility of relief
      on the other, he has only the choice of being starved, or
      of relieving his necessities by taking a small portion of
      the fruits of his own labour. Horrid crime! to be found
      eating the cane, which probably his own hands have planted,
      and to be eating it, because his necessities were pressing!
      This crime however is of such a magnitude, as always to be
      accompanied with the whip; and so unmercifully has it been
      applied on such an occasion, as to have been the cause, in
      wet weather, of the delinquent's death. But the smart of
      the whip has not been the only pain that the wretched
      Africans have experienced. Any thing that passion could
      seize, and convert into an instrument of punishment, has
      been used; and, horrid to relate! the very knife has not
      been overlooked in the fit of phrenzy. Ears have been slit,
      eyes have been beaten out, and bones have been broken; and
      so frequently has this been the case, that it has been a
      matter of constant lamentation with disinterested people,
      who out of curiosity have attended the markets<a name=
      "FNanchor067"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_067"><sup>[067]</sup></a> to which these unhappy
      people weekly resort, that they have not been able to turn
      their eyes on any group of them whatever, but they have
      beheld these inhuman marks of passion, despotism, and
      caprice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these instances of barbarity have not been able to
      deter them from similar proceedings. And indeed, how can it
      be expected that they should? They have still the same
      appetite to be satisfied as before, and to drive them to
      desperation. They creep out clandestinely by night, and go
      in search of food into their master's, or some neighbouring
      plantation. But here they are almost equally sure of
      suffering. The watchman, who will be punished himself, if
      he neglects his duty, frequently seizes them in the fact.
      No excuse or intreaty will avail; he must punish them for
      an example, and he must punish them, not with a stick, nor
      with a whip, but with a cutlass. Thus it happens, that
      these unhappy slaves, if they are taken, are either sent
      away mangled in a barbarous manner, or are killed upon the
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may now mention the consequences of the severity. The
      wretched Africans, daily subjected to the lash, and
      unmercifully whipt and beaten on every trifling occasion,
      have been found to resist their opposers. Unpardonable
      crime! that they should have the feelings of nature! that
      their breasts should glow with resentment on an injury!
      that they should be so far overcome, as to resist those,
      whom <i>they are under no obligations to obey</i>, and
      whose only title to their services consists in <i>a
      violation of the rights of men</i>! What has been the
      consequence?-But here let us spare the feelings of the
      reader, (we wish we could spare our own) and let us only
      say, without a recital of the cruelty, <i>that they have
      been murdered at the discretion of their masters</i>. For
      let the reader observe, that the life of an African is only
      valued at a price, that would scarcely purchase an horse;
      that the master has a power of murdering his slave, if he
      pays but a trifling fine; and that the murder must be
      attended with uncommon circumstances of horrour, if it even
      produces an inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immortal Alfred! father of our invaluable constitution!
      parent of the civil blessings we enjoy! how ought thy laws
      to excite our love and veneration, who hast forbidden us,
      thy posterity, to tremble at the frown of tyrants! how
      ought they to perpetuate thy name, as venerable, to the

      while she absolutely turns pale, trembles, and recoils, at
      the institutions of these <i>receivers</i>! Execrable men!
      you do not murder the horse, on which you only ride; you do
      not mutilate the cow, which only affords you her milk; you
      do not torture the dog, which is but a partial servant of
      your pleasures: but these unfortunate men, from whom, you
      derive your very pleasures and your fortunes, you torture,
      mutilate, murder at discretion! Sleep then you
      <i>receivers</i>, if you can, while you scarcely allow
      these unfortunate people to rest at all! feast if you can,
      and indulge your genius, while you daily apply to these
      unfortunate people the stings of severity and hunger! exult
      in riches, at which even avarice ought to shudder, and,
      which humanity must detest!

    <p>
      Some people may suppose, from the melancholy account that
      has been given in the preceding chapter, that we have been
      absolutely dealing in romance: that the scene exhibited is
      rather a dreary picture of the imagination, than a
      representation of fact. Would to heaven, for the honour of
      human nature, that this were really the case! We wish we
      could say, that we have no testimony to produce for any of
      our assertions, and that our description of the general
      treatment of slaves has been greatly exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the <i>receivers</i>, notwithstanding the ample and
      disinterested evidence, that can be brought on the
      occasion, do not admit the description to be true. They say
      first, "that if the slavery were such as has been now
      represented, no human being could possibly support it
      long." Melancholy truth! the wretched Africans generally
      perish in their prime. Let them reflect upon the prodigious
      supplies that are <i>annually</i> required, and their
      argument will be nothing less than a confession, that the
      slavery has been justly depicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They appeal next to every man's own reason, and desire him
      to think seriously, whether "self-interest will not always
      restrain the master from acts of cruelty to the slave, and
      whether such accounts therefore, as the foregoing, do not
      contain within themselves, their own refutation." We
      answer, "No." For if this restraining principle be as
      powerful as it is imagined, why does not the general
      conduct of men afford us a better picture? What is
      imprudence, or what is vice, but a departure from every
      man's own interest, and yet these are the characteristicks
      of more than half the world?-
    </p>
    <p>
      -But, to come more closely to the present case,
      <i>self-interest</i> will be found but a weak barrier
      against the sallies of <i>passion</i>: particularly where
      it has been daily indulged in its greatest latitude, and
      there are no laws to restrain its calamitous effects. If
      the observation be true, that passion is a short madness,
      then it is evident that self-interest, and every other
      consideration, must be lost, so long as it continues. We
      cannot have a stronger instance of this, than in a
      circumstance related in the second part of this Essay,
      "that though the Africans have gone to war for the express
      purpose of procuring slaves, yet so great has been their
      resentment at the resistance they have frequently found,
      that their <i>passion</i> has entirely got the better of
      their <i>interest</i>, and they have murdered all without
      any discrimination, either of age or sex." Such may be
      presumed to be the case with the no less savage
      <i>receivers</i>. Impressed with the most haughty and
      tyrannical notions, easily provoked, accustomed to indulge
      their anger, and, above all, habituated to scenes of
      cruelty, and unawed by the fear of laws, they will hardly
      be found to be exempt from the common failings of human
      nature, and to spare an unlucky slave, at a time when men
      of cooler temper, and better regulated passions, are so
      frequently blind to their own interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if <i>passion</i> may be supposed to be generally more
      than a ballance for <i>interest</i>, how must the scale be
      turned in favour of the melancholy picture exhibited, when
      we reflect that <i>self-preservation</i> additionally steps
      in, and demands the most <i>rigorous severity</i>. For when
      we consider that where there is <i>one</i> master, there
      are <i>fifty</i> slaves; that the latter have been all
      forcibly torn from their country, and are retained in their
      present situation by violence; that they are perpetually at
      war in their hearts with their oppressors, and are
      continually cherishing the seeds of revenge; it is evident
      that even <i>avarice</i> herself, however cool and
      deliberate, however free from passion and caprice, must
      sacrifice her own sordid feelings, and adopt a system of
      tyranny and oppression, which it must be ruinous to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then, if no picture had been drawn of the situation of
      slaves, and it had been left solely to every man's sober
      judgment to determine, what it might probably be, he would
      conclude, that if the situation were justly described, the
      page must be frequently stained with acts of uncommon
      cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains only to make a reply to an objection, that is
      usually advanced against particular instances of cruelty to
      slaves, as recorded by various writers. It is said that
      "some of these are so inconceivably, and beyond all example
      inhuman, that their very excess above the common measure of
      cruelty shews them at once exaggerated and incredible." But
      their credibility shall be estimated by a supposition. Let
      us suppose that the following instance had been recorded by
      a writer of the highest reputation, "that the master of a
      ship, bound to the western colonies with slaves, on a
      presumption that many of them would die, selected an
      <i>hundred and thirty two</i> of the most sickly, and
      ordered them to be thrown into the sea, to recover their
      value from the insurers, and, above all, that the fatal
      order was put into execution." What would the reader have
      thought on the occasion? Would he have believed the fact?
      It would have surely staggered his faith; because he could
      never have heard that any <i>one</i> man ever was, and
      could never have supposed that any <i>one</i> man ever
      could be, guilty of the murder of <i>such a number</i> of
      his fellow creatures. But when he is informed that such a
      fact as this came before a court<a name=
      "FNanchor068"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_068"><sup>[068]</sup></a> of justice in this
      very country; that it happened within the last five years;
      that hundreds can come forwards and say, that they heard
      the melancholy evidence with tears; what bounds is he to
      place to his belief? The great God, who looks down upon all
      his creatures with the same impartial eye, seems to have
      infatuated the parties concerned, that they might bring the
      horrid circumstance to light, that it might be recorded in
      the annals of a publick court, as an authentick specimen of
      the treatment which the unfortunate Africans undergo, and
      at the same time, as an argument to shew, that there is no
      species of cruelty, that is recorded to have been exercised
      upon these wretched people, so enormous that it may not
      <i>readily be believed</i>.

    </h2>
    <p>
      If the treatment then, as before described, is confirmed by
      reason, and the great credit that is due to disinterested
      writers on the subject; if the unfortunate Africans are
      used, as if their flesh were stone, and their vitals brass;
      by what arguments do you <i>receivers</i> defend your
      conduct?
    </p>
    <p>
      You say that a great part of your savage treatment consists
      in punishment for real offences, and frequently for such
      offences, as all civilized nations have concurred in
      punishing. The first charge that you exhibit against them
      is specifick, it is that of <i>theft</i>. But how much
      rather ought you <i>receivers</i> to blush, who reduce them
      to such a situation! who reduce them to the dreadful
      alternative, that they must either <i>steal</i> or
      <i>perish</i>! How much rather ought you <i>receivers</i>
      to be considered as <i>robbers</i> yourselves, who cause
      these unfortunate people to be <i>stolen</i>! And how much
      greater is your crime, who are <i>robbers of human
      liberty</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next charge which you exhibit against them, is general,
      it is that of <i>rebellion</i>; a crime of such a latitude,
      that you can impose it upon almost every action, and of
      such a nature, that you always annex to it the most
      excruciating pain. But what a contradiction is this to
      common sense! Have the wretched Africans formally resigned
      their freedom? Have you any other claim upon their
      obedience, than that of force? If then they are your
      subjects, you violate the laws of government, by making
      them unhappy. But if they are not your subjects, then, even
      though they should resist your proceedings, they are not
      <i>rebellious</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what do you say to that long catalogue of offences,
      which you punish, and of which no people but yourselves
      take cognizance at all? You say that the wisdom of
      legislation has inserted it in the colonial laws, and that
      you punish by authority. But do you allude to that
      execrable code, that <i>authorises murder</i>? that tempts
      an unoffended person to kill the slave, that abhors and
      flies your service? that delegates a power, which no host
      of men, which not all the world, can possess?-
    </p>
    <p>
      Or,-What do you say to that daily unmerited severity, which
      you consider only as common discipline? Here you say that
      the Africans are vicious, that they are all of them
      ill-disposed, that you must of necessity be severe. But can
      they be well-disposed to their oppressors? In their own
      country they were just, generous, hospitable: qualities,
      which all the African historians allow them eminently to
      possess. If then they are vicious, they must have
      contracted many of their vices from yourselves; and as to
      their own native vices, if any have been imported with
      them, are they not amiable, when compared with yours?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then do the excuses, which have been hitherto made by
      the <i>receivers</i>, force a relation of such
      circumstances, as makes their conduct totally inexcusable,
      and, instead of diminishing at all, highly aggravates their
      guilt.

    <h2>
      <a href="#PART_III.">CHAP. VII.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      We come now to that other system of reasoning, which is
      always applied, when the former is confuted; "that the
      Africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature, and
      are made for slavery."
    </p>
    <p>
      This assertion is proved by two arguments; the first of
      which was advanced also by the ancients, and is drawn from
      the <i>inferiority of their capacities</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us allow then for a moment, that they appear to have no
      parts, that they appear to be void of understanding. And is
      this wonderful, when, you <i>receivers</i> depress their
      senses by hunger? Is this wonderful, when by incessant
      labour, the continual application of the lash, and the most
      inhuman treatment that imagination can devise, you
      overwhelm their genius, and hinder it from breaking
      forth?-No,-You confound their abilities by the severity of
      their servitude: for as a spark of fire, if crushed by too
      great a weight of incumbent fuel, cannot be blown into a
      flame, but suddenly expires, so the human mind, if
      depressed by rigorous servitude, cannot be excited to a
      display of those faculties, which might otherwise have
      shone with the brightest lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither is it wonderful in another point of view. For what
      is it that awakens the abilities of men, and distinguishes
      them from the common herd? Is it not often the amiable hope
      of becoming serviceable to individuals, or the state? Is it
      not often the hope of riches, or of power? Is it not
      frequently the hope of temporary honours, or a lasting
      fame? These principles have all a wonderful effect upon the
      mind. They call upon it to exert its faculties, and bring
      those talents to the publick view, which had otherwise been
      concealed. But the unfortunate Africans have no such
      incitements as these, that they should shew their genius.
      They have no hope of riches, power, honours, fame. They
      have no hope but this, that their miseries will be soon
      terminated by death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here we cannot but censure and expose the murmurings of
      the unthinking and the gay; who, going on in a continual
      round of pleasure and prosperity, repine at the will of
      Providence, as exhibited in the shortness of human
      duration. But let a weak and infirm old age overtake them:
      let them experience calamities: let them feel but half the
      miseries which the wretched Africans undergo, and they will
      praise the goodness of Providence, who hath made them
      mortal; who hath prescribed certain ordinary bounds to the
      life of man; and who, by such a limitation, hath given all
      men this comfortable hope, that however persecuted in life,
      a time will come, in the common course of nature, when
      their sufferings will have an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such then is the nature of this servitude, that we can
      hardly expect to find in those, who undergo it, even the
      glimpse of genius. For if their minds are in a continual
      state of depression, and if they have no expectations in
      life to awaken their abilities, and make them eminent, we
      cannot be surprized if a sullen gloomy stupidity should be
      the leading mark in their character; or if they should
      appear inferiour to those, who do not only enjoy the
      invaluable blessings of freedom, but have every prospect
      before their eyes, that can allure them to exert their
      faculties. Now, if to these considerations we add, that the
      wretched Africans are torn from their country in a state of
      nature, and that in general, as long as their slavery
      continues, every obstacle is placed in the way of their
      improvement, we shall have a sufficient answer to any
      argument that may be drawn from the inferiority of their
      capacities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears then, from the circumstances that have been
      mentioned, that to form a true judgment of the abilities of
      these unfortunate people, we must either take a general
      view of them before their slavery commences, or confine our
      attention to such, as, after it has commenced, have had any
      opportunity given them of shewing their genius either in
      arts or letters. If, upon such a fair and impartial view,
      there should be any reason to suppose, that they are at all
      inferiour to others in the same situation, the argument
      will then gain some of that weight and importance, which it
      wants at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their own country, where we are to see them first, we
      must expect that the prospect will be unfavourable. They
      are mostly in a savage state. Their powers of mind are
      limited to few objects. Their ideas are consequently few.
      It appears, however, that they follow the same mode of
      life, and exercise the same arts, as the ancestors of those
      very Europeans, who boast of their great superiority, are
      described to have done in the same uncultivated state. This
      appears from the Nubian's Geography, the writings of Leo,
      the Moor, and all the subsequent histories, which those,
      who have visited the African continent, have written from
      their own inspection. Hence three conclusions; that their
      abilities are sufficient for their situation;-that they are
      as great, as those of other people have been, in the same
      stage of society;-and that they are as great as those of
      any civilized people whatever, when the degree of the
      barbarism of the one is drawn into a comparison with that
      of the civilization of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now follow them to the colonies. They are carried
      over in the unfavourable situation described. It is
      observed here, that though their abilities cannot be
      estimated high from a want of cultivation, they are yet
      various, and that they vary in proportion as the nation,
      from which they have been brought, has advanced more or
      less in the scale of social life. This observation, which
      is so frequently made, is of great importance: for if their
      abilities expand in proportion to the improvement of their
      state, it is a clear indication, that if they were equally
      improved, they would be equally ingenious.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here, before we consider any opportunities that may be
      afforded them, let it be remembered that even their most
      polished situation may be called barbarous, and that this
      circumstance, should they appear less docile than others,
      may be considered as a sufficient answer to any objection
      that may be made to their capacities. Notwithstanding this,
      when they are put to the mechanical arts, they do not
      discover a want of ingenuity. They attain them in as short
      a time as the Europeans, and arrive at a degree of
      excellence equal to that of their teachers. This is a fact,
      almost universally known, and affords us this proof, that
      having learned with facility such of the mechanical arts,
      as they have been taught, they are capable of attaining any
      other, at least, of the same class, if they should receive
      but the same instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the liberal arts, their proficiency is
      certainly less; but not less in proportion to their time
      and opportunity of study; not less, because they are less
      capable of attaining them, but because they have seldom or
      ever an opportunity of learning them at all. It is yet
      extraordinary that their talents appear, even in some of
      these sciences, in which they are totally uninstructed.
      Their abilities in musick are such, as to have been
      generally noticed. They play frequently upon a variety of
      instruments, without any other assistance than their own
      ingenuity. They have also tunes of their own composition.
      Some of these have been imported among us; are now in use;
      and are admired for their sprightliness and ease, though
      the ungenerous and prejudiced importer has concealed their
      original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither are their talents in poetry less conspicuous. Every
      occurrence, if their spirits are not too greatly depressed,
      is turned into a song. These songs are said to be
      incoherent and nonsensical. But this proceeds principally
      from two causes, an improper conjunction of words, arising
      from an ignorance of the language in which they compose;
      and a wildness of thought, arising from the different
      manner, in which the organs of rude and civilized people
      will be struck by the same object. And as to their want of
      harmony and rhyme, which is the last objection, the
      difference of pronunciation is the cause. Upon the whole,
      as they are perfectly consistent with their own ideas, and
      are strictly musical as pronounced by themselves, they
      afford us as high a proof of their poetical powers, as the
      works of the most acknowledged poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where these impediments have been removed, where they
      have received an education, and have known and pronounced
      the language with propriety, these defects have vanished,
      and their productions have been less objectionable. For a
      proof of this, we appeal to the writings of an African
      girl,<a name="FNanchor069"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_069"><sup>[069]</sup></a> who made no
      contemptible appearance in this species of composition. She
      was kidnapped when only eight years old, and, in the year
      1761, was transported to America, where she was sold with
      other slaves. She had no school education there, but
      receiving some little instruction from the family, with
      whom she was so fortunate as to live, she obtained such a
      knowledge of the English language within sixteen months
      from the time of her arrival, as to be able to speak it and
      read it to the astonishment of those who heard her. She
      soon afterwards learned to write, and, having a great
      inclination to learn the Latin tongue, she was indulged by
      her master, and made a progress. Her Poetical works were
      published with his permission, in the year 1773. They
      contain thirty-eight pieces on different subjects. We shall
      beg leave to make a short extract from two or three of
      them, for the observation of the reader.

      Such is the poetry which we produce as a proof of our
      assertions. How far it has succeeded, the reader may by
      this time have determined in his own mind. We shall
      therefore only beg leave to accompany it with this
      observation, that if the authoress <i>was designed for
      slavery</i>, (as the argument must confess) the greater
      part of the inhabitants of Britain must lose their claim to
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this poetry we shall only add, as a farther proof of
      their abilities, the Prose compositions of Ignatius Sancho,
      who received some little education. His letters are too
      well known, to make any extract, or indeed any farther
      mention of him, necessary. If other examples of African
      genius should be required, suffice it to say, that they can
      be produced in abundance; and that if we were allowed to
      enumerate instances of African gratitude, patience,
      fidelity, honour, as so many instances of good sense, and a
      sound understanding, we fear that thousands of the
      enlightened Europeans would have occasion to blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      But an objection will be made here, that the two persons
      whom we have particularized by name, are prodigies, and
      that if we were to live for many years, we should scarcely
      meet with two other Africans of the same description. But
      we reply, that considering their situation as before
      described, two persons, above mediocrity in the literary
      way, are as many as can be expected within a certain period
      of years; and farther, that if these are prodigies, they
      are only such prodigies as every day would produce, if they
      had the same opportunities of acquiring knowledge as other
      people, and the same expectations in life to excite their
      genius. This has been constantly and solemnly asserted by
      the pious Benezet,<a name="FNanchor071"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_071"><sup>[071]</sup></a> whom we have
      mentioned before, as having devoted a considerable part of
      his time to their instruction. This great man, for we
      cannot but mention him with veneration, had a better
      opportunity of knowing them than any person whatever, and
      he always uniformly declared, that he could never find a
      difference between their capacities and those of other
      people; that they were as capable of reasoning as any
      individual Europeans; that they were as capable of the
      highest intellectual attainments; in short, that their
      abilities were equal, and that they only wanted to be
      equally cultivated, to afford specimens of as fine
      productions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then does it appear from the testimony of this
      venerable man, whose authority is sufficient of itself to
      silence all objections against African capacity, and from
      the instances that have been produced, and the observations
      that have been made on the occasion, that if the minds of
      the Africans were unbroken by slavery; if they had the same
      expectations in life as other people, and the same
      opportunities of improvement, they would be equal; in all
      the various branches of science, to the Europeans, and that
      the argument that states them "to be an inferiour link of
      the chain of nature, and designed for servitude," as far as
      it depends on the <i>inferiority of their capacities</i>,
      is wholly malevolent and false.<a name="FNanchor072"></a><a

    </h2>
    <p>
      The second argument, by which it is attempted to be proved,
      "that the Africans are an inferiour link of the chain of
      nature, and are designed for slavery," is drawn from
      <i>colour</i>, and from those other marks, which
      distinguish them from the inhabitants of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove this with the greater facility, the
      <i>receivers</i> divide in opinion. Some of them contend
      that the Africans, from these circumstances, are the
      descendants of Cain:<a name="FNanchor073"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_073"><sup>[073]</sup></a> others, that they are
      the posterity of Ham; and that as it was declared by divine
      inspiration, that these should be servants to the rest of
      the world, so they are designed for slavery; and that the
      reducing of them to such a situation is only the
      accomplishment of the will of heaven: while the rest,
      considering them from the same circumstances as a totally
      distinct species of men, conclude them to be an inferiour
      link of the chain of nature, and deduce the inference
      described.
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer these arguments in the clearest and fullest
      manner, we are under the necessity of making two
      suppositions, first, that the scriptures are true;
      secondly, that they are false.
    </p>
    <p>
      If then the scriptures are true, it is evident that the
      posterity of Cain were extinguished in the flood. Thus one
      of the arguments is no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the curse of Ham, it appears also that it
      was limited; that it did not extend to the posterity of all
      his sons, but only to the descendants of him who was called
      Canaan:<a name="FNanchor074"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_074"><sup>[074]</sup></a> by which it was
      foretold that the Canaanites, a part of the posterity of
      Ham, should serve the posterity of Shem and Japhet. Now how
      does it appear that these wretched Africans are the
      descendants of Canaan?-By those marks, it will be said,
      which distinguish them from the rest of the world.-But
      where are these marks to be found in the divine writings?
      In what page is it said, that the Canaanites were to be
      known by their <i>colour</i>, their <i>features</i>, their
      <i>form</i>, or the very <i>hair of their heads</i>, which
      is brought into the account?-But alas! so far are the
      divine writings from giving any such account, that they
      shew the assertion to be false. They shew that the
      descendants of Cush<a name="FNanchor075"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_075"><sup>[075]</sup></a> were of the colour, to
      which the advocates for slavery allude; and of course, that
      there was no such limitation of colour to the posterity of
      Canaan, or the inheritors of the curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we should now shew, upon the most undeniable
      evidence,<a name="FNanchor076"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_076"><sup>[076]</sup></a> that those of the
      wretched Africans, who are singled out as inheriting the
      curse, are the descendants of Cush or Phut; and that we
      should shew farther, that but a single remnant of Canaan,
      which was afterwards ruined, was ever in Africa at
      all.-Here all is consternation.-
    </p>
    <p>
      But unfortunately again for the argument, though
      wonderfully for the confirmation that the scriptures are of
      divine original, the whole prophecy has been completed. A
      part of the descendants of Canaan were hewers of wood and
      drawers of water, and became tributary and subject to the
      Israelites, or the descendants of Shem. The Greeks
      afterwards, as well as the Romans, who were both the
      descendants of Japhet, not only subdued those who were
      settled in Syria and Palestine, but pursued and conquered
      all such as were then remaining. These were the Tyrians and
      Carthaginians: the former of whom were ruined by Alexander
      and the Greeks, the latter by Scipio and the Romans.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears then that the second argument is wholly
      inapplicable and false: that it is false in its
      <i>application</i>, because those, who were the objects of
      the curse, were a totally distinct people: that it is false
      in its <i>proof</i>, because no such distinguishing marks,
      as have been specified, are to be found in the divine
      writings: and that, if the proof could be made out, it
      would be now <i>inapplicable</i>, as the curse has been
      long completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the third argument, we must now suppose
      that the scriptures are false; that mankind did not all
      spring from the same original; that there are different
      species of men. Now what must we justly conclude from such
      a supposition? Must we conclude that one species is
      inferiour to another, and that the inferiority depends upon
      their <i>colour</i>, or their <i>features</i>, or their
      <i>form</i>?-No-We must now consult the analogy of nature,
      and the conclusion will be this: "that as she tempered the
      bodies of the different species of men in a different
      degree, to enable them to endure the respective climates of
      their habitation, so she gave them a variety of colour and
      appearance with a like benevolent design."
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up the whole. If the scriptures are true, it is
      evident that the posterity of <i>Cain</i> are no more; that
      the curse of <i>Ham</i> has been accomplished; and that, as
      all men were derived from the same stock, so this variety
      of appearance in men must either have proceeded from some
      interposition of the Deity; or from a co-operation of
      certain causes, which have an effect upon the human frame,
      and have the power of changing it more or less from its
      primitive appearance, as they happen to be more or less
      numerous or powerful than those, which acted upon the frame
      of man in the first seat of his habitation. If from the
      interposition of the Deity, then we must conclude that he,
      who bringeth good out of evil, produced it for their
      convenience. If, from the co-operation of the causes before
      related, what argument may not be found against any society
      of men, who should happen to differ, in the points alluded
      to, from ourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      If, on the other hand, the scriptures are false, then it is
      evident, that there was neither such a person as
      <i>Cain</i>, nor <i>Ham</i>, nor <i>Canaan</i>; and that
      nature bestowed such colour, features, and form, upon the
      different species of men, as were best adapted to their
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, on which ever supposition it is founded, the whole
      argument must fall. And indeed it is impossible that it can
      stand, even in the eye of common sense. For if you admit
      the <i>form</i> of men as a justification of slavery, you
      may subjugate your own brother: if <i>features</i>, then
      you must quarrel with all the world: if <i>colour</i>,
      where are you to stop? It is evident, that if you travel
      from the equator to the northern pole, you will find a
      regular gradation of colour from black to white. Now if you
      can justly take him for your slave, who is of the deepest
      die, what hinders you from taking him also, who only
      differs from the former but by a shade. Thus you may
      proceed, taking each in a regular succession to the poles.
      But who are you, that thus take into slavery so many
      people? Where do you live yourself? Do you live in
      <i>Spain</i>, or in <i>France</i>, or in <i>Britain</i>? If
      in either of these countries, take care lest the <i>whiter
      natives of the north</i> should have a claim upon
      yourself.-But the argument is too ridiculous to be farther
      noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now silenced the whole argument, we might
      immediately proceed to the discussion of other points,
      without even declaring our opinion as to which of the
      suppositions may be right, on which it has been refuted;
      but we do not think ourselves at liberty to do this. The
      present age would rejoice to find that the scriptures had
      no foundation, and would anxiously catch at the writings of
      him, who should mention them in a doubtful manner. We shall
      therefore declare our sentiments, by asserting that they
      are true, and that all mankind, however various their
      appearances are derived from the same stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove this, we shall not produce those innumerable
      arguments, by which the scriptures have stood the test of
      ages, but advert to a single fact. It is an universal law,
      observable throughout the whole creation, <i>that if two
      animals of a different species propagate, their offspring
      is unable to continue its own species</i>. By this
      admirable law, the different species are preserved
      distinct; every possibility of confusion is prevented, and
      the world is forbidden to be over-run by a race of
      monsters. Now, if we apply this law to those of the human
      kind, who are said to be of a distinct species from each
      other, it immediately fails. The <i>mulattoe</i> is as
      capable of continuing his own species as his father; a
      clear and irrefragable proof, that the scripture<a name=
      "FNanchor077"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_077"><sup>[077]</sup></a> account of the
      creation is true, and that "God, who hath made the world,
      hath made of one blood<a name="FNanchor078"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_078"><sup>[078]</sup></a> all the nations of men
      that dwell on all the face of the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      But if this be the case, it will be said that mankind were
      originally of one colour; and it will be asked at the same
      time, what it is probable that the colour was, and how they
      came to assume so various an appearance? To, each of these
      we shall make that reply, which we conceive to be the most
      rational.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mankind were originally of the same stock, so it is
      evident that they were originally of the same colour. But
      how shall we attempt to ascertain it? Shall we
      <i>Englishmen</i> say, that it was the same as that which
      we now find to be peculiar to ourselves?-No-This would be a
      vain and partial consideration, and would betray our
      judgment to have arisen from that false fondness, which
      habituates us to suppose, that every thing belonging to
      ourselves is the perfectest and the best. Add to this, that
      we should always be liable to a just reproof from every
      inhabitant of the globe, whose colour was different from
      our own; because he would justly say, that he had as good a
      right to imagine that his own was the primitive colour, as
      that of any other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      How then shall we attempt to ascertain it? Shall we look
      into the various climates of the earth, see the colour that
      generally prevails in the inhabitants of each, and apply
      the rule? This will be certainly free from partiality, and
      will afford us a better prospect of success: for as every
      particular district has its particular colour, so it is
      evident that the complexion of Noah and his sons, from whom
      the rest of the world were descended, was the same as that,
      which is peculiar to the country, which was the seat of
      their habitation. This, by such a mode of decision, will be
      found a dark olive; a beautiful colour, and a just medium
      between white and black. That this was the primitive
      colour, is highly probable from the observations that have
      been made; and, if admitted, will afford a valuable lesson
      to the Europeans, to be cautious how they deride those of
      the opposite complexion, as there is great reason to
      presume, <i>that the purest white</i><a name=
      "FNanchor079"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_079"><sup>[079]</sup></a> <i>is as far removed
      from the primitive colour as the deepest black</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We come now to the grand question, which is, that if
      mankind were originally of this or any other colour, how
      came it to pass, that they should wear so various an
      appearance? We reply, as we have had occasion to say
      before, either <i>by the interposition of the Deity</i>; or
      <i>by a co-operation of certain causes, which have an
      effect upon the human frame, and have the power of changing
      it more or less from its primitive appearance, as they are
      more or less numerous or powerful than those, which acted
      upon the frame of man in the first seat of his
      habitation</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the Divine interposition, two epochs have
      been assigned, when this difference of colour has been
      imagined to have been so produced. The first is that, which
      has been related, when the curse was pronounced on a branch
      of the posterity of <i>Ham</i>. But this argument has been
      already refuted; for if the particular colour alluded to
      were assigned at this period, it was assigned to the
      descendants of <i>Canaan</i>, to distinguish them from
      those of his other brothers, and was therefore
      <i>limited</i> to the former. But the descendants of
      <i>Cush</i>,<a name="FNanchor080"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_080"><sup>[080]</sup></a> as we have shewn
      before, partook of the same colour; a clear proof, that it
      was neither assigned to them on this occasion, nor at this
      period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second epoch is that, when mankind were dispersed on
      the building of <i>Babel</i>. It has been thought, that
      both <i>national features and colour</i> might probably
      have been given them at this time, because these would have
      assisted the confusion of language, by causing them to
      disperse into tribes, and would have united more firmly the
      individuals of each, after the dispersion had taken place.
      But this is improbable: first, because there is great
      reason to presume that Moses, who has mentioned the
      confusion of language, would have mentioned these
      circumstances also, if they had actually contributed to
      bring about so singular an event: secondly, because the
      confusion of language was sufficient of itself to have
      accomplished this; and we cannot suppose that the Deity
      could have done any thing in vain: and thirdly, because, if
      mankind had been dispersed, each tribe in its peculiar hue,
      it is impossible to conceive, that they could have wandered
      and settled in such a manner, as to exhibit that regular
      gradation of colour from the equator to the poles, so
      conspicuous at the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the only periods, which there has been even the
      shadow of a probability for assigning; and we may therefore
      conclude that the preceding observations, together with
      such circumstances as will appear in the present chapter,
      will amount to a demonstration, that the difference of
      colour was never caused by any interposition of the Deity,
      and that it must have proceeded therefore from that
      <i>incidental co-operation of causes</i>, which has been
      before related.
    </p>
    <p>
      What these causes are, it is out of the power of human
      wisdom positively to assert: there are facts, however,
      which, if properly weighed and put together, will throw
      considerable light upon the subject. These we shall submit
      to the perusal of the reader, and shall deduce from them
      such inferences only, as almost every person must make in
      his own mind, on their recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first point, that occurs to be ascertained, is, "What
      part of the skin is the seat of colour?" The old anatomists
      usually divided the skin into two parts, or lamina; the
      exteriour and thinnest, called by the Greeks
      <i>Epidermis</i>, by the Romans <i>Cuticula</i>, and hence
      by us <i>Cuticle</i>; and the interiour, called by the
      former <i>Derma</i>, and by the latter <i>Cutis</i>, or
      <i>true skin</i>. Hence they must necessarily have
      supposed, that, as the <i>true skin</i> was in every
      respect the same in all human subjects, however various
      their external hue, so the seat of colour must have existed
      in the <i>Cuticle</i>, or upper surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malphigi, an eminent Italian physician, of the last
      century, was the first person who discovered that the skin
      was divided into three lamina, or parts; the
      <i>Cuticle</i>, the <i>true skin</i>, and a certain
      coagulated substance situated between both, which he
      distinguished by the title of <i>Mucosum Corpus</i>; a
      title retained by anatomists to the present day: which
      coagulated substance adhered so firmly to the
      <i>Cuticle</i>, as, in all former anatomical preparations,
      to have come off with it, and, from this circumstance to
      have led the ancient anatomists to believe, that there were
      but two lamina, or divisible portions in the human skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This discovery was sufficient to ascertain the point in
      question: for it appeared afterwards that the
      <i>Cuticle</i>, when divided according to this discovery
      from the other lamina, was semi-transparent; that the
      cuticle of the blackest negroe was of the same transparency
      and colour, as that of the purest white; and hence, the
      <i>true skins</i> of both being invariably the same, that
      the <i>mucosum corpus</i> was the seat of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has been farther confirmed by all subsequent
      anatomical experiments, by which it appears, that, whatever
      is the colour of this intermediate coagulated substance,
      nearly the same is the apparent colour of the upper surface
      of the skin. Neither can it be otherwise; for the
      <i>Cuticle</i>, from its transparency, must necessarily
      transmit the colour of the substance beneath it, in the
      same manner, though not in the same degree, as the
      <i>cornea</i> transmits the colour of the <i>iris</i> of
      the eye. This transparency is a matter of ocular
      demonstration in white people. It is conspicuous in every
      blush; for no one can imagine, that the cuticle becomes
      red, as often as this happens: nor is it less discoverable
      in the veins, which are so easy to be discerned; for no one
      can suppose, that the blue streaks, which he constantly
      sees in the fairest complexions, are painted, as it were,
      on the surface of the upper skin. From these, and a variety
      of other observations,<a name="FNanchor081"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_081"><sup>[081]</sup></a> no maxim is more true
      in physiology, than that <i>on the mucosum corpus depends
      the colour of the human body</i>; or, in other words, that
      the <i>mucosum corpus</i> being of a different colour in
      different inhabitants of the globe, and appearing through
      the cuticle or upper surface of the skin, gives them that
      various appearance, which strikes us so forcibly in
      contemplating the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this can be incontrovertibly ascertained, it is evident,
      that whatever causes cooperate in producing this different
      appearance, they produce it by acting upon the <i>mucosum
      corpus</i>, which, from the almost incredible manner in
      which the cuticle<a name="FNanchor082"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_082"><sup>[082]</sup></a> is perforated, is as
      accessible as the cuticle itself. These causes are probably
      those various qualities of things, which, combined with the
      influence of the sun, contribute to form what we call
      <i>climate</i>. For when any person considers, that the
      mucous substance, before-mentioned, is found to vary in its
      colour, as the <i>climates</i> vary from the equator to the
      poles, his mind must be instantly struck with the
      hypothesis, and he must adopt it without any hesitation, as
      the genuine cause of the ph&aelig;nomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fact,<a name="FNanchor083"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_083"><sup>[083]</sup></a> <i>of the variation
      of the mucous substance according to the situation of the
      place</i>, has been clearly ascertained in the numerous
      anatomical experiments that have been made; in which,
      subjects of all nations have come under consideration. The
      natives of many of the kingdoms and isles of <i>Asia</i>,
      are found to have their <i>corpus mucosum</i> black. Those
      of <i>Africa</i>, situated near the line, of the same
      colour. Those of the maritime parts of the same continent,
      of a dusky brown, nearly approaching to it; and the colour
      becomes lighter or darker in proportion as the distance
      from the equator is either greater or less. The Europeans
      are the fairest inhabitants of the world. Those situated in
      the most southern regions of <i>Europe</i>, have in their
      <i>corpus mucosum</i> a tinge of the dark hue of their
      <i>African</i> neighbours: hence the epidemick complexion,
      prevalent among them, is nearly of the colour of the
      pickled Spanish olive; while in this country, and those
      situated nearer the north pole, it appears to be nearly, if
      not absolutely, white.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are facts,<a name="FNanchor084"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_084"><sup>[084]</sup></a> which anatomy has
      established; and we acknowledge them to be such, that we
      cannot divest ourselves of the idea, that <i>climate</i>
      has a considerable share in producing a difference of
      colour. Others, we know, have invented other hypotheses,
      but all of them have been instantly refuted, as unable to
      explain the difficulties for which they were advanced, and
      as absolutely contrary to fact: and the inventors
      themselves have been obliged, almost as soon as they have
      proposed them, to acknowledge them deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only objection of any consequence, that has ever been
      made to the hypothesis of <i>climate</i>, is this, <i>that
      people under the same parallels are not exactly of the same
      colour</i>. But this is no objection in fact: for it does
      not follow that those countries, which are at an equal
      distance from the equator, should have their climates the
      same. Indeed nothing is more contrary to experience than
      this. Climate depends upon a variety of accidents. High
      mountains, in the neighbourhood of a place, make it cooler,
      by chilling the air that is carried over them by the winds.
      Large spreading succulent plants, if among the productions
      of the soil, have the same effect: they afford agreeable
      cooling shades, and a moist atmosphere from their continual
      exhalations, by which the ardour of the sun is considerably
      abated. While the soil, on the other hand, if of a sandy
      nature, retains the heat in an uncommon degree, and makes
      the summers considerably hotter than those which are found
      to exist in the same latitude, where the soil is different.
      To this proximity of what may be termed <i>burning
      sands</i>, and to the sulphurous and metallick particles,
      which are continually exhaling from the bowels of the
      earth, is ascribed the different degree of blackness, by
      which some <i>African</i> nations are distinguishable from
      each other, though under the same parallels. To these
      observations we may add, that though the inhabitants of the
      same parallel are not exactly of the same hue, yet they
      differ only by shades of the same colour; or, to speak with
      more precision, that there are no two people, in such a
      situation, one of whom is white, and the other black. To
      sum up the whole-Suppose we were to take a common globe; to
      begin at the equator; to paint every country along the
      meridian line in succession from thence to the poles; and
      to paint them with the same colour which prevails in the
      respective inhabitants of each, we should see the black,
      with which we had been obliged to begin, insensibly
      changing to an olive, and the olive, through as many
      intermediate colours, to a white: and if, on the other
      hand, we should complete any one of the parallels according
      to the same plan, we should see a difference perhaps in the
      appearance of some of the countries through which it ran,
      though the difference would consist wholly in shades of the
      same colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument therefore, which is brought against the
      hypothesis, is so far from being, an objection, that we
      shall consider it one of the first arguments in its favour:
      for if <i>climate</i> has really an influence on the
      <i>mucous substance</i> of the body, it is evident, that we
      must not only expect to see a gradation of colour in the
      inhabitants from the equator to the poles, but also
      different<a name="FNanchor085"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_085"><sup>[085]</sup></a> shades of the same
      colour in the inhabitants of the same parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this argument, we shall add one that is
      incontrovertible, which is, that when the <i>black</i>
      inhabitants of <i>Africa</i> are transplanted to
      <i>colder</i>, or the <i>white</i> inhabitants of
      <i>Europe</i> to <i>hotter</i> climates, their children,
      <i>born there</i>, are of a <i>different colour from
      themselves</i>; that is, lighter in the first, and darker
      in the second instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a proof of the first, we shall give the words of the
      Abb&eacute; Raynal,<a name="FNanchor086"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_086"><sup>[086]</sup></a> in his admired
      publication. "The children," says he, "which they, (the
      <i>Africans</i>) procreate in <i>America</i>, are not so
      black as their parents were. After each generation the
      difference becomes more palpable. It is possible, that
      after a numerous succession of generations, the men come
      from <i>Africa</i> would not be distinguished from those of
      the country, into which they may have been transplanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      This circumstance we have had the pleasure of hearing
      confirmed by a variety of persons, who have been witnesses
      of the fact; but particularly by many intelligent<a name=
      "FNanchor087"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_087"><sup>[087]</sup></a> Africans, who have
      been parents themselves in <i>America</i>, and who have
      declared that the difference is so palpable in the
      <i>northern provinces</i>, that not only they themselves
      have constantly observed it, but that they have heard it
      observed by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither is this variation in the children from the colour
      of their parents improbable. <i>The children of the
      blackest Africans are born white.</i><a name=
      "FNanchor088"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_088"><sup>[088]</sup></a> In this state they
      continue for about a month, when they change to a pale
      yellow. In process of time they become brown. Their skin
      still continues to increase in darkness with their age,
      till it becomes of a dirty, sallow black, and at length,
      after a certain period of years, glossy and shining. Now,
      if climate has any influence on the <i>mucous substance</i>
      of the body, this variation in the children from the colour
      of their parents is an event, which must be reasonably
      expected: for being born white, and not having equally
      powerful causes to act upon them in colder, as their
      parents had in the hotter climates which they left, it must
      necessarily follow, that the same affect cannot possibly be
      produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence also, if the hypothesis be admitted, may be deduced
      the reason, why even those children, who have been brought
      from their country at an early age into colder regions,
      have been observed<a name="FNanchor089"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_089"><sup>[089]</sup></a> to be of a lighter
      colour than those who have remained at home till they
      arrived at a state of manhood. For having undergone some of
      the changes which we mentioned to have attended their
      countrymen from infancy to a certain age, and having been
      taken away before the rest could be completed, these
      farther changes, which would have taken place had they
      remained at home, seem either to have been checked in their
      progress, or weakened in their degree, by a colder climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We come now to the second and opposite case; for a proof of
      which we shall appeal to the words of Dr. Mitchell,<a name=
      "FNanchor090"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_090"><sup>[090]</sup></a> in the Philosophical
      Transactions. "The <i>Spaniards</i> who have inhabited
      <i>America</i> under the torrid zone for any time, are
      become as dark coloured as our native <i>Indians</i> of
      <i>Virginia</i>, of which, <i>I myself have been a
      witness</i>; and were they not to intermarry with the
      <i>Europeans</i>, but lead the same rude and barbarous
      lives with the <i>Indians</i>, it is very probable that, in
      a succession of many generations, they would become as dark
      in complexion."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this instance we shall add one, which is mentioned by a
      late writer,<a name="FNanchor091"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_091"><sup>[091]</sup></a> who describing the
      <i>African</i> coast, and the <i>European</i> settlements
      there, has the following passage. "There are several other
      small <i>Portuguese</i> settlements, and one of some note
      at <i>Mitomba</i>, a river in <i>Sierra Leon</i>. The
      people here called <i>Portuguese</i>, are principally
      persons bred from a mixture of the first <i>Portuguese
      discoverers</i> with the natives, and now become, in their
      <i>complexion</i> and <i>woolly quality</i> of their hair,
      <i>perfect negroes</i>, retaining however a smattering of
      the <i>Portuguese</i> language."
    </p>
    <p>
      These facts, with respect to the colonists of the
      <i>Europeans</i>, are of the highest importance in the
      present case, and deserve a serious attention. For when we
      know to a certainty from whom they are descended; when we
      know that they were, at the time of their transplantation,
      of the same colour as those from whom they severally
      sprung; and when, on the other hand, we are credibly
      informed, that they have changed it for the native colour
      of the place which they now inhabit; the evidence in
      support of these facts is as great, as if a person, on the
      removal of two or three families into another climate, had
      determined to ascertain the circumstance; as if he had gone
      with them and watched their children; as if he had
      communicated his observations at his death to a successor;
      as if his successor had prosecuted the plan, and thus an
      uninterrupted chain of evidence had been kept up from their
      first removal to any determined period of succeeding time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though these facts seem sufficient of themselves to
      confirm our opinion, they are not the only facts which can
      be adduced in its support. It can be shewn, that the
      members of the <i>very same family</i>, when divided from
      each other, and removed into different countries, have not
      only changed their family complexion, but that they have
      changed it to <i>as many different colours</i> as they have
      gone into <i>different regions of the world</i>. We cannot
      have, perhaps, a more striking instance of this, than in
      the <i>Jews</i>. These people, are scattered over the face
      of the whole earth. They have preserved themselves distinct
      from the rest of the world by their religion; and, as they
      never intermarry with any but those of their own sect, so
      they have no mixture of blood in their veins, that they
      should differ from each other: and yet nothing is more
      true, than that the <i>English Jew</i><a name=
      "FNanchor092"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_092"><sup>[092]</sup></a> is white, the
      <i>Portuguese</i> swarthy, the <i>Armenian</i> olive, and
      the <i>Arabian</i> copper; in short, that there appear to
      be as many different species of <i>Jews</i>, as there are
      countries in which they reside.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these facts we shall add the following observation, that
      if we can give credit to the ancient historians in general,
      a change from the darkest black to the purest white must
      have actually been accomplished. One instance, perhaps, may
      be thought sufficient. <i>Herodotus</i><a name=
      "FNanchor093"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_093"><sup>[093]</sup></a> relates, that the
      <i>Colchi were black</i>, and that they had <i>crisped
      hair</i>. These people were a detachment of the
      <i>&AElig;thiopian</i> army under <i>Sesostris</i>, who
      followed him in his expedition, and settled in that part of
      the world, where <i>Colchis</i> is usually represented to
      have been situated. Had not the same author informed us of
      this circumstance, we should have thought it strange<a name=
      "FNanchor094">, </a><a href="#Footnote_094"><sup>[094]</sup></a>
      that a people of this
      description should have been found in such a latitude. Now
      as they were undoubtedly settled there, and as they were
      neither so totally destroyed, nor made any such rapid
      conquests, as that history should notice the event, there
      is great reason to presume, that their descendants
      continued in the same, or settled in the adjacent country;
      from whence it will follow, that they must have changed
      their complexion to that, which is observable in the
      inhabitants of this particular region at the present day;
      or, in other words, that the <i>black inhabitant of
      Colchis</i> must have been changed into the <i>fair
      Circassian</i>.<a name="FNanchor095"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_095"><sup>[095]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have now shewn it to be highly probable, from the
      facts which have been advanced, that climate is the cause
      of the difference of colour which prevails in the different
      inhabitants of the globe, we shall now shew its probability
      from so similar an effect produced on the <i>mucous
      substance</i> before-mentioned by so similar a cause, that
      though the fact does not absolutely prove our conjecture to
      be right, yet it will give us a very lively conception of
      the manner, in which the ph&aelig;nomenon may be caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      This probability may be shewn in the case of
      <i>freckles</i>, which are to be seen in the face of
      children, but of such only, as have the thinnest and most
      transparent skins, and are occasioned by the rays of the
      sun, striking forcibly on the <i>mucous substance</i> of
      the face, and drying the accumulating fluid. This
      accumulating fluid, or perspirable matter, is at first
      colourless; but being exposed to violent heat, or dried,
      becomes brown. Hence, the <i>mucosum corpus</i> being
      tinged in various parts by this brown coagulated fluid, and
      the parts so tinged appearing through the <i>cuticle</i>,
      or upper surface of the skin, arises that spotted
      appearance, observable in the case recited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if we were to conceive a black skin to be an
      <i>universal freckle</i>, or the rays of the sun to act so
      universally on the <i>mucous substance</i> of a person's
      face, as to produce these spots so contiguous to each other
      that they should unite, we should then see, in imagination,
      a face similar to those, which are daily to be seen among
      black people: and if we were to conceive his body to be
      exposed or acted upon in the same manner, we should then
      see his body assuming a similar appearance; and thus we
      should see the whole man of a perfect black, or resembling
      one of the naked inhabitants of the torrid zone. Now as the
      feat of freckles and of blackness is the same; as their
      appearance is similar; and as the cause of the first is the
      ardour of the sun, it is therefore probable that the cause
      of the second is the same: hence, if we substitute for the
      word "<i>sun</i>," what is analogous to it, the word
      <i>climate</i>, the same effect may be supposed to be
      produced, and the conjecture to receive a sanction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it unlikely that the hypothesis, which considers the
      cause of freckles and of blackness as the same, may be
      right. For if blackness is occasioned by the rays of the
      sun striking forcibly and universally on the <i>mucous
      substance</i> of the body, and drying the accumulating
      fluid, we can account for the different degrees of it to be
      found in the different inhabitants of the globe. For as the
      quantity of perspirable fluid, and the force of the solar
      rays is successively increased, as the climates are
      successively warmer, from any given parallel to the line,
      it follows that the fluid, with which the <i>mucous
      substance</i> will be stained, will be successively thicker
      and deeper coloured; and hence, as it appears through the
      cuticle, the complexion successively darker; or, what
      amounts to the same thing, there will be a difference of
      colour in the inhabitants of every successive parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these, and the whole of the preceding observations on
      the subject, we may conclude, that as all the inhabitants
      of the earth cannot be otherwise than the children of the
      same parents, and as the difference of their appearance
      must have of course proceeded from incidental causes, these
      causes are a combination of those qualities, which we call
      <i>climate</i>; that the blackness of the <i>Africans</i>
      is so far ingrafted in their constitution, in a course of
      many generations, that their children wholly inherit it, if
      brought up in the same spot, but that it is not so
      absolutely interwoven in their nature, that it cannot be
      removed, if they are born and settled in another; that
      <i>Noah</i> and his sons were probably of an <i>olive</i>
      complexion; that those of their descendants, who went
      farther to the south, became of a deeper olive or
      <i>copper</i>; while those, who went still farther, became
      of a deeper copper or <i>black</i>; that those, on the
      other hand, who travelled farther to the north, became less
      olive or <i>brown</i>, while those who went still farther
      than the former, became less brown or <i>white</i>; and
      that if any man were to point out any one of the colours
      which prevails in the human complexion, as likely to
      furnish an argument, that the people of such a complexion
      were of a different species from the rest, it is probable
      that his own descendants, if removed to the climate to
      which this complexion is peculiar, would, in the course of
      a few generations, degenerate into the same colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now replied to the argument, "that the Africans are
      an inferiour link of the chain of nature," as far as it
      depended on their <i>capacity</i> and <i>colour</i>, we
      shall now only take notice of an expression, which the
      <i>receivers</i> before-mentioned are pleased to make use
      of, "that they are made for slavery."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the Africans been <i>made for slavery</i>, or to become
      the property of any society of men, it is clear, from the
      observations that have been made in the second part of this
      Essay, that they must have been created <i>devoid of
      reason</i>: but this is contrary to fact. It is clear also,
      that there must have been, many and evident signs of the
      <i>inferiority of their nature</i>, and that this society
      of men must have had a <i>natural right</i> to their
      dominion: but this is equally false. No such signs of
      <i>inferiority</i> are to be found in the one, and the
      right to dominion in the other is <i>incidental</i>: for in
      what volume of nature or religion is it written, that one
      society of men should <i>breed slaves</i> for the benefit,
      of another? Nor is it less evident that they would have
      wanted many of those qualities which they have, and which
      brutes have not: they would have wanted that <i>spirit of
      liberty</i>, that <i>sense of ignominy and shame,</i><a
      name="FNanchor096"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_096"><sup>[096]</sup></a> which so frequently
      drives them to the horrid extremity of finishing their own
      existence. Nor would they have been endowed with a
      <i>contemplative power</i>; for such a power would have
      been unnecessary to people in such a situation; or rather,
      its only use could have been to increase their pain. We
      cannot suppose therefore that God has made an order of
      beings, with such mental qualities and powers, for the sole
      purpose of being used as <i>beasts</i>, or
      <i>instruments</i> of labour. And here, what a dreadful
      argument presents itself against you <i>receivers</i>? For
      if they have no understandings as you confess, then is your
      conduct impious, because, as they cannot perceive the
      intention of your punishment, your severities cannot make
      them better. But if, on the other hand, they have had
      understandings, (which has evidently appeared) then is your
      conduct equally impious, who, by destroying their faculties
      by the severity of your discipline, have reduced men; who
      had once the power of reason, to an equality with the brute
      creation.

    <p>
      The reader may perhaps think, that the <i>receivers</i>
      have by this time expended all their arguments, but their
      store is not so easily exhausted. They are well aware that
      justice, nature, and religion, will continue, as they have
      ever uniformly done, to oppose their conduct. This has
      driven them to exert their ingenuity, and has occasioned
      that multiplicity of arguments to be found in the present
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arguments are of a different complexion from the
      former. They consist in comparing the state of
      <i>slaves</i> with that of some of the classes of
      <i>free</i> men, and in certain scenes of felicity, which
      the former are said to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is affirmed that the punishments which the Africans
      undergo, are less severe than the military; that their life
      is happier than that of the English peasant; that they have
      the advantages of manumission; that they have their little
      spots of ground, their holy-days, their dances; in short,
      that their life is a scene of festivity and mirth, and that
      they are much happier in the colonies than in their own
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      These representations, which have been made out with much
      ingenuity and art, may have had their weight with the
      unwary; but they will never pass with men of consideration
      and sense, who are accustomed to estimate the probability
      of things, before they admit them to be true. Indeed the
      bare assertion, that their situation is even comfortable,
      contains its own refutation, or at least leads us to
      suspect that the person, who asserted it, has omitted some
      important considerations in the account. Such we shall shew
      to have been actually the case, and that the
      representations of the <i>receivers</i>, when stripped of
      their glossy ornaments, are but empty declamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said, first, of <i>military punishments</i>, that
      they are more severe than those which the <i>Africans</i>
      undergo. But this is a bare assertion without a proof. It
      is not shewn even by those, who assert it, how the fact can
      be made out. We are left therefore to draw the comparison
      ourselves, and to fill up those important considerations,
      which we have just said that the <i>receivers</i> had
      omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That military punishments are severe we confess, but we
      deny that they are severer than those with which they are
      compared. Where is the military man, whose ears have been
      slit, whose limbs have been mutilated, or whose eyes have
      been beaten out? But let us even allow, that their
      punishments are equal in the degree of their severity:
      still they must lose by comparison. The soldier is never
      punished but after a fair and equitable trial, and the
      decision of a military court; the unhappy African, at the
      discretion of his Lord. The one knows what particular
      conduct will constitute an offence;<a name=
      "FNanchor097"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_097"><sup>[097]</sup></a> the other has no such
      information, as he is wholly at the disposal of passion and
      caprice, which may impose upon any action, however
      laudable, the appellation of a crime. The former has it of
      course in his power to avoid a punishment; the latter is
      never safe. The former is punished for a real, the latter,
      often, for an imaginary fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now will any person assert, on comparing the whole of those
      circumstances together, which relate to their respective
      punishments, that there can be any doubt, which of the two
      are in the worst situation, as to their penal systems?
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the declaration, that the life of an
      <i>African</i> in the colonies is happier than that of an
      <i>English</i> peasant, it is equally false. Indeed we can
      scarcely withhold our indignation, when we consider, how
      shamefully the situation of this latter class of men has
      been misrepresented, to elevate the former to a state of
      fictitious happiness. If the representations of the
      <i>receivers</i> be true, it is evident that those of the
      most approved writers, who have placed a considerable share
      of happiness in the <i>cottage</i>, have been mistaken in
      their opinion; and that those of the rich, who have been
      heard to sigh, and envy the felicity of the <i>peasant</i>,
      have been treacherous to their own sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But which are we to believe on the occasion? Those, who
      endeavour to dress <i>vice</i> in the habit of
      <i>virtue</i>, or those, who derive their opinion from
      their own feelings? The latter are surely to be believed;
      and we may conclude therefore, that the horrid picture
      which is given of the life of the <i>peasant</i>, has not
      so just a foundation as the <i>receivers</i> would, lead us
      to suppose. For has he no pleasure in the thought, that he
      lives in his <i>own country</i>, and among his relations
      and friends? That he is actually <i>free</i>, and that his
      children will be the same? That he can never be <i>sold</i>
      as a beast? That he can speak his mind <i>without the fear
      of the lash</i>? That he cannot even be struck <i>with
      impunity</i>? And that he partakes, equally with his
      superiours, of the <i>protection of the law</i>?-Now, there
      is no one of these advantages which the <i>African</i>
      possesses, and no one, which the defenders of slavery take
      into their account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the other comparisons that are usually made, we may
      observe in general, that, as they consist in comparing the
      iniquitous practice of slavery with other iniquitous
      practices in force among other nations, they can neither
      raise it to the appearance of virtue, nor extenuate its
      guilt. The things compared are in these instances both of
      them evils alike. They call equally for redress,<a name=
      "FNanchor098"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_098"><sup>[098]</sup></a> and are equally
      disgraceful to the governments which suffer them, if not
      encourage them, to exist. To attempt therefore to justify
      one species of iniquity by comparing it with another, is no
      justification at all; and is so far from answering the
      purpose, for which the comparison is intended, as to give
      us reason to suspect, that the <i>comparer</i> has but
      little notion either of equity or honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      We come now to those scenes of felicity, which slaves are
      said to enjoy. The first advantage which they are said to
      experience, is that of <i>manumission</i>. But here the
      advocates for slavery conceal an important circumstance.
      They expatiate indeed on the charms of freedom, and contend
      that it must be a blessing in the eyes of those, upon whom
      it is conferred. We perfectly agree with them in this
      particular. But they do not tell us that these advantages
      are <i>confined</i>; that they are confined to some
      <i>favourite domestick</i>; that not <i>one in an
      hundred</i> enjoy them; and that they are <i>never</i>
      extended to those, who are employed in the <i>cultivation
      of the field</i>, as long as they can work. These are they,
      who are most to be pitied, who are destined to
      <i>perpetual</i> drudgery; and of whom <i>no one
      whatever</i> has a chance of being freed from his
      situation, till death either releases him at once, or age
      renders him incapable of continuing his former labour. And
      here let it be remarked, <i>to the disgrace of the
      receivers</i>, that he is then made free, not-<i>as a
      reward for his past services</i>, but, as his labour is
      then of little or no value,-<i>to save the tax.</i><a name=
      "FNanchor099"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_099"><sup>[099]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the same artifice is mention also made of the little
      spots, or <i>gardens</i>, as they are called, which slaves
      are said to possess from the <i>liberality</i> of <i>the
      receivers</i>. But people must not be led away by agreeable
      and pleasant sounds. They must not suppose that these
      gardens are made for <i>flowers</i>; or that they are
      places of <i>amusement</i>, in which they can spend their
      time in botanical researches and delights. Alas, they do
      not furnish them with a theme for such pleasing pursuits
      and speculations! They must be cultivated in those hours,
      which ought to be appropriated to rest;<a name=
      "FNanchor100"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> and they must be
      cultivated, not for an amusement, but to make up, <i>if it
      be possible</i>, the great deficiency in their weekly
      allowance of provisions. Hence it appears, that the
      <i>receivers</i> have no merit whatever in such an
      appropriation of land to their unfortunate slaves: for they
      are either under the necessity of doing this, or of
      <i>losing</i> them by the jaws of famine. And it is a
      notorious fact, that, with their weekly allowance, and the
      produce of their spots together, it is often with the
      greatest difficulty that they preserve a wretched
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third advantage which they are said to experience, is
      that of <i>holy-days</i>, or days of respite from their
      usual discipline and fatigue. This is certainly a great
      indulgence, and ought to be recorded to the immortal honour
      of the <i>receivers</i>. We wish we could express their
      liberality in those handsome terms, in which it deserves to
      be represented, or applaud them sufficiently for deviating
      for once from the rigours of servile discipline. But we
      confess, that we are unequal to the task, and must
      therefore content ourselves with observing, that while the
      horse has <i>one</i> day in <i>seven</i> to refresh his
      limbs, the happy <i>African</i><a name="FNanchor101"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> has but
      <i>one</i> in <i>fifty-two</i>, as a relaxation from his
      labours.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to their <i>dances</i>, on which such a
      particular stress has been generally laid, we fear that
      people may have been as shamefully deceived, as in the
      former instances. For from the manner in which these are
      generally mentioned, we should almost be led to imagine,
      that they had certain hours allowed them for the purpose of
      joining in the dance, and that they had every comfort and
      convenience, that people are generally supposed to enjoy on
      such convivial occasions. But this is far from the case.
      Reason informs us, that it can never be. If they wish for
      such innocent recreations, they must enjoy them in the time
      that is allotted them for sleep; and so far are these
      dances from proceeding from any uncommon degree of
      happiness, which excites them to convivial society, that
      they proceed rather from an uncommon depression of spirits,
      which makes them even sacrifice their rest,<a name=
      "FNanchor102"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> for the sake of
      experiencing for a moment a more joyful oblivion of their
      cares. For suppose any one of the <i>receivers</i>, in the
      middle of a dance, were to address his slaves in the
      following manner: "<i>Africans!</i> I begin at last to feel
      for your situation; and my conscience is severely hurt,
      whenever I reflect that I have been reducing those to a
      state of misery and pain, who have never given me offence.
      You seem to be fond of these exercises, but yet you are
      obliged to take them at such unseasonable hours, that they
      impair your health, which is sufficiently broken by the
      intolerable share of labour which I have hitherto imposed
      upon you. I will therefore make you a proposal. Will you be
      content to live in the colonies, and you shall have the
      half of every week entirely to yourselves? or will you
      choose to return to your miserable, wretched country?"-But
      what is that which strikes their ears? Which makes them
      motionless in an instant? Which interrupts the festive
      scene?-their country?-transporting sound!-Behold! they are
      now flying from the dance: you may see them running to the
      shore, and, frantick as it were with joy, demanding with
      open arms an instantaneous passage to their beloved native
      plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the <i>colonial delights</i>, by the
      representation of which the <i>receivers</i> would persuade
      us, that the <i>Africans</i> are taken from their country
      to a region of conviviality and mirth; and that like those,
      who leave their usual places of residence for a summer's
      amusement, they are conveyed to the colonies-<i>to
      bathe</i>,-<i>to dance</i>,-<i>to keep holy-day</i>,-<i>to
      be jovial</i>.-But there is something so truly ridiculous
      in the attempt to impose these scenes of felicity on the
      publick, as scenes which fall to the lot of slaves, that
      the <i>receivers</i> must have been driven to great
      extremities, to hazard them to the eye of censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last point that remains to be considered, is the
      shameful assertion, that the <i>Africans</i> are much
      <i>happier in the colonies, than in their own country</i>.
      But in what does this superiour happiness consist? In those
      real scenes, it must be replied, which have been just
      mentioned; for these, by the confession of the receivers,
      constitute the happiness they enjoy.-But it has been shewn
      that these have been unfairly represented; and, were they
      realized in the most extensive latitude, they would not
      confirm the fact. For if, upon a recapitulation, it
      consists in the pleasure of <i>manumission</i>, they surely
      must have passed their lives in a much more comfortable
      manner, who, like the <i>Africans at home</i>, have had no
      occasion for such a benefit at all. But the
      <i>receivers</i>, we presume, reason upon this principle,
      that we never know the value of a blessing but by its loss.
      This is generally true: but would any one of them make
      himself a <i>slave</i> for years, that he might run the
      chance of the pleasures of <i>manumission</i>? Or that he
      might taste the charms of liberty with <i>a greater
      relish</i>? Nor is the assertion less false in every other
      consideration. For if their happiness consists in the few
      <i>holy-days</i>, which <i>in the colonies</i> they are
      permitted to enjoy, what must be their situation <i>in
      their own country</i>, where the whole year is but one
      continued holy-day, or cessation from discipline and
      fatigue?-If in the possession of <i>a mean and contracted
      spot</i>, what must be their situation, where a whole
      region is their own, producing almost spontaneously the
      comforts of life, and requiring for its cultivation none of
      those hours, which should be appropriated to
      <i>sleep</i>?-If in the pleasures of the <i>colonial
      dance</i>, what must it be in <i>their own country</i>,
      where they may dance for ever; where there is no stated
      hour to interrupt their felicity, no intolerable labour
      immediately to succeed their recreations, and no overseer
      to receive them under the discipline of the lash?-If these
      therefore are the only circumstances, by which the
      assertion can be proved, we may venture to say, without
      fear of opposition, that it can never be proved at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these are not the only circumstances. It is said that
      they are barbarous at home.-But do you <i>receivers</i>
      civilize them?-Your unwillingness to convert them to
      Christianity, because you suppose you must use them more
      kindly when converted, is but a bad argument in favour of
      the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is affirmed again, that their manner of life, and their
      situation is such in their own country, that to say they
      are happy is a jest. "But who are you, who pretend to
      judge<a name="FNanchor103"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> of another man's
      happiness? That state which each man, under the guidance of
      his maker, forms for himself, and not one man for another?
      To know what constitutes mine or your happiness, is the
      sole prerogative of him who created us, and cast us in so
      various and different moulds. Did your slaves ever complain
      to you of their unhappiness, amidst their native woods and
      desarts? Or, rather, let me ask, did they ever cease
      complaining of their condition under you their lordly
      masters? Where they see, indeed, the accommodations of
      civil life, but see them all pass to others, themselves
      unbenefited by them. Be so gracious then, ye petty tyrants
      over human freedom, to let your slaves judge for
      themselves, what it is which makes their own happiness, and
      then see whether they do not place it <i>in the return to
      their own country</i>, rather than in the contemplation of
      your grandeur, of which their misery makes so large a
      part."
    </p>
    <p>
      But since you speak with so much confidence on the subject,
      let us ask you <i>receivers</i> again, if you have ever
      been informed by your unfortunate slaves, that they had no
      connexions in the country from which they have forcibly
      been torn away: or, if you will take upon you to assert,
      that they never sigh, when they are alone; or that they
      never relate to each other their tales of misery and woe.
      But you judge of them, perhaps, in an happy moment, when
      you are dealing out to them their provisions for the week;
      and are but little aware, that, though the countenance may
      be cheered with a momentary smile, the heart may be
      exquisitely tortured. Were you to shew us, indeed, that
      there are laws, subject to no evasion, by which you are
      obliged to clothe and feed them in a comfortable manner;
      were you to shew us that they are protected<a name=
      "FNanchor104"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> at all; or that even
      <i>one</i> in a <i>thousand</i> of those masters have
      suffered death,<a name="FNanchor105"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> who have been guilty
      of <i>premeditated</i> murder to their slaves, you would
      have a better claim to our belief: but you can neither
      produce the instances nor the laws. The people, of whom you
      speak, are <i>slaves</i>, are your own <i>property</i>, are
      wholly <i>at your own disposal</i>; and this idea is
      sufficient to overturn your assertions of their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we shall now mention a circumstance, which, in the
      present case, will have more weight than all the arguments
      which have hitherto been advanced. It is an opinion, which
      the <i>Africans</i> universally entertain, that, as soon as
      death shall release them from the hands of their
      oppressors, they shall immediately be wafted back to their
      native plains, there to exist again, to enjoy the sight of
      their beloved countrymen, and to spend the whole of their
      new existence in scenes of tranquillity and delight; and so
      powerfully does this notion operate upon them, as to drive
      them frequently to the horrid extremity of putting a period
      to their lives. Now if these suicides are frequent, (which
      no person can deny) what are they but a proof, that the
      situation of those who destroy themselves must have been
      insupportably wretched: and if the thought of returning to
      their country after death, <i>when they have experienced
      the colonial joys</i>, constitutes their supreme felicity,
      what are they but a proof, that they think there is as much
      difference between the two situations, as there is between
      misery and delight?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is the assertion of the <i>receivers</i> less liable to
      a refutation in the instance of those, who terminate their
      own existence, than of those, whom nature releases from
      their persecutions. They die with a smile upon their face,
      and their funerals are attended by a vast concourse of
      their countrymen, with every possible demonstration of
      joy.<a name="FNanchor106"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> But why this unusual
      mirth, if their departed brother has left an happy place?
      Or if he has been taken from the care of an indulgent
      master, who consulted his pleasures, and administered to
      his wants? But alas, it arises from hence, that <i>he is
      gone to his happy country</i>: a circumstance, sufficient
      of itself, to silence a myriad of those specious arguments,
      which the imagination has been racked, and will always be
      racked to produce, in favour of a system of tyranny and
      oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains only, that we should now conclude the chapter
      with a fact, which will shew that the account, which we
      have given of the situation of slaves, is strictly true,
      and will refute at the same time all the arguments which
      have hitherto been, and may yet be brought by the
      <i>receivers</i>, to prove that their treatment is humane.
      In one of the western colonies of the Europeans, <a name=
      "FNanchor107"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>six hundred and fifty
      thousand slaves were imported within an hundred years; at
      the expiration of which time, their whole posterity were
      found to amount to one hundred and forty thousand. This
      fact will ascertain the treatment of itself. For how
      shamefully must these unfortunate people have been
      oppressed? What a dreadful havock must famine, fatigue, and
      cruelty, have made among them, when we consider, that the
      descendants of <i>six hundred and fifty thousand</i> people
      in the prime of life, gradually imported within a century,
      are less numerous than those, which only <i>ten
      thousand</i><a name="FNanchor108"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> would have produced in
      the same period, under common advantages, and in a country
      congenial to their constitutions?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the <i>receivers</i> have probably great merit on the
      occasion. Let us therefore set it down to their humanity.
      Let us suppose for once, that this incredible waste of the
      human species proceeds from a benevolent design; that,
      sensible of the miseries of a servile state, they resolve
      to wear out, as fast as they possibly can, their
      unfortunate slaves, that their miseries may the sooner end,
      and that a wretched posterity may be prevented from sharing
      their parental condition. Now, whether this is the plan of
      reasoning which the <i>receivers</i> adopt, we cannot take
      upon us to decide; but true it is, that the effect produced
      is exactly the same, as if they had reasoned wholly on this
      <i>benevolent</i> principle.

    <h2>
      <a href="#PART_III.">CHAP. X.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      We have now taken a survey of the treatment which the
      unfortunate <i>Africans</i> undergo, when they are put into
      the hands of the <i>receivers</i>. This treatment, by the
      four first chapters of the present part of this Essay,
      appears to be wholly insupportable, and to be such as no
      human being can apply to another, without the imputation of
      such crimes, as should make him tremble. But as many
      arguments are usually advanced by those who have any
      interest in the practice, by which they would either
      exculpate the treatment, or diminish its severity, we
      allotted the remaining chapters for their discussion. In
      these we considered the probability of such a treatment
      against the motives of interest; the credit that was to be
      given to those disinterested writers on the subject, who
      have recorded particular instances of barbarity; the
      inferiority of the <i>Africans</i> to the human species;
      the comparisons that are generally made with respect to
      their situation; the positive scenes of felicity which they
      are said to enjoy, and every other argument, in short, that
      we have found to have ever been advanced in the defence of
      slavery. These have been all considered, and we may venture
      to pronounce, that, instead of answering the purpose for
      which they were intended, they serve only to bring such
      circumstances to light, as clearly shew, that if ingenuity
      were racked to invent a situation, that would be the most
      distressing and insupportable to the human race; it could
      never invent one, that would suit the description better,
      than the-<i>colonial slavery</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this then be the case, and if slaves, notwithstanding
      all the arguments to the contrary, are exquisitely
      miserable, we ask you <i>receivers, by what right</i> you
      reduce them to so wretched a situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      You reply, that you <i>buy them</i>; that your <i>money</i>
      constitutes your <i>right</i>, and that, like all other
      things which you purchase, they are wholly at your own
      disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this principle alone it was, that we professed to view
      your treatment, or examine your right, when we said, that
      "the question<a name="FNanchor109"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> resolved itself into
      two separate parts for discussion; into the <i>African</i>
      commerce, as explained in the history of slavery, and the
      subsequent slavery in the colonies, <i>as founded on the
      equity of the commerce</i>." Now, since it appears that
      this commerce, upon the fullest investigation, is contrary
      to "<i>the principles<a name="FNanchor110"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> of law and government,
      the dictates of reason, the common maxims of equity, the
      laws of nature, the admonitions of conscience, and, in
      short, the whole doctrine of natural religion</i>," it is
      evident that the <i>right</i>, which is founded upon it,
      must be the same; and that if those things only are lawful
      in the sight of God, which are either virtuous in
      themselves, or proceed from virtuous principles, you
      <i>have no right over them at all</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You yourselves also confess this. For when we ask you,
      whether any human being has a right to sell you, you
      immediately answer, No; as if nature revolted at the
      thought, and as if it was so contradictory to your own
      feelings, as not to require consideration. But who are you,
      that have this exclusive charter of trading in the
      liberties of mankind? When did nature, or rather the Author
      of nature, make so partial a distinction between you and
      them? When did He say, that you should have the privilege
      of selling others, and that others should not have the
      privilege of selling you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now since you confess, that no person whatever has a right
      to dispose of you in this manner, you must confess also,
      that those things are unlawful to be done to you, which are
      usually done in consequence of the sale. Let us suppose
      then, that in consequence of the <i>commerce</i> you were
      forced into a ship; that you were conveyed to another
      country; that you were sold there; that you were confined
      to incessant labour; that you were pinched by continual
      hunger and thirst; and subject to be whipped, cut, and
      mangled at discretion, and all this at the hands of those,
      whom you had never offended; would you not think that you
      had a right to resist their treatment? Would you not resist
      it with a safe conscience? And would you not be surprized,
      if your resistance should be termed rebellion?-By the
      former premises you must answer, yes.-Such then is the case
      with the wretched <i>Africans</i>. They have a right to
      resist your proceedings. They can resist them, and yet they
      cannot justly be considered as rebellious. For though we
      suppose them to have been guilty of crimes to one another;
      though we suppose them to have been the most abandoned and
      execrable of men, yet are they perfectly innocent with
      respect to you <i>receivers</i>. You have no right to touch
      even the hair of their heads without their own consent. It
      is not your money, that can invest you with a right. Human
      liberty can neither be bought nor sold. Every lash that you
      give them is unjust. It is a lash against nature and
      religion, and will surely stand recorded against you, since
      they are all, with respect to your <i>impious</i> selves,
      in a state of nature; in a state of original dissociation;
      perfectly free.

    <p>
      Having now considered both the <i>commerce</i> and
      <i>slavery</i>, it remains only to collect such arguments
      as are scattered in different parts of the work, and to
      make such additional remarks, as present themselves on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      And first, let us ask you, who have studied the law of
      nature, and you, who are learned in the law of the land, if
      all property must not be inferiour in its nature to its
      possessor, or, in other words, (for it is a case, which
      every person must bring home to his own breast) if you
      suppose that any human being can have <i>a property in
      yourselves</i>? Let us ask you appraisers, who
      scientifically know the value of things, if any human
      creature is equivalent only to any of the trinkets that you
      wear, or at most, to any of the horses that you ride: or in
      other words, if you have ever considered the most costly
      things that you have valued, as <i>equivalent to
      yourselves?</i> Let us ask you rationalists, if man, as a
      reasonable being, is not <i>accountable</i> for his
      actions, and let us put the same question to you, who have
      studied the divine writings? Let us ask you parents, if
      ever you thought that you possessed an <i>authority</i> as
      such, or if ever you expected a <i>duty</i> from your sons;
      and let us ask you sons, if ever you felt an impulse in
      your own breasts to <i>obey</i> your parents. Now, if you
      should all answer as we could wish, if you should all
      answer consistently with reason, nature, and the revealed
      voice of God, what a dreadful argument will present itself
      against the commerce and slavery of the human species, when
      we reflect, that no man whatever can be bought or reduced
      to the situation of a slave, <i>but he must instantly
      become a brute, he must instantly be reduced to the value
      of those things, which were made for his own use and
      convenience; he must instantly cease to be accountable for
      his actions, and his authority as a parent, and his duty as
      a son, must be instantly no more</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither does it escape our notice, when we are speaking of
      the fatal wound which every social duty must receive, how
      considerably Christianity suffers by the conduct of you
      <i>receivers</i>. For by prosecuting this impious commerce,
      you keep the <i>Africans</i> in a state of perpetual
      ferocity and barbarism; and by prosecuting it in such a
      manner, as must represent your religion, as a system of
      robbery and oppression, you not only oppose the propagation
      of the gospel, as far as you are able yourselves, but throw
      the most certain impediments in the way of others, who
      might attempt the glorious and important task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such also is the effect, which the subsequent slavery in
      the colonies must produce. For by your inhuman treatment of
      the unfortunate <i>Africans</i> there, you create the same
      insuperable impediments to a conversion. For how must they
      detest the very name of <i>Christians</i>, when you
      <i>Christians</i> are deformed by so many and dreadful
      vices? How must they detest that system of religion, which
      appears to resist the natural rights of men, and to give a
      sanction to brutality and murder?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as we are now mentioning Christianity, we must pause
      for a little time, to make a few remarks on the arguments
      which are usually deduced from thence by the
      <i>receivers</i>, in defence of their system of oppression.
      For the reader may readily suppose, that, if they did not
      hesitate to bring the <i>Old</i> Testament in support of
      their barbarities, they would hardly let the <i>New</i>
      escape them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>St. Paul</i>, having converted <i>Onesimus</i> to the
      Christian faith, who was a fugitive slave of
      <i>Philemon</i>, sent him back to his master. This
      circumstance has furnished the <i>receivers</i> with a
      plea, that Christianity encourages slavery. But they have
      not only strained the passages which they produce in
      support of their assertions, but are ignorant of historical
      facts. The benevolent apostle, in the letter which he wrote
      to <i>Philemon</i>, the master of <i>Onesimus</i>,
      addresses him to the following effect: "I send him back to
      you, but not in his former capacity,<a name=
      "FNanchor111"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> <i>not now as a
      servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved</i>. In
      this manner I beseech you to receive him, for though I
      could <i>enjoin</i> you to do it, yet I had rather it
      should be a matter of your <i>own will</i>, than of
      <i>necessity</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that the same <i>Onesimus</i>, when he was sent
      back, was no longer <i>a slave</i>, that he was a minister
      of the gospel, that he was joined with <i>Tychicus</i> in
      an ecclesiastical commission to the church of the
      <i>Colossians</i>, and was afterwards bishop of
      <i>Ephesus</i>. If language therefore has any meaning, and
      if history has recorded a fact which may be believed, there
      is no case more opposite to the doctrine of the
      <i>receivers</i>, than this which they produce in its
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said again, that Christianity, among the many
      important precepts which it contains, does not furnish us
      with one for the abolition of slavery. But the reason is
      obvious. Slavery at the time of the introduction of the
      gospel was universally prevalent, and if Christianity had
      abruptly declared, that the millions of slaves should have
      been made free, who were then in the world, it would have
      been universally rejected, as containing doctrines that
      were dangerous, if not destructive, to society. In order
      therefore that it might be universally received, it never
      meddled, by any positive precept, with the civil
      institutions of the times; but though it does not expressly
      say, that "you shall neither buy, nor sell, nor possess a
      slave," it is evident that, in its general tenour, it
      sufficiently militates against the custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first doctrine which it inculcates, is that of
      <i>brotherly love</i>. It commands good will towards men.
      It enjoins us to love our neighbours as ourselves, and to
      do unto all men, as we would that they should do unto us.
      And how can any man fulfil this scheme of universal
      benevolence, who reduces an unfortunate person <i>against
      his will</i>, to the <i>most insupportable</i> of all human
      conditions; who considers him as his <i>private
      property</i>, and treats him, not as a brother, nor as one
      of the same parentage with himself, but as an <i>animal of
      the brute creation?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most important doctrine is that, by which we are
      assured that mankind are to exist in a future state, and to
      give an account of those actions, which they have severally
      done in the flesh. This strikes at the very root of
      slavery. For how can any man be justly called to an account
      for his actions, whose actions are not <i>at his own
      disposal?</i> This is the case with the <i>proper</i><a
      name="FNanchor112"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> slave. His liberty is
      absolutely bought and <i>appropriated</i>; and if the
      purchase is <i>just and equitable</i>, he is <i>under the
      necessity</i> of perpetrating any crime, which the
      purchaser may order him to commit, or, in other words, of
      ceasing to be <i>accountable for his actions</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These doctrines therefore are sufficient to shew, that
      slavery is incompatible, with the Christian system. The
      <i>Europeans</i> considered them as such, when, at the
      close of the twelfth century, they resisted, their
      hereditary prejudices, and occasioned its abolition. Hence
      one, among many other proofs, that Christianity was the
      production of infinite wisdom; that though it did not take
      such express cognizance of the wicked national institutions
      of the times, as should hinder its reception, it should yet
      contain such doctrines, as, when it should be fully
      established, would be sufficient for the abolition of them
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then is the argument of you <i>receivers</i>
      ineffectual, and your conduct impious. For, by the
      prosecution of this wicked slavery and commerce, you not
      only oppose the propagation of that gospel which was
      ordered to be preached unto every creature, and bring it
      into contempt, but you oppose its tenets also: first,
      because you violate that law of <i>universal
      benevolence</i>, which was to take away those hateful
      distinctions of <i>Jew</i> and <i>Gentile</i>, <i>Greek</i>
      and <i>Barbarian, bond</i> and <i>free</i>, which prevailed
      when the gospel was introduced; and secondly, because, as
      every man is to give an account of his actions hereafter,
      it is necessary that he should be <i>free</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another argument yet remains, which, though nature will
      absolutely turn pale at the recital, cannot possibly be
      omitted. In those wars, which are made for the sake of
      procuring slaves, it is evident that the contest must be
      generally obstinate, and that great numbers must be slain
      on both sides, before the event can be determined. This we
      may reasonably apprehend to be the case: and we have
      shewn,<a name="FNanchor113"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> that there have not
      been wanting instances, where the conquerors have been so
      incensed at the resistance they have found, that their
      spirit of vengeance has entirely got the better of their
      avarice, and they have murdered, in cool blood, every
      individual, without discrimination, either of age or sex.
      From these and other circumstances, we thought we had
      sufficient reason to conclude, that, where <i>ten</i> were
      supposed to be taken, an <i>hundred</i>, including the
      victors and vanquished, might be supposed to perish. Now,
      as the annual exportation from <i>Africa</i> consists of an
      hundred thousand men, and as the two orders, of those who
      are privately kidnapped by individuals, and of those, who
      are publickly seized by virtue of the authority of their
      prince, compose together, at least, nine-tenths of the
      <i>African</i> slaves, it follows, that about ten thousand
      consist of convicts and prisoners of war. The last order is
      the most numerous. Let us suppose then that only six
      thousand of this order are annually sent into servitude,
      and it will immediately appear that no less than
      <i>sixty-thousand</i> people annually perish in those wars,
      which are made only for the purpose of procuring slaves.
      But that this number, which we believe to be by no means
      exaggerated, may be free from all objection, we will
      include those in the estimate, who die as they are
      travelling to the ships. Many of these unfortunate people
      have a journey of one thousand miles to perform on foot,
      and are driven like sheep through inhospitable woods and
      deserts, where they frequently die in great numbers, from
      fatigue and want. Now if to those, who thus perish on the
      <i>African</i> continent, by war and travelling, we subjoin
      those,<a name="FNanchor114"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> who afterwards perish
      on the voyage, and in the seasoning together, it will
      appear that, in every yearly attempt to supply the
      colonies, an <i>hundred thousand</i> must perish, even
      before <i>one</i> useful individual can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracious God! how wicked, how beyond all example impious,
      must be that servitude, which cannot be carried on without
      the continual murder of so many and innocent persons! What
      punishment is not to be expected for such monstrous and
      unparalleled barbarities! For if the blood of one man,
      unjustly shed, cries with so loud a voice for the divine
      vengeance, how shall the cries and groans of an <i>hundred
      thousand</i> men, <i>annually murdered</i>, ascend the
      celestial mansions, and bring down that punishment, which
      such enormities deserve! But do we mention punishment? Do
      we allude to that punishment, which shall be inflicted on
      men as individuals, in a future life? Do we allude to that
      awful day, which shall surely come, when the master shall
      behold his murdered negroe face to face? When a train of
      mutilated slaves shall be brought against him? When he
      shall stand confounded and abashed? Or, do we allude to
      that punishment, which may be inflicted on them here, as
      members of a wicked community? For as a body politick, if
      its members are ever so numerous, may be considered as an
      whole, acting of itself, and by itself, in all affairs in
      which it is concerned, so it is accountable, as such, for
      its conduct; and as these kinds of polities have only their
      existence here, so it is only in this world, that, as such,
      they can be punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, whether we consider the crime, with respect to the
      individuals immediately concerned in this most barbarous
      and cruel traffick, or whether we consider it as
      patronized<a name="FNanchor115"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> and encouraged by the
      laws of the land, it presents to our view an equal degree
      of enormity. A crime, founded on a dreadful pre-eminence in
      wickedness,-a crime, which being both of individuals and
      the nation, must sometime draw down upon us the heaviest
      judgment of Almighty God, who made of one blood all the
      sons of men, and who gave to all equally a natural right to
      liberty; and who, ruling all the kingdoms of the earth with
      equal providential justice, cannot suffer such deliberate,
      such monstrous iniquity, to pass long unpunished."<a name=
      "FNanchor116"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas! he seems already to have interfered on the
      occasion! The violent<a name="FNanchor117"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> and supernatural
      agitations of all the elements, which, for a series of
      years, have prevailed in those European settlements, where
      the unfortunate <i>Africans</i> are retained in a state of
      slavery, and which have brought unspeakable calamities on
      the inhabitants, and publick losses on the states to which
      they severally belong, are so many awful visitations of God
      for this inhuman violation of his laws. And it is not
      perhaps unworthy of remark, that as the subjects of
      Great-Britain have two thirds of this impious commerce in
      their own hands, so they have suffered<a name=
      "FNanchor118"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> in the same
      proportion, or more severely than the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      How far these misfortunes may appear to be acts of
      providence, and to create an alarm to those who have been
      accustomed to refer every effect to its apparent cause; who
      have been habituated to stop there, and to overlook the
      finger of God; because it is slightly covered under the
      veil of secondary laws, we will not pretend to determine?
      but this we will assert with confidence, that the
      <i>Europeans</i> have richly deserved them all; that the
      fear of sympathy, which can hardly be restrained on other
      melancholy occasions, seems to forget to flow at the
      relation of these; and that we can never, with any shadow
      of justice, with prosperity to the undertakers of those,
      whose success must be at the expence of the happiness of
      millions of their fellow-creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is sufficient. For if liberty is only an
      adventitious right; if men are by no means superiour to
      brutes; if every social duty is a curse; if cruelty is
      highly to be esteemed; if murder is strictly honourable,
      and Christianity is a lye; then it is evident, that the
      <i>African</i> slavery may be pursued, without either the
      remorse of conscience, or the imputation of a crime. But if
      the contrary of this is true, which reason must immediately
      evince, it is evident that no custom established among men
      was ever more impious; since it is contrary to <i>reason,
      justice, nature, the principles of law and government, the
      whole doctrine, in short, of natural religion, and the
      revealed voice of God</i>.

      The author has lately read a work, intitled Paley's Moral
      and Political Philosophy, which, in this one respect,
      favours those which have been hinted at, as it denies that
      government was a contract. "No social compact was ever made
      in fact,"-"it is to suppose it possible to call savages out
      of caves and deserts, to deliberate upon topicks, which the
      experience and studies, and the refinements of civil life
      alone suggest. Therefore no government in the universe
      begun from this original." But there are no grounds for so
      absurd a supposition; for government, and of course the
      social compact, does not appear to have been introduced at
      the time, when families coming out of their caves and
      deserts, or, in other words, quitting their former
      <i>dissociated</i> state, joined themselves together. They
      had lived a considerable time in <i>society</i>, like the
      Lybians and G&aelig;tulians before-mentioned, and had felt
      many of the disadvantages of a want of discipline and laws,
      before government was introduced at all. The author of this
      Essay, before he took into consideration the origin of
      government, was determined, in a matter of such importance,
      to be biassed by no opinion whatever, and much less to
      indulge himself in speculation. He was determined solely to
      adhere to fact, and, by looking into the accounts left us
      of those governments which were in their infancy, and, of
      course in the least complicated state, to attempt to
      discover their foundation: he cannot say therefore, that
      upon a very minute perusal of the excellent work before
      quoted, he has been so far convinced, as to retract in the
      least from his sentiments on this head, and to give up
      maxims, which are drawn from historical facts, for those,
      which are the result of speculation. He may observe here,
      that whether government was a <i>contract</i> or not, it
      will not affect the reasoning of the present Essay; since
      where ever the contract is afterwards mentioned, it is
      inferred only that its object was "the <i>happiness of the
      people</i>," which is confessedly the end of government.
      Notwithstanding this, he is under the necessity of
      inserting this little note, though he almost feels himself
      ungrateful in contradicting a work, which has afforded him
      so much entertainment.

      The total annual exportation from Africa, is estimated here
      at 100,000 men, two thirds of whom are exported by the
      British merchants alone. This estimate is less than that
      which is usually made, and has been published. The author
      has been informed by disinterested people, who were in most
      of the West India islands during the late war, and who
      conversed with many of the most intelligent of the negroes,
      for the purpose of inquiring by what methods they had
      originally been reduced to slavery, that they did not find
      even two in twenty, who had been reduced to that situation,
      by any other means than those mentioned above. The author,
      desirous of a farther confirmation of this circumstance,
      stopped the press till he had written to another friend,
      who had resided twenty years in the West-Indies, and whose
      opinion he had not yet asked. The following is an extract
      from the answer. "I do not among many hundreds recollect to
      have seen but one or two slaves, of those imported from
      Africa, who had any scars to shew, that they had been in
      war. They are generally such as are kidnapped, or sold by
      their tyrants, after the destruction of a village. In
      short, I am firmly of opinion, that crimes and war together
      do not furnish one slave in an hundred of the numbers
      introduced into the European colonies. Of consequence the
      trade itself, were it possible to suppose convicts or
      prisoners of war to be justly sentenced to servitude, is
      accountable for ninety-nine in every hundred slaves, whom
      it supplies. It an insult to the publick, to attempt to
      palliate the method of procuring them."

      One third of the whole number imported, is often computed
      to be lost in the seasoning, which, in round numbers, will
      be 27000. The loss in the seasoning depends, in a great
      measure, on two circumstances, viz. on the number of what
      are called refuse slaves that are imported, and on the
      quantity of new land in the colony. In the French windward
      islands of Martinico, and Guadaloupe, which are cleared and
      highly cultivated, and in our old small islands, one
      fourth, including refuse slaves, is considered as a general
      proportion. But in St. Domingo, where there is a great deal
      of new land annually taken into culture, and in other
      colonies in the same situation, the general proportion,
      including refuse slaves, is found to be one third. This
      therefore is a lower estimate than the former, and reduces
      the number to about 23000. We may observe, that this is the

      It is very extraordinary that the advocates for slavery
      should consider those Africans, whom they call negroes, as
      the descendants of <i>Canaan</i>, when few historical facts
      can be so well ascertained, as that out of the descendants
      of the four sons of Ham, the descendants of Canaan were the
      only people, (if we except the Carthaginians, who were a
      colony of Canaan, and were afterwards ruined) who did not
      settle in that quarter of the globe. Africa was
      incontrovertibly peopled by the posterity of the three
      other sons. We cannot shew this in a clearer manner, than
      in the words of the learned Mr. Bryant, in his letter to
      Mr. Granville Sharp on this subject.<br>
      <br>
      "We learn from scripture, that Ham had four sons, <i>Chus,
      Mizraim, Phut</i>, and <i>Canaan</i>, Gen. x. 5, 6.
      <i>Canaan</i> occupied <i>Palestine</i>, and the country
      called by his name: <i>Mizraim, Egypt</i>: but <i>Phut</i>
      passed deep into <i>Africa</i>, and, I believe, most of the
      nations in that part of the world are descended from him;
      at least more than from any other person." <i>Josephus</i>
      says, "<i>that Phut was the founder of the nations in
      Libya, and the people were from him called (phoutoi)
      Phuti</i>." Antiq. L. 1. c. 7. "By <i>Lybia</i> he
      understands, as the <i>Greeks</i> did, <i>Africa</i> in
      general: for the particular country called <i>Lybia
      Proper</i>, was peopled by the <i>Lubim</i>, or
      <i>Lehabim</i>, one of the branches from <i>Mizraim</i>,
      (Labieim ex ou Libnes) Chron. Paschale, p. 29.<br>
      <br>
      "The sons of <i>Phut</i> settled in <i>Mauritania</i>,
      where was a country called <i>Phutia</i>, and a river of
      the like denomination. Mauritani&aelig; Fluvius usque ad
      pr&aelig;sens Tempus <i>Phut</i> dicitur, omnisq; circa eum

      &AElig;thiopia, and were styled Troglodyt&aelig;. (phoud ex
      ou troglodotai.) Syncellus, p. 47. Many of them passed
      inland, and peopled the Mediterranean country."<br>
      <br>
      "In process of time the sons of <i>Chus</i> also, (after
      their expulsion from Egypt) made settlements upon the sea
      coast of <i>Africa</i>, and came into <i>Mauritania</i>.
      Hence we find traces of them also in the names of places,
      such as <i>Churis, Chusares</i>, upon the coast: and a
      river <i>Chusa</i>, and a city <i>Cotta</i>, together with
      a promontory, <i>Cotis</i>, in <i>Mauritania</i>, all
      denominated from <i>Chus</i>; who at different times, and
      by different people, was called <i>Chus, Cuth, Cosh</i>,
      and <i>Cotis</i>. The river <i>Cusa</i> is mentioned by
      <i>Pliny</i>, Lib. 5. c. 1. and by <i>Ptolomy</i>."<br>
      <br>
      "Many ages after these settlements, there was another
      eruption of the <i>Cushites</i> into these parts, under the
      name of <i>Saracens</i> and <i>Moors</i>, who over-ran
      <i>Africa</i>, to the very extremity of Mount Atlas. They
      passed over and conquered <i>Spain</i> to the north, and
      they extended themselves southward, as I said in my
      treatise, to the rivers <i>Senegal</i> and <i>Gambia</i>,
      and as low as the <i>Gold Coast</i>. I mentioned this,
      because I do not think that they proceeded much farther:
      most of the nations to the <i>south</i> being, as I
      imagine, of the race of <i>Phut</i>. The very country upon
      the river <i>Gambia</i> on one side, is at this day called
      <i>Phuta</i>, of which <i>Bluet</i>, in his history of
      <i>Juba Ben Solomon</i>, gives an account."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
