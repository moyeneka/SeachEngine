<h4>THE</h4>
<h2>STORY OF THE TWO BULLS</h2>
<hr />
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>In former times, my story tells,</p>
<p class="i2">There lived one Deacon R.,</p>
<p>And not the worst man in the world,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor best was he, by far.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>His fields were rich, his acres broad,</p>
<p class="i2">And cattle were his pride;</p>
<p>Oxen and sheep, and horses, too,</p>
<p class="i2">And what you please, beside.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>His brindle cow, the highest prize</p>
<p class="i2">Won at the county fair,</p>
<p>For taper limbs and rounded form,</p>
<p class="i2">And short and shining hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Old Bonny Gray, a noble steed</p>
<p class="i2">Of sure, majestic pace,</p>
<p>Before the deacon purchased him,</p>
<p class="i2">Was famous at a race.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>This story he would sometimes tell,</p>
<p class="i2">And at the end would say,</p>
<p>"Alas! such sports are far from right;</p>
<p class="i2">But Bonny won the day!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Still, more than all, the spotted bull</p>
<p class="i2">Had filled the deacon's mind;</p>
<p>His back so straight, his breast so broad,</p>
<p class="i2">So perfect of his kind.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And when 'twas said that Moses Grimes,</p>
<p class="i2">A justice of the peace,</p>
<p>Had got the likeliest bull in town,</p>
<p class="i2">The deacon had no ease.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So off he rode to see the squire,</p>
<p class="i2">And put this question straight:</p>
<p>"Say, don't you want another bull,</p>
<p class="i2">And don't yours want a mate?"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The squire, perceiving at a glance</p>
<p class="i2">All that the man was after,</p>
<p>"Just forty pounds will buy my bull,"</p>
<p class="i2">Quoth he, with ready laughter.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And when the beast was brought to view,</p>
<p class="i2">And carefully surveyed,</p>
<p>Of deepest red, its every point</p>
<p class="i2">Of excellence displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I'll take him at your price," said he&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">"Please drive him down to-morrow,</p>
<p>And you shall have the money, sir,</p>
<p class="i2">If I the cash can borrow."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So saying, turned he on his steed,</p>
<p class="i2">The nimble-footed Bonny;</p>
<p>To-morrow came, and came the bull&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The deacon paid the money.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The sun was hid behind the hills&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The next day would be Sunday;</p>
<p>"You'll put him in the barn," said he,</p>
<p class="i2">"And leave him there till Monday."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The deacon was a man of peace,</p>
<p class="i2">For so he claimed, albeit</p>
<p>When there was war among the beasts,</p>
<p class="i2">He always liked to see it.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"How will the bulls together look,</p>
<p class="i2">And which will prove the stronger?</p>
<p>'Twere sin to wish the time to pass&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">'Twould only make it longer."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Such thoughts as these, on Sabbath morn,</p>
<p class="i2">Like birds of evil token,</p>
<p>Flew round and round the deacon's mind&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Its holy peace was broken.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Beyond the hills the steeple rose,</p>
<p class="i2">Distant a mile or two.</p>
<p>Our deacon's house and barns and bulls</p>
<p class="i2">Were well concealed from view.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Be ready all, to meeting go;</p>
<p class="i2">Perhaps I may not come&mdash;</p>
<p>A curious fluttering near my heart</p>
<p class="i2">Calls me to stay at home."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>As thus he spake, his careful wife</p>
<p class="i2">Replied with anxious tone,</p>
<p>"I'll stay with you; 'twere dangerous</p>
<p class="i2">To leave you all alone."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"No," answered he&mdash;"go, every one;</p>
<p class="i2">I've had the same before,</p>
<p>And, with a little medicine,</p>
<p class="i2">No doubt 'twill soon be o'er.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Run, Peter, run for Bonny Gray,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor tarry till you find him;</p>
<p>I've often heard his own or say</p>
<p class="i2">He'd carry all behind him."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The carriage stands before the door;</p>
<p class="i2">They enter&mdash;one, two, three;</p>
<p>The deacon says, "There's room for more&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Enough for Parson G."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The parson was a portly man&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The deacon loved to joke;</p>
<p>But afterwards, as it befell,</p>
<p class="i2">Was sorry that he spoke.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>They move to join the gathering throng</p>
<p class="i2">Within the house of prayer.</p>
<p>Now ceased the bell its solemn peal&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The deacon was not there.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Where was he, then? Perhaps you'll say</p>
<p class="i2">In easy chair reclining,</p>
<p>The glimmer of his spectacles,</p>
<p class="i2">Upon his Bible shining.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ah, no! See you that earnest man,</p>
<p class="i2">With air so bold and free,</p>
<p>Driving a spotted, warlike bull?&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">That very man is he.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Left to himself, the deacon grave</p>
<p class="i2">Tarried not long within,</p>
<p>And, thinking of his sturdy beasts,</p>
<p class="i2">Forgot his medicine.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I hope the meeting will be full,</p>
<p class="i2">And I shall not be missed,"</p>
<p>Softly he breathed, and, looking round,</p>
<p class="i2">He murmured, "All is whist!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thus on he drove that spotted bull,</p>
<p class="i2">And near the gateway placed him,</p>
<p>And when the other one came out,</p>
<p class="i2">It happened so, he faced him.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href=

"Fighting Bulls" /></a></div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When Greek meets Greek," the deacon said,</p>
<p class="i2">"Then comes the tug of war;"</p>
<p>But such another tug, I ween,</p>
<p class="i2">The deacon never saw.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Like sudden thunderbolts they met,</p>
<p class="i2">The spotted and the red.</p>
<p>Those bulls will never fight again&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The spotted one is dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>All gored and prostrate in his blood,</p>
<p class="i2">He lies upon the ground,</p>
<p>While the unsated red one toward</p>
<p class="i2">The deacon made a bound.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Down from the bars where he was perched.</p>
<p class="i2">Aghast, the good man sprung,</p>
<p>And if you'd seen him go it, <i>then</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">You'd said that he was young.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Still after him with fury</p>
<p class="i2">The bull did rush and roar,</p>
<p>And was very near the deacon</p>
<p class="i2">When he reached the outer door.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href=
"images/002.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/002.jpg" alt=
"Bull in Pursuit" /></a></div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Through kitchen and through parlor fine,</p>
<p class="i2">Breathless, the poor man flew,</p>
<p>And lo! the bull is at his heels</p>
<p class="i2">And in the parlor too.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>A flight of stairs is all that's left</p>
<p class="i2">Between him and despair;</p>
<p>He springs to gain the top, and falls,</p>
<p class="i2">A sober deacon, there.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But to his ears terrific sounds</p>
<p class="i2">Rise from the room below&mdash;</p>
<p>Tables and glasses, chairs and all,</p>
<p class="i2">Crash, crash, together go!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Upon the wall a mirror hung,</p>
<p class="i2">Of massive, gilded frame,</p>
<p>Which had reflected many a squire</p>
<p class="i2">And many a worthy dame.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>There last, not least, the raging beast</p>
<p class="i2">Descried his form at length,</p>
<p>And deemed it was another bull</p>
<p class="i2">Coming to try his strength.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href=
"images/003.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/003.jpg" alt=
"Bull in Mirror" /></a></div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>He plunged to meet his threatening foe,</p>
<p class="i2">But fought himself, alas!</p>
<p>While all around in fragments flew</p>
<p class="i2">The shattered looking glass!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"What will come next?" the deacon cries;</p>
<p class="i2">"This is too much for one day:</p>
<p>My rifle's loaded, and I'll try</p>
<p class="i2">To stop this noise on Sunday."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>With trembling hand he seized the gun,</p>
<p class="i2">With wary step descended;</p>
<p>He aimed, he fired, he killed the bull,</p>
<p class="i2">And thus the battle ended.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>To yonder house we turn again,</p>
<p class="i2">And to the quiet throng</p>
<p>The preacher now has said, Amen!</p>
<p class="i2">Now ends the choral song.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And friendly speech and courtesies</p>
<p class="i2">And shake of hands go round,</p>
<p>And each inquires the other's health,</p>
<p class="i2">All as in duty bound.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"How is your spouse?" the parson said;</p>
<p class="i2">"I see he's not at meeting."</p>
<p>"This morning, sir," the wife replied,</p>
<p class="i2">"His heart was strangely beating.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I hope you'll call and see him soon"</p>
<p class="i2">"That I shall gladly do."</p>
<p>"Ride down with us&mdash;the carriage waits;</p>
<p class="i2">There's room enough for you."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>All seated now, with solemn air,</p>
<p class="i2">And with a placid smile,</p>
<p>Such words of truth the parson spoke</p>
<p class="i2">As might their fears beguile.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Lo! they alight, the gate in sight&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">"What's that?" the matron said.</p>
<p>Says Peter, "It's the spotted bull,</p>
<p class="i2">And I believe he's dead."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thus all, amazed, a moment gazed,</p>
<p class="i2">And quickly turn about;</p>
<p>In doleful plight, the deacon sighs,</p>
<p class="i2">"Murder will surely out!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Where shall I go? What shall I do?</p>
<p class="i2">I'm caught&mdash;I am a sinner!</p>
<p>My wife, good soul&mdash;my wife has brought</p>
<p class="i2">The parson home to dinner!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And with a little spice of wit,</p>
<p class="i2">To which he was inclined,</p>
<p>Though none to spare the deacon had,</p>
<p class="i2">He thus relieved his mind:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I've often heard the preacher say</p>
<p class="i2">That good may come of evil;</p>
<p>Still every hour, with all our might,</p>
<p class="i2">We must resist the devil.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If horn and hoof be any proof,</p>
<p class="i2">And if the foot be riven,</p>
<p>Surely I am the very man</p>
<p class="i2">That with the beast has striven!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now hurried steps without are heard,</p>
<p class="i2">And earnest voices blend;</p>
<p>"I'm in a vice," the deacon groans&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">"When will this torture end?"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Young Peter, being first within,</p>
<p class="i2">For he had run ahead,</p>
<p>Loudly exclaims, "Another bull</p>
<p class="i2">Lies in the parlor, dead!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href=
"images/004.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/004.jpg" alt=
"Dead Bull in Parlor" /></a></div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>They enter all, with hands upraised</p>
<p class="i2">And faces filled with wonder&mdash;</p>
<p>There stood confessed the deacon's case,</p>
<p class="i2">And all were struck with thunder.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The tale flew quickly round, and woke</p>
<p class="i2">Much pity and more laughter;</p>
<p>But not a word the deacon spoke</p>
<p class="i2">Of his two bulls thereafter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="full" />
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Listen! listen to my song,</p>
<p class="i2">There is meaning in it;</p>
<p>You may know it sha'nt be long&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Only half a minute.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Have you ever read the tale&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Have you heard the story&mdash;</p>
<p>How two bulls together fought</p>
<p class="i2">On the field of glory?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And how a famous hero</p>
<p class="i2">Thought it was so cunning,</p>
<p>How he became a master</p>
<p class="i2">Of the art of running?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And how he was so frightened,</p>
<p class="i2">In getting up the stairs;</p>
<p>And how he heard the breaking</p>
<p class="i2">Of all his china-wares?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And how his heart was swelling</p>
<p class="i2">Up like a pot of yeast;</p>
<p>And how he took a rifle,</p>
<p class="i2">And fired it at the beast?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And how the parish preacher</p>
<p class="i2">Had heard that he was sick,</p>
<p>And losing not a moment,</p>
<p class="i2">Did come to see him quick?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And how the rumor flourished,</p>
<p class="i2">'Mongst people young and old,</p>
<p>And how they sighed, and how they laughed</p>
<p class="i2">To hear the story told?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>If you have read, remember</p>
<p class="i2">The moral of this book&mdash;</p>
<p>Whoever takes the devil's bait,</p>
<p class="i2">Is sure to feel the hook.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
