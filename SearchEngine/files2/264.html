</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="poetry">The years will pass, and hearts will range,<br
/>
<i>You</i> conquer Time, and Care, and Change.<br />
Though Time doth still delight to shed<br />
The dust on many a younger head;<br />
Though Care, oft coming, hath the guile<br />
From younger lips to steal the smile;<br />
Though Change makes younger hearts wax cold,<br />
And sells new loves for loves of old,<br />
Time, Change, nor Care, hath learned the art<br />
To fleck your hair, to chill your heart,<br />
To touch your tresses with the snow,<br />
To mar your mirth of long ago.<br />
Change, Care, nor Time, while life endure,<br />
Shall spoil our ancient friendship sure,<br />
The love which flows from sacred springs,<br />
In &lsquo;old unhappy far-off things,&rsquo;<br />
From sympathies in grief and joy,<br />
Through all the years of man and boy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Therefore, to you, the rhymes I strung<br />
When even this &lsquo;brindled&rsquo; head was young<br />
I bring, and later rhymes I bring<br />
That flit upon as weak a wing,<br />
But still for you, for yours, they sing!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span><span
class="smcap">Many</span> of the verses and translations in this
volume were published first in <i>Ballads and Lyrics of Old
France</i> (1872).&nbsp; Though very sensible that they have the
demerits of imitative and even of undergraduate rhyme, I print
them again because people I like have liked them.&nbsp; The rest
are of different dates, and lack (though doubtless they need) the
excuse of having been written, like some of the earlier pieces,
during College Lectures.&nbsp; I would gladly have added to this
volume what other more or less serious rhymes I have written, but
circumstances over which I have no control have bound them up
with <i>Ballades</i>, and other toys of that sort.</p>
<p>It may be as well to repeat in prose, what has already been
said in verse, that Grass of Parnassus, the pretty Autumn flower,
grows in the marshes at the foot of the Muses&rsquo; Hill, and
other hills, not at the top by any means.</p>
<p>Several of the versions from the Greek Anthology have been
published in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, and the sonnet on
Colonel Burnaby appeared in <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; These, with
pieces from other serials, are reprinted by the courteous
permission of the Editors.</p>
<p>The verses that were published in <i>Ballades and Lyrics</i>,
and in <i>Ballads and Verses Vain</i> (Charles Scribner&rsquo;s
Sons, New York), are marked in the contents with an asterisk.</p>

<p class="poetry">By the example of certain Grecian mariners,
who, being safely returned from the war about Troy, leave yet
again their old lands and gods, seeking they know not what, and
choosing neither to abide in the fair Ph&aelig;acian island, nor
to dwell and die with the Sirens, at length end miserably in a
desert country by the sea, is set forth the <i>Vanity of
Melancholy</i>.&nbsp; And by the land of Ph&aelig;acia is to be
understood the place of Art and of fair Pleasures; and by
Circe&rsquo;s Isle, the place of bodily delights, whereof men,
falling aweary, attain to Eld, and to the darkness of that
age.&nbsp; Which thing Master Fran&ccedil;oys Rabelais feigned,
under the similitude of the Isle of the Macr&aelig;ones.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a land in
the remotest day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the soft night is born, and sunset dies;<br />
The eastern shore sees faint tides fade away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That wash the lands where laughter, tears, and
sighs<br />
Make life,&mdash;the lands below the blue of common skies.</p>
<p class="poetry">But in the west is a mysterious sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (What sails have seen it, or what shipmen known?)<br
/>
With coasts enchanted where the Sirens be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With islands where a Goddess walks alone,<br />
And in the cedar trees the magic winds make moan.</p>
<p class="poetry">Eastward the human cares of house and home,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cities, and ships, and unknown gods, and loves;<br
/>
Westward, strange maidens fairer than the foam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lawless lives of men, and haunted groves,<br />
Wherein a god may dwell, and where the Dryad roves.</p>
<p class="poetry">The gods are careless of the days and death<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of toilsome men, beyond the western seas;<br />
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>The gods
are heedless of their painful breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love them not, for they are not as these;<br />
But in the golden west they live and lie at ease.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet the Ph&aelig;acians well they love, who
live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the light&rsquo;s limit, passing careless
hours,<br />
Most like the gods; and they have gifts to give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even wine, and fountains musical, and flowers,<br />
And song, and if they will, swift ships, and magic powers.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is a quiet midland; in the cool<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the twilight comes the god, though no man
prayed,<br />
To watch the maids and young men beautiful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance, and they see him, and are not afraid,<br />
For they are neat of kin to gods, and undismayed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, would the bright red prows might bring us
nigh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dreamy isles that the Immortals keep!<br />
But with a mist they hide them wondrously,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And far the path and dim to where they
sleep,&mdash;<br />
The loved, the shadowy lands, along the shadowy deep.</p>

<p class="poetry">The red rose clouds, without law or leader,<br

<p class="poetry">The strange flowers&rsquo; perfume turns to
singing,<br />

The Siren&rsquo;s song, grown faint in winging,<br />

<p class="poetry">As waifs blown out of the sunset, flying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Purple, and rosy, and grey, the birds<br />
Brighten the air with their wings; their crying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wakens a moment the weary herds.</p>
<p class="poetry">Butterflies flit from the fairy garden,<br />

PATH.</h3>
<p>Plotinus, the Greek philosopher, had a certain proper mode of
ecstasy, whereby, as Porphyry saith, his soul, becoming free from
the deathly flesh, was made one with the Spirit that is in the
world.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Alas</span>, the path is
lost, we cannot leave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our bright, our clouded life, and pass away<br />
As through strewn clouds, that stain the quiet eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To heights remoter of the purer day.<br />
The soul may not, returning whence she came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bathe herself deep in Being, and forget<br />
The joys that fever, and the cares that fret,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made once more one with the eternal flame<br />
That breathes in all things ever more the same.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She would be young again, thus drinking deep<br />
Of her old life; and this has been, men say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But this we know not, who have only sleep<br />
To soothe us, sleep more terrible than day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where dead delights, and fair lost faces stray,<br
/>
To make us weary at our wakening;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of that long lost path to the Divine<br />
We dream, as some Greek shepherd erst might sing,<br />

shadow then the Greeks and Trojans slew each other.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Why</span> from the quiet
hollows of the hills,<br />
And extreme meeting place of light and shade,<br />

Clouds among sister clouds, where fair spent beams<br />
And dying glories of the sun would dwell,<br />
Why have they whom I know not, nor may know,<br />
Strange hands, unseen and ruthless, fashioned me,<br />
And borne me from the silent shadowy hills,<br />
Hither, to noise and glow of alien life,<br />
To harsh and clamorous swords, and sound of war?</p>
<p class="poetry">One speaks unto me words that would be
sweet,<br />
Made harsh, made keen with love that knows me not,<br />
And some strange force, within me or around,<br />
Makes answer, kiss for kiss, and sigh for sigh,<br />
And somewhere there is fever in the halls<br />
That troubles me, for no such trouble came<br />
To vex the cool far hollows of the hills.</p>

Among the streets bereft, and helpless shrines.</p>
<p class="poetry">At other hours another life seems mine,<br />
Where one great river runs unswollen of rain,<br />

Around me, then again the shriek of arms,<br />
And all the turmoil of the Ilian men.</p>

What make they?&nbsp; Even this&mdash;the sport of gods&mdash;<br

The sport of gods, however free they seem.<br />
Ah, would the game were ended, and the light,<br />
The blinding light, and all too mighty suns,<br />
Withdrawn, and I once more with sister shades,<br />
Unloved, forgotten, mingled with the mist,<br />
Dwelt in the hollows of the shadowy hills.</p>

Plucked no fire-hearted flowers, but were content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool fritillaries and flag-flowers to twine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With lilies woven and with wet woodbine;<br />
Till once they sought the bright &AElig;tn&aelig;an flowers,<br

And their glad mistress fled from summer hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Hades, far from olive, corn, and vine.<br />
And they have sought her all the wide world through<br />

Have filled and changed their song, and o&rsquo;er the blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rings deadly sweet the magic of the song,<br />
And whoso hears must listen till he die<br />
Far on the flowery shores of Sicily.</p>

And the returning swallows, and spring flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till forth to seek a shadow-queen she strayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A shadowy land; and now hath overweighed<br />
Her singing chaplet with the snow and showers.<br />
Yes, fair well-water for the bitter brine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She left, and by the margin of life&rsquo;s sea<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sings, and her song is full of the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
