<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
<br>
<p>In this edition a chapter has been added, bringing
down to date the record of the contest for
equal suffrage. The summary on pages 175-235
is now largely obsolete; but it has been retained
as instructive evidence of the rapid progress made
during the last four years.</p>

<a name="PREFACE"></a>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<br>
<p>While making some researches in the evolution
of women's rights, I was impressed
by the fact that no one had ever, as far as I could
discover, attempted to give a succinct account of
the matter for English-speaking nations. Indeed,
I do not believe that any writer in any country
has essayed such a task except Laboulaye; and
his <i>Recherches sur la Condition Civile et Politique
des Femmes</i>, published in 1843, leaves much to
be desired to one who is interested in the subject
to-day.</p>
<p>I have, therefore, made an effort to fill a lack.
This purpose has been strengthened as I have
reflected on the great amount of confused information
which is absorbed by those who have no
time to make investigations for themselves.
Accordingly, in order to present an accurate historical
review, I have cited my authorities for
all statements regarding which any question could
be raised. This is particularly so in the chapters
which deal with the condition of women under
Roman Law, under the early Christian Church,
and under Canon Law. In all these instances I
have gone directly to primary sources, have
investigated them myself, and have admitted
no secondhand evidence. In connection with
Women's rights in England and in the United
States I have either consulted the statutes or
studied the commentaries of jurists, like Messrs.
Pollock and Maitland, whose authority cannot
be doubted. To such I have given the exact
references whenever they have been used. In
preparing the chapter on the progress of women's
lights in the United States I derived great
assistance from the very exhaustive <i>History of
Woman Suffrage</i>, edited by Miss Susan B.
Anthony, Mrs. Ida H. Harper, and others to
whose unselfish labours we are for ever indebted.
From their volumes I have drawn freely; but I
have not given each specific reference.</p>
<p>The tabulation of the laws of the several States
which I have given naturally cannot be entirely
adequate, because the laws are being changed
constantly. It is often difficult to procure the
latest revised statutes. However, these laws are
recent enough to illustrate the evolution of women's
rights.</p>
<p>Finally, this volume was written in no hope that
all readers would agree with the author, who is
zealous in his cause. His purpose will be gained
if he induces the reader to reflect for himself on
the problem in the light of its historical development.</p>

<h2>WOMEN'S RIGHTS UNDER ROMAN LAW, FROM
AUGUSTUS TO JUSTINIAN&#8212;27 B.C. TO
527 A.D.</h2>
<br>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
Guardianship.</div>
<p>The age of legal capability for the Roman
woman was after the twelfth year, at which
period she was permitted to make a will.<a name="FNanchor_1"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
However, she was by no means allowed
to do so entirely on her own account, but only
under supervision.<a name="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
This superintendence was
vested in the father or, if he was dead, in a guardian<a
 name="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>;
if the woman was married, the power belonged
to the husband. The consent of such
supervision, whether of father, husband, or
<a name="Page_2"></a>guardian, was essential, as Ulpian informs us,<a
 name="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
under these circumstances: if the woman entered
into any legal action, obligation, or civil contract;
if she wished her freedwoman to cohabit with
another's slave; if she desired to free a slave; if
she sold any things <i>mancipi</i>, that is, such as
estates on Italian soil, houses, rights of road or
aqueduct, slaves, and beasts of burden. Throughout
her life a woman was supposed to remain
absolutely under the power<a name="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
of father, husband, or
guardian, and to do nothing without their consent.
In ancient times, indeed, this authority was so
great that the father and husband could, after
calling a family council, put the woman to death
without public trial.<a name="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
The reason that women
were so subjected to guardianship was "on account
of their unsteadiness of character,"<a name="FNanchor_7"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> "the weakness
of the sex," and their "ignorance of legal
matters."<a name="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
Under certain circumstances, however,
women became <i>sui iuris</i> or entirely independent:
I. By the birth of three children
(a freedwoman by four)<a name="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>;
II. By becoming a
Vestal Virgin, of whom there were but six<a name="FNanchor_10"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>; III.
By a formal emancipation, which took place
<a name="Page_3"></a>rarely, and then often only with a view of
transferring
the power from one guardian to another.<a name="FNanchor_11"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
Even when <i>sui iuris</i> a woman could not acquire
power over any one, not even over her own children<a name="FNanchor_12"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>;
for these an agnate&#8212;a male relative on the
father's side&#8212;was appointed guardian, and the
mother was obliged to render him and her children
an account of any property which she had
managed for them.<a name="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
On the other hand, her
children were bound to support her.<a name="FNanchor_14"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote">Digression on the growth of respect for women</div>
<p>So much for the laws on the subject. They
seem rigorous enough, and in early times were
doubtless executed with strictness. A
marked feature, however, of the Roman
character, a peculiarity which at once
strikes the student of their history as compared
with that of the Greeks, was their great respect
for the home and the <i>materfamilias</i>. The stories
of Lucretia, Cloelia, Virginia, Cornelia, Arria,
and the like, familiar to every Roman schoolboy,
must have raised greatly the esteem in which
women were held. As Rome became a world
power, the Romans likewise grew in breadth of
view, in equity, and in tolerance. The political
<a name="Page_4"></a>influence wielded by women<a name="FNanchor_15"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> was as great during
the first three centuries after Christ as it has ever
been at any period of the world's history; and the
powers of a Livia, an Agrippina, a Plotina, did not
fail to show pointedly what a woman could do.
In the early days of the Republic women who
touched wine were severely punished and male
relatives were accustomed solemnly to kiss them,
if haply they might discover the odour of drink on
their breath.<a name="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Valerius Maximus tells us that
<a name="Page_5"></a>Egnatius Mecenas, a Roman knight, beat his
wife to death for drinking wine.<a name="FNanchor_17"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Cato the Censor
(234-149 B.C.) dilated with joy on the fact that a
woman could be condemned to death by her husband
for adultery without a public trial, whereas
men were allowed any number of infidelities
without censure.<a name="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
The senator Metellus (131 B.C.)
lamented that Nature had made it necessary to
have women.<a name="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>
<p>The boorish cynicism of a Cato and a Metellus&#8212;though
it never expressed the real feelings of the
majority of Romans&#8212;gave way, however, under
the Empire to a generous expression of the equality
of the sexes in the realms of morality and of
intellect. "I know what you may say," writes
Seneca to Marcia,<a name="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
"'You have forgotten that
you are consoling a woman; you cite examples of
fortitude on the part of men.' But who said that
Nature had acted scurvily with the characters of
women and had contracted their virtues into a
narrow sphere? Equal force, believe me, is
possessed by them; equal capability for what is
<a name="Page_6"></a>honorable, if they so wish." The Emperor Marcus
Aurelius gratefully recalls that from his mother he
learned piety and generosity, and to refrain not
only from doing ill, but even from thinking it,
and simplicity of life, far removed from the
ostentatious display of wealth.<a name="FNanchor_21"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The passionate
attachment of men like Quintilian and Pliny to
their wives exhibits an equality based on love that
would do honour to the most Christian households.<a name="FNanchor_22"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
All Roman historians speak with great admiration
of the many heroic deeds performed by women
and are fond of citing conspicuous examples of
conjugal affection.<a name="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
The masterly and <a name="Page_7"></a>sympathetic
delineation of Dido in the <i>Aeneid</i> shows
how deeply a Roman could appreciate the character
of a noble woman. In the numerous provisions
for the public education at the state's expense
girls were given the same opportunities and
privileges as boys; there were five thousand boys
and girls educated by Trajan alone.<a name="FNanchor_24"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Decay of the power or the guardian.</div>
<p>Such are a few examples of the growth of respect
for women; and we should naturally conclude
that, as time progressed, the unjust
laws of guardianship would no longer
be executed to the letter, even though
the hard statutes were not formally expunged.
This was the case during the first three centuries
after Christ, as is patent from many sources. It
is to be borne in mind that because a law is on the
books, does not mean necessarily that it is enforced.
A law is no stronger than public opinion.
Of this anomaly there are plenty of instances even
to-day&#8212;the Blue Laws of Massachusetts, for
example. "That women of mature age should be
under guardianship," writes the great jurist
Gaius<a name="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
in the second century, "seems to have no
valid reason as foundation. For what is commonly
believed, to the effect that on account of
unsteadiness of character they are generally
<a name="Page_8"></a>hoodwinked, and that, therefore, it is right for
them to be governed by the authority of a guardian,
seems rather specious than true. As a matter of
fact, women of mature age do manage their
own affairs, and in certain cases the guardian
interposes his authority as a mere formality;
frequently, indeed, he is forced by the supreme
judge to lend his authority against his will."
Ulpian, too, hints at the really slight power of the
guardian in his day, that is, the first three decades
of the third century. "In the case of male and
female wards under age, the guardians both
manage their affairs and interpose their authority;
but in the case of mature women they merely
interpose their authority."<a name="FNanchor_26"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> The woman had, in
practice, become free to manage her property as
she wished; the function of the legal guardian
was simply to see to it that no one should attempt
a fraud against her. Adequately to observe the
decay of the vassalage of women, we must investigate
the story of their rights in all its forms;
and the position of women in marriage will next
occupy our attention.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Women and marriage.</div>
<p>As in all Southern countries where women
mature early, the Roman girl usually married
<a name="Page_9"></a>young; twelve years were required by custom
for her to reach the marriageable age.<a name="FNanchor_27"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> In the
earlier period a woman was acquired
as wife in three different ways: I. By
<i>coemptio</i>&#8212;a mock sale to her husband<a name="FNanchor_28"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>; II. By
<i>confarreatio</i>&#8212;a solemn marriage with peculiar
sacred rites to qualify men and women and their
children for certain priesthoods<a name="FNanchor_29"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>; III. By <i>usus</i>,
or acquisition by prescription. A woman became
a man's legal wife by <i>usus</i> if he had lived with
her one full year and if, during that time, she had
not been absent from him for more than three
successive nights.<a name="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>
<p>All these forms, however, had either been
abolished by law or had fallen into desuetude
during the second century of our era, as is evident
from Gaius.<a name="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
A man could marry even if not
present personally; a woman could not.<a name="FNanchor_32"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> The
woman's parents or guardians were accustomed
to arrange a match for her,<a name="FNanchor_33"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> as they still do in
many parts of Europe. Yet the power of the
<a name="Page_10"></a>father to coerce his daughter was limited. Her
consent was important. "A marriage cannot
exist," remarks Paulus, "unless all parties consent."<a
 name="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
Julianus writes also that the daughter
must give her permission<a name="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>;
yet the statement
of Ulpian which immediately follows in the
Digest shows that she had not complete free will
in the matter: "It is understood that she who
does not oppose the wishes of her father gives
consent. But a daughter is allowed to object
only in case her father chooses for her a man of
unworthy or disgraceful character."<a name="FNanchor_36"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> The son
had an advantage here, because he could never
be forced into a marriage against his will.<a name="FNanchor_37"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> The
consent of the father was always necessary for a
valid marriage.<a name="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
He could not by will compel
his daughter to marry a certain person.<a name="FNanchor_39"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> After
she was married, he still retained power over her,
unless she became independent by the birth of
three children; but this was largely to protect her
and represent her in court against her husband if

Husband and Wife.</div>
<p>The Roman marriage was a purely civil contract
based on consent.<a name="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
The definition given by
the law was a noble one. "Marriage is
the union of a man and a woman and
a partnership of all life; a mutual sharing of laws
human and divine."<a name="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
The power of the husband
over the wife was called <i>manus</i>; and the wife
stood in the same position as a daughter.<a name="FNanchor_53"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> No
husband was allowed to have a concubine.<a name="FNanchor_54"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> He
was bound to support his wife adequately, look
<a name="Page_13"></a>out for her interests,<a name="FNanchor_55"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> and strictly to avenge
any insult or injury offered her<a name="FNanchor_56"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>; any abusive
treatment of the wife by the husband was punished
by an action for damages<a name="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>.
A wife was
compelled by law to go into solemn mourning
for a space of ten months upon the death of a
husband<a name="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>.
During the period of mourning she
was to abstain from social banquets, jewels, and
crimson and white garments<a name="FNanchor_59"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>. If she did not do
so, she lost civil status. The emperor Gordian,
in the year 238, remitted these laws so far as
solemn clothing and other external signs of
mourning above enumerated were concerned.<a name="FNanchor_60"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
But a husband was not compelled to do any legal
mourning for the death of his wife.<a name="FNanchor_61"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>
<p>The wife was, as I have said, in the power of
her husband. Originally, no doubt, this power
was absolute; the husband could even put his wife
to death without a public trial. But the world
was progressing, and that during the first three
centuries after Christ the power of the husband
was reduced in practice to absolute nullity I shall
<a name="Page_14"></a>make clear in the following pages. I shall,
accordingly, first investigate the rights of the wife
over her dowry, that is, the right of managing her
own property.</p>
<p>Even from earliest times it is clear that the
wife had complete control of her dowry. The
henpecked husband who is afraid of offending his
wealthy wife is a not uncommon figure in the
comedies of Plautus and Terence; and Cato the
Censor growled in his usual amiable manner at
the fact that wives even in his day controlled completely
their own property.<a name="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>
The attitude of the
Roman law on the subject is clearly expressed.
"It is for the good of the state that women have
their dowries inviolate."<a name="FNanchor_63"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> "The dowry is always
and everywhere a chief concern; for it is for the
public good that dowries be retained for women,
since it is highly necessary that they be dowered
in order to bring forth offspring and replenish the
state with children."<a name="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>
"It is just that the income
of the dowry belong to the husband; for inasmuch
as it is he who stands the burdens of the
married state, it is fair that he also acquire the
interest."<a name="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>
"Nevertheless, the dowry belongs
<a name="Page_15"></a>to the woman, even though it is in the goods of
the
husband."<a name="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
"A husband is not permitted to
alienate his wife's estate against her will."<a name="FNanchor_67"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> A
wife could use her dowry during marriage to
support herself, if necessary, or her kindred,
to buy a suitable estate, to help an exiled parent,
or to assist a needy husband, brother, or sister.
The numerous accounts in various authors of
the first three centuries after Christ confirm
the statement that the woman's power over
her dowry was absolute.<a name="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
Then as now, a man
might put his property in his wife's name to
escape his creditors,<a name="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>&#8212;a
useless proceeding, if
she had not had complete control of her own
property.</p>
<p>When the woman died, her dowry, if it had been
given by the father (<i>dos profecticia</i>) returned to the
latter; but if any one else had given it (<i>dos adventicia</i>),
the dowry remained with the husband, unless
the donor had expressly stipulated that it was
to be returned to himself at the woman's death
(<i>dos recepticia</i>),<a name="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>
In the case of a dowry of
the
first kind, the husband might retain what he had
<a name="Page_16"></a>expended for his wife's funeral.<a
 name="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>
The dowry was
confiscated to the state if the woman was convicted
of l&egrave;se majest&eacute;, violence against the state, or
murder.<a name="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
If she suffered punishment involving
loss of civil status under any other law which did
not assess the penalty of confiscation, the husband
acquired the dowry just as if she were dead.
Banishment operated as no impediment; if the
woman wished to leave her husband under these
circumstances, her father could recover the dowry.<a name="FNanchor_73"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>
<p>A further confirmation of the power of the wife
over her property is the law that prohibited gifts
between husband and wife; obviously, a woman
could not be said to have the power of making
a gift if she had no right of property of her own.
The object of the law mentioned was to prevent
the husband and wife from receiving any lasting
damage to his or her property by giving of it
under the impulse of conjugal affection.<a name="FNanchor_74"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> This
statute acted powerfully to prevent a husband
from wheedling a wife out of her goods; and in case
the latter happened to be of a grasping disposition
the law was a protection to the husband and
hence to the children, his heirs, for whose interests
the Roman law constantly provided.</p>
<p><a name="Page_17"></a>Gifts between husband and wife were
nevertheless
valid under certain conditions. It was
permissible to make a present of clothing and to
bestow various tokens of affection, such as ornaments.
The husband could present his wife with
enough money to rebuild a house of hers which
had burned.<a name="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>
The Emperor Marcus Aurelius
permitted a wife to give her husband the sum
necessary to obtain public office or to become a
senator or knight or to give public games.<a name="FNanchor_76"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> A
gift was also legal if made by the husband in
apprehension that death might soon overtake
him; if, for instance, he was very sick or was
setting out to war, or to exile, or on a dangerous
journey.<a name="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
The point in all gifts was, that neither
party should become richer by the donation.<a name="FNanchor_78"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>
<p>Some further considerations of the relation of
husband and wife will aid in setting forth the
high opinion which Roman law entertained of
marriage and its constant effort to protect the
wife as much as possible. A wife could not be
held in a criminal action if she committed theft
against her husband. The various statements
of the jurists make the matter clear. Thus
Paulus<a name="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>:
"A special action for the recovery of
<a name="Page_18"></a>property removed [<i>rerum amotarum iudicium</i>]
has
been introduced against her who was a wife, because
it has been decided that it is not possible
to bring a criminal action for theft against her
[<i>quid non placuit cum ea furti agere posse</i>]. Some&#8212;as
Nerva Cassius&#8212;think she cannot even commit
theft, on the ground that the partnership in
life made her mistress, as it were. Others&#8212;like
Sabinus and Proculus&#8212;hold that the wife can
commit theft, just as a daughter may against her
father, but that there can be no criminal action
by established law." "As a mark of respect
to the married state, an action involving disgrace
for the wife is refused."<a name="FNanchor_80"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> "Therefore she will be
held for theft if she touches the same things after
being divorced. So, too, if her slave commits
theft, we can sue her on the charge. But it is
possible to bring an action for theft even against
a wife, if she has stolen from him whose heirs we
are or before she married us; nevertheless, as a
mark of respect we say that in each case a formal
claim for restitution alone is admissible, but not
an action for theft."<a name="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>
"If any one lends help or
advice to a wife who is filching the property of
her husband, he shall be held for theft. If he
commits theft with her, he shall be held for theft,
although the woman herself is not held."<a name="FNanchor_82"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_19"></a>A husband who did not avenge the murder of
his wife lost all claims to her dowry, which was
then confiscated to the state; this by order of the
Emperor Severus.<a name="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>
<p>The laws on adultery are rather more lenient to
the woman than to the man. In the first place,
the Roman law insisted that it was unfair for a
husband to demand chastity on the part of his
wife if he himself was guilty of infidelity or did not
set her an example of good conduct,<a name="FNanchor_84"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>&#8212;a maxim
which present day lawyers may reflect upon with
profit. A father was permitted to put to death
<a name="Page_20"></a>his daughter and her paramour if she was still in
his power and if he caught her in the act at his
own house or that of his son-in-law; otherwise he
could not.<a name="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>
He must, however, put both man and
woman to death at once, when caught in the act;
to reserve punishment to a later date was unlawful.
The husband was not permitted to kill his wife;
he might kill her paramour if the latter was a man
of low estate, such as an actor, slave, or freedman,
or had been convicted on some criminal
charge involving loss of citizenship.<a name="FNanchor_86"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> The
reason that the father was given the power
which was denied the husband was that the
latter's resentment would be more likely to blind
his power of judging dispassionately the merits
of the case.<a name="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>
If now the husband forgot himself
and slew his wife, he was banished for life if of
noble birth, and condemned to perpetual hard
labour if of more humble rank.<a name="FNanchor_88"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> He must at once
divorce a wife guilty of adultery; otherwise he
was punished as a pander, and that meant loss
of citizenship.<a name="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>
Women convicted of adultery
were, when not put to death, punished by the
loss of half their dowry, a third part of their
other goods, and relegation to an island; guilty
<a name="Page_21"></a>men suffered the loss of half of their
possessions
and similar relegation to an island; but the guilty
parties were never confined in the same place.<a name="FNanchor_90"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>
We have mention also in several writers of some
curious and vicious punishments that might be
inflicted on men guilty of adultery.<a name="FNanchor_91"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, all this seems rigorous enough; but, as I
have already remarked, we must beware of imagining
that a statute is enforced simply because
it stands in the code. As a matter of fact, public
sentiment had grown so humane in the first three
centuries after Christ that it did not for a moment
tolerate that a father should kill his daughter,
no matter how guilty she was; and in all our
records of that period no instance occurs. As to
husbands, we have repeated complaints in the
literature of the day that they had grown so
complaisant towards erring wives that they could
not be induced to prosecute them.<a name="FNanchor_92"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> A typical instance
is related by Pliny.<a name="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>
Pliny was summoned
by the Emperor Trajan to attend a council where,
among other cases, that of a certain Gallitta was
discussed. She had married a military tribune
and had committed adultery with a common
captain (<i>centurio</i>). Trajan sent the captain into
<a name="Page_22"></a>exile. The husband took no measures against
his wife, but went on living with her. Only by
coercion was he finally induced to prosecute.
Pliny informs us that the guilty woman had to be
condemned, even against the will of her accuser.</p>
<p>A woman guilty of incest received no punishment,
but the guilty man was deported to an
island.<a name="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a>
If the incest involved adultery, the
woman was of course held on that charge.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Divorce</div>
<p>We come now to a matter where the growing
freedom of women reached its highest point&#8212;the
matter of divorce. Here again we have
to note the progress of toleration and humanitarianism.
In the early days of the Republic
the family tie was rarely severed. Valerius Maximus
tells us<a name="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>
of a quaint custom of the olden days,
to the effect that "whenever any quarrel arose
between husband and wife, they would proceed
to the chapel of the goddess Viriplaca ["Reconciler
of Husbands"], which is on the Palatine, and
there they would mutually express their feelings;
then, laying aside their anger, they returned home
reconciled." During these days a woman could
never herself take the initiative in divorce; the
husband was all-powerful. The first divorce
of which we have any record took place in the
year 231 B.C., when Spurius Carvilius Ruga put
away his wife for sterility. Public opinion censured
him severely for it "because people thought
<a name="Page_23"></a>that not even the desire for children ought to
have
been preferred to conjugal fidelity and affection."<a name="FNanchor_96"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>
As the Empire extended and Rome became more
worldly and corrupt, the reasons for divorce became
more trivial. Sempronius Sophus divorced
his wife because she had attended some public
games without his knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_97"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> Cicero, who
was a lofty moralist&#8212;on paper,&#8212;put away his
wife Terentia in order to marry a rich young
ward and get her money if he could. Maecenas,
the great prime-minister of Augustus, sent away
and took back his wife repeatedly at caprice&#8212;perhaps
he believed that variety is the spice of
life. But during all this time the husband alone
could annul marriage.<a name="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>
<p>Gradually, however, the status of women changed
and they were given greater and greater liberty.
Inasmuch as Roman marriage was a civil contract
based on consent, strict justice had to allow
that on this basis either party to the contract
might annul the marriage at his or her pleasure.
The result was that during the first three centuries
after Christ the wife had absolute freedom to take
the initiative and send her husband a divorce
whenever and for whatever reason she wished.
<a name="Page_24"></a>The proof of this fact is positively established
not
only from the statements of the jurists, but also
from numberless accounts in the other writers of
the day.<a name="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>
Divorce became, at least among the
higher strata of society, extraordinarily frequent.
That a lady of the Upper Four Hundred should
have been content with only one husband was
deemed worthy of special mention on her tomb; the
word <i>univira</i> (a woman of one husband) may
still be read on certain inscriptions. The satirists
are fond of dwelling on the license allowed to
women in the case of divorce. Martial, for instance,<a
 name="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>
says that one Theselina married ten husbands
in one month. Still, allowing for the natural
exaggeration of satirists, we are yet reasonably sure
that divorce had reached great heights in the upper
classes. Whether it was as bad among the middle
classes is very improbable. There was one kind
of marriage which, originally at least, did not
admit of dissolution.<a name="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>
This was the solemn
marriage by <i>confarreatio</i>, already described, which
<a name="Page_25"></a>qualified the husband and wife for the special
priesthood of Jupiter. Women soon grew to
value their freedom too highly to enter it; as
early as 23 A.D. the Senate had to relax some of the
rigour of the old laws on the matter as a special
inducement for women to consent to enter this
union.<a name="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>
<p>We may now observe what became of the wife's
property after divorce and what her rights were
under such circumstances. If it was the husband
who had taken the initiative and had sent his wife
a divorce, and if the divorce was not the fault of
the woman, she at once had an action in law for
complete recovery of her dowry; on her own responsibility
if she was <i>sui iuris</i>, otherwise with
the help of her father.<a name="FNanchor_103"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> But even the woman still
under guardianship could act by herself if her
father was too sick or infirm or if she had no other
agent to act for her.<a name="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a>
For the offence of
adultery
a husband had to pay back the dowry at once;
for lesser guilt he might return it in instalments
at intervals of six months.<a name="FNanchor_105"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> If, now, the divorce
was clearly the fault of the woman, her husband
could retain certain parts of the dowry in these
proportions: for adultery, a sixth part for each
of the children up to one half of the whole; for
lighter offences, an eighth part; if the husband had
<a name="Page_26"></a>gone to expense or had incurred civil obligations
for his wife's benefit or if she had removed any
of his property, he could recover the amount.<a name="FNanchor_106"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>
<p>A year and six months must elapse after a
divorce before the woman was allowed to marry
again.<a name="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>
If at the time of the divorce she was
pregnant, her husband was obliged to support her
offspring, provided that within thirty days after
the separation she informed him of her condition.<a name="FNanchor_108"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a>
She could sue her former husband for damages if
he insulted her.<a name="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a>
Whether the children
should
stay with the mother or father was left to the
discretion of the judge.<a name="FNanchor_110"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Property rights of widows and single women.</div>
<p>The married woman had, as I have shown,
complete disposal of her own property. Let us
see next what rights those women had
over their possessions who were widows
or spinsters.</p>
<p>Roman Law constantly strove to protect the
children and laid it down as a maxim that the
property of their parents belonged to them.<a name="FNanchor_111"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>
<a name="Page_27"></a>A widow could not therefore, except by special
permission from the emperor,<a name="FNanchor_112"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> be the legal
guardian of her children, but must ask the court to
appoint one upon the death of her husband.<a name="FNanchor_113"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a>
This was to prevent possible mismanagement and
because "to undertake the legal defence of others
is the office of men."<a name="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>
But she was permitted to
assume complete charge of her children's property
during their minority and enjoy the usufruct;
only she must render an account of the goods
when the children arrived at maturity.<a name="FNanchor_115"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> We
have many instances of women who managed their
children's patrimony and did it exceedingly well.
"You managed our patrimony in such wise," writes
Seneca to his mother,<a name="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>
"that you exerted
yourself
as if it were yours and yet abstained from it as if
it belonged to others."<a name="FNanchor_117"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> Agricola, father-in-law
of
Tacitus, had such confidence in his wife's business
ability that he made her co-heir with his daughter
and the Emperor Domitian.<a name="FNanchor_118"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> A mother could
get an injunction to restrain extravagance on
<a name="Page_28"></a>the part of her children.<a name="FNanchor_119"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a>
Women could not
adopt.<a name="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>
<p>Married women, spinsters, and widows had as
much freedom as men in disposing of property
by will. If there were children, the Roman law
put certain limitations on the testator's powers,
whether man or woman. By the Falcidian Law
no one was allowed to divert more than three
fourths of his estate from his (or her) natural
heirs.<a name="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a>
But for any adequate cause a woman
could disinherit her children completely; and
there are many instances of this extant both in the
Law Books and in the literature of the day.<a name="FNanchor_122"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>
<p>Single women had grown absolutely unshackled
and even their guardians had become a mere
formality, as the words of Gaius, already quoted
(<a href="#Page_8">page 8</a>) prove. That they had complete disposal
of their property is proved furthermore
by the numerous complaints in Roman authors
about the sycophants who flattered and toadied the
wealthy ladies with an eye to being remembered
in their wills.<a name="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a>
For it is evident that
if these
<a name="Page_29"></a>women had not had the power freely to dispose of
their own property, there would have been no
point in paying them such assiduous court. The
legal age of maturity was now twenty-five for
both male and female.</p>

Examples of women who toiled
for a living with their own hands are indeed very
old, as the widow, described by Homer, who
worked for a scanty wage to support her fatherless
children, or the wreathmaker, mentioned by
Aristophanes.<a name="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>
But such was the case only with
women of the lower classes; the lady of high birth
acted through her agents.<a name="FNanchor_132"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> The right of women to sue.</div>
<p><a name="Page_30"></a>When so many women were engaged in business,
occasions for lawsuits would naturally arise; we
shall see next what power the woman
had to sue. It was a standing maxim
of the law that a woman by herself
could not conduct a case in court.<a name="FNanchor_133"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> She had to
act through her agent, if she was independent,
otherwise through her guardian. The supreme
judge at Rome and the governor in a province
assigned an attorney to those who had no agent or
guardian.<a name="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>
But in this case again custom and
the law were at variance. Various considerations
will make it clear that women who sued had, in
practice, complete disposal of the matter. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>.&#8212;A
woman who was still under the power of her father
must, according to law, sue with him as her agent
or appoint an agent to act with him. Nevertheless,
a father could do nothing without the consent
of his daughter.<a name="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a>
Obviously, then, so far
as the
power of the father was concerned, a woman had
practically the management of her suit. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">II</span>.&#8212;The
husband had no power. If he tried to browbeat
her as to what to do, she could send him a divorce,
a privilege which she had at her beck and call,
<a name="Page_31"></a>as we have seen; and then she could force him to
give her any guardian she wanted.<a name="FNanchor_136"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> <big>III</big>.&#8212;That the
authority of other guardians was in practice a
mere formality, I have already proved (<a href="#Page_7">pp. 7 </a>and
<a href="#Page_8">8</a>).</p>
<p>From these considerations it is clear that the
woman's wishes were supreme in the conduct of
any suit. Moreover, the law expressly states that
women may appoint whatever attorneys or agents
they desire, without asking the consent of their
legal guardians<a name="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>;
and thus they were at
liberty to
select a man who would manage things as they
might direct. There were cases where even the
strict letter of the law permitted women to lay
an action on their own responsibility alone: if,
when a suit for recovery of dowry was brought,
the father was absent or hindered by infirmities<a name="FNanchor_138"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a>;
if the woman sued or was sued to get or render an
account of property managed in trust<a name="FNanchor_139"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a>; to avenge
the death of a parent or children, or of patron or
patroness and their children<a name="FNanchor_140"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a>; to lay bare any
matter pertaining to the public grain supply<a name="FNanchor_141"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a>;
and to disclose cases of treason.<a name="FNanchor_142"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Instances of women pleading in public and suing.</div>
<p>We read of many cases of women pleading
<a name="Page_32"></a>publicly and bringing suit. Indeed, according
to Juvenal&#8212;who is, however, a pessimist by profession&#8212;the
ladies found legal proceedings
so interesting that bringing suit
became a passion with them as strong as
it had once been among the Athenians.
Thus Juvenal<a name="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a>:
"There is almost no case in
which a woman wouldn't bring suit. Manilia
prosecutes, when she isn't a defendant. They
draw up briefs quite by themselves, and are ready
to cite principles and authorities to Celsus [a
celebrated lawyer of that time]." Of pleading in
public one of the celebrated instances was that of
Hortensia, daughter of the great orator Quintus
Hortensius, Cicero's rival. On an occasion when
matrons had been burdened with heavy taxes and
none of their husbands would fight the measure,
Hortensia pleaded the case publicly with great
success. All writers speak of her action and the
eloquence of her speech with great admiration.<a name="FNanchor_144"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>
We hear also of a certain Gaia Afrania, wife of a
Senator; she always conducted her case herself
before the supreme judge, "not because there was
any lack of lawyers," adds her respectable and
scandalised historian,<a name="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a>
"but because she had
more
than enough of impudence."</p>
<p>Quintilian mentions several cases of women
<a name="Page_33"></a>being sued<a name="FNanchor_146"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a>; Pliny tells how he
acted as attorney
for some<a name="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a>;
and the Law Books will supply any one
curious in the matter with abundant examples.<a name="FNanchor_148"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a>
A quotation from Pliny<a name="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a>
will give an idea of the
kind of suit a woman might bring, and the great interest
aroused thereby: "Attia Viriola, a woman of
illustrious birth and married to a former supreme
judge, was disinherited by her eighty-year-old
father within eleven days after he had brought
Attia a stepmother. Attia was trying to regain
her share of her father's estate. One hundred and
eighty jurors sat in judgment. The tribunal was
crowded, and from the higher part of the court
both men and women strained over the railings in
their eagerness to hear (which was difficult), and
to see (which was easy)."</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Partiality of the law to women.</div>
<p>There were many legal qualifications designed
to help women evade the strict letter of the law
when this, if enforced absolutely, would
work injustice. Ignorance of the law,
if there was no criminal offence involving
good morals, was particularly accepted in the case
of women "on account of the weakness of the sex."<a name="FNanchor_150"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>
A typical instance of the growth of the desire to
help women, protect them as much as possible,
<a name="Page_34"></a>and stretch the laws in their favour, may be
taken
from the senatorial decree known as the Senatus
Consultum Velleianum.<a name="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a>
This was an order
forbidding females to become sureties or defendants
for any one in a contract. But at the end of the
first century of our era the Senate voted that the
law be emended to help women and to give them
special privileges in every class of contract. "We
must praise the farsightedness of that illustrious
order," comments the great jurist Ulpian,<a name="FNanchor_152"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> "because
it brought aid to women on account of the
weakness of the sex, exposed, as it is, to many
mishaps of this sort."</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Rights of women to inherit.</div>
<p>The rights of women to inherit under Roman
law deserve some mention. Here again we may
note a steady growth of justice. Some
general examples will make this clearer,
before I treat of the specific powers of inheritance.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span>&#8212;In the year 169 B.C. the
Tribune Quintus
Voconius Saxa had a law passed which restricted
greatly the rights of women to inherit.<a name="FNanchor_153"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> According
to Dio<a name="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a>
no woman was, by this statute, permitted
to receive more than 25,000 sesterces&#8212;1250
dollars. In the second century after Christ, this
law had fallen into complete desuetude.<a name="FNanchor_155"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span>&#8212;By
<a name="Page_35"></a>the Falcidian Law, passed in the latter part of
the first century B.C., no citizen was allowed to
divert more than three fourths of his estate from
his natural heirs.<a name="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a>
The Romans felt strongly
against any man who disinherited his children
without very good reason; the will of such a
parent was called <i>inofficiosum</i>, "made without
a proper feeling of duty," and the disinherited
children had an action at law to recover their
proper share.<a name="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a>
A daughter was considered a
natural heir no less than a son and had equal
privileges in succession<a name="FNanchor_158"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a>; and so women were
bound to receive some inheritance at least. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">III.</span>&#8212;It
is a sad commentary on Christian rulers that for
many ages they allowed the crimes of the father
to be visited upon his children and by their bills
of attainder confiscated to the state the goods
of condemned offenders. Now, the Roman law
stated positively that "the crime or punishment
<a name="Page_36"></a>of a father can inflict no stigma on his child."<a
 name="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>
So
far as the goods of the father were concerned, the
property of three kinds of criminals escheated to
the crown: <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1)</span> those who
committed suicide
while under indictment for some crime,<a name="FNanchor_160"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">(2)</span>
forgers,<a name="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(3)</span> those guilty of high treason<a
 name="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a>.
Yet
it seems reasonable to doubt whether these laws
were very often carried out strictly to the letter.
For example, the law did indeed hold that the
estate of a party guilty of treason was confiscated
to the state<a name="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a>;
but even here it was expressly
ordained that the goods of the condemned man's
freedmen be reserved for his children.<a name="FNanchor_164"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> Moreover,
in actual practice we can find few instances
where the law was executed in its literal severity
even under the worst tyrants. It was Julius
Caesar who first set the splendid example of
allowing to the children of his dead foes full
enjoyment of their patrimonies.<a name="FNanchor_165"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> Succeeding
<a name="Page_37"></a>emperors followed the precedent.<a
 name="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a>
Tyrants like
Tiberius and Nero, strangely enough, in a majority
of cases overruled the Senate when it proposed
to confiscate the goods of those condemned for
treason, and allowed the children a large part
or all of the paternal estate.<a name="FNanchor_167"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> Hadrian gave
the children of proscribed offenders the twelfth
part of their father's goods.<a name="FNanchor_168"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> Antoninus Pius
gave them all.<a name="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a>
There was a strong public feeling
against bills of attainder and this sentiment is
voiced by all writers of the Empire. The law
forbade wives to suffer any loss for any fault of
their husbands.<a name="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>
<p>Since we have now noticed that women could
inherit any amount, that they were bound to
receive something under their fathers' wills, and
that the guilt of their kin could inflict no prejudice
upon them in the way of bills of attainder involving
physical injury or civil status and, in
practice, little loss so far as inheriting property
<a name="Page_38"></a>was concerned, we may pass to a contemplation of
the specific legal rights of inheritance of women.</p>
<p>If women were to be disinherited, it was sufficient
to mention them in an aggregate; but males must
be mentioned specifically.<a name="FNanchor_171"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> If, however, they
were disinherited in an aggregate (<i>inter ceteros</i>),
some legacy had to be left them that they might
not seem to have been passed over through
forgetfulness.<a name="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a>
I shall not concern myself particularly
with testate succession, because here
obviously the will of the testator could dispose
as he wished, except in so far as he was limited
by the Falcidian Law. The matter of intestate
succession may well claim our attention; for
therein we shall see what powers of inheritance
were given the female sex. The general principles
are explained by Gaius (iii, 1-38); and these
principles followed, in the main, the law as laid
down in the Twelve Tables (451 B.C.). According
to these, the estates of those who died intestate
belonged first of all to the children who were in
the power of the deceased at the time of his death;
there was no distinction of sex; the daughters
were entitled to precisely the same amount as
the sons.<a name="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a>
If the children of the testator had
died, the grandson or granddaughter <i>through the
son</i> succeeded; or the great-grandson or great-<a name="Page_39"></a>granddaughter
through the <i>grandson</i>. If a son
a daughter were alive, as well as grandsons
and granddaughters through the <i>son</i>, they were
all equally called to the estate. The estate was
not divided per capita, but among families as a
whole; for example, if of two sons one only was
alive, but the other had left children, the testator's
surviving son received one half of the patrimony
and his grandchildren through his other son the
other half, to be divided among them severally. If,
then, there were six grandchildren, each received
one twelfth of the estate.</p>
<p>Here the powers of women to inherit stopped.
Beyond the tie of <i>consanguinitas</i>, that is, that of
daughter to father, or granddaughter through a
<i>son</i>, the female line must at once turn aside, and
had no powers; the estate descended to the <i>agnati</i>,
that is, male relatives on the father's side. Hence
a mother was shut out by a brother of the deceased
or by that brother's children. If there were no
<i>agnati</i>, the goods were given to the <i>gentiles</i>, male
relatives of the clan bearing the same name.
In fact, under this r&eacute;gime we may say that of the
female line the daughter alone was sure of inheriting
something.</p>
<p>In the days of the Empire some attempts were
made to be more just. It was enacted<a name="FNanchor_174"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> that all
the children should be called to the estate, whether
they had been under the power of the testator
at the time of his death or not; and female relatives
<a name="Page_40"></a>were now allowed to come in for their share "in
the third degree," that is, if there was neither a
child or an agnate surviving. This was not
much of an improvement; and the principle of
agnate succession is the only point in which
Roman law failed to give to women those
equal rights which it allowed them in other
cases.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Protection of property of children.</div>
<p>There is no point on which Roman law laid
more stress than that the children, both male and
female, were to be constantly protected
and must receive their legal share of
their father's or mother's goods. After a
husband's divorce or death his wife could, indeed,
enjoy possession of the property and the usufruct;
but the principal had to be conserved intact for
the children until they arrived at maturity. In
the same way a father was obliged to keep untouched
for the children whatever had been left
them by the mother on her decease<a name="FNanchor_175"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a>; and he must
also leave them that part, at least, of his own
property prescribed by the Falcidian Law. A
case&#8212;and it was common enough in real life&#8212;
such as that described by Dickens in <i>David
Copperfield</i>, where, by the English law, a second
husband acquired absolute right over his wife's
property and shut out her son, would have been
<a name="Page_41"></a>impossible under Roman law. Neither husband
nor wife could succeed to one another's intestate
estate absolutely unless there were no children,
parents, or other relatives living.<a name="FNanchor_176"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Punishment of crimes against women.</div>
<p>Rape of a woman was punished by death;
accessories to the crime merited the same penalty.<a name="FNanchor_177"></a><a

Indecent exposure before a virgin met
with punishment out of course.<a name="FNanchor_178"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> Kidnapping
was penalised by hard labour in
the mines or by crucifixion in the case of those
of humble birth, and by confiscation of half the
goods and by perpetual exile in the case of a
noble.<a name="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a>
Temporary exile was visited upon those
guilty of abortion themselves<a name="FNanchor_180"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>; if it was caused
through the agency of another, the agent, even
though he or she did so without evil intent, was
punished by hard labour in the mines, if of humble
birth, and by relegation to an island and confiscation
of part of their goods, if of noble rank.<a name="FNanchor_181"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> If
<a name="Page_42"></a>the victim died, the person who caused the

<div class="sidenote"> Rights of women to an education.</div>
<p>The rights of women to an education were not
questioned. That Sulpicia could publish amatory
poems in honour of her husband and
receive eulogies from writers like Martial<a name="FNanchor_183"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a>
shows that she and ladies like her
occupied somewhat the same position as Olympia
Morata and Tarquinia Molza later in Italy during
the Renaissance, or like some of the celebrated
Frenchwomen, such as Madame de Sta&euml;l. Seneca
addresses a <i>Dialogue on Consolation</i> to one Marcia;
such an idea would have made the hair of any
Athenian gentleman in the time of Socrates stand
on end. Aspasia was obliged to be a courtesan in
order to become educated and to frequent cultivated
society<a name="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>;
Sulpicia was a noble matron in
good standing. The world had not stood still
since Socrates had requested some one to take
Xanthippe home, lest he be burdened by her
sympathy in his last moments. Pains were taken
that the Roman girl of wealth should have special
tutors.<a name="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>
"Pompeius Saturninus recently read me
some letters," writes Pliny<a name="FNanchor_186"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> to one of his <a
 name="Page_43"></a>correspondents,
"which he insisted had been written
by his wife. I believed that Plautus or Terence
was being read in prose. Whether they are really
his wife's, as he maintains; or his own, which he
denies; he deserves equal honour, either because he
composes them, or because he has made his wife,
whom he married when a mere girl, so learned
and polished." The enthusiasm of the ladies for
literature is attested by Persius.<a name="FNanchor_187"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Juvenal, who, as an orthodox
satirist, was not fond of the weaker sex, women
sometimes became over-educated. He growls
as follows<a name="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a>:
"That woman is a worse nuisance
than usual who, as soon as she goes to bed, praises
Vergil; makes excuses for doomed Dido; pits bards
against one another and compares them; and
weighs Homer and Maro in the balance. Teachers
of literature give way, professors are vanquished,
the whole mob is hushed, and no lawyer or auctioneer
will speak, nor any other woman." The
prospect of a learned wife filled the orthodox
Roman with peculiar horror.<a name="FNanchor_189"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> No Roman woman
ever became a public professor as did Hypatia or,
<a name="Page_44"></a>ages later, Bitisia Gozzadina, who, in the
thirteenth
century, became doctor of canon and civil law at
the University of Bologna.</p>
<p>I have been speaking of women of the wealthier
classes; but the poor were not neglected. As far
back as the time of the Twelve Tables&#8212;450 B.C.&#8212;parents of moderate
means were accustomed to
club together and hire a schoolroom and a teacher
who would instruct the children, girls no less than
boys, in at least the proverbial three R's. Virginia
was on her way to such a school when she encountered
the passionate gaze of Appius Claudius.
Such grammar schools, which boys and girls
attended together, flourished under the Empire as
they had under the Republic.<a name="FNanchor_190"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> They were not
connected with the state, being supported by the
contributions of individual parents. To the end
we cannot say that there was a definite scheme
of public education for girls at the state's expense
as there was for boys.<a name="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a>
Still, the emperors did
something. Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius,
Marcus Aurelius, and Alexander Severus, for
example, regularly supplied girls and boys with
<a name="Page_45"></a>education at public expense<a name="FNanchor_192"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a>;
under Trajan there
were 5000 children so honoured. Public-spirited
citizens were also accustomed to contribute
liberally to the same cause; Pliny on one occasion<a name="FNanchor_193"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a>
gave the equivalent of $25,000 for the support
and instruction of indigent boys and girls.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> The Vestals.</div>
<p>It may not be out of place to speak briefly of the
Vestal Virgins, the six priestesses of Vesta, who are
the only instances in pagan antiquity of
anything like the nuns of the Christians.
The Vestals took a vow of perpetual chastity.<a name="FNanchor_194"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a>
They passed completely out of the power of their
parents and became entirely independent. They
could not receive the inheritance of any person
who died intestate, and no one could become heir
to a Vestal who died intestate. They were
allowed to be witnesses in court in public trials,
a privilege denied other women. Peculiar honour
was accorded them and they were regularly
appointed the custodians of the wills of the
emperors.<a name="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Female slaves.</div>
<p>The position of women in slavery merits some
attention, in view of the huge multitudes that
<a name="Page_46"></a>were held in bondage. Roman law
acknowledged no legal rights on the part of slaves<a name="FNanchor_196"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a>.
The master had absolute power of life
and death.<a name="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a>
They were exposed to every
whim of master or mistress without redress.<a name="FNanchor_198"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> If
some one other than their owner harmed them
they might obtain satisfaction through their
master and for his benefit; but the penalty for the
aggressor was only pecuniary.<a name="FNanchor_199"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> A slave's evidence
was never admitted except under torture.<a name="FNanchor_200"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> If
a master was killed, every slave of his household
and even his freedmen and freedwomen were put to
torture, although the culprit may already have
been discovered, in order to ascertain the instigator
of the plot and his remotest accessories.<a name="FNanchor_201"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>
<p>The earlier history of Rome leaves no doubt
that before the Republic fell these laws were
carried out with inhuman severity. With the
growth of Rome into a world power and the
consequent rise of humanitarianism<a name="FNanchor_202"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> a strong public
<a name="Page_47"></a>feeling against gratuitous cruelty towards slaves
sprang up. This may be illustrated by an
event which happened in the reign of Nero, in the
year 58, when a riot ensued out of sympathy for
some slaves who had been condemned <i>en masse</i>
after their master had been assassinated by one of
them.<a name="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a>
Measures were gradually introduced for
alleviating the hardships and cruelties of slavery.
Claudius (41-54 A.D.) ordained<a name="FNanchor_204"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> that since sick
and infirm slaves were being exposed on an island
in the Tiber sacred to Aesculapius, because their
masters did not wish to bother about attending
them, all those who were so exposed were to be set
free if they recovered and never to be returned into
the power of their masters; and if any owner preferred
to put a slave to death rather than expose
him, he was to be held for murder. Gentlemen
began to speak with contempt of a master or
mistress who maltreated slaves.<a name="FNanchor_205"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> Hadrian (117-138 A.D.)
modified the old laws to a remarkable
degree: he forbade slaves to be put to death by
their masters and commanded them to be tried by
<a name="Page_48"></a>regularly appointed judges; he brought it about
that a slave, whether male or female, was not to be
sold to a slave-dealer or trainer for public shows
without due cause; he did away with <i>ergastula</i>
or workhouses, in which slaves guilty of offences
were forced to work off their penalties in chains
and were confined to filthy dungeons; and he
modified the law previously existing to the extent
that if a master was killed in his own house, the
inquisition by torture could not be extended to
the whole household, but to those only who, by
proximity to the deed, could have noticed it.<a name="FNanchor_206"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a>
Gaius observes<a name="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a>
that for slaves to be in complete
subjection to masters who have power of life and
death is an institution common to all nations,
"But at this time," he continues, "it is permitted
neither to Roman citizens nor any other men who
are under the sway of the Roman people to vent
their wrath against slaves beyond measure and
without reason. In fact, by a decree of the
sainted Antoninus (138-161 A.D.) a master who
without cause kills his slave is ordered to be held
no less than he who kills another's slave.<a name="FNanchor_208"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> An
excessive severity on the part of masters is also
checked by a constitution of the same prince.
On being consulted by certain governors about
those slaves who rush for refuge to the shrines of
<a name="Page_49"></a>the gods or the statues of emperors, he ordered
that if the cruelty of masters seemed intolerable
they should be compelled to sell their slaves."
Severus ordained that the city prefect should
prevent slaves from being prostituted<a name="FNanchor_209"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a>. Aurelian
gave his slaves who had transgressed to be heard
according to the laws by public judges<a name="FNanchor_210"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a>. Tacitus
procured a decree that slaves were not to be put
to inquisitorial torture in a case affecting a master's
life, not even if the charge was high treason<a name="FNanchor_211"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a>. So
much for the laws that mitigated slavery under
the Empire. They were not ideal; but they would
in more respects than one compare favourably
with the similar legislation that was in force, prior
to the Civil War, in the American Slave States.</p>

<p>Of course, no woman ever had a right to vote; but neither did
anybody else, since the Roman government had become an
absolute despotism. The first woman on the throne was Pulcheria,
who, in 450 A.D., was proclaimed Empress of the East,
succeeding her brother, Theodosius II. But she soon took a
husband and made him Emperor. She had been practically sole
ruler since 414.</p>

Valerius
Maximus devotes a whole chapter to Conjugal Love&#8212;iv,

7066, x, 8192, vi, 3, 15696, 15317, and 17690. Man and wife
are often represented with arms thrown about one another's
shoulders to signify that they were united in death as in life.
The poet Statius remarks that "to love a wife when she is living
is pleasure; to love her when dead, a solemn duty" (Silvae,
in prooemio). Yet some theologians would have us believe that
conjugal love and fidelity is an invention of Christianity.</p>

<p> Ulpian in Dig., 48, 5, 14 (13): Iudex adulterii ante oculos
habere debet et inquirere, an maritus pudice vivens mulieri
quoque bonos mores colendi auctor fuerit periniquum enim videtur
esse, ut pudicitiam vir ab uxore exigat, quam ipse non exhibeat.
Cf. Seneca, <i>Ep</i>., 94: Scis improbum esse qui ab uxore pudicitiam
exigit, ipse alienarum corruptor uxorum. Scis ut illi nil cum
adultero, sic nihil tibi esse debere cum pellice. Antoninus
Pius gave a husband a bill for adultery against his wife "Provided
it is established that by your life you give her an example
of fidelity. It would be unjust that a husband should
demand a fidelity which he does not himself keep"&#8212;quoted by St.
Augustine, de Conj. Adult., ii, ch. 8. In view of these explicit
statements it is difficult to see what the Church Father Lactantius
meant by asserting (<i>de Vero Cultu</i>, 23): Non enim, sicut iuris
publici
ratio est, sola mulier adultera est, quae habet alium; maritus
autem, etiamsi plures habeat, a crimine adulterii solutus est.
Perhaps this deliberate distortion of the truth was another one
of the libels against pagan Rome of which the pious Fathers are
so fond "for the good of the Church."</p>

<h2><a name="Page_52"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2>WOMEN AND THE EARLY CHRISTIAN CHURCH</h2>
<p>Meanwhile a new world force, destined to
overthrow the old order of things, was
growing slowly to maturity and spreading out its
might until eventually it fought its way to preeminence.
I have traced the rights of women
under the regime of pagan Rome; I shall inquire
next into the position of women under Christianity.
We must first note the attitude of the early
Christians towards women in general; for that
attitude will naturally be reflected in any laws
made after the Church has become supreme and
is combined with and directs the State. That
will demand a special chapter on Canon Law; but
in the present chapter I propose to show how
women were regarded by the Christians in the
centuries which were the formative period of the
Church.</p>
<p>The direct words of Christ so far as they relate
to women and as we have them in the Gospels concern
themselves wholly to bring about purity in
the relation of the sexes. "Ye have heard that it
was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but I
say unto you, that every one that looketh on a
<a name="Page_53"></a>woman to lust after her hath committed adultery
with her already in his heart."<a name="FNanchor_212"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> His commands
on the subject of divorce are positive and unequivocal:
"It was said also, Whosoever shall put
away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement;
but I say unto you, that every one that
putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of
fornication, maketh her an adultress; and whosoever
shall marry her when she is put away, committeth
adultery."<a name="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a>
Christ was content to
lay
down great ethical principles, not minute regulations.
Of any inferiority on the part of women
he says nothing, nor does be concern himself with
giving any directions about their social or legal
rights. He blessed the marriage at Cana; and
to the woman taken in adultery he showed his
usual clemency. For the rest, his relations with
women have an atmosphere of rare sympathy,
gentleness, and charm.</p>
<p>But as soon as we leave the Gospels and read
the Apostles we are in a different sphere. The
Apostles were for the most part men of humble
position, and their whole lives were directed by
inherited beliefs which were distinctly Jewish and
Oriental or Greek; not Western. In the Orient
woman has from the dawn of history to the present
day occupied a position exceedingly low. Indeed,
in Mohammedan countries she is regarded merely
<a name="Page_54"></a>as a tool for the man's sensual passions and she
is not allowed to have even a soul. In Greece
women were confined to their houses, were uneducated,
and had few public rights and less moral
latitude; their husbands had unlimited license.<a name="FNanchor_214"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a>
The Jewish ideal is by no means a lofty one and
cannot for a moment compare with the honour accorded
the Roman matron under the Empire. According
to <i>Genesis</i> a woman is the cause of all the
woes of mankind. <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> declares that the
badness of men is better than the goodness of
women.<a name="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a>
In <i>Leviticus</i><a name="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a>
we read that the period
of
purification customary after the birth of a child is
to be twice as long in the case of a female as in a
<a name="Page_55"></a>male. The inferiority of women was strongly felt;
and this conception would be doubly operative on
men of humble station who never travelled, who
had received little education, and whose ideas were
naturally bounded by the horizon of their native
localities. We are to remember also that the East
is the home of asceticism, a conviction alien to
the Western mind. There is no parallel in Western
Europe to St. Simeon Stylites.</p>
<p>We would, therefore, expect to find in the teachings
of the Apostles an expression of Jewish, i.e.,
Eastern ideals on the subject of women; and we do
so find them. Following the express commands of
Christ, they exhorted to sexual purity and reiterated
his injunctions on the matter of divorce.
They went much farther and began to legislate on
more minute details. Paul allows second marriages
to women<a name="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a>;
but thinks it better for a widow to
remain as she is.<a name="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a>
It is better to marry
than to
burn; yet would he prefer that men and women
should remain in celibacy.<a name="FNanchor_219"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> The power of the
father to arrange a marriage for his daughter was,
under Roman law, limited by her consent; but
the words of Paul make it clear that it was now to
be a Christian precept that a father could determine
on his own responsibility whether his daughter
should remain a virgin.<a name="FNanchor_220"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> Wives are to be in
subjection
to their husbands, and "let the wife see that
<a name="Page_56"></a>she fear her husband."<a name="FNanchor_221"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> Woman is the weaker
vessel<a name="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a>;
she is to be silent in church; if she desires
to learn anything, she should ask her husband
at home.<a name="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a>
Furthermore: "I permit not a woman
to teach, nor to have dominion over a man,
but to be in quietness. For Adam was first
formed, then Eve; and Adam was not beguiled,
but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into
transgression; but she shall be saved through
childbearing, if they continue in faith and love
and sanctification with sobriety."<a name="FNanchor_224"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> The apparel
of women also evoked legislation from the Apostles.
Women were to pray with their heads veiled "for
the man is not of the woman, but the woman for
the man."<a name="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a>
Jewels, precious metal, and costly
garments were unbecoming the modest woman.<a name="FNanchor_226"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a></p>
<p>In this early stage of Christianity we may already
distinguish three conceptions that were quite
foreign to the Roman jurist: <span style="font-weight: bold;">I. </span>The
inferiority
and weakness of women was evident from the
time of Eve and it was an act of God that punished
all womankind for Eve's transgression. Woman
had been man's evil genius. <span style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span>
She was to be
submissive to father or husband and not bring
her will in opposition to theirs. <span style="font-weight: bold;">III.</span>
She must
not be prominent in public, she must consider her
<a name="Page_57"></a>conduct and apparel minutely, and she was
exhorted to remain a virgin, as being thus in a
more exalted position. At the same time insistence
was placed on the fact that a virgin, wife, and
widow must be given due honour and respect,
must be provided for, and allowed her share in
taking part in those interests of the community
which were considered her sphere.</p>
<p>If, now, we examine the writings of the Church
Fathers, we shall see these ideas elaborated with
all the vehemence of religious zeal.</p>
<p>The general opinions of the Fathers regarding
women present a curious mixture. They are fond
of descanting on the fact that woman is responsible
for all the woes of mankind and that her very
presence is dangerous. At the same time they
pay glowing tribute to women in particular. St.
Jerome held that women were naturally weaker,
physically and morally, than men.<a name="FNanchor_227"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> The same
saint proves that all evils spring from women<a name="FNanchor_228"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a>;
and in another passage he opines that marriage
is indeed a lottery and the vices of women are
too great to make it worth while.<a name="FNanchor_229"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> "The sex is
<a name="Page_58"></a>practiced in deceiving," observes St. Maximus.<a
 name="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a>
St. Augustine disputes subtly whether woman is
the image of God as well as man. He says no,
and proves it thus<a name="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a>:
The Apostle commands
that a man should not veil his head, because he
is the image of God; but the woman must veil hers,
according to the same Apostle; therefore the
woman is not the image of God. "For this
reason, again," continues the Saint, "the Apostle
says 'A woman is not permitted to teach, nor
to have dominion over her husband.'" Bishop
Marbodius calls woman a "pleasant evil, at once
a honeycomb and a poison" and indicts the sex,<a name="FNanchor_232"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a>
<a name="Page_59"></a>something on the order of Juvenal or Jonathan
Swift, by citing the cases of Eve, the daughters of
Lot, Delilah, Herodias, Clytemnestra, and Progne.
The way in which women were regarded as at once
a blessing and a curse is well illustrated also in a
distich of Sedulius: "A woman alone has been
responsible for opening the gates of death; a
woman alone has been the cause of a return to
life."<a name="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>
<p>That women should be in subjection, in accordance
with the dictum of Paul, the Church Fathers
assert emphatically. "How can it be said of a
woman that she is the image of God," exclaims
St. Augustine,<a name="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a>
"when it is evident that she is
subject to the rule of her husband and has no
authority! Why, she can not teach, nor be a
witness, nor give security, nor act in court; how
much the more can she not govern!" Women are
commanded again and again not to perform any
of the functions of men and to yield a ready
<a name="Page_60"></a>and unquestioning obedience to their husbands.<a
 name="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a>
The Fathers also insist that marriage without a
paternal parent's consent is fornication.<a name="FNanchor_236"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>
<p>Marriage was looked upon as a necessary evil,
permitted, indeed, as a concession to the weakness
of mankind, but to be avoided if possible.
"Celibacy is to be preferred to marriage," says
St. Augustine.<a name="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a>
"Celibacy is the life of the
angels," remarks St. Ambrose.<a name="FNanchor_238"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> "Celibacy is a
spiritual kind of marriage," according to St.
Optatus.<a name="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a>
"Happy he," says Tertullia<a name="FNanchor_240"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> "who
lives like Paul!" The same saint paints a lugubrious
picture of marriage and the "bitter pleasure of
children" (<i>liberorum amarissima voluptate</i>) who
are burdens and just as likely as not will turn out
criminals. "Why did the Lord cry woe unto those
that are pregnant and give suck, unless it was to
call attention to the fact that children will be a
<a name="Page_61"></a>hindrance on the day of judgment?"<a
 name="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a>
When
such views were entertained of marriage, it need
not seem remarkable that Tertullian and St. Paul
of Nolan, like Tolstoy to-day, discovered the
blessings of a celibate life after they were married
and ran away from their wives.<a name="FNanchor_242"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> Jerome
finds marriage useful chiefly because it produces
virgins.<a name="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>
<p>As for second marriages, the Montanist and the
Novatian sects condemned them absolutely, on
the ground that if God has removed a wife or
husband he has thereby signified his will to end
the marrying of the parties; Tertullian calls second
marriage a species of prostitution.<a name="FNanchor_244"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a>Jerome expresses
the more tolerant and orthodox view:
"What then? Do we condemn second marriages?
Not at all; but we praise single ones. Do we cast
the twice-married from the Church? Far from it;
but we exhort the once-married to continence. In
Noah's ark there were not only clean, but also
unclean animals."<a name="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_62"></a>As the Fathers were very well aware of the
subtle influence of dress on the sexual passions,
we have a vast number of minute regulations directing
virgins, matrons, and widows to be clothed
simply and without ornament; virgins were to be
veiled.<a name="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a>
Tertullian, with that keen logic of which
the Church has always been proud in her sons,
argues that inasmuch as God has not made crimson
or green sheep it does not behoove women to
wear colours that He has not produced in animals
naturally.<a name="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a>
St. Augustine forbids nuns to bathe
more than once a month, unless under extreme
necessity.<a name="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>
<p>As soon as the Church begins to exercise an
influence upon law, we shall expect to see the legal
position of women changed in accordance with
certain general principles outlined above, viz: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span>
That inasmuch as Adam was formed before
Eve and as women are the weaker vessels, they
should confine themselves to those duties only
which society has, from time immemorial, assigned
<a name="Page_63"></a>them as their peculiar sphere. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span> They should
be meek, and not oppose father or husband; and
to these they should go for advice on all matters.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">III.</span> All license, such as the
Roman woman's
right of taking the initiative in a divorce, must
never be tolerated. <span style="font-weight: bold;">IV.</span> They
should never
transgress the bounds of strictest decorum in
conduct and dress, lest they seduce men; and they
must never be conspicuous in public or attempt to
perform public functions. <span style="font-weight: bold;">V.</span>
They are to be given
due honour and are to be cared for properly.</p>
<p>The legal rights of women would be affected,
moreover, by a difference in the spirit of the law.
The Roman jurist derived his whole sanction from
reason and never allowed religious considerations,
as such, to influence him when legislating on
women. He recognised that laws are not immutable,
but must be changed to fit the growth
of equity and tolerance. No previous authority
was valid to him if reason suggested that the
authority's dictum had outlived its usefulness and
must be adapted to larger ideas. It never occurred
to him to make the inferiority of woman an act of
God. On the other hand, the Church referred
everything to one unchanging authoritative source,
the Gospels and the writings of the Apostles; faith
and authority took the place of reason; and any
attempt to question the injunctions of the Bible
was regarded as an act of impiety, to be punished
accordingly. And as the various regulations
about women had now a divine sanction,
<a name="Page_64"></a>the permanence of these convictions was doubly
assured.<br>

<p> Plutarch lived in the second century A.D.; but he has inherited
the Greek point of view and advises a wife to bear with meekness
the infidelities of the husband&#8212;see <i>Praecep. Coniug</i>., 16.
His words are often curiously similar to those of the Apostles,
e.g., <i>Coniug. Praecep</i>., 33: "The husband shall rule the wife
not as if master of a chattel, but as the soul does the body." Id.
37: "Wives who are sensible will be silent when their husbands
are angry and vent their passion; when their husbands are
silent, then let them speak to them and mollify them." However,
like the Apostles, he enjoins upon husbands to honour their
wives; his essay on the "Virtues of Women"&#8212;&#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#969;&#957; &#945;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#8212;is

</p>
<p>Some of the respectable Puritan gentlemen at Rome also
held that a wife be content to be a humble admirer of her husband
(e.g., Pliny, <i>Paneg</i>., 83, hoc efficiebat, quod mariti minores
erant ... nam uxori sufficit obsequii gloria, etc.). But
Roman law insisted that what was morally right for the man
was equally so for the woman; just as it compelled a husband
himself to observe chastity, if he expected it from his wife.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_65"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2>RIGHTS OF WOMEN AS MODIFIED BY THE CHRISTIAN
EMPERORS</h2>
<p>Christianity became the state religion
under Constantine, who issued the Edict of
Milan, giving toleration to the Christians, in
the year 313. The emperors from Constantine
through Justinian (527-565) modified the various
laws pertaining to the rights of women in various
ways. To the enactments of Justinian, who caused
the whole body of the Roman law to be collected,
I intend to give special attention. We must not,
as yet, expect to find the strict views of the Church
Fathers carried out in any severe degree. On
the contrary the old Roman law was still so
powerful that it was for the most part beyond the
control of ecclesiasts. Justinian was an ardent
admirer of it and could not escape from its prevailing
spirit. Canon law had not yet developed.
When the old Roman civilisation in Italy has
succumbed completely to its barbarian conquerors;
when the East has been definitely sundered from
the West; when the Church has risen supreme,
has won temporal power, and has developed
canon law into a force equal to the civil law,&#8212;
<a name="Page_66"></a>then finally we shall expect to see the legal
rights
of women changed in accordance with two new
world forces&#8212;the Roman Catholic Church and the
Germanic nations. I shall now discuss legislation
having to do with my subject under the Christian
emperors from Constantine (306-337) through the
reign of Justinian (527-565).</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Divorce: rescript of Theodosius and Valentian.</div>
<p>The power of husband and wife to divorce at will
and for any cause, which we have seen obtained
under the old Roman law, was confined
to certain causes only by Theodosius and
Valentinian (449 A.D.). These emperors
asserted vigorously that<a name="FNanchor_249"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> the dissolution
of the marriage tie should be made more
difficult, especially out of regard to the children.
Pursuant to this idea the power of divorce was
given for the following reasons alone: adultery,
murder, treason, sacrilege, robbery; unchaste
conduct of a husband with a woman not his wife
and vice-versa; if a wife attended public games
without her husband's permission; and extreme
physical violence of either party. A woman who
sent her husband a bill of divorce for any other
reason forfeited her dowry and all ante-nuptial
gifts and could not marry again for five years,
under penalty of losing all civil rights. Her property
accrued to her husband to be kept in trust for
the children.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Justinian on divorce</div>
<p>Justinian made more minute regulations on the
subject of divorce. To the valid causes for
<a name="Page_67"></a>divorce as laid down by Theodosius and
Valentinian
he added impotence; if a separation was obtained
on this ground, the husband might
retain ante-nuptial gifts.<a name="FNanchor_250"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> Abortion
committed by the wife or bathing with other men
than her husband or inveigling other men to be her
paramours&#8212;these offences on the part of the wife
gave her husband the right of divorce.<a name="FNanchor_251"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> Captivity
of either party for a prolonged period of time was
always a valid reason. Justinian added also<a name="FNanchor_252"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a>
that a man who dismissed his wife without any of
the legal causes mentioned above existing or who
was himself guilty of any of these offences must
give to his wife one fourth of his property up to
a sum not to exceed one hundred <i>librae</i> of gold,
if he owned property worth four hundred <i>librae</i>
or more; if he had less, one fourth of all he possessed
was forfeit. The same penalties held for the wife
who presumed to dismiss her husband without the
offences legally recognised existing. The forfeited
money was at the free disposal of the blameless
party if there were no children; these being extant,
the property must be preserved intact for their
inheritance and merely the usufruct could be
enjoyed by the trustees. A woman who secured
a divorce through a fault of her husband had
always to wait at least a year before marrying
again <i>propter seminis confusionem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_253"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Justin revokes decrees of Justinian.</div>
<p><a name="Page_68"></a>Justin, the nephew and successor of Justinian,
reaffirmed the right to divorce by mutual consent,
thus abrogating the laws of his predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_254"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a>
Justinian had ordained
that if husband and wife separated by
mutual consent, they were to be forced to spend the
rest of their lives in a convent and forfeit to it
one third of their goods.<a name="FNanchor_255"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> Justin, then, made
the pious efforts of his uncle naught. Nothing
can more clearly illustrate than his decree how
small a power the Church still possessed to mould
the tenor of the law; for such a thing as divorce
by mutual consent, without any necessary reason,
was a serious misdemeanour in the eyes of the
Church Fathers, who passed upon it their severest
censures.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Adultery.</div>
<p>On the subject of adultery Justinian enacted
that if the husband was the guilty party, the dowry
and marriage donations must be given
his wife; but the rest of his property
accrued to his relatives, both in ascending and descending
lines, to the third degree; these failing, his
<a name="Page_69"></a>goods were confiscated to the royal purse.<a
 name="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a>
A
woman guilty of adultery was at once sent to a
monastery. After a space of two years her husband
could take her back again, if he so wished,
without prejudice. If he did not so desire, or if
he died, the woman was shorn and forced to spend
the rest of her life in a nunnery; two thirds of her
property were given to her relatives in descending
line, the other third to the monastery; if there were
no descendants, ascendants got one third and
the monastery two thirds; relatives failing, the
monastery took all; and in all cases goods inserted
in the dowry contract were to be kept for the
husband.<a name="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Second marriages. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Strict laws of Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.</div>
<p>The legislation of the earlier Christian emperors
on second marriages reflects the various
feelings of the Church Fathers on the
subject. Under the old law, people could marry
as often as they wished without any penalties.<a name="FNanchor_258"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>
But we have seen that among some of the Churchmen
second marriages were held in peculiar abhorrence,
and third nuptials were regarded as a
hideous sin; while the orthodox clergy, like St.
Augustine and St. Jerome, permitted second and
third marriages, but damned them with faint
praise and urged Christians to be content with
<a name="Page_70"></a>one venture. Public opinion, custom, and the
influence
of the old Roman law were too powerful
to allow Christian monarchs to become fanatical
on the subject<a name="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a>;
but certain stricter regulations
were introduced by the pious Gratian,
Valentinian, and Theodosius, in the
years 380, 381, and 382.<a name="FNanchor_260"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> As under
the old laws any widow who married
again before the legal time of mourning
&#8212;a year&#8212;had expired, became infamous and lost
both cast and all claims to the goods of her
deceased husband. She was furthermore not
permitted to give a second husband more than one
third of her property nor leave him more than one
third by will; and she could receive no intestate
succession beyond the third degree. A woman
who proceeded to a second marriage after the
legal period of mourning, must make over at once
to the children of the first marriage all the property
which her former husband had given or left to her.
As to her own personal property, she was allowed
to possess it and enjoy the income while she lived,
but not to alienate it or leave it by will to any one
except the children of the first marriage. As
I have before remarked, Roman law constantly
had the interest of the children at heart.<a name="FNanchor_261"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> If
<a name="Page_71"></a>there was no issue of the first marriage, then
the
woman had free control. A mother acquired full
right&#8212;as the old Senatus consultum Tertullianum
had decreed&#8212;to the property of a son or daughter
who died childless<a name="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a>;
but if she married a
second
time, and her son or daughter died without leaving
children or grandchildren, she was expelled from
all succession and distant relatives acquired the
property.<a name="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Justinian moderates these laws to a great degree.</div>
<p>Justinian changed these enactments to a pronounced
degree. "We are not making laws
that are too bitter against women
who marry a second time," he remarks,<a name="FNanchor_264"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a>
"and we do not want to lead them,
in consequence of such action, to the harsh
necessity, unworthy of our age, of abstaining
from a chaste second marriage and descending
to illegitimate connections." He ordained,
therefore, that the law mentioned above be
annulled and that mothers should have absolutely
unrestricted rights of inheritance to a
deceased child's property along with the latter's
brothers and sisters; and second marriage was
<a name="Page_72"></a>never to create any prejudice.<a
 name="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a>
In the earlier part
of his reign Justinian also forbade husband or
wife to leave one another property under the
stipulation that the surviving partner must not
marry again<a name="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a>;
but later, when his zeal for reform
had become more pronounced and fanatical, he
revoked this and gave the conditioned party the
option either of enjoying the property by remaining
unmarried or of forfeiting it by a second union.<a name="FNanchor_267"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Breaking of engagements.</div>
<p>Constantine ordained,<a name="FNanchor_268"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> in the year 336, that
if an engagement was broken by the death
of one of the contracting parties and
if the <i>osculum</i><a name="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>
had taken place, half
of whatever donations had been given was
to be handed over to the surviving party and
half to the heirs of the deceased; but if the
solemn <i>osculum</i> had not yet taken place, all
gifts went to the heirs of the deceased. There
was also a law that if either party broke the engagement
to enter monastic life, the man who did so
lost all that he had given by way of earnest
money for the marriage contract (<i>arrarum nomine</i>);
if it was the woman who took the initiative, she
was compelled to return twice the amount of any
sums she had received. This was changed by
<a name="Page_73"></a>Justinian, who enacted that those who broke
an engagement to enter monastic life should
merely return or receive whatever donations had
been made.<a name="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>
Constantine and his successors abrogated
the old time Julian laws, which had inflicted
certain penalties&#8212;such as limited rights of inheritance&#8212;on
men and women who did not marry.<a name="FNanchor_271"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Changes in the law of gifts.</div>
<p>I have already pointed out that gifts between
husband and wife were illegal and I have explained
the reasons. Justinian allowed the husband
to make donations to his wife, in
such wise, however, that all chance of
intent to defraud might be absent.<a name="FNanchor_272"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> He ordained
also that if husband or wife left the married state
to embrace a celibate life, each party was to keep
his or her own property as per marriage contract
or as each would legitimately in the case of the
other's death.<a name="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a>
If any one, after vowing the
monastic life, returned to the world, his or her
<a name="Page_74"></a>goods were forfeit to the monastery which he or
she had left.<a name="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Various enactments on marriage.</div>
<p>The consent of the father or, if he was dead, of
near relatives was emphatically declared necessary
by the Christian emperors for a marriage
and the woman had practically no will
of her own although, if several suitors
were proposed to her, she might be requested to
name which one she preferred.<a name="FNanchor_275"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a> Marriage with
a Jew was treated as adultery.<a name="FNanchor_276"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> Women who
belonged to heretical sects were to have no
privileges.<a name="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a>
Justinus and Justinian abrogated the
old law which forbade senators to marry freedwomen
or any woman who had herself or whose
parents had followed the stage. Actresses were
now permitted, on giving up their profession, to
claim all the rights of other free women; and a
senator could marry such or even a freedwoman
without prejudice.<a name="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Changes in the laws of inheritance.</div>
<p>Under the old law, as we have seen, a son and a
daughter had equal rights to intestate succession;
but beyond the relationship of daughter
to father or sister to brother women had
no rights to intestate succession unless
there were no agnates, that is, male relatives on
the father's side. Thus, an aunt would not be
called to the estate of a nephew who died childless,
<a name="Page_75"></a>but the uncle was regularly admitted. So, too, a
nephew was admitted to the intestate succession
of an uncle, who died without issue, but the niece
was shut out. All this was changed by Justinian,
who gave women the same rights of inheritance
as men under such conditions.<a name="FNanchor_279"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> If the children
were unorthodox, they were to have absolutely no
share of either parent's goods.<a name="FNanchor_280"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Women as guardians.</div>
<div class="sidenote"> In suits.</div>
<p>The Christian emperors permitted widows to be
guardians over their children if they
promised on oath not to marry again
and gave security against fraud.<a name="FNanchor_281"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> Justinian forbade
women to act by themselves in
any legal matters.<a name="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Bills of attainder.</div>
<p>Arcadius and Honorius (397 A.D.) enacted some
particularly savage bills of attainder, which were
in painful contrast to the clemency
of their pagan predecessors. Those
guilty of high treason were decapitated and their
goods escheated to the crown. "To the sons of
such a man [i.e., one condemned for high treason],"
write these amiable Christians,<a name="FNanchor_283"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> "we allow their
lives out of special royal mercy&#8212;for they ought
really to be put to death along with their fathers&#8212;but
they are to receive no inheritances. Let them
be paupers forever; let the infamy of their father
ever follow them; they may never aspire to office;
<a name="Page_76"></a>in their lasting poverty let death be a relief
and
life a punishment. Finally, any one who tries to
intercede for these with us is also to be infamous."<a
 name="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a>
However, to the daughters of the condemned these
emperors graciously granted one fourth of their
mother's but not any of their father's goods. In
the case of crimes other than high treason the
children or grandchildren were allowed one half of
the estate.<a name="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a>
Constantine decreed that a wife's
property was not to be affected by the condemnation
of her husband.<a name="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Rape.</div>
<p>Ravishers of women, even of slaves and freedwomen,
were punished by Justinian with death;
but in the case of freeborn women only
did the property of the guilty man and
his abettors become forfeit to the outraged victim.
A woman no longer had the privilege of demanding
her assailant in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_287"></a><a

<h2><a name="Page_77"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2>WOMEN AMONG THE GERMANIC PEOPLES</h2>
<p>A second world force had now come into its
own. The new power was the Germanic
peoples, those wandering tribes who, after shattering
the Roman Empire, were destined to form
the modern nations of Europe and to find in
Christianity the religion most admirably adapted
to fill their spiritual needs and shape their ideals.
In the year 476 the barbarian Odoacer ascended
the throne of the Caesars. He still pretended to
govern by virtue of the authority delegated to him
by Zeno, emperor at Constantinople; but the rupture
between East and West was becoming final
and after the reign of Justinian (527-565) it was
practically complete. Henceforth the eastern
empire had little or nothing to do with western
Europe and subsisted as an independent monarchy
until Constantinople was taken by the Turks in
1453. I shall not concern myself with it any
longer.</p>
<p>In western Europe, then, new races with new
ideals were forming the nations that to-day are
England, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and
Austria. It is interesting to note what some of
<a name="Page_78"></a>these barbarians thought about women and what
place they assigned them.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
Julius Caesar's account.</div>
<p>Our earliest authorities on the subject are
Julius Caesar and Tacitus. Caesar informs us<a name="FNanchor_288"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a>
that among the Gauls marriage was a
well recognized institution. The husband
contributed of his own goods the same
amount that his wife brought by way of dowry;
the combined property and its income were enjoyed
on equal terms by husband and wife. If husband
or wife died, all the property became the possession
of the surviving partner. Yet the husband
had full power of life and death over his wife as
over his children; and if, upon the decease of a
noble, there were suspicions regarding the manner
of his death, his wife was put to inquisitorial
torture and was burnt at the stake when adjudged
guilty of murder. Among the Germans women
seem to have been held in somewhat greater respect.
German matrons were esteemed as prophetesses
and no battle was entered upon unless they
had first consulted the lots and given assurance
that the fight would be successful.<a name="FNanchor_289"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> As for the
British, who were not a Germanic people, Caesar
says that they practiced polygamy and near
relatives were accustomed to have wives in
common.<a name="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> The account of Tacitus.</div>
<p>Tacitus wrote a century and a half after Julius
<a name="Page_79"></a>Caesar when the tribes had become better known
the Romans; hence we get from him more detailed
information. From him we
learn that both the Sitones&#8212;a people
of northern Germany&#8212;and the British often bestowed
the royal power on women, a circumstance
which aroused the strong contempt of Tacitus,
who was in this respect of a conservative mind.<a name="FNanchor_291"></a><a

a whole book in which he idealises that nation as
a contrast to the lax morality of civilised Rome,
much as Rousseau in the eighteenth century
extolled the virtues of savages in a state of nature.
What Tacitus says in regard to lofty morals we
shall do well to take with a pinch of salt; but
we may with more safety trust his accuracy
when he depicts national customs. From Tacitus
we learn that the Germans believed something
divine resided in women<a name="FNanchor_293"></a><a

them as prophetesses.<a name="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a>

<div class="sidenote"> The written laws of the barbarians.</div>
<p>We see, then, that by no means all of these
barbarian nations had the same standards in
regard to women. Of written laws there were
<a name="Page_81"></a>none as yet. But contact with the civilisation
of Rome had its effect; and when Goths, Burgunindians,
Franks, and Lombards had
founded new states on the ruins of the
western Roman Empire, the national
laws of the Germanic tribes began to be collected
and put into writing at the close of the fifth century.
Between the fifth and the ninth centuries we
get the Visigothic, Burgundian, Salic, Ripuarian,
Alemannic, Lombardian, Bavarian, Frisian, Saxon,
and Thuringian law books. They are written in
medieval Latin and are not elaborated on a scientific
basis. Three distinct influences are to be
seen in them: <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1) </span>native race
customs, ideals, and
traditions; <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2)</span> Christianity; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">(3)</span> the Roman civil
law, which was felt more or less in all, but especially
in the case of the Visigoths; as was natural,
since this people had been brought into closest
touch with Rome. Inasmuch as the barbarians
allowed all peoples conquered by them to be tried
under their own laws, the old Roman civil law
was still potent in all its strength in cases affecting
a Roman. Let us endeavour to glean what we
can from the barbarian codes on the matter of
women's rights.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
Guardianship.</div>
<p>The woman was always to be under guardianship
among the Germanic peoples and could never be
independent under any conditions. Perhaps
we should rather call the power
(<i>mundium</i>) wielded by father, brother, husband, or
other male relative a protectorate; for in those early
<a name="Page_82"></a>days among rude peoples any legal action might
involve fighting to prove the merits of one's case,
and the woman would therefore constantly need a
champion to assert her rights in the lists. Thus the
woman was under the perpetual guardianship of a
male relative and must do nothing without his consent,
under penalty of losing her property.<a name="FNanchor_304"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> Her
guardian arranged her marriage for her as he
wished, provided only that he chose a free man
for her husband<a name="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a>;
if the woman, whether
virgin
or widow, married without his consent, she lost
all power to inherit the goods of her relatives<a name="FNanchor_306"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a>;
and her husband was forced to pay to her kin a
recompense amounting to 600 <i>solidi</i> among the
Saxons, 186 among the Burgundians.<a name="FNanchor_307"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
Marriage.</div>
<p><a name="Page_83"></a>The feeling of caste was very strong; a woman
must not marry below her station.<a name="FNanchor_308"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a> By a law
of the Visigoths she who tried to marry
her own slave was to be burned alive<a name="FNanchor_309"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a>;
if she attempted it with another's bondman, she
merited one hundred lashes.<a name="FNanchor_310"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> The dowry was a
fixed institution as among the Romans; but the
bridegroom regularly paid a large sum to the father
or guardian of the woman. This <i>wittemon</i> was
regarded as the price paid for the parental authority
(<i>mundium</i>) and amounted among the
Saxons to 300 <i>solidi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_311"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> As a matter of fact this
custom practically amounted to the intended
husband giving the dowry to his future wife. The
husband was also allowed to present his wife with
a donation (<i>morgengabe</i>) on the morning after the
<a name="Page_84"></a>wedding; the amount was limited by King Liutprand
to not more than one fourth of all his goods.<a name="FNanchor_312"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a>
Breaking an engagement after the solemn betrothal
had been entered into was a serious
business. The Visigoths refused to allow one party
to break an engagement without the consent of
the other; and if a woman, being already engaged,
went over to another man without her parent's
or fianc&eacute;'s leave, both she and the man who took
her were handed over as slaves to the original
fianc&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a>
The other barbarians were content to
inflict a money fine for breach of promise.<a name="FNanchor_314"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
Power of the husband.</div>
<p>The woman on marrying passed into the power
of her husband "according to the Sacred Scriptures,"
and the husband thereupon acquired
the lordship of all her property.<a name="FNanchor_315"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a>
The law still protected the wife in some ways.
The Visigoths gave the father the right of demanding
and preserving for his daughter her dowry.<a name="FNanchor_316"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a>
The Ripuarians ordained that whatever the hus<a name="Page_85"></a>band
had given his wife by written agreement
must remain inviolate.<a name="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a>
King Liutprand made
the presence of two or three of the woman's male
relatives necessary at any sale involving her goods,
to see to it that her consent to the sale had not
been forced.<a name="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
Divorce.</div>
<p>On the subject of divorce the regulations of the
several peoples are various; but the commands of
the New Testament are alike strongly felt
in all; and we may expect to find divorce
limited by severe restrictions.<a name="FNanchor_319"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> The Burgundians
allowed it only for adultery or grave crimes, such
as violating tombs. If a wife presumed to dismiss
her husband for any other cause, she was put to
death (<i>necetur in luto</i>); to a husband who sent his
wife a divorce without these specific reasons existing
the law was more indulgent, allowing him to
preserve his life by paying to his injured wife twice
the amount that he had originally given her
parents for her, and twelve <i>solidi</i> in addition; and
in case he attempted to prove her guilty of one of
the charges mentioned above and she was adjudged
innocent, he forfeited all his goods to her
and was forced to leave his home.<a name="FNanchor_320"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> The Visigoths
<a name="Page_86"></a>were equally strict; the husband who dismissed
his
wife on insufficient legal grounds lost all power
over her and must return all her goods; his own
must be preserved for the children; if there were
none, the wife acquired his property. A woman
who married a divorced man while his first wife
was living, was condemned for adultery and
accordingly handed over to the first wife to be
disposed of as the latter wished; exile, stripes, and
slavery were the lot of a man who took another
wife while his first partner was still alive.<a name="FNanchor_321"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> The
Alemanni and the Bavarians, who were more
remote from Italy and hence from the Church,
were influenced more by their own customs and
allowed a pecuniary recompense to take the place
of the harsher enactments.<a name="FNanchor_322"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Adultery.</div>
<p>Adultery was not only a legal cause for divorce,
but also a grave crime. All the barbarian peoples
are agreed in so regarding it, but their
penalties vary according as they were
more or less affected by proximity to Italy, where
the power of the Church was naturally strongest.
The Ripuarians, the Bavarians, and the Alemanni
preferred a money fine ranging from fifty to two
hundred <i>solidi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_323"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> Among the Visigoths the
guilty
party was usually bound over in servitude to the
injured person to be disposed of as the latter
<a name="Page_87"></a>wished.<a name="FNanchor_324"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a> Sometimes the law was
harsher to
women than to men; thus, according to a decree
of Liutprand,<a name="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a>
a husband who told his wife to
commit adultery or who did so himself paid a
mulct of fifty <i>solidi</i> to the wife's male relatives;
but if the wife consented to or hid the deed, she
was put to death. The laws all agree that the
killing of adulterers taken in the act could not be
regarded as murder.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> The Church indulgent toward kings.</div>
<p>It is always to be remembered that although the
statutes were severe enough, yet during this period,
as indeed throughout all history, they
were defied with impunity. Charlemagne,
for example, the most Christian
monarch, had a large number of concubines and
divorced a wife who did not please him; yet his
biographer Einhard, pious monk as he was, has no
word of censure for his monarch's irregularities<a name="FNanchor_326"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a>;
and policy prevented the Church from thundering
at a king who so valiantly crushed the heretics, her
enemies. Bishop Gregory of Tours tells us without
a hint of being shocked that Clothacharius,
King of the Franks, had many concubines.<a name="FNanchor_327"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> Con<a name="Page_88"></a>cubinage
was, in fact, the regular thing.<a name="FNanchor_328"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> But
neither in that age, nor later in the case of Louis
XIV, nor in our own day in the case of Leopold of
Belgium has the Church had a word of reproach
for monarchs who broke with impunity moral laws
on which she claims always to have insisted without
compromise.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Remarriage.</div>
<p>In accordance with the commands of Scripture
neither the divorced man nor the divorced woman
could marry again during the lifetime
of the other party. To do so was to
commit adultery, for which the usual penalties
went into effect.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Property rights and powers.</div>
<p>A woman's property would consist of any or
all of these:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span> Her share of the property
of
parents or brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span> Her dowry and whatever
nuptial donations
(<i>morgengabe</i>) her husband had given her,
and whatever she had earned together with her
husband.</p>
<p>There could be no account of single women's
property or disposal of what they earned, because
in the half-civilised state of things which then
obtained there was no such thing as women
engaging in business; indeed, not even men of any
pretension did so; war was their work. The
unmarried woman was content to sit by the fire
<a name="Page_89"></a>and spin under the guardianship and support of a
male relative. Often she would enter a convent.</p>
<p>I shall first discuss the laws of inheritance as
affecting women, in order to note what property
she was allowed to acquire. In this connection
it is well to bear in mind a difference between
Roman and Germanic law. The former viewed
an inheritance as consisting always of a totality
of all goods, whether of money, land, movables,
cattle, dress, or what not. But among the
Germanic peoples land, money, ornaments, and the
like were regarded as so many distinct articles of
inheritance, to some of which women might have
legal claims of succession, but not necessarily to
all. This is most emphatically shown in the case
of land. Of all the barbarian peoples, the Ripuarians
alone allowed women the right to succeed
to land.<a name="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a>
Among other nations a daughter or
sister or mother, whoever happened to be the
nearest heir, would get the money, slaves, etc.,
but the nearest <i>male</i> kin would get the land.<a
 name="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a>
Only if male kin were lacking to the fifth degree&#8212;an improbable
contingency&#8212;did alodial inheritance "pass from the lance
to the spindle."<a name="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a>
<a name="Page_90"></a>In respect to all other things a daughter was
co-heir
with a son to the estate of a father or mother.
According to the Salic and </p>
<p>Ripuarian law this
would be one order of succession<a name="FNanchor_332"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a>:</p>

</table>
<p>It will be observed that in such a succession these
laws are more partial to women relatives than the
Roman law; an aunt, for example, is called before
an uncle. An uncle would certainly exclude an
aunt under the Roman law; but most of the
Germanic codes allowed them an equal succession.<a name="FNanchor_333"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a>
Nevertheless, when women did inherit under
the former, they acquired the land also. Moreover,
the woman among the Germanic nations
must always be under guardianship; and whereas
under the Empire the power of the guardian was
in practice reduced to nullity, as I have shown,
among the barbarians it was extremely powerful,
because to assert one's rights often involved
fighting in the lists to determine the judgment
<a name="Page_91"></a>of God. It was a settled conviction among the
Germanic peoples that God would give the victory
to the rightful claimant. As women could not
fight, a champion or guardian was a necessity.
This was not true in Roman courts, which preferred
to settle litigation by juristic reasoning and believed,
like Napoleon, that God, when appealed to
in a fight, was generally on the side of the party
who had the better artillery.</p>
<p>Children inherited not only the estate but also
the friendships and enmities of their fathers, which
it was their duty to take up. Hereditary feuds
were a usual thing.<a name="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a>
King Liutprand ordaine<a name="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a>
however, that if a daughter alone survived, the
feud was to be brought to an end and an agreement
effected.</p>
<p>Some of the nations seem to have provided
that children must not be disinherited except for
very strong reasons; for example, the law of the
Visigoths<a name="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a>
forbids more than one third of their
estate being alienated by mother or father,
grandmother or grandfather. The Alemanni permitted
a free man to leave all his property to the
Church and his heirs had no redress<a name="FNanchor_337"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a>; but the
Bavarians compelled him before entering monastic
life to distribute among his children their proportionate
parts.<a name="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Property of the married woman.</div>
<p><a name="Page_92"></a>We may pass now to the property rights of the
married woman. The relation of her husband
to the dowry I have already explained.
The dowry was conceived as being
ultimately for the children; only when
there were no children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren
did the woman have licence to dispose
of the dowry as she wished: this was the law
among the Visigoths.<a name="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a>
The dowry, then, was
to revert to the children or grandchildren at the
death of the wife; if there were none such, to the
parents or relatives who had given her in marriage;
these failing, it escheated to the Crown&#8212;so
according to Rotharis.<a name="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a>
By the laws of the
Visigoths<a name="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a>
when the wife died, her husband continued
in charge of the property; but, as under the
Roman law, he had to preserve it entire for the
children, though he might enjoy the usufruct.
When a son or daughter married, their father must
at once give them their share of their mother's
goods, although he could still receive the income
of one third of the portion. If son or daughter
did not marry, they received one half their share
on becoming twenty years of age; their father
might claim the interest of the other half while
he lived; but at his death he must leave it to them.
When a woman left no children, her father or nearest
male kin usually demanded the dowry back.<a name="FNanchor_342"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a>
<a name="Page_93"></a>When the husband died, his estate did not go to
wife, but to his children or other relatives.<a name="FNanchor_343"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a>
If however, any property had been earned by the
joint labour of husband and wife, the latter had a
right to one half among the Westfalians; to one
third among the Ripuarians; to nothing among the
Ostfalians.<a name="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a>
Children remained in the power of
their mother if she so desired and provided she
remained a widow. A mother usually had the
enjoyment of her dowry until her death, when she
must leave it to her children or to the donor or
nearest relative.<a name="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a>
If the husband died
without
issue, some nations allowed the wife a certain
succession to her husband's goods, provided that
she did not marry again. Thus, the Burgundians
gave her under such conditions one third of her
husband's estate to be left to his heirs, however, at
her death.<a name="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a>
The Bavarians, too, under the same
conditions allowed her one half of her husband's
goods<a name="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a>
and even if there was issue, granted her
the right to the interest of as much as one child
received.<a name="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>
<p>A widow who married again lost the privilege
<a name="Page_94"></a>of guardianship over her children, who thereupon
passed to a male relative of the first husband. As
to the dowry of the prior union the woman must
make it over at once to her children according to
some laws or, according to others, might receive
the usufruct during life and leave it to the children
of the first marriage at her death. Any right to the
property of her first husband she of course lost.<a name="FNanchor_349"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a>
When there was no issue of the first marriage
then the dowry and nuptial donations could
usually follow her to a second union.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Criminal law pertaining to women.</div>
<p>Criminal law among these half civilised
nations could not but be a crude affair. Their
civilisation was in a state of flux, and
immediate practical convenience was
the only guide. They were content to
fix the penalties for such outrages as murder, rape,
insult, assault, and the like in money; the Visigoths
alone were more stringent in a case of rape,
adding 200 lashes and slavery to the ravisher of
a free woman who had accomplished his purpose.<a name="FNanchor_350"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a>
Some enactments which may well strike us as
peculiar deserve notice. For example, among the
Saxons the theft of a horse or an ox or anything
worth three <i>solidi</i> merited death; but murder
was atoned for by pecuniary damages.<a name="FNanchor_351"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a> Among
<a name="Page_95"></a>the Burgundians, if a man stole horses or cattle
and his wife did not at once disclose the deed,
she and her children who were over fourteen were
bound over in slavery to the outraged party "because
it hath often been ascertained, that these
women are the confederates of their husbands in
crime."<a name="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>
<p>The most minute regulations prevailed on the
subject of injury to women. Under the Salic law<a name="FNanchor_353"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_353"><sup>[353]</sup></a>
for instance, if a free man struck a free women on
the fingers or hand, he had to pay fifteen <i>solidi</i>;
if he struck her arm, thirty <i>solidi</i>; if above her
elbow, thirty-five <i>solidi</i>; if he hit her breast, forty-five
<i>solidi</i>. The penalties for murdering a free
woman were also elaborated on the basis of her
value to the state as a bearer of children. By the
same Salic law<a name="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a>
injury to a pregnant woman
resulting in her death merited a fine of seven
hundred <i>solidi</i>; but two hundred was deemed
sufficient for murder of one after her time
for bearing children had passed. Similarly, for
killing a free woman after she had begun to
have children the transgressor paid six hundred
<i>solidi</i>; but for murdering an unmarried freeborn
girl only two hundred. The murder
of a free woman was punished usually by a fine
<a name="Page_96"></a>(<i>wergeld</i>) equal to twice the amount
demanded
for a free man "because," as the law of the Bavarians
has it,<a name="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a>
"a woman can not defend herself
with arms. But if, in the boldness of her heart
(per audaciam cordis sui), she shall have resisted
and fought like a man, there shall not be a double
penalty, but only the recompense usual for a man
[160 <span style="font-style: italic;">solidi</span>]." Fines were not
paid to the state,
but to the injuried parties or, if these did not
survive, to the nearest kin. If the fine could not
be paid, then might death be meted to the guilty.<a name="FNanchor_356"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>
<p>Another peculiar feature of the Germanic law
was the appeal to God to decide a moot point by
various ordeals. For example, by the laws of the
Angles and Werini, if a woman was accused of
murdering her husband, she would ask a male
relative to assert her innocence by a solemn oath<a name="FNanchor_357"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a>
or, if necessary, by fighting for her as her champion
in the lists. God was supposed to give the victory
to the champion who defended an innocent party.
<a name="Page_97"></a>If she could find no champion, she was permitted
to
walk barefoot over nine red-hot ploughshares<a name="FNanchor_358"></a><a

and if she was innocent, God would not, of course,
allow her to suffer any injury in the act.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Women in slavery.</div>
<p>Perhaps a word on the status of women in
slavery among the Germanic nations will not be
out of place. The new nations looked
upon a slave as a chattel, much as the
Romans did. If a wrong was done a slave woman,
her master received a recompense from the
aggressor, but she did not, for to hold property
was denied her. But we may well believe that the
great value which the Church put on chastity
and conjugal fidelity rendered the slave woman
less exposed to the brutal passions of her lord
than had been the case under the Empire. Thus,
by a law of King Liutprand, a master who committed
adultery with the wife of a slave was
compelled to free both<a name="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a>;
and the Visigot<a name="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a>
inflicted
fifty lashes and a fine of twenty <i>solidi</i> upon
the man who used violence to another man's slave
woman.</p>
<p>On comparing the position of women under
Roman law and under the Germanic nations, as
we have observed them thus far, we should note
first of all that under the latter women benefited
chiefly by the insistence of the Church on the value
<a name="Page_98"></a>of chastity in both sexes. That in those days the
passions of men were difficult to restrain in practice
does not invalidate the real service done the
world by the ideal that was insisted upon,<a name="FNanchor_361"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a> an
ideal which was certainly not held in pagan
antiquity except by a few great minds. Although
the social position of woman was thus improved,
the character of the age and the sentiments of the
Bible which I have already quoted made her status
far inferior to her condition under Roman law so
far as her legal rights were concerned. In a
period<a name="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a>
when the assertion of one's rights constantly
demanded fighting, the woman was forced
to rely on the male to champion her; the Church,
in accordance with the dicta of the Apostles, encouraged
and indeed commanded her to confine
herself to the duties of the household, to leave legal
matters to men, and to be guided by their advice;
and thus she was prevented from asserting herself
out of regard for the strong public opinion on the
subject, which was quite alien to the sentiments
of the old Roman law. Henceforward also we
are to have law based on old customs and <i>theology</i>,<a
 name="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a>
not on practical convenience or scientific reasoning.<br>

<p> It was deemed sufficient for a male relative, say, the father,
to assert the innocence of the woman under solemn oath: for
it was thought that he would be unwilling to do this if he knew
the woman was guilty and so incur eternal Hell-fire as a punishment
for perjury. An example of this solemn ceremony is
told interestingly by Gregory of Tours, 5, 33. A woman at
Paris was charged by her husband's relatives with adultery and
was demanded to be put to death. Her father took a solemn
oath that she was innocent. Far from being content with this,
the husband's kin began a fight and the matter ended in a wholesale
butchery at the church of St. Dionysius.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_100"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2>DIGRESSION OF THE LATER HISTORY OF
ROMAN LAW</h2>
<br>
<p>With Charlemagne, who was crowned Emperor
by the Pope in the year 800, began
the definite union of Church and State and the
Church's temporal power. Henceforth for seven
centuries, until the Reformation, we shall have
to reckon with canon law as a supreme force in
determining the question of the position of
women. A brief survey of the later history of
the old Roman Law will not be out of place in
order to note what influence, if any, it continued
to exert down the ages.</p>
<p>The body of the Roman law, compiled by
order of Justinian (527-565 A.D.), was intended
primarily for the eastern empire; but when, in the
year 535, the Emperor conquered the western
Goths, who then ruled Italy, he ordered his laws
taught in the school of jurisprudence at Rome
and practiced in the courts. I have already remarked
that the barbarians who overran Italy
allowed the vanquished the right to be judged in
most cases by their own code. But the splendid
fabric of the Roman law was too elaborate a
<a name="Page_101"></a>system to win the attentive study of a rude
people; the Church had its own canons, the people
their own ancestral customs; and until the twelfth
century no development of the Roman Civil Code
took place. Finally, during the twelfth century,
the great school at Bologna renewed the study
with vigour, and Italy at the present day derives
the basic principles of its civil law from the Corpus
of Justinian. Practically the same story holds
true of France,<a name="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a>
of Spain, and of the
Netherlands,
all of whom have been influenced particularly by
the great jurists of the sixteenth century who were
simply carrying further the torch that had been
lit so enthusiastically at Bologna in the twelfth
century.</p>
<p>As to Germany,<a name="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a>
when that unhappy
country
had been separated from France and Italy after
the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Carlovingian law and
the ancient German law books fell into disuse.
The law again rested on unwritten customs, on
the decisions of the judges and their assessors, and
on agreements of the interested parties (feudal
services and tenures). Not till the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries was any record made of
the rules of law which had arisen; many laws of
cities on various matters and in various provinces
were recorded by public authority; and thus
<a name="Page_102"></a>originated the so-called law books of the Middle
Ages, the private labours of experienced men, who
set forth the legal principles which were recognised
in all Germany, or at least in certain parts of it.
There were no law schools as yet, and scientific
compilation of German law was not even thought
of. After the University of Bologna had revived
the study of Roman law in Italy, the Italian
universities attracted the German youth, who on
their return would labour to introduce what they
had learned. Their efforts were seconded by the
clergy, through the close connection with canon
law which was in force in Germany. German
emperors and territorial lords also favoured Roman
law because they saw how well suited it was to
absolutism; they liked to engage jurists trained
in Italy, especially if they were doctors of both
canon and Roman law. Nor did the German
people object. From the fourteenth century
many schools of jurisprudence were established
on Italian models.</p>
<p>At present, the law of Justinian has only such
force as is received by usage or as it has acquired by
recognition. <span style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span> The Roman law
forms in Germany
the principal law in some branches, that is,
it is in so far its basis that the German law is
only an addition or modification of it. In other
branches it is only supplementary, that is, it is
merely subsidiary to the German law. <span style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span>
Only
the glossed parts and passages of Justinian's
law collection have binding force in Germany. <a name="Page_103"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">III.</span> Only those glossed passages are
binding
which contain the latest rule of law. Consequently
the historical materials contained in them,
though always of great importance for discovering
the latest law, have not binding force. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">IV.</span> Those
precepts of the Roman law which relate to Roman
manners and institutions unknown in Germany are
inapplicable here, though glossed. <span style="font-weight: bold;">V.</span>
The Roman
law has but slight application to such objects
and transactions as were unknown to the Romans
and are of purely Germanic origin. <span style="font-weight: bold;">VI.</span>
With
the limitations above enumerated the Roman law
has been adopted as a whole and not in detached
parts.</p>
<p>In England Roman law has had practically
no effect. In the year 1149 a Lombard jurist,
Vacarius, lectured on it at Oxford; but there were
no results. Canon law is, of course, a force to be
reckoned with in Britain as on the Continent.</p>
<p>Before we enter the question of women's rights
during the Middle Ages, we must take a general
survey of the character of that period; for obviously
we cannot understand its legislation without
some idea of the background of social, political,
and intellectual life. In the first place, then, the
Church was everywhere triumphant and its
ideals governed legislation completely on such
matters as marriage. The civil law of Rome, as
drawn up first by the epitomisers and later studied
more carefully at Bologna, served to indicate
<a name="Page_104"></a>general principles in cases to which canon law
did not apply; but there was little jurisdiction in
which the powers ecclesiastical could not contrive
to take a hand. At the same time Germanic
ideals and customs continued a powerful force.
For a long time after the partition of the vast
empire of Charlemagne government was in a state
of chaos and transition from which eventually the
various distinct states arose. A struggle between
kings and nobles for supremacy dragged along
for many generations; and as during that contest
each feudal lord was master in his own domain,
there was no consistent code of laws for all countries
or, indeed, for the same country. Yet the
character of the age determined in a general way
the spirit that dictated all laws. Society rested
on a military and aristocratic basis, and when
the ability to wield arms is essential to maintain
one's rights, the position of women will be affected
by that fact. Beginning with the twelfth century
city life began to exert a political influence; and
this, again, did not fail to have an effect on the
status of women. Of any participation of women
in intellectual life there could be no question
until the Renaissance, although we do meet here
and there with isolated exceptions, a few ladies of
high degree like Roswitha of Gandersheim and
Hadwig, Duchess of Swabia, niece of Otto the
Great, and Heloise. The learning was exclusively
scholastic, and from any share in that women were
barred. When people are kept in ignorance, there
<a name="Page_105"></a>is less inducement for them to believe that they
have any rights or to assert them if they do
think so.</p>
<p>We shall do well to bear in mind, in noting the
laws relative to women, that theory is one thing
and practice quite another. Hence, although the
doctrines of the Church on various matters touching
the female sex were characterised by the
greatest purity, we shall see that in practice they
were not strictly executed. Religion does in fact
play a less considerable part in regulating the
daily acts of men than theologians are inclined to
believe. If anything proves this, it is the history of
that foulest stain on Christian nations&#8212;prostitution.
We might expect that since the Roman
Catholic Church insists so on chastity the level
of this virtue would certainly be higher in countries
which are almost exclusively Catholic, like Spain
and Italy, than in Protestant lands; but no one
who has ever travelled in Spain or Italy fails to
recognise that the conduct of men is as lamentably
low in these as in England, Germany, or the
United States.</p>
<p>With this brief introduction I shall proceed next
to explain the position of women under the canon
law, a code which affected all countries of Europe
equally until the Reformation; and in connection
with this I shall give some idea of the attitude of
the Roman Catholic Church towards women and
women's rights at the present day.<br>

<h2>THE CANON LAW AND THE ATTITUDE OF THE
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
The canon law reaffirms the subjection of women.</div>
<p>The canon law reaffirms woman's subjection to
man in no uncertain terms. The wife must
be submissive and obedient to her husband.<a name="FNanchor_366"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a>
She must never, under penalty
of excommunication, cut off her hair,
because "God has given it to her as a veil and
as a sign of her subjection."<a name="FNanchor_367"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> A woman who
assumed men's garments was accursed<a name="FNanchor_368"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a>; it will be
remembered that the breaking of this law was
one of the charges which brought Joan of Arc
to the stake. However learned and holy, woman
<a name="Page_107"></a>must never presume to teach men publicly.<a
 name="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a>
She was not allowed to bring a criminal action
except in cases of high treason or to avenge the
death of near relatives.<a name="FNanchor_370"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> Parents could dedicate
a daughter to God while she was yet an infant;
and this parental vow bound her to the nunnery
when she was mature, whether she was willing or
not.<a name="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a>
Virgins or widows who had once consecrated
themselves to God might not marry under pain of
excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372"><sup>[372]</sup></a>
Parents could not
prevent a
daughter from taking vows, if she so wished, after
she had attained the age of twelve.<a name="FNanchor_373"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Woman and marriage under canon law.</div>
<p>The most important effect of the canon law
was on marriage, which was now a sacrament
and had its sanction not in
the laws of men, but in the express <a name="Page_108"></a>decrees
of God. Hence even engagements acquired
a sacred character unknown to the Roman law;
and when a betrothal had once been entered into,
it could be broken only in case one or both
of the contracting parties desired to enter a
monastery.<a name="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a>
Free consent of both man and
woman was necessary for matrimony.<a name="FNanchor_375"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a> There
must also be a dowry and a public ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_376"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a>
The legitimate wife is thus defined<a name="FNanchor_377"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a>: "A chaste
virgin, betrothed in chastity, dowered according to
law, given to her betrothed by her parents, and
received from the hands of the bridesmaids (<i>a
paranimphis accipienda</i>); she is to be taken
according to the laws and the Gospel and the
marriage ceremony must be public; all the days
of her life&#8212;unless by consent for brief periods to
<a name="Page_109"></a>devote to worship&#8212;she is never to be separated
from her husband; for the cause of adultery she is
to be dismissed, but while she lives her husband
may marry no other." The blessing of the priest
was necessary. About every form connected with
the marriage service the Church threw its halo of
mystery and symbol to emphasise the sacred
character of the union. Thus<a name="FNanchor_378"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a>: "Women are
veiled during the marriage ceremony for this
reason, that they may know they are lowly and
in subjection to their husbands.... A ring is
given by the bridegroom to his betrothed either
as a sign of mutual love or rather that their hearts
may be bound together by this pledge. For this
reason, too, the ring is worn on the fourth finger,
because there is a certain vein in that finger which
they say reaches to the heart."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
Clandestine marriages.</div>
<p>Clandestine marriages were forbidden,<a name="FNanchor_379"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_379"><sup>[379]</sup></a> but the
Church always presumed everything it could in
favour of marriage and its indissolubility.
Thus, Gratian remarks<a name="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380"><sup>[380]</sup></a>:
"Clandestine
marriages are, to be sure, contrary to law; nevertheless,
they can not be dissolved." The reason
for forbidding them was perfectly reasonable:
one party might change his or her mind and there
would be no positive proof that a marriage had
taken place, so that a grave injury might be inflicted
on an innocent partner by an unscrupulous
<a name="Page_110"></a>one who desired to dissolve the union.<a
 name="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a>
Yet the
marriage by consent alone without any of the
ceremonies or the blessing of the priest was
perfectly valid, though not "according to law"
(<i>legitimum</i>), and could not be dissolved.<a name="FNanchor_382"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a>
Not
until the great Council of Trent in 1563 was this
changed. At that time all marriages were declared
invalid unless they had been contracted in
the presence of a priest and two or three witnesses.<a
 name="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Protection to women.</div>
<p>The Church is seen in its fairest light in its
provisions to protect the wife from sexual brutality
on the part of her husband, and it
deserves high praise for its stand on
such matters.<a name="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a>
Various other laws show the same
regard for the interests of women. A man who was
entering priestly office could not cast off his wife
and leave her destitute, but must provide living
and raiment for her.<a name="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a>
Neither husband nor wife
could embrace the celibate life nor devote themselves
to continence without the consent of the
other.<a name="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a>
A man who cohabited with a woman as his
<a name="Page_111"></a>concubine, even though she was of servile
condition
or questionable character, could not dismiss her
and marry another saving for adultery.<a name="FNanchor_387"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> Slaves
were now allowed to contract marriages and
masters were not permitted to dissolve them.<a name="FNanchor_388"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Divorce.</div>
<p>It has always been and still is the boast of the
Roman Catholic Church that it has been the
supreme protector of women on account
of its stand on divorce. Says Cardinal
Gibbons<a name="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a>:
"Christian wives and mothers, what
gratitude you owe to the Catholic Church for the
honorable position you now hold in society! If
you are no longer regarded as the slave, but the
equal, of your husbands; if you are no longer the
toy of his caprice, and liable to be discarded at any
moment; but if you are recognised as the mistress
and queen of your household, you owe your emancipation
to the Church. You are especially indebted
for your liberty to the Popes who rose up
in all the majesty of their spiritual power to vindicate
the rights of injured wives against the lustful
tyranny of their husbands." In view of such a
claim I may be justified in entering a somewhat
more detailed account of this subject.</p>
<p>On the subject of divorce the Roman Catholic
Church took the decided position which it continues
to maintain at the present day. Marriage when
<a name="Page_112"></a>entered upon under all the conditions demanded
by the Church for a valid union is indissoluble.<a name="FNanchor_390"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a>
A separation "from bed and board" (<i>quoad
thorum seu quoad cohabitationem</i>) is allowed for
various causes, such as excessive cruelty, for a
determinate or an indeterminate period; but
there is no absolute divorce even for adultery.
For this cause a separation may, indeed, take
place, but the bond of matrimony is not dissolved
thereby and neither the innocent nor the guilty
party may marry again during the lifetime of the
other partner.</p>
<p>All this seems very rigorous. It is true that
the Roman Catholic Church does not permit
"divorce." But it allows fourteen cases where a
marriage can be declared absolutely null and void,
as if it had never existed; and in these cases the
man or woman may marry again. To say that
the Roman Church does not allow divorce is,
therefore, playing upon words. The instruments
used to render its strict theory ineffective are
"diriment impediments" and "dispensations."</p>
<p>By the doctrine of "diriment impediments" the
Pope or a duly constituted representative can
declare that a marriage has been null and void
from the very beginning because of some impediment
defined in the canon law. Canon IV of the
twenty-fourth session of the Council of Trent
<a name="Page_113"></a>anathematises anyone who shall say that the
Church cannot constitute impediments dissolving
marriage, or that she has erred in constituting
them. The impediments which can annul marriage
are described in the official Catholic Encyclopedia,
vol. vii, pages 697-698. Among them are
impuberty and impotency. Then there is "disparity
of worship," which renders void the marriage
of a Christian&#8212;that is, a Roman Catholic,
with an infidel,&#8212;that is, one who is unbaptised.
Marriage of a Roman Catholic with a baptised non-Catholic
constitutes a "relative" impediment and
needs a special dispensation and provisoes, such as
a guarantee to bring up the children in the Roman
faith to give it validity. Another impediment is
based on the presumption of want of consent,
"the nullity being caused by a defect of consent."
"This defect," says the Catholic Encyclopedia,
"may arise from the intellect or the will; hence
we have two classes. Arising from the intellect
we have: insanity; and total ignorance, even if in
confuso of what marriage is (this ignorance, however,
is not presumed to exist after the age of
puberty has been reached); and lastly error, where
the consent is not given to what was not intended.
Arising from the will, a defect of consent may be
caused through deceit or dissimulation, when one
expresses exteriorly a consent that does not really
exist; or from constraint imposed by an unjust
external force, which causes the consent not to be
free." Consanguinity and affinity are diriment
<a name="Page_114"></a>impediments. Consanguinity "prohibits all
marriages
in the direct ascending or descending line
in infinitum, and in the collateral line to the fourth
degree or fourth generation." Affinity "establishes
a bond of relationship between each of
the married parties and the blood relations of the
other, and forbids marriage between them to the
fourth degree. Such is the case when the marriage
springs from conjugal relations; but as canon
law considers affinity to spring also from illicit
intercourse, there is an illicit affinity which annuls
marriage to the second degree only." Then there
is "spiritual relationship"; for example, the
marriage of one who stood as sponsor in confirmation
with a parent of the child is null and void.</p>
<p>Under the canon law, even more resources are
open for the man who is tired of his wife; by
the doctrine, namely, of "spiritual fornication."
Adultery is, of course, recognised as the cause
that admits a separation. But the canon law
remarks that idolatry and all harmful superstition
&#8212;by which is meant any doctrine that does not
agree with that of the Church&#8212;is fornication;
that avarice is also idolatry and hence fornication;
that in fact no vice can be separated from idolatry
and hence all vices can be classed as fornication;
so that if a husband only tried a little bit, he
could without much trouble find some "vice" in
his wife that would entitle him to a separation.<a name="FNanchor_391"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_115"></a>When all these fail, recourse can be had to a
dispensation. The Church reserves the right to
give dispensations for all impediments. Canon
III of the twenty-fourth session of Trent says:
"If anyone shall say, that only those degrees of
consanguinity and affinity which are set down in
<i>Leviticus</i> [xviii, 6 ff.] can hinder matrimony from
being contracted, and dissolve it when contracted;
and that the Church can not dispense in some of
those degrees, or ordain that others may hinder
and dissolve it; let him be anathema."</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Inheritance</div>
<p>The minute and far-fetched subtleties which
the Roman Church has employed in the interpretation
of these relationships make escape from
the marital tie feasible for the man who is eager
to disencumber himself of his life's partner. The
man of limited means will have a hard time of it.
The great and wealthy have been able at all periods,
by working one or more of these doctrines, to
reduce the theory of the Roman Church to nullity
in practice. Napoleon had his marriage to Josephine
annulled on the ground that he had never
intended to enter into a religious marriage with
<a name="Page_116"></a>her, although the day before the ceremony he had
had the union secretly blessed by Cardinal Fesch.
On the basis of this avowed lack of intent, his
marriage with Josephine was declared null and
void, and he was free to marry Louisa. A plea
along the same lines is being worked by the Count
de Castellane now. Louis XII, having fallen in
love with Anne of Brittany, suddenly discovered
that his wife was his fourth cousin, that she was
deformed, and that her father had been his godfather;
and for this the Pope gave him a dispensation
and his legitimate wife was sent away.
The Pope did not thunder against Louis XIV for
committing adultery with women like Louise de
la Valli&egrave;re and Madame de Montespan. It is
certainly true that in the case of Philip Augustus
of France and Henry VIII of England the Pope
did protect injured wives; but both these monarchs
were questioning the Vatican's autocracy. The
matrimonial relations of John of England, Philip's
contemporary, were more corrupt than those of
the French king; but, while the Pope chastised
John for his defiance of his political autonomy, he
did not excommunicate him on any ground of
morality. The statement of Cardinal Gibbons
is not entirely in accordance with history; he
does not take all facts into consideration, as is also
true of his complacent assumption that outside
of the Roman Church no economic forces and no
individuals have had any effect in elevating the
moral and economic status of women.</p>
<p><a name="Page_117"></a>Questions such as those of inheritance belong
properly to civil law; but the canon law claimed
to be heard in any case into which any
spiritual interest could be foisted. Thus
in the year 1199 Innocent III enacted that children
of heretics be deprived of all their offending
parents' goods "since in many cases even according
to divine decree children are punished in this
world on account of their parents."<a name="FNanchor_392"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> General attitude towards women at the present day</div>
<p>The attitude of the Roman Catholic Church
towards women's rights at the present day is
practically the same as it has been for
eighteen centuries. It still insists on the
subjection of the woman to the man, and
it is bitterly hostile to woman suffrage.
This position is so well illustrated by an article
of the Rev. David Barry in the Roman Catholic
paper, the Dublin <i>Irish Ecclesiastical Review</i>, that
I cannot do better than quote some of it. "It
seems plain enough," he says, "that allowing
women the right of suffrage is incompatible with
the high Catholic ideal of the unity of domestic
life. Even those who do not hold the high and
rigid ideal of the unity of the family that the
Catholic Church clings to must recognise some
authority in the family, as in every other society.
<a name="Page_118"></a>Is this authority the conjoint privilege of
husband
and wife? If so, which of them is to yield, if a
difference of opinion arises? Surely the most
uncompromising suffragette must admit that the
wife ought to give way in such a case. That is to
say, every one will admit that the wife's domestic
authority is subordinate to that of her husband.
But is she to be accorded an autonomy in outside
affairs that is denied her in the home? Her
authority is subject to her husband's in domestic
matters&#8212;her special sphere; is it to be considered
co-ordinate with his in regulating the affairs of
the State? Furthermore, there is an argument
that applies universally, even in the case of those
women who are not subject to the care and protection
of a husband, and even, I do not hesitate
to say, where the matters to be decided on would
come specially within their cognisance, and where
their judgment would, therefore, be more reliable
than that of men. It is this, that in the noise and
turmoil of party politics, or in the narrow, but
rancorous arena of local factions, it must needs
fare ill with what may be called the passive virtues
of humility, patience, meekness, forbearance,
and self-repression. These are looked on by the
Church as the special prerogative and endowment
of the female soul ... But these virtues would
soon become sullied and tarnished in the dust
and turmoil of a contested election; and their
absence would soon be disagreeably in evidence
in the character of women, who are, at the same
<a name="Page_119"></a>time, almost constitutionally debarred from
preeminence
in the more robust virtues for which
the soul of man is specially adapted."</p>
<p>Cardinal Gibbons, in a letter to the National
League for the Civic Education of Women&#8212;an
anti-suffrage organisation&#8212;said that "woman
suffrage, if realised, would be the death-blow of
domestic life and happiness" (Nov. 2, 1909).</p>
<p>Rev. William Humphrey, S.J., in his <i>Christian
Marriage</i>, chap. 16, remarks that woman is "the
subordinate equal of man"&#8212;whatever that means.</p>
<p>A few Roman Catholic prelates, like Cardinal
Moran, have advocated equal suffrage, but they
are in the minority. The Pope has not yet definitely
stated the position of the Church; individual
Catholics are free to take any side they wish,
as it is not a matter of faith; but the tendency of
Roman Catholicism is against votes for women.</p>

<h2>HISTORY OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN ENGLAND</h2>
<p>Since I have now given a brief summary of
the canon law, which until the Reformation
marked the general principles that guided the
laws of all Europe on the subject of women, I
propose next to consider more particularly the
history of women's rights in England; for the
institutions of England, being the basis of our
own, will necessarily be more pertinent to us than
those of Continental countries, to which I shall
not devote more than a passing comment here and
there. My inquiry will naturally fall into certain
well-defined parts. The status of the unmarried
woman is different from that of her married sister
and will, accordingly, demand separate consideration.
The rights of women, again, are to be
viewed both from the legal and the social standpoint.
Their legal rights include those of a
private nature, such as the disposal of property,
and public rights, such as suffrage, sitting on a
jury, or holding office. Under social rights are
included the right to an education, to earn a living,
and the like. Let us glance first at the history of
the legal rights of single women.</p>
<p><a name="Page_121"></a></p>
<div class="sidenote">Single women: Pollock and Maitland
i, pp. 482-485.</div>
<p>From very early times the law has continued
to put the single woman of mature age on practically
a par with men so far as private single
rights are concerned. She could hold
land, make a will or contract, could sue
and be sued, all of her own initiative; she
needed no guardian. She could herself, if a widow,
be guardian of her own children.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Pollock and Maitland, ii, 260-313. Blackstone,
ii, ch.
13.</div>
<p>In the case of
inheritance, however, women have to
within extremely recent times been
treated less generously than men. The
male sex has been preferred in an inheritance;
males excluded females of equal degree;
or, in the words of Blackstone: "In collateral
inheritances the male stock shall be preferred to
the female; that is, kindred derived from the
blood of the male ancestors, however remote,
shall be admitted before those from the blood of
the female, however near; unless where the lands
have, in fact, descended from a female. Thus the
relations on the father's side are admitted <i>in
infinitum</i> before those on the mother's side are
admitted at all." Blackstone justly remarks
that this harsh enactment of the laws of England
was quite unknown to the Roman law "wherein
brethren and sisters were allowed to succeed to
equal portions of the inheritance." As an example,
suppose we look for the heir of John Stiles,
deceased. The order of succession would be:</p>
<p>I. The eldest son, Matthew Stiles, or his issue.</p>
<p>II. If his line is extinct, then Gilbert Stiles
<a name="Page_122"></a>and the other sons, respectively, in order of
birth,
or their issue.</p>
<p>III. In default of these, all the daughters together,
Margarite and Charlotte Stiles, or their
issue.</p>
<p>IV. On the failure of the descendants of
John Stiles himself, the issue of Geoffrey and Lucy
Stiles, his parents, is called in, viz.: first, Francis
Stiles, the eldest brother of the whole blood, or
his issue.</p>
<p>V. Then Oliver Stiles, and the other whole
brothers, respectively, in order of birth, or their
issue.</p>
<p>VI. Then the sisters of the whole blood all
together, Bridget and Alice Stiles, or their issue.</p>
<p>And so on. It will be noted that females of
equal degree inherited together; and that a
daughter excluded a brother of the dead man.
Men themselves, if younger sons, have suffered
what seems to us a grave injustice in the prevalence
of the right of primogeniture, whereby, if
there are two or more males in equal degree, the
eldest only can inherit. This law might work for
the benefit of certain females; thus, the daughter,
granddaughter, or great-granddaughter of an eldest
son will succeed before the younger son.</p>
<p>To public rights, such as sitting on a jury<a name="FNanchor_393"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> or
<a name="Page_123"></a>holding offices of state, women never were
admitted;
that is a question that has become
prominent only in the twentieth century and will
demand consideration in its proper place.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Power of Parents.</div>
<p>Unlike the Roman law, English law allows
parents to disinherit children completely, if they so
desire, without being under any compulsion
to leave them a part of their goods.
As to legal power over children, the mother,
as such, is entitled to none, says Blackstone,<a name="FNanchor_394"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a>
but only to reverence and respect. Now, however,
by the statute 2 and 3 Vict., c. 54, commonly
called <i>Talfourd's Act</i>, an order may be made on
petition to the court of chancery giving mothers
access to their children and, if such children are
within the age of seven years, for delivery of them
to their mother until they attain that age. But
no woman who has been convicted of adultery is
entitled to the benefit of the act. The father
has legal power up to the time when his children
come of age; then it ceases. Until that time,
his consent is necessary to a valid marriage; he
may receive the profit of a child's estate, but only
as guardian or trustee, and must render an account
when the child attains his majority; and he may
have the benefit of his children's labour while they
live with him.</p>

<p><a name="Page_124"></a>We are ready now to observe the status of
women in marriage. The question of their legal
rights in this relation offers the most
illuminating insight into their conditions
in the various epochs of history.
Matrimony is a state over which the
Church has always asserted special jurisdiction.
By the middle of the twelfth
century it was law in England that to it belonged
this prerogative. The ecclesiastical court, for
example, pronounced in a given case whether
there had been a valid marriage or not; the temporal
court took this decision as one of the bases
for determining a matter of inheritance, whether
a woman was entitled to dower, and the like. The
general precepts laid down by canon law in the
case of a wife have already been noted. These
rules need now to be supplemented by an account
of the position of women in marriage under the
common law.</p>
<p>Under the older common law the husband was
very much lord of all he surveyed and even
more. An old enactment thus describes a husband's
duty<a name="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a>:
"He shall treat and <i>govern</i> the
aforesaid A well and decently, and shall not inflict
nor cause to be inflicted any injury upon the
aforesaid A except in so far as he may lawfully
<a name="Page_125"></a>and reasonably do so in accordance with <i>the
right of a husband to correct and chastise his wife</i>."
Blackstone, who wrote in 1763, has this to say on
the husband's power to chastise his wife: "The
husband also, by the old law, might give his wife
moderate correction. For, as he is to answer for
her misbehaviour, the law thought it reasonable to
intrust him with this power of restraining her,
by domestic chastisement, in the same moderation
that a man is allowed to correct his apprentices or
children, for whom the master or parent is also
liable in some cases to answer. But this power
of correction was confined within reasonable
bounds, and the husband was prohibited from
using any violence to his wife <i>aliter quam ad,
virum, ex causa regiminis et castigationis uxoris
suae, licite et rationabiliter pertinet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_396"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> The civil law
gave the husband the same, or a larger, authority
over his wife; allowing him for some misdemeanours
<i>flagellis et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem</i> [to give
his wife a severe beating with whips and clubs];
for others, only <i>modicam castigationem adhibere</i>
[to apply moderate correction]. But with us
in the politer reign of Charles the Second, this
power of correction began to be doubted; and a
wife may now have security of the peace against
her husband, or, in return, a husband against his
wife. Yet the lower rank of people, who were
always fond of the old common law, still claim and
<a name="Page_126"></a>exert their ancient privilege; and the courts of
law will still permit a husband to restrain a wife
of her liberty, in case of any gross misbehaviour."
Doubtless what Mr. Weller, Sr., describes as the
"amiable weakness" of wife-beating was not
necessarily confined to the "lower rank." For
instance, some of the courtly gentlemen of the
reign of Queen Anne were probably not averse to
exercising their old-time prerogative. Says Sir
Richard Steele (<i>Spectator</i>, 479): "I can not deny
but there are Perverse Jades that fall to Men's
Lots, with whom it requires more than common
Proficiency in Philosophy to be able to live.
When these are joined to men of warm Spirits,
without Temper or Learning, they are frequently
corrected with Stripes; but one of our famous
Lawyers is of opinion, That this ought to be used
sparingly." The law was, indeed, even worse than
might appear from the words of Blackstone. The
wife who feared unreasonable violence could, to be
sure, bind her husband to keep the peace; but she
had no action against him. A husband who
killed his wife was guilty of murder, but the wife
who slew her husband was adjudged guilty of
petty treason; and whereas the man would be
merely drawn and hanged, the woman, until
the reign of George III, was drawn and burnt
alive.<a name="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_127"></a>The right of a husband to restrain a wife's
liberty
may not be said to have become completely
obsolete until the case of <i>Reg. v. Jackson in 1891</i>.<a
 name="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a>
Wife-beating is still a flagrantly common offence
in England.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Wife's property in marriage.</div>
<p>Turning now to the question of the wife's
property in marriage, we shall be forced to believe
that Blackstone was an optimist of
unusual magnitude when he wrote that
the female sex was "so great a favourite
of the laws of England." Not to weary the reader
by minute details, I cannot do better than give
Messrs. Pollock and Maitland's excellent summary
of the final shape taken by the common law&#8212;
a glaring piece of injustice, worthy of careful
reading, and in complete accord with Apostolic
injunctions: "<span style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span> In the lands
of which the wife is
tenant in fee, whether they belonged to her at the
date of the marriage or came to her during the
marriage, the husband has an estate which will
endure during the marriage, and this he can
alienate without her concurrence. If a child is
born of the marriage, thenceforth the husband
as 'tenant by courtesy' has an estate which will
<a name="Page_128"></a>endure for the whole of his life, and this he
can
alienate without the wife's concurrence. The
husband by himself has no greater power of
alienation than is here stated; he cannot confer
an estate which will endure after the end of the
marriage or (as the case may be) after his own
death. The wife has during the marriage no
power to alienate her land without her husband's
concurrence. The only process by which the fee
can be alienated is a <i>fine</i> to which both husband
and wife are parties and to which she gives her
assent after a separate examination.</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span> A widow is entitled to
enjoy for her life
under the name of dower one third of any land
of which the husband was seised in fee at any time
during the marriage. The result of this is that
during the marriage the husband cannot alienate
his own land so as to bar his wife's right of dower,
unless this is done with her concurrence, and her
concurrence is ineffectual unless the conveyance
is made by <i>fine</i>." [This inconvenience for an unscrupulous
husband was evaded in modern conveyancy
by a device of extreme ingenuity finally
perfected only in the eighteenth century. Professor
James Bryce remarks (p. 820): "As this
right (i.e., the right of dower) interfered with the
husband's power of freely disposing of his own
land, the lawyers at once set about to find means
of evading it, and found these partly in legal processes
by which the wife, her consent being ascertained
by the courts, parted with her right, partly
<a name="Page_129"></a>by an ingenious device whereby lands could be
conveyed to a husband without the right of dower
attaching to them, partly by giving the wife a
so-called jointure which barred her claim."]</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">III.</span> Our law institutes no
community, even
of movables, between husband and wife. Whatever
movables the wife has at the date of the
marriage become the husband's, and the husband
is entitled to take possession of and thereby to make
his own whatever movables she becomes entitled
to during the marriage, and without her concurrence
he can sue for all debts that are due her.
On his death, however, she becomes entitled to all
movables and debts that are outstanding, or (as
the phrase goes) have not been 'reduced into possession.'
What the husband gets possession of is
simply his; he can freely dispose of it <i>inter vivos</i>
or by will. In the main, for this purpose as for
other purposes, a 'term of years' is treated as a
chattel, but under an exceptional rule the husband,
though he can alienate his wife's 'chattel real'
<i>inter vivos</i>, cannot dispose of it by his will. If he
has not alienated it <i>inter vivos</i>, it will be hers if she
survives him. If he survives her, he is entitled to
her 'chattels real' and is also entitled to be made
the administrator of her estate. In that capacity
he has a right to whatever movables or debts have
not yet been 'reduced into possession' and, when
the debts have been paid, he keeps these goods as
his own. If she dies in his lifetime, she can have
no other intestate successor. Without his consent
<a name="Page_130"></a>she can make no will, and any consent that he
may have given is revocable at any time before
the will is proved.</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">IV.</span> Our common law&#8212;but we
have seen
that this rule is not very old&#8212;assured no share of
the husband's personality to the widow. He can,
even by his will, give all of it away from her except
her necessary clothes, and with that exception his
creditors can take all of it. A further exception,
of which there is not much to be read, is made
of jewels, trinkets, and ornaments of the person,
under the name of paraphernalia. The husband
may sell or give these away in his lifetime, and even
after his death they may be taken for his debts;
but he cannot give them away by will. If the
husband dies during the wife's life and dies intestate
she is entitled to a third, or, if there be no living
descendant of the husband, to one half of his
personality [but see the note of Bryce, above].
But this is a case of pure intestate succession; she
only has a share of what is left after payment of
her husband's debts.</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">V.</span> During the marriage the
husband is in
effect liable to the whole extent of his property for
debts incurred or wrongs committed by his wife
before the marriage, also for wrongs committed
during the marriage. The action is against him
and her as co-defendants. If the marriage is
dissolved by his death, she is liable, his estate is
not. If the marriage is dissolved by her death,
he is liable as her administrator, but only to the
<a name="Page_131"></a>extent of the property which he takes in that
character." [Mr. Ashton, in his very interesting
book, p. 31, quotes a peculiar note from a Parish
Register in the reign of Queen Anne to this effect:
"John Bridmore and Anne Sellwood, both of
Chiltern all Saints, were married October 17, 1714.
The aforesaid Anne Sellwood was married in her
Smock, without any clothes or headgier on."
"This is not uncommon," remarks Mr. Ashton,
"the object being, according to a vulgar error, to
exempt the husband from the payment of any
debts his wife may have contracted in her ante-nuptial
condition. This error seems to have
been founded on a misconception of the law, as it
is laid down 'the husband is liable for the wife's
debts, because he acquires an absolute interest in
the personal estate of his wife.' An unlearned
person from this might conclude, and not unreasonably,
that if his wife had no estate whatever
he could not incur any liability."]</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">VI.</span> During the marriage the
wife cannot
contract on her own behalf. She can contract as
her husband's agent and has a certain power of
pledging his credit in the purchase of necessaries.
At the end of the Middle Ages it is very doubtful
how far this power is to be explained by an
'implied agency.' The tendency of more recent
times has been to allow her no power that cannot
be thus explained, except in the exceptional case
of desertion."</p>
<p>A perusal of these laws shows that they are
<a name="Page_132"></a>immensely inferior to the Roman law, which not
only gave the wife full control of her property,
but protected her from coercion and bullying on
the part of the husband. The amendment of these
injustices has been very recent indeed. Successive
statutes in 1870, 1874, and 1882<a name="FNanchor_399"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a> finally abrogated
the law which gave the husband full ownership of
his wife's property by the mere act of marriage.
Beginning with the year 1857, too, enlightenment
in England had progressed to such a remarkable
degree that certain acts were passed forbidding
a husband to seize his wife's earnings and neglect
her<a name="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a>;
and she was actually allowed to keep her
own wages after the desertion of her lord. Before
that time he might desert his wife repeatedly,
and return from time to time to take away her
earnings and sell everything she had acquired.
An act in 1886 (<i>49 and 50 Vict., c. 52</i>) gave magistrates
the power to order a husband to pay his
wife a weekly sum, not exceeding two pounds, for
her support and that of the children if it appeared
to the magistrates that the deserting husband had
<a name="Page_133"></a>the means of maintaining her, but was unwilling
to do so. Still, the husband can at any time
terminate his desertion and force his wife to take
him back on penalty of losing all rights to such
maintenance. There was frantic opposition to
all of these revolutionary enactments and many
prophets arose crying woe; but the acts finally
passed and England still lives.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Divorce. Authorities as above; and Howard, ii,
3-117.</div>
<p>Until the Reformation divorce was regulated
by the canon law in accordance with the principles
which I have explained. After the
Reformation the matter at once assumed
a different aspect because all Protestants
agreed in denying that marriage is a
sacrament. Scotland in this as in other respects
has been more liberal than England; as early as
1573 desertion as well as adultery had become
grounds for divorce. But in England the force of
the canon law continued. In Blackstone's day
there were still, as under the canon law, only
two kinds of separation. Complete dissolution
of the marriage tie (<i>a vinculo matrimonii</i>) took
place only on a declaration of the Ecclesiastical
Court that on account of some canonical impediment,
like consanguinity, the marriage was
null and void from the beginning. Separation
"from bed and board" (<i>a mensa et thoro</i>) simply
gave the parties permission no longer to live
together and was allowed for adultery or some
other grave offences, like intolerable cruelty or
a chronic disease. However, some time before
<a name="Page_134"></a>Blackstone's day it had become the habit to get
a dissolution of marriage <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> for
adultery by Act of Parliament; but the legal process
was so tedious, minute, and expensive that only
the very rich could afford the luxury.<a name="FNanchor_401"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> In the case
of a separation <i>a mensa et thoro</i> alimony was allowed
the wife for her support out of her husband's estate
at the discretion of the ecclesiastical judges.</p>
<p>The initiative in divorce by Act of Parliament
was usually taken by the husband; not until 1801
did a woman have the temerity so to assert her
rights. The fact is, ever since the dawn of history
society has, with its usual double standard of
morality for men and women, insisted that while
the husband must never tolerate infidelity on the
part of the wife, the wife should bear with meekness
the adulteries of her husband. Plutarch
in his <i>Conjugal Precepts</i> so advises a wife; and this
pious frame of mind has continued down the
centuries to the present day. Devout old Jeremy
Taylor in his <i>Holy Living</i>&#8212;a book which is read
by few, but praised by many&#8212;thus counsels the
suffering wife<a name="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a>:
"But if, after all the fair deportments
and innocent chaste compliances, the husband
be morose and ungentle, let the wife discourse
thus: 'If, while I do my duty, my husband
neglects me, what will he do if I neglect him?'
And if she thinks to be separated by reason of her
<a name="Page_135"></a>husband's unchaste life, let her consider that
the
man will be incurably ruined, and her rivals
could wish nothing more than that they might
possess him alone." Dr. Samuel Johnson ably
seconded the holy Jeremy's advice by declaring
that there is a boundless difference between the
infidelity of the man and that of the woman. In
the husband's case "the man imposes no bastards
upon his wife." Therefore, "wise married women
don't trouble themselves about infidelity in their
husbands."<a name="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a>
Until very recent times not only men
but also women have been unanimous in counselling
abject submission to and humble adoration of
the husband. A single example out of hundreds
will serve excellently as a pattern. In 1821 a
"Lady of Distinction" writes to a "Relation
Shortly after Her Marriage" as follows<a name="FNanchor_404"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a>: "The
most perfect and implicit faith in the superiority
of a husband's judgment, and the most absolute
obedience to his desires, is not only the conduct
that will insure the greatest success, but will give
the most entire satisfaction. It will take from
you a thousand cares, which would have answered
to no purpose; it will relieve you from a weight of
thought that would be very painful, and in no
way profitable.... It has its origin in reason,
<a name="Page_136"></a>in justice, in nature, and in the law of God....
I have told you how you may, and how people
who are married do, get a likeness of countenance;
and in that I have done it. You will understand
me, that by often looking at your husband's face,
by smiling on the occasions on which he does, by
frowning on those things which make him frown,
and by viewing all things in the light in which you
perceive he does, you will acquire that likeness of
countenance which it is an honour to possess, because
it is a testimony of love.... When your
temper and your thoughts are formed upon those
of your husband, according to the plan which I have
laid down, you will perceive that you have no will,
no pleasure, but what is also his. This is the
character the wife of prudence would be apt to
assume; she would make herself the mirror, to show,
unaltered, and without aggravation, diminution,
or distortion, the thoughts, the sentiments, and
the resolutions of her husband. She would have
no particular design, no opinion, no thought, no
passion, no approbation, no dislike, but what
should be conformable to his own judgment ...
I would have her judgment seem the reflecting
mirror to his determination; and her form the
shadow of his body, conforming itself to his
several positions, and following it in all its movements ...
I would not have you silent; nay,
when trifles are the subject, talk as much as any
of them; but distinguish when the discourse turns
upon things of importance."</p>
<p><a name="Page_137"></a>It is not strange, therefore, that no woman
protested publicly against a husband's infidelity
until 1801. Up to 1840 there were but three cases
of a woman's taking the initiative in divorce,
namely, in 1801, 1831, and 1840; and in each case
the man's adultery was aggravated by other
offences. In two other suits the Lords rejected
the petition of the wife, although the misconduct
of the husband was clearly proved. But redress
was still by the elaborate machinery of Act of
Parliament and hence a luxury only for the
wealthy until 1857, when a special Court for
Divorce and Matrimonial Causes was established.<a name="FNanchor_405"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a>
Nevertheless, the law as it stands to-day is not of
a character to excite admiration or to prove the
existence of the proverbial "British Fair Play."
A husband can obtain a divorce upon proof of his
wife's infidelity; but the wife can get it only by
proving, in addition to the husband's adultery,
either that it was aggravated by bigamy or incest
or that it was accompanied by cruelty or by two
years' desertion. Misconduct by the husband
bars him from obtaining a divorce. The court is
empowered to regulate at its discretion the property
rights of divorced people and the custody of
the children.<a name="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a>
All attempts have failed to make the
law recognise that the misconduct of the husband
shall be regarded equally as culpable as the wife's.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Rape and the age of legal consent.</div>
<p><a name="Page_138"></a>We may pause a moment to glance at the
provisions made by the criminal law for protecting
women. The offence that most closely
touches women is rape. The punishment
of this in Blackstone's day was
death<a name="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a>;
but in the next century the death penalty
was repealed and transportation for life substituted.<a
 name="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a>
The saddest blot on a presumably
Christian civilisation connected with this matter
is the so-called "age of legal consent." Under the
older Common Law this was <i>ten</i> or <i>twelve;</i> in 1885
it was <i>thirteen</i>, at which period a girl was supposed
to be at an age to know what she was doing. But
in the year 1885 Mr. Stead told the London public
very plainly those hideous truths about crimes
against young girls which everybody knew very
well had been going on for centuries, but which
no one ever before had dared to assert. The
result was that Parliament raised the "age of
legal consent" to sixteen, where it now stands.<a name="FNanchor_409"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a>
<a name="Page_139"></a>The idea that any girl of this age is
sufficiently
mature to know what she is doing by consenting
to the lust of scoundrels is a fine commentary on
the acuteness of the legal intellect and the high
moral convictions of legislators.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Women's rights to an education.</div>
<p>The rights of women to a higher education is
distinctly a movement of the last half of the nineteenth
century. It is true that throughout
history there are many examples
of remarkably well-educated women&#8212;Lady
Jane Grey, for example, or Queen Elizabeth,
or Olympia Morata, in Italy, she who in the golden
period of the Renaissance became a professor at
sixteen and wrote dialogues in Greek after the
manner of Plato. But on looking closely into these
instances we shall find first that these ladies were
of noble rank and only thanks to their lofty position
had access to knowledge; and secondly that
they stand out as isolated cases&#8212;the great masses
of women never dreamed beyond the traditional
Kleider, K&uuml;che, Kinder, and Kirche. That an
elementary education, consisting of reading, writing,
and simple arithmetic, was offered them
freely by hospital, monastery, and the like
schools even as early as Chaucer&#8212;this we know;
nevertheless, beyond that they were not supposed
to aspire. So very recently, indeed, have women
<a name="Page_140"></a>secured the rights to a higher education that
many thousands to-day can easily recall the
intensely bitter attacks which were directed
against colleges like Wellesley and Bryn Mawr in
their inception. Until the middle of the nineteenth
century the whole education&#8212;what there
was of it&#8212;of a girl was arranged primarily with a
view to capture a husband and, once having him
secure, to be his loving slave, to dwell with adoring
rapture on his superior learning, and to be humbly
grateful if her liege deigned from time to time to
throw his spouse some scraps of knowledge which
might be safely administered without danger of
making her think for herself. These facts no one
can well deny; but a few instances of prevalent
opinion, in addition to those which I have already
quoted, will afford the amusement of concrete
examples.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chapone, in the eighteenth century,
advised her niece to avoid the study of classics
and science lest she "excite envy in one sex and
jealousy in the other." Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu laments thus: "There is hardly a
creature in the world more despicable and more
liable to universal ridicule than a learned woman,"
and "folly is reckoned so much our proper sphere,
we are sooner pardoned any excesses of that than
the least pretensions to reading and good sense."
Pursuant to the prevailing sentiment on the
education of women, the subjects which they
studied and the books which they were allowed
<a name="Page_141"></a>to read were carefully regulated. As to their
reading, it was confined to romantic tales whereof
the exceeding insipidity could not awaken any
symptom of intelligence. Lyly dedicated his
<i>Euphues</i> to the "Ladies and Gentlewomen of
England" and Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> owed its vast
success to its female readers.</p>
<p>The subjects studied followed the orthodox
views. Beginning with the reign of Queen Anne
boarding-schools for girls became very numerous.
At these schools "young Gentlewomen" were
"soberly educated" and "taught all sorts of
learning fit for young Gentlewomen." The
"learning fit for young Gentlewomen" comprised
"the Needle, Dancing, and the French tongue; a
little Music on the Harpsichord or Spinet, to read,
write, and cast accounts in a small way." Dancing
was the all-important study, since this was
the surest route to their Promised Land, matrimony.
The study of French consisted in learning
parrot-like a modicum of that language pronounced
according to the fancy of the speaker. As, however,
the young beau probably did not know any
more himself, the end justified the means. Studies
like history, when pursued, were taken in homoeopathic
doses from small compendiums; and it was
adequate to know that Charlemagne lived somewhere
in Europe about a thousand or so years ago.
Yet even this was rather advanced work and
exposed the woman to be damned by the report
that she was educated. Ability to cook was not
<a name="Page_142"></a>despised and pastry schools were not uncommon.
Thus in the time of Queen Anne appears this:
"To all Young Ladies: at Edw. Kidder's Pastry
School in little Lincoln's Inn Fields are taught all
Sorts of Pastry and Cookery, Dutch hollow works,
and Butter Works," etc.</p>
<p>At last in the first decades of the nineteenth
century the civilised world began slowly to take
some thought of women's higher education and
to wake up to the fact that because a certain
system has been in vogue since created man does
not necessarily mean that it is the right one; a
very heretical and revolutionary idea, which has
always been and still is ably opposed by that great
host of people who have steadily maintained that
when men and women once begin to think for
themselves society must inevitably run to ruin.
In 1843 there was established a certain Governesses'
Benevolent Institution. This was in its inception
a society to afford relief to governesses, i.e.,
women engaged in tutoring, who might be temporarily
in straits, and to raise annuities for those
who were past doing work. Obviously this would
suggest the question of what a competent governess
was; and this in turn led to the demand for a
diploma as a warrant of efficiency. That called
attention to the extreme ignorance of the members
of the profession; and it was soon felt that classes
of instruction were needed. A sum of money
was accordingly collected in 1846 and given
the Institution for that purpose. Some eminent
<a name="Page_143"></a>professors of King's College volunteered to
lecture;
and so, on a small scale to be sure, began what
is now Queen's College, the first college for women
in England, incorporated by Royal Charter in
1853. In 1849 Bedford College for women had
been founded in London through the unselfish
labours of Mrs. Reid; but it did not receive its
charter until 1869. Within a decade Cheltenham,
Girton, Newnham, and other colleges for women
had arisen. Eight of the ten men's universities
of Great Britain now allow examinations and
degrees to women also; Oxford and Cambridge
do not.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Women in the professions.</div>
<p>Since then women's right to any higher education
which they may wish to embrace has been
permanently assured. As early as 1868
Edinburgh opened its courses in pharmacy
to women. In 1895 there were already
264 duly qualified female physicians in Great
Britain. In many schools they are allowed to
study with men, as at the College of Physicians
and Surgeons at Edinburgh; there are four medical
schools for women only. We find women now
actively engaged in agriculture, apiculture, poultry-keeping,
horticulture; in library work and indexing;
in stenography; in all trades and professions.
The year 1893 witnessed the first appointment of
women as factory inspectors, two being chosen
that year in London and in Glasgow. Nottingham
had chosen women as sanitary inspectors in
1892. Thus in about two decades woman has
<a name="Page_144"></a>advanced farther than in the combined ages which
preceded. Before these very modern movements
we may say that the stage was the only
profession which had offered them any opportunity
of earning their living in a dignified way. It
seems that a Mrs. Coleman, in 1656, was the
first female to act on the stage in England; before
that, all female parts had been taken by boys
or young men. A Mrs. Sanderson played Desdemona
in 1660 at the Clare Market Theatre. In
1661, as we may see from Pepys' <i>Diary</i> (Feb. 12,
1661), an actress was still a novelty; but within
a few decades there were already many famous
ones.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Woman suffrage in England</div>
<p>We have seen that now woman has obtained
practically all rights on a par with men. There
are still grave injustices, as in divorce;
but the battle is substantially won. One
right still remains for her to win, the
right, namely, to vote, not merely on issues such
as education&#8212;this privilege she has had for some
time&#8212;but on all political questions; and connected
with this is the right to hold political office. We
may fittingly close this chapter by a review of the
history of the agitation for woman suffrage.</p>
<p>In the year 1797 Charles Fox remarked: "It
has never been suggested in all the theories and
projects of the most absurd speculation, that it
would be advisable to extend the elective suffrage
to the female sex." Yet five years before Mary
Wollstonecraft had published her <i>Vindication of
<a name="Page_145"></a>the Rights of Women</i>. Presently the writings
of
Harriet Martineau upon political economy proved
that women could really think on politics.</p>
<p>We may say that the general public first began
to think seriously on the matter after the epoch-making
Reform Act of 1832. This celebrated
measure admitted &pound;10 householders to the right
to vote and carefully excluded females; yet it
marked a new era in the awakening of civic
consciousness: women had taken active part in the
attendant campaigns; and the very fact that
"male persons" needed now to be so specifically
designated in the bill, whereas hitherto "persons"
and "freeholders" had been deemed sufficient,
attests the recognition of a new factor in
political life.</p>
<p>In 1865 John Stuart Mill was elected to Parliament.
That able thinker had written on <i>The
Subjection of Women</i> and was ready to champion
their rights. A petition was prepared under the
direction of women like Mrs. Bodichon and Miss
Davies; and in 1867 Mill proposed in Parliament
that the word <i>man</i> be omitted from the People's
Bill and <i>person</i> substituted. The amendment
was rejected, 196 to 83.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the agitation was continued. The
next year constitutional lawyers like Mr. Chisholm
Anstey decided that women might be legally
entitled to vote; and 5000 of them applied
to be registered. In a test case brought before the
Court of Common Pleas the verdict was adverse,
<a name="Page_146"></a>on the ground that it was contrary to usage for
women to vote. The fight went on. Mr. Jacob
Bright in 1870 introduced a "Bill to Remove the
Electoral Disabilities of Women" and lost. In
1884 Mr. William Woodall tried again; he lost
also, largely through the efforts of Gladstone; and
the same statesman was instrumental in killing
another bill in 1892, when Mr. A.J. Balfour urged
its passage.</p>
<p>At the present day women in England cannot
vote on great questions of universal state policy
nor can they hold great offices of state. Yet their
gains have been enormous, as I shall next demonstrate;
and in this connection I shall also
glance briefly at their vast strides in the colonies.</p>
<p>In 1850 Ontario gave all women school suffrage.
In 1867 New South Wales gave them municipal
suffrage. In 1869 England granted municipal
suffrage to single women and widows; Victoria
gave it to all women, married or single. In
England in 1870 the Education Act, by which
school boards were created, gave women the
same rights as men, both as regards electing and
being elected. In 1871 West Australia gave them
municipal suffrage; in 1878 New Zealand gave
school suffrage. In 1880 South Australia gave
municipal suffrage. In 1881 widows and single
women obtained municipal suffrage in Scotland
and Parliamentary suffrage on the Isle of Man.
Municipal suffrage was given by Ontario and
Tasmania in 1884 and by New Zealand and New
<a name="Page_147"></a>Brunswick in 1886; by Nova Scotia and Manitoba
in 1887. In 1888 England gave women county
suffrage and British Columbia and the North-West
Territory gave them municipal suffrage. In 1889
county suffrage was given the women of Scotland
and municipal suffrage to single women and
widows in the Province of Quebec. In 1893 New
Zealand gave full suffrage. In 1894 parish and
district suffrage was given in England to women
married and single, with power to elect and to be
elected to parish and district councils. In 1895
South Australia gave full state suffrage to all
women. In 1898 the women of Ireland were
given the right to vote for all officers except
members of Parliament. In 1900 West Australia
granted full state suffrage to all. In 1902 full
national suffrage was given all the women in
federated Australia and full state suffrage to those
of New South Wales. In 1903 Tasmania gave
full state suffrage; in 1905 Queensland did the
same; in 1908 Victoria followed. In 1907 England
made women eligible as mayors, aldermen, and
county and town councillors. In London, for example,
at the present time women can vote for
the 28 borough councils and 31 boards of guardians
of the London City Council; they can also be
themselves elected to these; be members of the
central unemployed body or of the 23 district
committees, and can be co-opted to all other
bodies, like the local pension committees.
Women can be aldermen of the Council; and there is
<a name="Page_148"></a>nothing to prevent one from holding even the
office of chairman.</p>
<p>At the present moment the cause of woman
suffrage in England is being furthered chiefly by
two organizations which differ in methods. The
National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies has
adopted the "constitutional" or peaceful policy;
but the National Women's Social and Political
Union is "militant" and coercive.<br>

<p> If a woman sentenced to execution declared she was pregnant,
a jury of twelve matrons could be appointed on a writ
<i>de venire inspiciendo</i> to determine the truth of the matter; for
she could not be executed if the infant was alive in the womb.
The same jury determined the case of a widow who feigned herself
with child in order to exclude the next heir and when she
was suspected of trying to palm off a supposititious birth. But
from all other jury duties women have always been excluded
"on account of the weakness of the sex"&#8212;<i>propter defectum sexus</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_150"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2>WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>It has been my aim, in this short history of the
growth of women's rights, to depict for the
most part the strictly legal aspect of the matter;
but from time to time I have interposed some
typical illustration of public opinion, in order to
bring into greater prominence the ferment that
was going on or the misery which existed behind
the scenes. A history of legal processes might
otherwise, from the coldness of the laws, give
few hints of the conflicts of human passion which
combined to set those processes in motion. Before
I present the history of the progress of women's
rights in the United States, I shall place before
the reader some extracts which are typical and
truly representative of the opposition which from
the beginning of the agitation to the present day
has voiced itself in all ranks of life. Let the
reader bear carefully in mind that from 1837 to the
beginning of the twentieth century such abuse
as that which I shall quote as typical was hurled
from ten thousand throats of men and women
unceasingly; that Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony,
and Mrs. Gage were hissed, insulted, and offered
<a name="Page_151"></a>physical violence by mobs in New York<a
 name="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a>
and
Boston to an extent inconceivable in this age; and
that the marvellously unselfish labour of such
women as these whom I have mentioned and of
men like Wendell Phillips is alone responsible
for the improvement in the legal status of
women, which I propose to trace in detail. Some
expressions of the popular attitude follow:</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Examples of opposition to women's rights.</div>
<p>From a speech of the Rev. Knox-Little at the
Church of St. Clements in Philadelphia in 1880:
"God made himself to be born of a woman
to sanctify the virtue of endurance;
loving submission is an attribute of a
woman; men are logical, but women,
lacking this quality, have an intricacy of thought.
There are those who think women can be taught
logic; this is a mistake. They can never by any
power of education arrive at the same mental status
as that enjoyed by men, but they have a quickness
of apprehension, which is usually called leaping
at conclusions, that is astonishing. There, then,
we have distinctive traits of a woman, namely,
endurance, loving submission, and quickness of
apprehension. Wifehood is the crowning glory
of a woman. In it she is bound for all time. To
her husband she owes the duty of unqualified
obedience. There is no crime which a man can
commit which justifies his wife in leaving him or
<a name="Page_152"></a>applying for that monstrous thing, divorce. It
is
her duty to subject herself to him always, and no
crime that he can commit can justify her lack
of obedience. If he be a bad or wicked man, she
may gently remonstrate with him, but refuse him
never. Let divorce be anathema; curse it; curse
this accursed thing, divorce; curse it, curse it!
Think of the blessedness of having children. I am
the father of many children and there have been
those who have ventured to pity me. 'Keep your
pity for yourself,' I have replied, 'they never cost
me a single pang.' In this matter let woman
exercise that endurance and loving submission
which, with intricacy of thought, are their only
characteristics."</p>
<p>From the Philadelphia <i>Public Ledger and Daily
Transcript</i>, July 20, 1848: "Our Philadelphia ladies
not only possess beauty, but they are celebrated
for discretion, modesty, and unfeigned diffidence,
as well as wit, vivacity, and good nature. Who
ever heard of a Philadelphia lady setting up for a
reformer or standing out for woman's rights, or assisting
to <i>man</i> the election grounds [<i>sic</i>], raise a regiment,
command a legion, or address a jury? Our
ladies glow with a higher ambition. They soar to
rule the hearts of their worshippers, and secure
obedience by the sceptre of affection.... But all
women are not as reasonable as ours of Philadelphia.
The Boston ladies contend for the rights
of women. The New York girls aspire to mount
the rostrum, to do all the voting, and, we suppose,
<a name="Page_153"></a>all the fighting, too.... Our Philadelphia girls
object to fighting and holding office. They prefer
the baby-jumper to the study of Coke and Lyttleton,
and the ball-room to the Palo Alto battle.
They object to having a George Sand for President
of the United States; a Corinna for Governor; a
Fanny Wright for Mayor; or a Mrs. Partington for
Postmaster.... Women have enough influence
over human affairs without being politicians....
A woman is nobody. A wife is everything.
A pretty girl is equal to ten thousand
men, and a mother is, next to God, all powerful....
The ladies of Philadelphia, therefore, under
the influence of the most 'sober second thoughts'
are resolved to maintain their rights as Wives,
Belles, Virgins, and Mothers, and not as Women."</p>
<p>From the "Editor's Table" of <i>Harper's New
Monthly Magazine</i>, November, 1853: "Woman's
Rights, or the movement that goes under that
name, may seem to some too trifling in itself and
too much connected with ludicrous associations
to be made the subject of serious arguments.
If nothing else, however, should give it consequence,
it would demand our earnest attention
from its intimate connection with all the radical
and infidel movements of the day. A strange
affinity seems to bind them all together....
But not to dwell on this remarkable connection&#8212;the
claim of 'woman's rights' presents not only
the common radical notion which underlies the
whole class, but also a peculiar enormity of its
<a name="Page_154"></a>own; in some respects more boldly infidel, or
defiant both of nature and revelation, than that
which characterises any kindred measure. It is
avowedly opposed to the most time-honoured proprieties
of social life; it is opposed to nature;
it is opposed to revelation.... This unblushing
female Socialism defies alike apostles and prophets.
In this respect no kindred movement is so decidedly
infidel, so rancorously and avowedly anti-biblical.</p>
<p>"It is equally opposed to nature and the established
order of society founded upon it. We do
not intend to go into any physiological argument.
There is one broad striking fact in the constitution
of the human species which ought to set the
question at rest for ever. This is the fact of
maternity.... From this there arise, in the first
place, physical impediments which, during the best
part of the female life, are absolutely insurmountable,
except at a sacrifice of almost everything that
distinguishes the civilized human from the animal,
or beastly, and savage state. As a secondary, yet
inevitably resulting consequence, there come
domestic and social hindrances which still more
completely draw the line between the male
and female duties.... Every attempt to break
through them, therefore, must be pronounced as
unnatural as it is irreligious and profane....
The most serious importance of this modern
'woman's rights' doctrine is derived from its
direct bearing upon the marriage institution. The
<a name="Page_155"></a>blindest must see that such a change as is
proposed
in the relations and life of the sexes cannot leave
either marriage or the family in their present state.
It must vitally affect, and in time wholly sever,
that oneness which has ever been at the foundation
of the marriage idea, from the primitive
declaration in Genesis to the latest decision of the
common law. This idea gone&#8212;and it is totally
at war with the modern theory of 'woman's rights'&#8212;marriage
is reduced to the nature of a contract
simply.... That which has no higher sanction
than the will of the contracting parties, must, of
course, be at any time revocable by the same
authority that first created it. That which makes
no change in the personal relations, the personal
rights, the personal duties, is not the holy marriage
<i>union</i>, but the unholy <i>alliance</i> of concubinage."</p>
<p>In a speech of Senator George G. Vest, of
Missouri, in the United States Senate, January 25,
1887, these: "I now propose to read from a pamphlet
sent to me by a lady.... She says to her
own sex: 'After all, men work for women; or, if
they think they do not, it would leave them but
sorry satisfaction to abandon them to such existence
as they could arrange without us.'</p>
<p>"Oh, how true that is, how true!"</p>
<p>In 1890 a bill was introduced in the New York
Senate to lower the "age of consent"&#8212;the age at
which a girl may legally consent to sexual intercourse&#8212;from
16 to 14. It failed. In 1892 the
brothel keepers tried again in the Assembly. The
<a name="Page_156"></a>bill was about to be carried by universal
consent
when the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
feeling the importance of the measure, called for
the individual yeas and nays, in order that the
constituents of the representatives might know
how their legislators voted. The bill thereupon
collapsed. In 1889 a motion was made in the
Kansas Senate to lower the age of consent from
18 to <i>12</i>. But the public heard of it; protests
flowed in; and under the pressure of these the law
was allowed to remain as it was.</p>
<p>Such are some typical examples of the warfare of
the opposition to all that pertains to advancing
the status of women. As I review the progress
of their rights, let the reader recollect that this
opposition was always present, violent, loud, and
often scurrilous.</p>
<p>In tracing the history of women's rights in the
United States my plan will be this: I shall first give
a general review of the various movements connected
with the subject; and I shall then lay
before the reader a series of tables, wherein may
be seen at a glance the status of women to-day in
the various States.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Single women.</div>
<div class="sidenote"><br>
<br>
<br>
History of agitation for women's rights.</div>
<p>In our country, as in England, single women
have at all times had practically the same legal
rights as men; but by no means the
same political, social, educational, or
professional privileges; as will appear more conclusively
later on.</p>
<p><a name="Page_157"></a>We may say that the history of the agitation
for
women's rights began with the visit of Frances
Wright to the United States in 1820.
Frances Wright was a Scotchwoman, born
at Dundee in 1797, and early exhibited
a keen intellect on all the subjects which
concern political and social reform. For several
years after 1820 she resided here and strove to
make men and women think anew on old traditional
beliefs&#8212;more particularly on theology,
slavery, and the social degradation of women.
The venomous denunciations of press and pulpit
attested the success of her efforts. In 1832
Lydia Maria Child published her <i>History of
Woman</i>, a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the status of women; and
this was followed by numerous works and articles,
such as Margaret Fuller's, <i>The Great Lawsuit, or
Man vs. Woman: Woman vs. Man</i>, and Eliza
Farnham's <i>Woman and her Era</i>. Various women
lectured; such as Ernestine L. Rose&#8212;a Polish
woman, banished for asserting her liberty. The
question of women's rights received a powerful
impetus at this period from the vast number of
women who were engaged in the anti-slavery
agitation. Any research into the validity of
slavery perforce led the investigators to inquire
into the justice of the enforced status of women;
and the two causes were early united. Women
like Angelina and Sarah Grimk&eacute; and Lucretia
Mott were pioneers in numerous anti-slavery
conventions. But as soon as they dared to
<a name="Page_158"></a>address meetings in which men were present, a
tempest was precipitated; and in 1840, at the
annual meeting of the Anti-Slavery Association,
the men refused to serve on any committee in
which any woman had a part; although it had
been largely the contributions of women which
were sustaining the cause. Affairs reached a
climax in London, in 1840, at the World's Anti-Slavery
Convention. Delegates from all anti-slavery
organisations were invited to take part;
and several American societies sent women to
represent them. These ladies were promptly denied
any share in the proceedings by the English
members, thanks mainly to the opposition of the
clergy, who recollected with pious satisfaction that
St. Paul permitted not a woman to teach. Thereupon
Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton
determined to hold a women's rights convention
as soon as they returned to America; and thus
a World's Anti-Slavery Convention begat an
issue equally large.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the first Women's Rights Convention
was held at Seneca Falls, New York,
July 19-20, 1848. It was organised by <i>divorced
wives, childless women, and sour old maids</i>, the
gallant newspapers declared; that is, by Mrs.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mrs. Lucretia Mott,
Mrs. McClintock, and other fearless women, who
not only lived the purest and most unselfish of
domestic lives, but brought up many children
besides. Great crowds attended. A <i>Declaration
<a name="Page_159"></a>of Sentiments</i> was moved and adopted; and as
this
exhibits the temper of the convention and illustrates
the then prevailing status of women very
clearly, I shall quote it:</p>
<p>DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS</p>
<p>"When, in the course of human events, it
becomes necessary for one portion of the family
of man to assume among the people of the earth a
position different from that which they have
hitherto occupied, but one to which the laws of
nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that
they should declare the causes which impel them
to such a course.</p>
<p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that
all men and women are created equal; that they
are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
rights; that among these are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these
rights governments are instituted, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed.
Whenever any form of government becomes destructive
of those ends, it is the right of those who
suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist
upon the institution of a new government, laying
its foundation on such principles, and organising
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments
<a name="Page_160"></a>long established should not be changed for light
or transient causes; and accordingly all experience
hath shown that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right
themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
were accustomed. But when a long train of
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same object, evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw
off such government, and to provide new guards
for their future security. Such has been the
patient sufferance of the women under this government,
and such is now the necessity which constrains
them to demand the equal station to which
they are entitled.</p>
<p>"The history of mankind is a history of repeated
injuries and usurpations on the part of man
toward woman, having in direct object the establishment
of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove
this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
<p>"He has never permitted her to exercise her
inalienable right to the elective franchise.</p>
<p>"He has compelled her to submit to laws, in
the formation of which she had no voice.</p>
<p>"He has withheld from her rights which are
given to the most ignorant and degraded men&#8212;both
natives and foreigners.</p>
<p>"Having deprived her of this first right of a
citizen, the elective franchise, thereby leaving her
without representation in the halls of legislation,
he has oppressed her on all sides.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_161"></a>He has made her, if married, in the eye of
the
law, civilly dead.</p>
<p>"He has taken from her all right in property,
even to the wages she earns.</p>
<p>"He has made her, morally, an irresponsible
being, as she can commit many crimes with
impunity, provided they be done in the presence
of her husband. In the covenant of marriage,
she is compelled to promise obedience to her husband,
he becoming, to all intents and purposes,
her master&#8212;the law giving him power to deprive
her of her liberty, and to administer chastisement.</p>
<p>"He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to
what shall be the proper causes, and, in case of
separation, to whom the guardianship of the children
shall be given, as to be wholly regardless
of the happiness of women&#8212;the law in all cases
going upon a false supposition of the supremacy
of man, and giving all power into his hands.</p>
<p>"After depriving her of all rights as a married
woman, if single, and the owner of property, he has
taxed her to support a government which recognises
her only when her property can be made
profitable to it.</p>
<p>"He has monopolised nearly all the profitable
employments, and from those she is permitted to
follow she receives but a scanty remuneration.
He closes against her all the avenues of wealth and
distinction which he considers most honourable to
himself. As a teacher of theology, medicine, or
law, she is not known.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_162"></a>He has denied her the facilities for
obtaining
a thorough education, all colleges being closed
against her.</p>
<p>"He allows her in church, as well as state,
but a subordinate position, claiming Apostolic
authority for her exclusion from the ministry, and,
with some exceptions, from any public participation
in the affairs of the church.</p>
<p>"He has created a false public sentiment by
giving to the world a different code of morals for
men and women, by which moral delinquencies
which exclude women from society are not only
tolerated, but deemed of little account in man.</p>
<p>"He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah
himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her
a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience
and to her God.</p>
<p>"He has endeavoured, in every way that he
could, to destroy her confidence in her own powers,
to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing
to lead a dependent and abject life.</p>
<p>"Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement
of one half the people of this country, their social
and religious degradation; in view of the unjust
laws above mentioned, and because women do feel
themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently
deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that
they have immediate admission to all the rights
and privileges which belong to them as citizens
of the United States.</p>
<p>"In entering upon the great work before us,
<a name="Page_163"></a>we anticipate no small amount of misconception,
misrepresentation, and ridicule; but we shall use
every instrumentality within our power to effect
our object. We shall employ agents, circulate
tracts, petition the State and National legislatures,
and endeavour to enlist the pulpit and press in
our behalf. We hope this Convention will be
followed by a series of Conventions embracing
every part of the country."</p>
<p>Such was the defiance of the Women's Rights
Convention in 1848; other conventions were
held, as at Rochester, in 1853, and at Albany in
1854; the movement extended quickly to other
States and touched the quick of public opinion.
It bore its first good fruits in New York in 1848,
when the Property Bill was passed. This law,
amended in 1860, and entitled "An Act Concerning
the Rights and Liabilities of Husband and Wife"
(March 20, 1860), emancipated completely the
wife, gave her full control of her own property,
allowed her to engage in all civil contracts or
business on her own responsibility, rendered her
joint guardian of her children with her husband,
and granted both husband and wife a one-third
share of one another's property in case of the
decease of either partner.</p>
<p>Thus New York became the pioneer. The
movement spread, as I have mentioned, with
amazing rapidity; but it was not so uniformly
successful. Conventions were held, for example,
<a name="Page_164"></a>in Ohio, at Salem, April 19-20, 1850; at Akron,
May 28-29, 1851; at Massillon on May 27, 1852.
Nevertheless, in 1857, the Legislature of Ohio
passed a bill enacting that no married man should
dispose of any personal property without having
first obtained the consent of his wife; the wife was
empowered, in case of a violation of this law, to
commence a civil suit in her own name for the
recovery of the property; and any married woman
whose husband deserted her or neglected to provide
for his family was to be entitled to his wages
and to those of her minor children. A bill to
extend suffrage to women was defeated, by a vote
of 44 to 44; the petition praying for its enactment
had received 10,000 signatures.</p>
<p>The course of events as it has been described
in New York and Ohio, is practically the same
in the case of the other States. The Civil War
relegated these issues to a secondary place; but
during that momentous conflict the heroism of
Clara Barton on the battlefield and of thousands
of women like her paved the way for a reassertion
of the rights of woman in the light of her unquestioned
exertions and unselfish labours for her
country in its crisis. After the war, attention
began to be concentrated more on the right to <i>vote</i>.
By the Fourteenth Amendment the franchise was
at once given to negroes; but the insertion of the
word <i>male</i> effectually barred any national recognition
of woman's right to vote. A vigorous effort
was made by the suffrage leaders to have <i>male</i>
<a name="Page_165"></a>stricken from the amendment; but the effort was
futile. Legislators thought that the black man's
vote ought to be secured first; as the <i>New York
Tribune</i> (Dec. 12, 1866) puts it snugly: "We want
to see the ballot put in the hands of the black
without one day's delay added to the long postponement
of his just claim. When that is done,
we shall be ready to take up the next question"
(i.e., woman's rights).</p>
<p>The first Women's Rights Convention after the
Civil War had been held in New York City, May
10, 1866, and had presented an address to Congress.
Such was the dauntless courage of the
leaders, that Mrs. Stanton offered herself as a
candidate for Congress at the November elections,
in order to test the constitutional rights of a
woman to run for office. She received twenty-four
votes.</p>
<p>Six years later, on November I, 1872, Miss
Susan B. Anthony did a far more Audacious
thing. She went to the polls and asked to be
registered. The two Republican members of the
board were won over by her exposition of the
Fourteenth Amendment and agreed to receive
her name, against the advice of their Democratic
colleague and a United States supervisor. Following
Miss Anthony's example, some fifty other
women of Rochester registered. Fourteen voted
and were at once arrested under the enforcement
act of Congress of May 31, 1870 (<i>section</i> 19). The
case of Miss Anthony was argued, ably by her
<a name="Page_166"></a>attorney; but she was adjudged guilty. A <i>nolle
prosequi</i> was entered for the women who voted
with her.</p>
<p>Immediately after the decision in her case,
the inspectors who had registered the women were
put on trial because they "did knowingly and
willfully register as a voter of said District one
Susan B. Anthony, she, said Susan B. Anthony,
then and there not being entitled to be registered
as a voter of said District in that she, said Susan
B. Anthony, was then and there a person of the
female sex, contrary to the form of the statute of
the United States of America in such case made and
provided, and against the peace of the United
States of America and their dignity." The defendants
were ordered to pay each a fine of
twenty-five dollars and the costs of the prosecution;
but the sentence was revoked and an unconditional
pardon given them by President Grant, in an order
dated March 3, 1874. Miss Anthony was forced
to pay her fine, in spite of an appeal to Congress.</p>
<p>Such were the stirring times when the agitation
for women's rights was first brought to the fore
as a national issue. Within a few years, various
States, like New York and Kansas, put the question
of equal suffrage for women before its voters;
they in general rejected the measure. At present
there are four States which give women complete
suffrage and right to vote on all questions with the
same privileges as men, viz., Wyoming (1869),
Colorado (1893), Utah (1896), and Idaho (1896).
<a name="Page_167"></a>In 1838 Kentucky gave school suffrage to widows
with children of school age; in 1861 Kansas gave
it to all women. School suffrage was granted all
women in 1875 by Michigan and Minnesota, in
1876 by Colorado, in 1878 by New Hampshire and
Oregon, in 1879 by Massachusetts, in 1880 by
New York and Vermont, in 1883 by Nebraska,
in 1887 by North and South Dakota, Montana,
Arizona, and New Jersey. Kansas gave municipal
suffrage in 1887; and Montana gave tax-paying
women the right to vote upon all questions submitted
to the tax-payers. In 1891 Illinois granted
school suffrage, as did Connecticut in 1893. Iowa
gave bond suffrage in 1894. In 1898 Minnesota
gave women the right to vote for library trustees,
Delaware gave school suffrage to tax-paying
women, and Louisiana gave tax-paying women
the right to vote upon all questions submitted to
the tax-payers. Wisconsin gave school suffrage
in 1900. In 1901 New York gave tax-paying
women in all towns and villages of the State the
right to vote on questions of local taxation; and
the Kansas Legislature voted down almost unanimously
a proposal to repeal municipal suffrage.
In 1903 Kansas gave bond suffrage; and in 1907
the new State of Oklahoma continued school
suffrage. In 1908 Michigan gave all women who
pay taxes the right to vote upon questions of local
taxation and the granting of franchises.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> Age of Legal consent.</div>
<p>The history of the "age of legal consent" has
an importance which through prudery and a wilful
<a name="Page_168"></a>ignorance of facts the public has never fully
realised.
I shall have considerable to say of it
later. It will suffice for the moment
to remark that until the decade preceding
1898 the old Common Law
period of ten, sometimes twelve, years was the
basis of "age of consent" legislation in most States
and in the Territories under the jurisdiction of
the national government. In 1885 the age in
Delaware was <i>seven</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> The beginnings of higher education for women.</div>
<p>The Puritans, burning with an unquenchable
zeal for liberty, fled to America in order to build
a land of freedom and strike off the
shackles of despotism. After they were
comfortably settled, they forthwith proceeded,
with fine humour, to expel mistress
Anne Hutchinson for venturing to speak
in public, to hang superfluous old women for
being witches, and to refuse women the right to an
education. In 1684, when a question arose about
admitting girls to the Hopkins School of New
Haven, it was decided that "all girls be excluded
as improper and inconsistent with such a grammar
school as ye law enjoins and as in the Designs
of this settlement." "But," remarks Professor
Thomas, "certain small girls whose manners seem
to have been neglected and who had the natural
curiosity of their sex, sat on the schoolhouse steps
and heard the boys recite, or learned to read and
construe sentences from their brothers at home,
and were occasionally admitted to school."</p>
<p><a name="Page_169"></a>In the course of the next century the world
moved a little; and in 1789, when the public
school system was established in Boston, girls
were admitted from April to October; but until
1825 they were allowed to attend primary schools
only. In 1790 Gloucester voted that "two hours,
or a proportional part of that time, be devoted to
the instruction of females." In 1793 Plymouth
accorded girls one hour of instruction daily.</p>
<p>The first female seminary in the United States
was opened by the Moravians in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, in 1749. It was unique. In 1803,
of 48 academies or higher schools fitting for college
in Massachusetts, only three were for girls, although
a few others admitted both boys and girls.</p>
<p>The first instance of government aid for the
systematic education of women occurred in New
York, in 1819. This was due to the influence of a
remarkable woman. Mrs. Emma Willard had begun
teaching in Connecticut and by extraordinary
diligence mastered not only the usual subjects of
the curriculum, but in addition botany, chemistry,
mineralogy, astronomy, and the higher mathematics.
She had, moreover, striven always to introduce
new subjects and new methods into her
school, and with such success that Governor
Clinton, of New York, invited her to that State
and procured her a government subsidy. Her
school was established first at Watervliet, but
soon moved to Troy. This seminary was the first
girls' school in which the higher mathematics
<a name="Page_170"></a>formed a part of the course; and the first
public
examination of a girl in geometry, in 1829, raised
a storm of ridicule and indignation&#8212;the clergy, as
usual, prophesying the speedy dissolution of all
family bonds and therefore, as they continued
with remorseless logic, of the state itself. But
Mrs. Willard continued her ways in spite of clerical
disapproval and by-and-by projected a system
of normal schools for the higher education of
teachers, and even suggested women as superintendents
of public schools. New York survived
and does not even remember the names of the
patriots who fought a lonely woman so valiantly.</p>
<p>The first female seminary to approach college
rank was Mt. Holyoke, which was opened by
Mary Lyon at South Hadley, Mass., in 1836.
Vassar, the next, dates from 1865; and Radcliffe,
the much-abused "Harvard Annex," was instituted
in 1879. These were the first colleges
exclusively for women. Oberlin College had
from its foundation, in 1833, admitted men and
women on equal terms; although it took pains to
express its hearty disapproval of those women
who, after graduation, had the temerity to advocate
political rights for women&#8212;rights which
that same Oberlin insisted should be given the
negro at once. In 1858, when Sarah Burger and
other women applied for admission to the University
of Michigan, their request was refused.</p>
<div class="sidenote"> First women in medicine.</div>
<p>It was hard enough for women to assert their
rights to a higher education; to enter a profession
<a name="Page_171"></a>was almost impossible. Nevertheless, it was
done.
The pioneer in medicine was Harriet K. Hunt who
practised in Boston from 1822 to 1872
without a diploma; but in 1853 the
Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania
conferred upon her the degree of Doctor of
Medicine. The first woman to receive a diploma
from a college after completing the regular course
was Elizabeth Blackwell, who attained that distinction
at Geneva, New York, in 1848. The first adequate
woman's medical institution was Miss
Blackwell's New York Infirmary, chartered in 1854.
In 1863, Dr. Zakrzewska, in co-operation with
Lucy Goddard and Ednah D. Cheney, established
the New England Hospital for Women and Children,
which aimed to provide women the medical
aid of competent physicians of their own sex, to
assist educated women in the practical study of
medicine, and to train nurses for the care of the
sick.<a name="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> In law.</div>
<p>In law, it would seem that Mistress Brut
practised in Baltimore as early as 1647; but after
her the first woman lawyer in the United
States was Arabella A. Mansfield, of Mt.
Pleasant, Iowa. She was admitted to the bar in
1864. By 1879 women were allowed to plead
before the Supreme Court of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_412"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_172"></a><br>
</p>
<div class="sidenote">In the ministry.</div>
<p>Coming now to the consideration of the ministry,
the first woman to attempt to assert a right to
that profession was Anne Hutchinson,
of Boston, in 1634. She was promptly
banished. Among the Friends and the Shakers
women like Lucretia Mott and Anne Lee preached;
and among the primitive Methodists and similar
bodies women were always permitted to exhort;
but the first regularly ordained woman in the
United States appears to have been Rev. Antoinette
Brown Blackwell, of the Congregational Church
who was ordained in 1852. In 1864 Rev. Olympia
Brown settled as pastor of the parish at Weymouth
Landing, in Massachusetts; and the Legislature
acknowledged marriages solemnised by women as
legal. Phebe Hanaford, Mary H. Graves, and
Lorenza Haynes were the first Massachusetts
women to be ordained preachers of the Gospel;
the latter was at one time chaplain of the
Maine House of Representatives. The best
known woman in the ministry at the present
day is Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, a Methodist
minister, president of the National American
Woman's Suffrage Association.<a name="FNanchor_413"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> As newspaper editors.</div>
<p>Women have from very early times been exceedingly
active in newspaper work. Anna Franklin
printed the first newspaper in Rhode
Island, in 1732; she was made official
printer to the colony. When the founder of the
<i>Mercury</i>, of Philadelphia, died in 1742, his widow,
<a name="Page_173"></a>Mrs. Cornelia Bradford, carried it on for many
years with great success, just as Mrs. Zenger continued
the <i>New York Weekly Journal</i>&#8212;the second
newspaper started in New York&#8212;for years after
the death of her husband. Anna K. Greene
established the <i>Maryland Gazette</i>, the first paper
in that colony, in 1767. Penelope Russell printed
<i>The Censor</i> in Boston, in 1771. In fact, there was
hardly a colony in which women were not actively
engaged in printing. After the Revolution they
were still more active. Mrs. Anne Royal edited
<i>The Huntress</i> for a quarter of a century. Margaret
Fuller ran <i>The Dial</i>, in Boston, in 1840 and
numbered Emerson and William Channing among
her contributors. From 1840 to 1849 the mill
girls of Lowell edited the <i>Lowell Offering</i>. These
are but a few examples of what women have done
in newspaper work. How very influential they
are to-day every one knows who is familiar with
the articles and editorial work appearing in
newspapers and magazines; and that women are
very zealous reporters many people can attest
with considerable vigour.<a name="FNanchor_414"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a></p>
<div class="sidenote"> Women in industry.</div>
<p>The enormous part which women now play in
industry and in all economic production is a
concomitant of the factory system, specialised
industry, and all that makes
a highly elaborated and complex society. Be<a name="Page_174"></a>fore
the introduction of machine industry, and in
the simple society of the colonial days, women
were no less a highly important factor in economic
production; but not as wage earners. Their importance
lay in the fact that spinning, weaving,
brewing, cheese and butter making, and the like
were matters attended to by each household to
supply its own wants; and this was considered the
peculiar sphere of the housewife. In 1840 Harriet
Martineau found only seven employments open
to women in the United States, viz., teaching,
needlework, keeping boarders, working in cotton
mills and in book binderies, type-setting, and
household service.</p>
<p>I shall now present a series of fifty tables, by
means of which the reader may see at a glance the
status of women in all the States to-day. For convenience,
I shall arrange the views alphabetically.</p>
<br>
<p>TABLES SHOWING THE PRESENT STATUS OF WOMEN
IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>The right of "dower," as used in these tables,
refers to the widow's right, under the Common
Law, to the possession, for her life-time, of one
third of the real estate of which her husband was
possessed in fee-simple during the marriage.</p>
<p>"Curtesy" is the right of the husband after his
wife's death to the life use of his wife's real estate,
sometimes dependent on the birth of children,
sometimes not; and usually the absolute right to
her whole personal estate.</p>
<p><a name="Page_175"></a>It must be remembered that the enforcement
Of certain laws, particularly in regard to child
labour, is extremely lax in many States. It will
be noted also that an unscrupulous employer
could find loopholes in some of the statutes.
The reader can observe these things for himself
in his particular State.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_236"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
<p>It is twenty-three centuries since Plato gave to
the world his magnificent treatise on the
State. The dream of the Greek philosopher of
equal rights for all intelligent citizens, among
whom he includes women, has in large part been
realised; but much is yet wanting to bring society
to the standard of the Ideal Republic. In not a
few States of the world the conditions affecting
property rights are inequitable; in all but very
few States woman is still barred from the field of
politics and from the legitimate rights of citizenship;
and the day seems far distant when the
States possessing a representative government will
be prepared to accept the woman citizen as eligible
for administrative positions.</p>
<p>It will, therefore, be my purpose in this chapter
first to consider five of the most serious objections
to the granting of equal suffrage, that is to
say, to the concession to women of full citizens'
rights under the law. It will be found that these
objections are based on a presumed inferiority of
women to men in various respects. I shall give
consideration next in order to the question of the
<a name="Page_237"></a>inferiority or superiority of one sex over the
other.
In view, furthermore, of the new ferment in
thought in modern society, it will be useful to
analyse certain habits of mind and to indicate the
necessity for a readjustment of old beliefs in
the light of recent evolution. I shall conclude
my history with a suggestion for definite reforms
which, I believe, must be brought about, whether
equal suffrage is granted or not, before women can
attain their maximum of efficiency.</p>
<p>The opposition to the granting of equal suffrage
is, as I have said, based mainly upon five
classes of contentions:</p>
<br>

    <tr>

 style="margin-left: 1em;">V.</span></td>
      <td> The moral.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>A consideration and an analysis of these five
classes of objections will constitute a summary of
the relations of woman to the community, and
may also serve as a guide or suggestion to the
possibility of a legitimate development, in the
near future, of her rights as a citizen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span> The theological argument
is based upon
the distinctly evil conception of woman, presented
in <i>Genesis</i>, as the cause of misery in this world
and upon the subordinate position assigned to her
by Paul and Peter. Christ himself has left us
no teachings on the subject. The Hebrew and
Oriental creed of woman's sphere permeated the
<a name="Page_238"></a>West as Christianity expanded and forced to
extinction the Roman principle of equality. Only
within fifty years, has the female sex regained the
rights enjoyed by women under the law of the
Empire seventeen centuries ago. The Apostolic
theory of complete subordination gained strength
with each succeeding age. I have already cited
instances of ecclesiastical vehemence. As a final
example I may recall that when, early in the
nineteenth century, chloroform was first used
to help women in childbirth, a number of Protestant
divines denounced the practice as a sin
against the Creator, who had expressly commanded
that woman should bring forth in sorrow
and tribulation. Yet times have so far changed
within two decades that the theological argument
is practically obsolete among Protestants, although
it is still influential in the Roman Catholic
Church, which holds fast to the doctrine laid
down by the Apostles. We may say, however,
that of all the objections, the theological has, in
practice, the least weight among the bulk of the
population. The word <i>obey</i> in the clerical formula
<i>love, honour, and obey</i> provokes a smile.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span> The physiological
argument is more powerful.
Its supporters assert that the constitution
of woman is too delicate, too finely wrought to
compete with man in his chosen fields. The
physiological argument makes its appearance most
persistently in the statement that woman should
have no vote because she could not defend her
<a name="Page_239"></a>property or her country in time of war. In reply
to this some partisans of equal suffrage have
thought it necessary to prove that women are
physically equal in all respects to men. But the
issues between nations which in the centuries
past it had been believed could be adjusted only
by war, by being fought out (not, of course,
to any logical conclusion, but to a result which
showed simply that one party was stronger than
the other), are now, in the great majority of cases,
determined by the more reasonable, the more
civilised, method of arbitration.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the cause of woman's rights
will suffer no harm by a frank admission that
women are not, in general, the peers of men in
brute force. The very nature of the female sex,
subjected, as it is, to functional strains from which
the male is free, is sufficient to invalidate such a
claim. A refutation of the physiological objection
to equal suffrage is, however, not hard to
find. Even in war, as it is practised to-day,
physical force is of little significance compared
with strategy which is a product of the intellect.
In a naval battle for instance, ships no longer engage
at close range, where it is possible for the crew
of one to board the opposing ship and engage in
hand to hand conflict with the enemy; machinery
turns the guns and even loads them; the whole
fight is simply a contest between trained gunners,
who must depend for success on cool mathematical
computation.</p>
<p><a name="Page_240"></a>Nevertheless, it is true that under stress or
the
need of making a livelihood women in many instances
do show physical endurance equal to that
of men. Women who are expert ballet dancers
and those who are skilled acrobats can hardly
be termed physiological weaklings. In Berlin,
you may see women staggering along with huge
loads on their backs; in Munich, women are street-cleaners
and hod-carriers; on the island of Capri,
the trunk of the tourist is lifted by two men onto
the shoulder of a woman, who carries it up the
steep road to the village. In this country many
women are forced to do hard bodily labour ten
hours a day in sweat-shops. In all countries
and in all ages there have been examples of women
who, disguised as men, have fought side by
side with the male and with equal efficiency. The
case of Joan of Arc will at once occur to the
reader; and those who are curious about this
subject may, by consulting the records of our
Civil War, find exciting material in the story of
"Belle Boyd," "Frank Miller," and "Major
Cushman."<a name="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>
<p>Doubtless women are stronger physically than
they were a half-century ago, when it was considered
unladylike to exercise. If you will read
the novels of that time, you will find that the
heroine faints on the slightest provocation or
weeps copiously, like Amelia in <i>Vanity Fair</i>,
<a name="Page_241"></a>whenever the situation demands a grain of
will-power
or of common-sense. But to-day women
seldom faint or weep in literature; they play tennis
or row. When, in 1844, Pauline Wright Davis
lectured on physiology before women in America
and displayed the manikin, some of her auditors
dropped their veils, some ran from the room, and
some actually became unconscious, because their
sense of delicacy was put to so sharp a test.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind, in connection with
the contention that the privileges of a citizen
ought to be accorded only to those persons who
are physically capable of helping to defend the
community by force, that no such principle is applied
in fixing the existing qualifications for male
citizenship. A large number of the voters of
every community are, on the ground either of
advanced years or of invalidism, physically disqualified
for service as soldiers, sailors, or policemen.
This group of citizens includes a very large
proportion of the thinking power of the community.
No intelligently directed state would,
however, be prepared to deprive itself of the counsels,
of the active political co-operation, and of the
service from time to time in the responsibility of
office, of men of the type of Gladstone (at the age
of seventy-five), of John Stuart Mill (always a
physical weakling), of Washington (serving as
President after he was sixty), on the ground that
these citizens were no longer capable of carrying
muskets in the ranks.</p>
<p><a name="Page_242"></a>Any classification of citizens, any
privileges
extended to voters, ought, of course, to be arrived
at on a consistent and impartial principle.</p>
<p>Further, under the conditions obtaining in
this twentieth century, governments, whether of
nations, of states, or of cities, are carried on not
by force but by opinion. In the earlier history
of mankind, each family was called upon to maintain
its existence by physical force. The families
the members of which (female as well as male)
were not strong enough to fight for their existence
were crushed out. Par into the later centuries,
issues between individuals were adjusted by the
decision of arms. Up to within a very recent
date, it may be admitted that issues between
nations could be settled only by war. It is, however,
at this time the accepted principle of representative
government in all communities that
matters of policy are determined by the expression
of opinion, that is by means of the votes given by
the majority of its citizens. It is by intelligence
and not by brute force that the world is now being
ruled, and with the growth of intelligence and a
better understanding of the principles of government,
it is in order not only on the grounds of
justice but for the best interests of the state to
widen the foundations of representative government,
so as to make available for voting and for
official responsibilities all the intelligence that is
comprised within the community. This is in my
judgment the most conclusive reply to the objec<a name="Page_243"></a>tion
that the physical weakness of woman unfits
her for citizenship.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">III.</span> According to the social
or political argument,
if woman is given equal rights with man,
the basis of family life, and hence the foundation
of the state itself, is undermined, as a house
divided against itself cannot stand. It is said
that <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1) </span>there must be some
one authority in a
household and that this should be the man; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">(2)
</span>woman will neglect the home if she is left free to
enter politics or a profession; <span style="font-weight: bold;">(3)</span>
politics will
degrade her; <span style="font-weight: bold;">(4)</span> when
independent and self-asserting
she will lose her influence over man;
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">(5) </span>most women do not
want to vote or to
enter politics.</p>
<p>It is astonishing with what vehemence men will
base arguments on pure theory and speculation,
while they wilfully close their eyes to any facts
which may contradict their assumptions. It is
inconceivable to a certain type of mind that a
husband and wife can differ on political questions
and may yet maintain an even harmony, while
their love abates not one whit. In the four States
where women vote&#8212;Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
and Idaho&#8212;there is no more divorce than in
other States; and any one who has travelled in
these communities can attest that no domestic
unhappiness results from the suffrage. Nor does
it in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is said that there must be some one supreme
authority; but this depends on the view taken of
<a name="Page_244"></a>marriage. Under the old Common Law, the
personality of the wife was merged completely
in that of her husband; marriage was an absolute
despotism. Under the Canon Law, woman is
man's obedient and unquestioning subject; marriage
is a benevolent despotism. To-day people
are more inclined to look upon matrimony as a
partnership of equal duties, rights, and privileges.</p>
<p>Sophocles argued in one of his tragedies that
children belong entirely to the father, that the
mother can assert no valid claim for anything.
Lawyers have found this logic excellent; and the
records are full of instances of children being
taken from a hard-working mother in order to be
handed over to a drunken father who wants their
wages for his support. It is no longer so in most
states. Civilisation has advanced so far, that the
pains of bringing forth and raising children are
acknowledged to give the mother a right almost
equal to that of the father to determine all that
concerns the child. There is some reason, therefore,
for believing that she should have a voice
also in passing upon laws which may make or
undo for ever the welfare of the boys and girls for
whom she struggles during the years that they
are growing to manhood and womanhood. Men
are for the greater part so engrossed in business
that on certain questions they are far less competent
to be "authorities" than women. Against
stupid pedagogy, against red-tape, against the
policy that morality must never interfere with
<a name="Page_245"></a>business principles, against civic dirtiness,
against
brothel and saloon, women are more active than
men, because they see more clearly how vitally
the interests of their children are affected by these
evil conditions. Wherever women vote, these
questions are to the fore.</p>
<p>Closely connected with the "one authority"
argument is the old contention, so often resorted
to and relied upon, that women, if they are permitted
to vote, will neglect the home, and that,
if the professions are opened to them, they will
find these too absorbingly attractive. Much
weight should, however, be given to the great
power of the domestic instinct implanted in the
nature of woman. In the States where women
vote and are eligible for political offices, there
are fewer unmarried women in proportion to the
population than in States where they have no such
rights. The great leaders of the woman suffrage
movement from Mrs. Stanton to Mrs. Snowden
have in their home circle led lives as beautiful
and have raised families as large and as well
equipped morally and intellectually as those who
are content to sit by the fire and spin.</p>
<p>Thus far I have argued from the orthodox view,
that matrimony ought to be the goal of every
woman's ambition. But if a woman wishes to
remain single and devote herself exclusively to
the realisation of some ideal, it is hard to see
why she should not. Men who take this course
are eulogised for their noble self-sacrifice in
<a name="Page_246"></a>immolating themselves for the advancement of
the cause of civilisation; women who do precisely
the same thing are sometimes unthinkingly spoken
of in terms of contempt or with that complacent
pity which is far worse. It is difficult for us to
realise adequately what talented women like
Rosa Bonheur had to undergo because of this
curious attitude of humanity.</p>
<p>"The home is woman's sphere." This shibboleth
is the logical result of the attitude mentioned.
Doubtless, the home is woman's sphere;
but the home includes all that pertains to it&#8212;city,
politics and taxes, laws relating to the protection
of minors, municipal rottenness which may
corrupt children, schools and playgrounds and
museums which may educate them. Few doctrines
have been productive of more pain than the
"woman's sphere" argument. It is this which
has, for a thousand years, made the unmarried
woman, the <i>Old Maid</i>, the butt of the contemptible
jibes of Christian society, whereof you will find
no parallel in pagan antiquity. Dramatic writers
have held her up to ridicule on the stage on account
of the peculiarities of character which are
naturally acquired when a person is isolated from
participation in the activities of life. It is the
doctrine which has made women glad to marry
drunkards and rakes, to bring forth children
tainted with the sins of their fathers, and to suffer
hell on earth rather than incur the ridicule of the
Christian gentleman who may, without incurring
<a name="Page_247"></a>the protest of society, remain unmarried and sow
an unlimited quantity of wild oats. It is this doctrine
which was indirectly responsible for the
hanging and burning of eccentric old women on
the charge that they were witches. As men found
a divine sanction for keeping women in subjection,
so in those days of superstition did they blaspheme
their Creator by digging out of the Old Testament,
as a justification for their brutality, the text,
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."</p>
<p>"Politics will degrade women"&#8212;this na&iuml;ve
confession that politics are rotten is a fairly
strong argument that some good influence is
needed to make them cleaner. Generally speaking,
it is difficult to imagine how politics could be
made any worse. If a woman cannot go to the
polls or hold office without being insulted by
rowdies, her vote will be potent to elect officials
who should be able to secure for the community a
standard of reasonable civilisation. There is no
case in which more sentimentality is wasted.
Lovely woman is urged not to allow her beauty,
her gentleness, her tender submissiveness to become
the butt of the lounger at the street corner;
and in most instances lovely woman, like the
celebrated Ma&icirc;tre Corbeau, is cajoled effectively.
Meanwhile the brothel and the sweat-shop continue
on their prosperous way. By a curious
inconsistency, man will permit woman to help
him out of a political dilemma and will then
suavely remark that suffrage will degrade her.</p>
<p><a name="Page_248"></a>During the Civil War, Anna Dickinson by her
remarkable lecture entitled, "The National
Crisis" saved New Hampshire and Connecticut
for the Republicans; Anna Carroll not only gave
such a crushing rejoinder to Breckinridge's secession
speech that the government printed and
distributed it, but she also, as is now generally
believed, planned the campaign which led to the
fall of Forts Henry and Donelson and opened
the Mississippi to Vicksburg. How many men
realise these facts?</p>
<p>The theory that politics degrade women will
not find much support in such States as Colorado
and Wyoming. Here, where equal suffrage obtains,
women have been treated with uniform
courtesy at the polls; they have even been elected
to legislatures with no diminution of their womanliness;
and the House of Wyoming long ago made
a special resolution of its approval of equal rights
and attested the beneficial results that have followed
the extension of the suffrage to women.<a name="FNanchor_416"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a>
Judge Lindsey of Colorado has said that his
election, and consequent power to work out his
great reforms in juvenile delinquency, was due to
the backing of women at a time when men, for
"<a name="Page_249"></a>business reasons," were averse to extend their
aid. "No one would dare to propose its repeal
[i.e., the repeal of equal suffrage], and if left to
the men of the State any proposition to revoke the
rights bestowed on women would be overwhelmingly
defeated." Experience in Colorado and
elsewhere has shown that any important moral
issue will bring out the women voters in great
force; but after election they are content to resume
their domestic duties; and they have shown
no great desire for political office.<a name="FNanchor_417"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>
<p><a name="Page_250"></a>Before I leave the discussion as to whether
politics degrade women, it will not be out of
place to consider the question whether certain
women may not, if they have a vote, degrade
politics. Of such women there are two classes&#8212;the
immoral and the merely ignorant. As to
the former, much fear has been expressed that they
would be the very agents for unscrupulous politicians
to use at the polls. Exact data on this
<a name="Page_251"></a>matter are not available. I shall content myself
with quoting a statement by Mrs. Ida Husted
Harper<a name="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a>:</p>
<p>"That 'immoral' class," said Mrs. Harper, "is
a bogey that has never materialised in States
where women have the suffrage. Those women
don't vote. Indeed, Denver's experience has
been interesting in that respect. When equal
suffrage was first granted, women of that class
were compelled by the police to register. It was
a question of doing as the police said, of course,
or being arrested. The women did not want to
vote. They don't go under their real names; they
have no fixed residence, and so on. Anyway,
the last thing they wanted was to be registered
voters.</p>
<p>"But the corrupt political element needed their
vote, and were after it, through the police. These
women actually appealed to a large woman's
political club to use its influence to keep the police
from forcing them to register. A committee was
appointed; it was found that the story was true;
coercion was stopped, and the women's vote
turned out the chief of police who attempted it.
There is now no coercion, and this class simply
pays no attention to politics at all."</p>
<p>The doubling of the number of ignorant voters
by giving all women alike the ballot would be a
more serious affair. A remedy for that, however,
lies in making an educational test a necessary
<a name="Page_252"></a>qualification for all voters. In this connection
the remarks of Mr. G.H. Putnam are suggestive<a name="FNanchor_419"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a>:
"If I were a citizen of Massachusetts
or of any State which, like Massachusetts, possesses
such educational qualification, I should be
an active worker for the cause of equal suffrage.
As a citizen of New York who has during the last
fifty years done his share of work in the attempt
to improve municipal conditions, I am forced to
the conclusion that it will be wiser to endure for
a further period the inconsistency, the stupidity,
and the injustice of the disfranchisement of thousands
of intelligent women voters rather than to
accept the burden of an increase in the mass
of unintelligent voters. The first step toward
'equal suffrage' will, in my judgment, be a fight
for an educational qualification for all voters."</p>
<p>Those who maintain that when women are independent
and self-asserting, they will lose their
influence over men, assume that we view things
to-day as they did a century ago and that the
thoughts of men are not widened with the progress
of the suns. The woman who can share the
aspirations, the thoughts, the complete life of a
man, who can understand his work thoroughly
and support him with the sympathy born of
perfect comprehension, will exert a far vaster influence
over him than the milk-and-water ideal
who was advised "to smile when her husband
smiled, to frown when he frowned, and to be
<a name="Page_253"></a>discreetly silent when the conversation turned
on
subjects of importance." It is a good thing for
women to be self-asserting and independent.
There is and always has been a class of men who,
like Mr. Murdstone, are amenable to justice and
reason only when they know that their proposed
victim can at any time break the chains with
which they would bind her.</p>
<p>This brings us to the last of the social or political
arguments, viz., "Most women do not want to
vote."<a name="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a>
Precisely the same argument has been
used by slave owners from time immemorial&#8212;the
slaves do not wish to be free. As Professor
Thomas writes<a name="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a>:
"Certainly the negroes
of Virginia did not greatly desire freedom before
the idea was developed by agitation from the
outside, and many of them resented this outside
interference. 'In general, in the whole western
Sahara desert, slaves are as much astonished
to be told that their relation to their owners is
wrong and that they ought to break it, as
boys amongst us would be to be told that
their relation to their fathers was wrong and
ought to be broken.' And it is reported from
eastern Borneo that a white man could hire no
natives for wages. 'They thought it degrading to
work for wages, but if he would buy them, they
would work for him.'" It is akin to the old
<a name="Page_254"></a>contention of despots that when their subjects
are fit for freedom, they will make them free;
but nobody has ever seen such a time.</p>
<p>Reform of evil conditions does not come from
below; leaders with visions of the future must
point the way. I once heard of a very respectable
lady of Boston who exclaimed indignantly against
certain proposed changes in child labour laws in
North Carolina, where she owned shares in a cotton
mill. She maintained that the children who
worked at the looms ten hours a day expressed
no discontent; it kept them off the streets; and
the operators, in the kindness of their hearts, had
actually had the looms made especially to accommodate
conveniently the diminutive size of
the little workers. Some people might, with
great profit to themselves, read Plato's superb
allegory of the men in the cave.</p>
<p>The fact that various women's associations have
been instituted in opposition to the extension of
woman suffrage&#8212;as in Boston and New York&#8212;is
no argument for depriving all women of the
franchise. If the women who compose these
societies do not care to vote, they do not need to;
but they have no right to deprive of their rights
those who do so desire. It is said that good
women will not go to the polls; yet there are
in every large city hundreds of respectable males
who disdain to vote. A woman is more likely to
have a sense of duty to vote than a man. It is
the old cry, "Don't disturb the old order of things.</p>
<p><a name="Page_255"></a>If you make us think for ourselves, we shall
be so
unhappy." So Galileo was brought to trial,
so Anne Hutchinson was banished; and so persecuted
they the prophets before them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IV.</span> Another argument that is
made much of
is the intellectual inferiority of woman. For ages
women were allowed nor higher education than
reading, writing, and simple arithmetic, often
not even these; yet Elizabeth Barrett Browning,
George Sand, George Eliot, Harriet Martineau,
Jane Austen, and some scores of others did work
which showed them to be the peers of any minds
of their day. And if no woman can justly
claim to have attained an eminence such as that
of Shakespeare in letters or of Darwin in science,
we may question whether Shakespeare would have
been Shakespeare or Darwin Darwin if the society
which surrounded them had insisted that it was
a sin for them to use their minds and that they
should not presume to meddle with knowledge.
When a girl for the first time in America took a
public examination in geometry, in 1829, men
wagged their heads gravely and prophesied the
speedy dissolution of family and state.</p>
<p>To the list of women whose service for their
fellows would have been lost if the old-time barriers
had been maintained, may be added the name
of the late Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi. Mary
Putnam secured her preliminary medical education
in the early '60's, and found herself keenly
troubled and dissatisfied at the inadequacy of the
<a name="Page_256"></a>facilities extended to women for the study of
medicine. She insisted that if women practitioners
were to be, as she expressed it, "turned
loose" upon the community with license to practise,
they should, not only as a matter of justice
to themselves but of protection for the women
and children whose lives they would have in their
hands, be properly qualified.</p>
<p>At the time in question, the medical profession
took the ground that women might enjoy the
benefit of a little medical education but they were
denied the facilities for any thorough training or
for any research work. Mary Putnam secured
her graduate degree from the great medical school
of the University of Paris, being the first woman
who had been admitted to the school since the
fourteenth century. Returning after six years
of thorough training, she did much during the
remaining years of her life to secure and to maintain
for women physicians the highest possible
standard of training and of practice. It was
natural that with this experience of the requirement
of equal facilities for women in her own
work, she should always have been a believer in
the extension of equal facilities for any citizen's
work for which, after experience, women might
be found qualified. She was, therefore, an ardent
advocate of equal suffrage.</p>
<p>One needs but recall the admirable intellectual
work of women to-day to wonder at the imbecility
of those who assert that women are intellectually
<a name="Page_257"></a>the inferiors of men. Madame Curie in science,
Miss Tarbell in political and economic history,
Miss Jane Addams in sociological writings and
practice, the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw in the
ministry, Mrs. Hetty Green in business, are a
few examples of women whose mental ability
ought to bring a blush to the Old Guard. Mrs.
Harriman and Mrs. Sage, who manage properties
of many millions, are denied the privilege of
voting in regard to the expenditure of their taxes;
but every ignorant immigrant can cast a vote,
thanks to the doctrine that the political acumen
of a man, however degraded, is superior to that
of a woman, however great her genius&#8212;an admirable
obedience to the saw in Ecclesiasticus
that the badness of men is better than the goodness
of women. Let me quote again from Professor
Thomas: "The men have said that women
are not intelligent enough to vote, but the women
have replied that more of honesty than of intelligence
is needed in politics at present, and that
women certainly do not represent the most ignorant
portion of the population. They claim that
voting is a relatively simple matter anyway, that
political freedom 'is nothing but the control of
those who do make politics their business by those
who do not,' and that they have enough intelligence
'to decide whether they are properly governed,
and whom they will be governed by.'
They point out also that already, without the
ballot, they are instructing men how to vote and
<a name="Page_258"></a>teaching them how to run a city; that women have
to journey to the legislature at every session to
instruct members and committees at legislative
hearings, and that it is absurd that women who
are capable of instructing men how to vote should
not be allowed to vote themselves. To the suggestion
that they would vote like their husbands
and that so there would be no change in the political
situation, women admit that they would
sometimes vote like their husbands, because their
husbands sometimes vote right; but ex-Chief-Justice
Fisher of Wyoming says: 'When the
Republicans nominate a bad man and the Democrats
a good one, the Republican women do not
hesitate a moment to "scratch" the bad and substitute
the good. It is just so with the Democrats;
hence we almost always have a mixture of office-holders.
I have seen the effects of female suffrage,
and, instead of being a means of encouragement
to fraud and corruption, it tends greatly to purify
elections and to promote better government.'
Now, 'scratching' is the most difficult feature of
the art of voting, and if women have mastered
this, they are doing very well. Furthermore, the
English suffragettes have completely outgeneralled
the professional politicians. They discovered
that no cause can get recognition in politics unless
it is brought to the attention, and that John Bull
in particular will not begin to pay attention 'until,
you stand on your head to talk to him.' They
regretted to do this, but in doing it they secured
<a name="Page_259"></a>the attention and interest of all England. They
then followed a relentless policy of opposing the
election of any candidate of the party in power.
The Liberal men had been playing with the Liberal
women, promising support and then laughing the
matter off. But they are now reduced to an
appeal to the maternal instinct of the women.
They say it is unloving of them to oppose their
own kind. Politics is a poor game, but this is
politics."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">V.</span> The last objection I
would call the <i>moral</i>.
It embraces such arguments as, that woman is too
impulsive, too easily swayed by her emotions to
hold responsible positions, that the world is very
evil and slippery, and that she must therefore
constantly have man to protect her&#8212;a pious duty,
which he avows solemnly it has ever been his
special delight to perform. The preceding pages
are a commentary on the manner in which man
has discharged this duty. In Delaware, for instance,
the age of legal consent was until 1889
seven years. The institution of Chivalry, to take
another example, is usually praised for the high
estimation and protection it secured for women;
yet any one who has read its literature knows
that, in practice, it did nothing of the sort. The
noble lord who was so gallant to his lady love&#8212;who,
by the way, was frequently the wife of another
man&#8212;had very little scruple about seducing
a maid of low degree. The same gallantry
is conspicuous in the Letters of Lord Chesterfield,
<a name="Page_260"></a>beneath whose unctuous courtesy the beast of
sensuality is always leering.</p>
<p>In the past the main function of woman outside
of the rearing of children has been to satisfy
the carnal appetite of man, to prepare his food,
to minister to his physical comfort; she was
barred from participation in the intellectual.
In order to hold her to these bonds a Divine Sanction
was sought. The Mohammedan found it in
the Koran; the Christian, in the Bible&#8212;just as
slavery was justified repeatedly from the story
of Ham, just as the Stuarts and the Bourbons believed
firmly that they were the special favourites
of God.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, men who are so sensitive
about the moral welfare of women will visit a
dance hall where women are degraded nightly,
and will allow their daughters to marry "reformed"
rakes. Men will not permit any mention
of sexual matters in their homes, and will
let their children get their information on the
street; and all for the very simple reason that
they are afraid the truth will hurt, will make
people think. Men have been remarkably sensitive
about having women speak in public for their
rights; but they watch with zest a woman screaming
nonsense on the stage.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that many women are swayed
too easily by their emotions. We must recollect,
however, that for some thousands of years woman
has been carefully drilled to believe that she is an
<a name="Page_261"></a>emotional creature. If a dozen people conspire
to tell a man that he is looking badly, it is not
unlikely that he will feel ill. Certainly Florence
Nightingale and Clara Barton exhibited no lack
of firmness on the shambles of battlefields; and
there are few men living who cannot recall instances
of women who have, in the face of disaster
and evil fortune, shown a steady perseverance and
will-power in earning a living for themselves and
their children that men have not surpassed.</p>
<p>Having in the preceding pages considered the
five capital objections to the concession of equal
suffrage, I shall now, in accordance with my plan,
say something of the much-mooted question of
the superiority or inferiority of one sex to the other.
It might be concluded from the foregoing account
that I see little difference in the aptitudes and
powers of the sexes physically, morally, or intellectually.
That does not necessarily follow.
It is possible to conceive of each sex as the complement
of the other; and between complements
there can be no question either of superiority or
of inferiority. The great historian of European
Morals has analysed the constitutional differences
of the sexes as he conceived them; and I may
quote his remarks as pertinent to my theme.
Lecky writes as follows<a name="FNanchor_422"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a>:</p>
<p>"Physically, men have the indisputable super<a name="Page_262"></a>iority
in strength, and women in beauty. Intellectually,
a certain inferiority of the female sex
can hardly be denied when we remember how
almost exclusively the foremost places in every
department of science, literature, and art have
been occupied by men, how infinitesimally small
is the number of women who have shown in any
form the very highest order of genius, how many
of the greatest men have achieved their greatness
in defiance of the most adverse circumstances,
and how completely women have failed in obtaining
the first position, even in music or painting,
for the cultivation of which their circumstances
would appear most propitious. It is as impossible
to find a female Raphael, or a female Handel, as a
female Shakespeare or Newton. Women are intellectually
more desultory and volatile than men;
they are more occupied with particular instances
than with general principles; they judge rather
by intuitive perceptions than by deliberate reasoning
or past experience. They are, however,
usually superior to men in nimbleness and rapidity
of thought, and in the gift of tact or the power of
seizing speedily and faithfully the finer inflections
of feeling, and they have therefore often attained
very great eminence as conversationalists, as letter-writers,
as actresses, and as novelists.</p>
<p>"Morally, the general superiority of women over
men is, I think, unquestionable. If we take the
somewhat coarse and inadequate criterion of police
statistics, we find that, while the male and
<a name="Page_263"></a>female populations are nearly the same in
number,
the crimes committed by men are usually rather
more than five times as numerous as those committed
by women; and although it may be justly
observed that men, as the stronger sex, and the
sex upon whom the burden of supporting the
family is thrown, have more temptations than
women, it must be remembered, on the other hand,
that extreme poverty which verges upon starvation
is most common among women, whose
means of livelihood are most restricted, and whose
earnings are smallest and most precarious. Self-sacrifice
is the most conspicuous element of a
virtuous and religious character, and it is certainly
far less common among men than among women,
whose whole lives are usually spent in yielding to
the will and consulting the pleasures of another.
There are two great departments of virtue: the
impulsive, or that which springs spontaneously
from the emotions, and the deliberative, or that
which is performed in obedience to the sense of
duty; and in both of these I imagine women are
superior to men. Their sensibility is greater,
they are more chaste both in thought and act, more
tender to the erring, more compassionate to the
suffering, more affectionate to all about them....
In active courage women are inferior to men. In
the courage of endurance they are commonly
their superiors.... In the ethic of intellect
they are decidedly inferior. To repeat an expression
I have already employed, women very rarely
<a name="Page_264"></a>love truth, though they love passionately what
they call 'the truth' or opinions they have received
from others, and hate vehemently those
who differ from them. They are little capable of
impartiality or doubt; their thinking is chiefly a
mode of feeling; though very generous in their
acts, they are rarely generous in their opinions....
They are less capable than men of perceiving
qualifying circumstances, of admitting
the existence of elements of good in systems to
which they are opposed, of distinguishing the
personal character of an opponent from the
opinions he maintains. Men lean most to justice,
and women to mercy. Men are most addicted
to intemperance and brutality, women to frivolity
and jealousy. Men excel in energy, self-reliance,
perseverance, and magnanimity, women in humility,
gentleness, modesty, and endurance....
Their religious or devotional realisations are incontestably
more vivid.... But though more
intense, the sympathies of women are commonly
less wide than those of men. Their imaginations
individualise more, their affections are, in consequence,
concentrated rather on leaders than on
causes.... In politics, their enthusiasm is
more naturally loyalty than patriotism. In history,
they are even more inclined than men to
dwell exclusively upon biographical incidents or
characteristics as distinguished from the march
of general causes."</p>
<p>Experience, by which alone mankind has ever
<a name="Page_265"></a>learned or can learn, will show how far the
characteristics
enumerated by Lecky are innate and
how far they have been acquired in the course of
ages by certain habits of belief and education.</p>
<p>The securing of citizens' rights for woman will
of necessity depend on the attitude of society.
There may be numerous laws for her relief on the
statute books; but if society frowns on her appearance
in court, it will be only in exceptional
cases that she will appeal to the courts. To one
who is familiar with the records of daily life a
hundred years ago there is little doubt that conjugal
infidelity on the part of the husband was
more flagrant then than it is to-day; but there
were infinitely fewer divorces. The reason for
this is simply that public sentiment on the subject
has changed. A century ago, a divorced
woman could do nothing; the wife was exhorted
to bear her husband's faults with meekness;
and the expansion of industry had not yet opened
to her that opportunity of making her own living
which she now possesses in a hundred ways.
Women were entirely dependent on men; and the
men knew it. To-day they are not so sure.</p>
<p>The old conception of woman's position was
subjection, based on mental and physical inferiority
and supported by Biblical arguments. The
newer conception is that of a complement, in
which neither inferiority nor superiority finds
place. The old conception was based, like every
<a name="Page_266"></a>institution of the times, on fear. Men were
warned against heresy by being reminded of the
tortures of hell fire; against crime by appealing
to their dread of the gallows. Between the death
of Anne and the reign of George III one hundred
and eighty-eight capital offences were added to
the penal code; and crime at once increased to an
amazing degree. In a system that is founded on
fear, when once that fear is removed&#8212;as it
inevitably will be with the growth of enlightenment&#8212;there
remains no basis of action, no incentive
to good. It has been tried for centuries
and has yielded only Star Chambers and Spanish
Inquisitions. It is time that we try a new method.
An appeal to the sense of <i>fair play</i>, an appeal
to the sense of duty and of natural affection
may yield immeasurably superior results. It has
been my experience and personal observation
that the standard of honour in our non-sectarian
schools, where the <i>fair play</i> spirit is most insisted
on, is vastly greater than it was in the old
sectarian institutions where boys were told morning,
noon, and night that they would go to hell
if they did not behave.</p>
<p>The new spirit is not going to be accepted at
once by society. There must first be some wailing
and much gnashing of teeth; and the monster,
custom, which all sense doth eat, will still for a
time be antagonistic as it has been in the past.
"In no society has life ever been completely controlled
by the reason," remarks Professor Thomas,
"<a name="Page_267"></a>but mainly by the instincts and the habits and
the customs growing out of these. Speaking in
a general way, it may be said that all conduct
both of men and animals tends to be right rather
than wrong. They do not know why they behave
in such and such ways, but their ancestors
behaved in those ways and survival is the guaranty
that the behaviour was good. We must admit
that within the scope of their lives the animals
behave with almost unerring propriety. Their
behaviour is simple and unvarying, but they
make fewer mistakes than ourselves. The difficulty
in their condition is, that having little
power of changing their behaviour they have little
chance of improvement. Now, in human societies,
and already among gregarious animals, one
of the main conditions of survival was common
sentiment and behaviour. So long as defence of
life and preying on outsiders were main concerns
of society, unanimity and conformity had the
same value which still attaches to military discipline
in warfare and to team work in our sports.
Morality therefore became identified with uniformity.
It was actually better to work upon
some system, however bad, than to work on none
at all, and early society had no place for the dissenter.
Changes did take place, for man had the
power of communicating his experiences through
speech and the same power of imitation which
we show in the adoption of fashions, but these
changes took place with almost imperceptible
<a name="Page_268"></a>slowness, or if they did not, those who proposed
them were considered sinners and punished with
death or obloquy.</p>
<p>"And it has never made any difference how
bad the existing order of things might be. Those
who attempted to reform it were always viewed
with suspicion. Consequently our practices usually
run some decades or centuries behind our
theories and history is even full of cases where
the theory was thoroughly dead from the standpoint
of reason before it began to do its work
in society. A determined attitude of resistance
to change may therefore be classed almost with
the instincts, for it is not a response to the reason
alone, but is very powerfully bound up with the
emotions which have their seat in the spinal
cord.</p>
<p>"It is true that this adhesion to custom is more
absolute and astonishing in the lower races and
in the less educated classes, but it would be difficult
to point out a single case in history where a
new doctrine has not been met with bitter resistance.
We justly regard learning and freedom
of thought and investigation as precious, and we
popularly think of Luther and the Reformation as
standing at the beginning of the movement toward
these, but Luther himself had no faith in
'the light of reason' and he hated as heartily as
any papal dogmatist the 'new learning' of Erasmus
and Hutten.... We are even forced to
realise that the law of habit continues to do
<a name="Page_269"></a>its perfect work in a strangely resentful or
apathetic manner even when there is no moral
issue at stake.... Up to the year 1816, the
best device for the application of electricity to
telegraphy had involved a separate wire for each
letter of the alphabet, but in that year Francis
Ronalds constructed a successful line making
use of a single wire. Realising the importance of
his invention, he attempted to get the British
government to take it up, but was informed that
'telegraphs of any kind are now wholly unnecessary,
and no other than the one in use will be
adopted.'"</p>
<p>The reader will doubtless be able to add from
his own experience and observation examples
which will support Professor Thomas's admirable
account of the power of custom. Among many
barbarous tribes certain foods, like eggs, are
<i>taboo</i>; no one knows why they should not be eaten;
but tradition says their use produces bad results,
and one who presumes to taste them is put to
death. To-day, we believe ourselves rather highly
civilised; but the least observation of society
must compel us to acknowledge that <i>taboo</i> is
still a vital power in a multitude of matters.</p>
<p>There is a still more forcible opposition to a recasting
of the status of women by those men who
have beheld no complete regeneration of society
through the extension of the franchise in four
of our States. Curiously oblivious of the fact
that partial regeneration through the instru<a name="Page_270"></a>mentality
of women is something attained, they
take this as a working argument for the uselessness
of extending the suffrage. They point to
other evils that have followed and tell you that if
this is the result of the emancipation of women,
they will have none of it. For example, there
can be no doubt that one may see from time to
time the pseudo-intellectual woman. She affects
an interest in literature, attends lectures on
Browning and Emerson, shows an academic interest
in slum work, and presents, on the whole, a
selfishness or an egotism which repels. There
never has been a revolution in society, however
beneficial eventually, which did not bring at
least some evil in its train. I cannot do better
in this connection than to quote Lord Macaulay's
splendid words (from the essay on Milton): "If
it were possible that a people, brought up under
an intolerant and arbitrary system, could subvert
that system without acts of cruelty and folly,
half the objections to despotic power would be
removed. We should, in that case, be compelled
to acknowledge that it at least produces no pernicious
effects on the intellectual and moral character
of a people. We deplore the outrages which
accompany revolutions. But the more violent
the outrages, the more assured we feel that a
revolution was necessary. The violence of these
outrages will always be proportioned to the ferocity
and ignorance of the people; and the ferocity
and ignorance of the people will be proportioned
<a name="Page_271"></a>to the oppression and degradation under which
they have been accustomed to live. Thus it was
in our civil war. The rulers in the church and
state reaped only what they had sown. They
had prohibited free discussion&#8212;they had done
their best to keep the people unacquainted with
their duties and their rights. The retribution was
just and natural. If they suffered from popular
ignorance, it was because they had themselves
taken away the key to knowledge. If they were
assailed with blind fury, it was because they had
exacted an equally blind submission.</p>
<p>"It is the character of such revolutions that we
always see the worst of them at first. Till men
have been for some time free, they know not how
to use their freedom. The natives of wine-countries
are always sober. In climates where wine
is a rarity, intemperance abounds. A newly-liberated
people may be compared to a northern
army encamped on the Rhine or the Xeres. It is
said that when soldiers in such a situation first
find themselves able to indulge without restraint
in such a rare and expensive luxury, nothing
is to be seen but intoxication. Soon, however,
plenty teaches discretion; and after wine has been
for a few months their daily fare, they become
more temperate than they had ever been in their
own country. In the same manner, the final and
permanent fruits of liberty are wisdom, moderation,
and mercy. Its immediate effects are often
atrocious crimes, conflicting errors, skepticism on
<a name="Page_272"></a>points the most clear, dogmatism on points the
most mysterious. It is just at this crisis that
its enemies love to exhibit it. They pull down
the scaffolding from the half-finished edifice; they
point to the flying dust, the falling bricks, the
comfortless rooms, the frightful irregularity of
the whole appearance; and then ask in scorn where
the promised splendour and comfort are to be
found? If such miserable sophisms were to prevail,
there never would be a good house or a
good government in the world.... There is
only one cure for the evils which newly acquired
freedom produces&#8212;and that cure is freedom.
When a prisoner leaves his cell, he cannot bear
the light of day&#8212;he is unable to discriminate
colours or to recognise faces. But the remedy
is not to remand him into his dungeon, but to
accustom him to the rays of the sun. The
blaze of truth and liberty may at first dazzle
and bewilder nations which have become half-blind
in the house of bondage. But let them
gaze on, and they will soon be able to bear it.
In a few years men learn to reason. The extreme
violence of opinion subsides. Hostile theories
correct each other. The scattered elements
of truth cease to conflict, and begin to coalesce.
And at length a system of justice and order is
educed out of the chaos.</p>
<p>"Many politicians of our time are in the habit
of laying it down as a self-evident proposition,
that no people ought to be free till they are
<a name="Page_273"></a>fit to use their freedom. The maxim is worthy
of the fool in the old story, who resolved not to
go into the water till he had learnt to swim. If men
are to wait for liberty till they become wise and
good in slavery, they may indeed wait for ever."</p>
<p>The speedy dissolution of family and state was
prophesied by men when first a girl took a public
examination in geometry; whenever women have
been given complete control of their own property;
when they have been received into the professions
and industries; and now in like manner
people dread the condition of things that they
imagine might follow if women are given the right
to vote and to hold office. We may well believe,
with Lecky, that there are "certain eternal moral
landmarks which never can be removed." But
no matter what our views may be of the destinies,
characteristics, functions, or limitations of the
sex, certain reforms are indispensable before woman
and, through her, family life can reach their
highest development. Of these reforms I shall
speak briefly and with them close my history.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span> The double standard of
morality for the
sexes must gradually be abolished.<a name="FNanchor_423"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> Of all the
<a name="Page_274"></a>sad commentaries on Christian nations none is so
pathetic or so tragical as the fact that for nineteen
centuries men have been tacitly and openly allowed,
at least before marriage, unrestrained
liberty to indulge in sexual vice and intemperance,
while one false step on the part of the woman
has condemned her to social obloquy and,
frequently, to a life on the street. This strange
system, a blasphemy against the Christ who
suffered death in order to purify the earth, has
had its defenders not merely among the uneducated
who do not think, but even among
the most acute intellects. The philosopher
Hume justifies it by commenting on the vastly
greater consequences attendant on vice in women
than in men; divines like Jeremy Taylor
have encouraged it by urging women meekly
to bear the sins of their husbands. This subject
is one of the great <i>taboos</i> in modern society.
Let me exhort the reader to go to
any physician and get from him the statistics
of gonorrhea and syphilis which he has met
in his practice; let him learn of the children
born blind and of wives rendered invalid
for life because their husbands once sowed
a crop of wild oats with the sanction of society;
let him read the Report of the Committee
of Fifteen in New York (G.P. Putnam's
Sons, 1902) on <i>The Social Evil</i>, the records
of the Watch and Ward Society in Boston,
or the recent report of the special jury in
<a name="Page_275"></a>New York which investigated the "White Slave
Traffic."<a name="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>
<p>The plain facts are not pleasant. A system
which has been in vogue from the beginning of
history cannot be changed in a decade; but the
desired state of things will be more speedily
achieved and immediate good will be accomplished
by three reforms which may be begun at
once&#8212;have begun, in fact. In the first place, the
"age of legal consent" should be uniformly
twenty-one. In most States to-day it is fourteen
or sixteen.<a name="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a>
To the ordinary mind it is a self-evident
proposition that a girl of those ages, the
slippery period of puberty, can but seldom realise
what she is doing when she submits herself to the
lust of scoundrels. But the minds of legislators
pass understanding; and when, a few years ago,
a woman in the Legislature of Colorado proposed
to have the age of consent raised from sixteen to
twenty-one, such a storm of protest came from her
male colleagues that the measure had to be abandoned.
In the second place the public should be
made better acquainted with the facts of prostitution.
When people once realise thoroughly
what sickness and social ulcers result from the
<a name="Page_276"></a>presence in the city of New York of 100,000
debauched
women (and the estimate is conservative)&#8212;when
they begin to reflect that their
children must grow up in such surroundings, then
perhaps they will question the expediency of the
double standard of morality and will insist that
what is wrong for a woman is wrong for a man.
It is a fact, to be borne carefully in mind, that
the vast majority of prostitutes begin their career
below the age of <i>eighteen</i> and usually at the
instigation of adult <i>men</i>, who take advantage of
their ignorance or of their poverty. If the miserable
Thaw trial did nothing else, it at least once
more called public attention to conditions which
every intelligent man knows have existed for
years. Something can also be done by statute.
New York has made adultery a crime; and the
State of Washington requires a physical examination
of the parties before marriage. In the third
place, physicians should take more pains to educate
men to the knowledge that a continent life
is not a detriment to health&#8212;the contrary belief
being more widely spread than is usually suspected.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">II.</span> In the training of
women, care should be
taken to impress upon them that they are not
toys or spoiled children, but fellow-citizens, devoted
to the common task of advancing the ideals
of the nation to their goal.</p>

<p>WORDSWORTH.</p>
<p>Towards a higher conception of their duties,
women are steadily advancing. It often happens
that the history of words will give a hint of the
progress of civilisation. Such a story is told by
the use of <i>lady</i> and <i>woman</i>. Not many decades
ago the use of the word <i>woman</i> in referring to
respectable members of the sex was interpreted
as a lack of courtesy. To-day, women prefer
to be called <i>women</i>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">III.</span> Women should be given
the full right to
enter any profession or business which they may
desire. As John Stuart Mill says:</p>
<p>"The proper sphere for any human being is
the highest sphere that being is capable of attaining;
and this cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice."</p>
<p>"We are, as always, in a period of transition,"
remarks Mr. Bj&ouml;rkman,<a name="FNanchor_426"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> "the old forms are
<a name="Page_278"></a>falling away from us on every side. Concerning
the new ones we are still uncertain and divided.
Whether woman shall vote or not, is not the main
issue. She will do so sooner or later if it suits
her. No, the imperative question confronting us
is this: What are we to do that her life once
more may be full and useful as it used to
be? That question cannot be answered by anybody
but herself. Furthermore, it can only be
answered on the basis of actual experience. And
urged onward by her never-failing power of intuition,
woman has for once taken to experimenting.
She has, if you please, become temporarily
catabolic. But it means merely that she is seeking
for new means to fulfil her nature, not for
ways of violating it. And the best thing&#8212;nay,
the only thing&#8212;man can do to help her is to stand
aside and keep his faith, both in her and in life.
Whether it be the franchise, or the running of
railroads, or public offices, that her eager hands
and still more eager soul should happen to reach
out for, he must give her free way. All she
wants is to find herself, and for this purpose
she must try everything that once was foreign
to her being: the trial over, she will instinctively
and unfailingly pick out the right new things
to do, and will do them."</p>
<p>The opening up of professions and industries to
woman has been of incalculable benefit to her.
Of old the unmarried woman could do little except
sit by the fire and spin or make clothing for
<a name="Page_279"></a>the South Sea Islanders. Her limited activities
caused a corresponding influence on her character.
People who have nothing to do will naturally
find an outlet for their superfluous energy in
gossip and all the petty things of life; if isolated
from a share in what the world is doing, they will
no less naturally develop eccentricities of character
and will grow old prematurely. To-day, by being
allowed a part in civic and national movements,
women can "get out of themselves"&#8212;a powerful
therapeutic agent. Mrs. Ella Young, a woman of
sixty, was last year made Superintendent of the
great Public School System of Chicago. Fr&auml;ulein
Anna Heinrichsdorff is the first woman in Germany
to get an engineer's diploma, very recently
bestowed upon her; an "excellent" mark was given
Fr&auml;ulein Heinrichsdorff in every part of her examination
by the Berlin Polytechnic Institute.
Miss Jean Gordon, the only factory inspector
in Louisiana, is at present waging a strong fight
against the attempt to exempt "first-class"
theatres from the child-labour law. Mrs. Nellie
Upham, of Colorado, is President and General
Manager of the Gold Divide Mining, Milling,
and Tunnel Company of Colorado and directs
300 workmen. These are a few examples out of
some thousands of what woman is doing.<a name="FNanchor_427"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> And
<a name="Page_280"></a>yet there are men who do not believe she should
do anything but wash dishes and scrub.</p>
<p>Much more serious is the glaring discrepancy
in the wages paid to men and to women. For
doing precisely the same work as a man and often
doing it better, woman receives a much lower
<a name="Page_281"></a>wage. The reasons are several and specious.
We are told that men have families to support,
that women do not have such expensive tastes
as men, that they are incapable of doing as much
as men, that by granting them equal wages one
of the inducements to marry is removed. These
arguments are generally used with the greatest
gravity by bachelors. If men have families to
support, women by the hundreds support brothers
and sisters and weak parents. That they are
incapable of doing as much sounds unconvincing
<a name="Page_282"></a>to one who has seen the work of sweat-shops. The
argument that men have more expensive tastes
to satisfy is too feeble to deserve attention.
Finally, when men argue that women should be
forced to marry by giving them smaller wages,
they are simply reverting to the time-honoured
idea that the goal of every women's ambition
should be fixed as matrimony. If the low wages
of women produced no further consequence, one
might dismiss the matter as not of essential importance;
but inadequate pay has been found too
frequently to be a direct cause of prostitution.
No girl can well keep body and soul together on
four dollars a week and some business managers
have been known to inform their women employees
with frankness that a "gentleman friend" is a
necessary adjunct to a limited income.</p>
<p>The women who suffer most from low wages
are probably the teachers in our primary schools.
They start usually on a salary of about three
hundred and fifty dollars a year. For this each
teacher performs all the minute labour and bears
all the nervous strain of instructing sixty pupils
six and a half hours a day and of correcting dozens
of papers far into the night. And when crime
increases or the pupils are not universally successful
in business, the school teacher has the
added pleasure of getting blamed for it, being
told that she ought to have trained them better.
These facts lend some colour to Mark Twain's
sage reflection that God at first made idiots&#8212;<a name="Page_283"></a>that
was for practice; then he made school
boards.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting examples of recent
evolution in the industrial status of women is
the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois in the
so-called Ritchie Case. The last Legislature of
Illinois passed a law limiting to ten hours the
working day of women in factories and stores.
Now, as far back as 1893, the Legislature had
passed a similar law limiting woman's labour to
<i>eight</i> hours; but the Supreme Court in 1895 declared
it unconstitutional on the ground that it
was an arbitrary and unreasonable interference
with the right of women to contract for the sale
of their labour. When, therefore, this year a
ten-hour bill was tried, W.C. Ritchie, who had
secured the nullification of the act of 1893, again
protested. The decision of the Court, rendered
April 21, 1910, is an excellent proof of the great
advance made within two decades in the position
of women. Reversing completely its judgment of
1895, the Court left far behind it mere technicalities
of law and found a sanction for its change
of front in the experience of humanity and of common
sense. These are its conclusions:</p>
<p>"It is known to all men, and of what we know
as men we cannot profess to be ignorant as judges:</p>
<p>"That woman's physical structure and the performance
of maternal functions place her at a
great disadvantage in the battle of life.</p>
<p>"That while a man can work for more than ten
<a name="Page_284"></a>hours a day without injury to himself, a woman,
especially when the burdens of motherhood are
upon her, cannot.</p>
<p>"That while a man can work standing upon
his feet for more than ten hours a day, day
after day, without injury to himself, a woman
cannot.</p>
<p>"That to require a woman to stand upon her
feet for more than ten hours in any one day and to
perform severe manual labour while thus standing
has the effect of impairing her health.</p>
<p>"And as weakly and sickly women cannot be
the mothers of vigorous children, it is of the greatest
importance to the public that the State take
such measures as may be necessary to protect
its women from the consequences produced by
long-continued manual labour in those occupations
which tend to break them down physically.</p>
<p>"It would seem obvious, therefore, that legislation
which limits the number of hours which
women shall be permitted to work to ten hours in
a single day in such employments as are carried
on in mechanical establishments, factories, and
laundries would tend to preserve the health of
women and assure the production of vigorous
offspring by them and would conduce directly to
the health, morals, and general welfare of the
public, and that such legislation would fall clearly
within the police powers of the State."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IV.</span> All phenomena that
concern family life
should be carefully studied and their bearing on
<a name="Page_285"></a>the state ascertained as exactly as possible.
There is no subject, for example, from which such
wild conclusions are drawn as the matter of divorce.
The average moralist, but more particularly the
clergy, seeing the fairly astonishing increase in
divorce during the last decade, jump to the conclusion
that family life is decadent and immorality
flagrantly on the increase. They point to
the indubitable fact that a century ago divorces
were insignificant in number; and they infer that
morality was then on a much higher level than it
is now. Such alarmists neglect certain elementary
facts. The flippant manner in which marriage
is treated by the Restoration dramatists and by
novelists of the 18th century, the callous sexual
morality revealed in diaries and in the conversations
of men like Johnson alone are sufficient to
suggest the need of a readjustment of one's view
regarding the standard of morality in the past.
A century ago it was the duty of a gentleman to
drink to excess; and it was presumed that a guest
had not enjoyed his dinner unless he was at least
comfortably the worse for liquor. This view of
drunkenness is admirably depicted in Dickens's
<i>Pickwick Papers</i>, where intoxication is treated
throughout as something merely humorous.</p>
<p>There were just as many unhappy marriages
formerly in proportion to the population as there
are to-day; but the wife was held effectually from
application for a divorce not only by rigid laws
but by the sentiment of society, which ostracised
<a name="Page_286"></a>a divorced woman, and furthermore by her lack
of means and of opportunity for earning an independent
livelihood. To-day women are not
inclined to tolerate a husband who is brutal or
debauched. Alarmists make a mistake when
they place too much emphasis on the seeming
triviality of the reasons, justifying their course,
which wives advance when applying for a separation.
For example, the phrase "incompatibility
of temperament" is in a great number of cases
merely a euphemism for something much worse.
The clergy will counsel a woman to bear with what
they call Christian resignation a husband addicted
to drink or scarred by the diseases that
are a consequence of sin. Abstractly considered,
this may conceivably be good advice. But viewed
in a common-sense way it is the duty of a woman
to reflect on the consequences of conceiving children
from such a man; and the researches of physicians
will furnish her with incontrovertible facts
regarding the impaired health of the offspring of
such a union. A law which would permit of no
divorce under such conditions, instead of benefiting
the state, would injure it in its most
vital asset&#8212;healthy children, the coming citizens.
Doubtless the divorce laws in many States are
too lax. But sweeping generalities based on
theory will not remedy matters. Divorce may
simply be a symptom, not a disease; a revolt
against unjust conditions; and the way to do away
with divorce or reduce the frequency of it is to
<a name="Page_287"></a>remedy the evil social conditions which, in a
great many instances, are responsible.</p>
<p>The fact is, the institution of marriage is going
through a crisis. The old view that marriage
is a complete merging of the wife in the husband
and that the latter is absolute monarch of his
home is being questioned. When a man with
this idea and a woman with a far different one
marry, there is likely to be a clash. Marriage
as a real partnership based on equality of goods
and of interests finds an increasing number of
advocates. There is great reason to believe
that the issue will be only for the good and that
from doubt and revolt a more enduring ideal will
arise, based on a sure foundation of perfect
understanding.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_288"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2>FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
<br>
<p>In the four years intervening since this book was
first written, the progress of equal rights for
women has been so rapid that the summary on
pages 175-235 is now largely obsolete; but it is
useful for comparison. In the United States at
present (August, 1914), Wyoming, Colorado,
Utah, Idaho, Washington, California, Oregon,
Kansas, Arizona, and Alaska have granted full
suffrage to women. In the following States the
voters will pass upon the question in the autumn
of 1914: Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Ohio, the last
three by initiative petition. In New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Iowa, New York, and Massachusetts
a constitutional amendment for equal suffrage
has passed one legislature and must pass
another before being submitted to the people.
The advance has been world-wide. Thus, in 1910
the Gaekwar of Baroda in India allowed the women
of his dominions a vote in municipal elections, and
Bosnia bestowed the parliamentary suffrage on
women who owned a certain amount of real estate;
Norway in 1913 and Iceland in 1914 were won to
<a name="Page_289"></a>full suffrage. The following table presents a
convenient historical summary of the progress in
political rights:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>On July 2, 1776, two days before the Declaration of Independence
was signed, New Jersey, in her first State constitution, enfranchised
the women by changing the words of her provincial
charter from "Male freeholders worth &pound;50" to "<i>all inhabitants</i>
worth &pound;50," and for 31 years the women of that State voted.</p>
</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">GAINS IN EQUAL
SUFFRAGE</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>Eighty years ago women could not vote anywhere, except to
a very limited extent in Sweden and in a few other places in the
Old World.<br>

<a name="Page_291"></a>In the United States the struggle for the
franchise
has entered national politics, a sure sign of
its widening scope. The demand for equal suffrage
was embodied in the platform of the Progressive
Party in August, 1912. This marks an advance
over Col. Roosevelt's earlier view, expressed in
the <i>Outlook</i> of February 3, 1912, when he said:
"I believe in woman's suffrage wherever the
women want it. Where they do not want it, the
suffrage should not be forced upon them." When
the new administration assumed office in March,
1913, the friends of suffrage worked to secure a
constitutional amendment which should make
votes for women universal in the United States.
<a name="Page_292"></a>The inauguration ceremonies were marred by an
attack of hoodlums on the suffrage contingent of
the parade. Mr. Hobson in the House denounced
the outrage and mentioned the case of a young
lady, the daughter of one of his friends, who was
insulted by a ruffian who climbed upon the float
where she was. Mr. Mann, the Republican minority
leader, remarked in reply that her daughter
ought to have been at home. Commenting on
this dialogue, <i>Collier's Weekly</i> of April 5, 1913,
recalled the boast inscribed by Rameses III of
Egypt on his monuments, twelve hundred years
before Christ: "To unprotected women there is
freedom to wander through the whole country
wheresoever they list without apprehending danger."
If one works this out chronologically,
said the editor, Mr. Mann belongs somewhere
back in the Stone Age. In the Senate an active
committee on woman suffrage was formed under
the chairmanship of Mr. Thomas, of Colorado.
The vote on the proposed new amendment was
taken in the Senate on March 19, 1914, and it
was rejected,<a name="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a>
35 to 34, two-thirds being necessary
<a name="Page_293"></a>before the measure could be submitted to the
States for ratification. In the House Mr. Underwood,
Democratic minority leader, took the stand
that suffrage was purely a State issue. Mr.
Heflin of Alabama was particularly vigorous in
denunciation of votes for women. He said<a name="FNanchor_429"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a>:
<p>"I do not believe that there is a red-blooded
man in the world who in his heart really believes
in woman suffrage. I think that every man who
favours it ought to be made to wear a dress. Talk
about taxation without representation! Do you
say that the young man who is of age does not
represent his mother? Do you say that the young
man who pledges at the altar to love, cherish, and
protect his wife, does not represent her and his
children when he votes? When the Christ of God
came into this world to die for the sins of humanity,
did he not die for all, males and females?
What sort of foolish stuff are you trying to inject
into this tariff debate?... There are trusts and
monopolies of every kind, and these little feminine
fellows are crawling around here talking about
woman suffrage. I have seen them here in this
Capitol. The suffragette and a little henpecked
fellow crawling along beside her; that is her husband.
She is a suffragette, and he is a mortal
suffering yet."</p>
<p><a name="Page_294"></a>Mr. Falconer of Washington rose in reply. He
remarked:<a name="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>
<p>"I want to observe that the mental operation
of the average woman in the State of Washington,
as compared to the ossified brain operation of the
gentleman from Alabama, would make him look
like a mangy kitten in a tiger fight. The average
woman in the State of Washington knows more
about social economics and political economy in
one minute than the gentleman from Alabama has
demonstrated to the members of this House that
he knows in five minutes."</p>
<p>On February 2, 1914, a delegation of women
called upon President Wilson to ascertain his
views. The President refused to commit himself.
He was not at liberty, he said, to urge upon
Congress policies which had not the endorsement
of his party's platform; and as the representative
of his party he was under obligations not to promulgate
or intimate his individual convictions.
On February 3, 1914, the Democrats of the House
in caucus, pursuant to a resolution of Mr. Heflin,
refused to create a woman suffrage committee.
So the constitutional amendment was quite lost.
In the following July Mr. Bryan suddenly issued
a strong appeal for equal suffrage in the <i>Commoner</i>.
Among his arguments were these:</p>
<p>"As man and woman are co-tenants of the earth
and must work out their destiny together, the
presumption is on the side of equality of treatment
<a name="Page_295"></a>in all that pertains to their joint life and its
opportunities.
The burden of proof is on those who
claim for one an advantage over the other in determining
the conditions under which both shall
live. This claim has not been established in the
matter of suffrage. On the contrary, the objections
raised to woman suffrage appear to me to be
invalid, while the arguments advanced in support of
the proposition are, in my judgment, convincing."</p>
<p>"Without minimising other arguments advanced
in support of the extending of suffrage to
woman, I place the emphasis upon the mother's
right to a voice in molding the environment which
shall surround her children&#8212;an environment
which operates powerfully in determining whether
her offspring will crown her latter years with joy
or 'bring down her gray hairs in sorrow to the
grave.'</p>
<p>"For a time I was imprest by the suggestion
that the question should be left to the women to
decide&#8212;a majority to determine whether the
franchise should be extended to woman; but I find
myself less and less disposed to indorse this test....
Why should any mother be denied the use
of the franchise to safeguard the welfare of her
child merely because another mother may not
view her duty in the same light?"</p>
<p>The change in the status of women has been
significant not only in the political field, but also
in every other direction. A brief survey of the
legislation of various States in the past year, 1913,
<a name="Page_296"></a>reveals the manifold measures already adopted
for
the further protection of women and indicates
the trend of laws in the near future. Acts were
passed in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico,
and Ohio to punish the seduction of girls and women
for commercialised vice, the laws being known
as "White Slave Acts"; laws for the abatement
of disorderly houses were passed in California,
Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington;
Oregon decreed that male applicants for a
marriage license must produce a physician's certificate
showing freedom from certain diseases;
and it authorised the sterilisation of habitual
criminals and degenerates. The necessity of
inculcating chastity in the newer generation,
whether through the teaching of sex hygiene in
the schools or in some other form, was widely
discussed throughout the country. Mothers' pensions
were granted by fourteen States; minimum
wage boards were established by three; and three
passed laws for the punishment of family desertion,
in such wise that the family of the offender
should receive a certain daily sum from the State
while he worked off his sentence. Tennessee removed
the disability of married women arising
from coverture. Ten States further limited the
hours of labour for women in certain industries,
the tendency being to fix the limit at fifty-four
or fifty-eight hours a week with a maximum of
nine or ten in any one day. The hours of labour
of children and the age at which they are allowed
<a name="Page_297"></a>to work were largely restricted. A National
Children's Bureau, under the charge of Miss Julia
Lathrope, has been created at Washington; and
Mrs. J. Borden Harriman was appointed to the
Industrial Relations Commission. The minuteness
and thoroughness of modern legislation for
the protection of women may be realised by noting
that in 1913 alone New York passed laws that no
girl under sixteen shall in any city of the first,
second, or third class sell newspapers or magazines
or shine shoes in any street or public place; that
separate wash rooms and dressing rooms must be
provided in factories where more than ten women
are employed; that whenever an employer requires
a physical examination, the employee, if a
female, can demand a physician of her own sex;
that the manufacture or repair for a factory of
any article of food, dolls' clothing, and children's
apparel in a tenement house be prohibited except
by special permit of the Labor Commission; that
the State Industrial Board be authorised to make
special rules and regulations for dangerous employments;
and that the employment of women
in canning establishments be strictly limited
according to prescribed hours.</p>
<p>The unmistakable trend of legislation in the
United States is towards complete equality of the
sexes in all moral, social, industrial, professional,
and political activities.</p>
<p>In England the House of Commons rejected
parliamentary suffrage for women. Incensed at
<a name="Page_298"></a>the repeated chicanery of politicians who
alternately
made and evaded their promises, a group
of suffragettes known as the "militants" resorted
to open violence. When arrested for damaging
property, they went on a "hunger strike," refusing
all nourishment. This greatly embarrassed
the government, which in 1913 devised the so-called
"Cat and Mouse Act," whereby those who
are in desperate straits through their refusal to eat
are released temporarily and conditionally, but
can be rearrested summarily for failure to comply
with the terms of their parole. The weakness in
the attitude of the militant suffragettes is their
senseless destruction of all kinds of property and
the constant danger to which they subject innocent
people by their outrages. If they would confine
themselves to making life unpleasant for those who
have so often broken their pledges, they could
stand on surer ground. The English are commonly
regarded as an orderly people, especially
by themselves. Nevertheless, it is true that hardly
any great reform has been achieved in England
without violence. The men of England did not
secure the abolition of the "rotten-borough"
system and extensive manhood suffrage until, in
1831, they smashed the windows of the Duke of
Wellington's house, burned the castle of the Duke
of Newcastle, and destroyed the Bishop's palace
at Bristol. In 1839 at Newport twenty chartists
were shot in an attempt to seize the town; they
were attempting to secure reforms like the aboli<a name="Page_299"></a>tion
of property qualifications for members of
Parliament. The English obtained the permanent
tenure of their "immemorial rights" only by
beheading one king and banishing another. In
our own country, the Boston Tea Party was a
typical "militant outrage," generally regarded
as a fine piece of patriotism. If the tradition of
England is such that violence must be a preliminary
to all final persuasion, perhaps censure of
the militants can find some mitigation in that fact.
Some things move very slowly in England. In
1909 a commission was appointed to consider reform
in divorce. Under the English law a husband
can secure a divorce for infidelity, but a
woman must, in addition to adultery, prove aggravated
cruelty. This is humorously called
"British fair play." In November, 1912, the
majority of the commission recommended that
this inequality be removed and that the sexes be
placed on an equal footing; and that in addition
to infidelity, now the only cause for divorce allowed,
complete separation be also granted for
desertion for three years, incurable insanity, and
incurable habitual drunkenness. The majority,
nine commissioners, found that the present stringent
restrictions and costliness of divorce are
productive of immorality and illicit relations,
particularly among the poorer classes. The majority
report was opposed by the three minority
members, the Archbishop of York, Sir William
Anson, and Sir Lewis Dibdin, representing the
<a name="Page_300"></a>Established Church of England and the Roman
Catholic Church. Thus far, Parliament has not
yet acted and the old law is still in force.</p>
<p>On the Continent, with the exception of a few
places like Finland, the movement for equal
suffrage, while earnestly pressed by a few, is not
yet concentrated. Women have won their rights
to higher education and are admitted to the
universities. They can usually enter business
and most of the professions. Inequities of civil
rights are gradually being swept away. For
example, in Germany a married woman has complete
control of her property, but only if she specifically
provided for it in the marriage contract;
many German women are ignorant that they
possess such a right. The Germans may be
divided into two classes: the caste which rules,
largely Prussian, militaristic, and bureaucratic;
and that which, although desirous of more republican
institutions and potentially capable of
liberal views, is constrained to obey the first or
ruling class. This upper class is not friendly
to the modern women's-rights movement. Perhaps
it has read too much Schopenhauer. This
amiable philosopher, whose own mother could
not endure living with him, has this to say of
women<a name="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a>:</p>
<p>"A woman who is perfectly truthful and does
not dissemble, is perhaps an impossibility. In a
<a name="Page_301"></a>court of justice women are more often found
guilty
of perjury than men.... Women are directly
adapted to act as the nurses and educators of our
early childhood, for the simple reason that they
themselves are childish, foolish, and shortsighted.... Women
are and remain, taken altogether,
the most thorough and incurable Philistines; and
because of the extremely absurd arrangement
which allows them to share the position and title
of their husbands they are a constant stimulus to
his ignoble ambitions.... Where are there any
real monogamists? We all live, at any rate for a
time, and the majority of us always, in polygamy.... It
is men who make the money, and not
women; therefore women are neither justified in
having unconditional possession of it nor capable
of administering it.... That woman is by nature
intended to obey, is shown by the fact that every
woman who is placed in the unnatural position
of absolute independence at once attaches herself
to some kind of man, by whom she is controlled
and governed; that is because she requires a
master. If she is young, the man is a lover; if she
is old, a priest."</p>
<p>Essentially the opinion of Schopenhauer is that
of the Prussian ruling class to-day. It is indisputable
that in Germany, as elsewhere on the
Continent, chastity in men outside of marriage is
not expected, nor is the wife allowed to inquire
into her husband's past. The bureaucratic German
expects his wife to attend to his domestic
<a name="Page_302"></a>comforts; he does not consult her in politics.
The natural result when the masculine element
has not counterchecks is bullying and coarseness.
To find the coarseness, the reader can consult the
stories in papers like the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> and
much of the current drama; to observe the bullying,
he will have to see it for himself, if he doubts
it. This is not an indictment of the whole German
people; it is an indictment of the militaristic-bureaucratic
ruling class, which, persuaded of its
divine inspiration and intolerant of criticism,<a name="FNanchor_432"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a>
has plunged the country into a devastating war.
It is not unlikely that the end of the conflict will
mark also the overthrow of the Hohenzollern
dynasty. The spirit of the Germans of 1848, who
labored unsuccessfully to make their country a
republic, may awake again and realise its dreams.
In concluding this chapter, I wish to enlarge
somewhat upon the philosophy of suffrage as
exhibited in the preceding chapter. The "woman's
sphere" argument is still being worked
overtime by anti-suffrage societies, whose members
rather inconsistently leave their "sphere," the
<a name="Page_303"></a>home, to harangue in public and buttonhole
legislators
to vote against the franchise for women.
"A woman's place," says the sage Hennessy, "is
in th' home, darning her husband's childher. I
mean----" "I know what ye mean," says Mr.
Dooley. "'Tis a favrite argument iv mine whin I
can't think iv annything to say." A century ago,
the home was the woman's sphere. To-day the
man has deliberately dragged her out of it to
work for him in factory and store because he can
secure her labor more cheaply than that of men
and is, besides, safer in abusing her when she has
no direct voice in legislation. Are the manufacturers
willing to send their 1,300,000 female employees
back to their "sphere"? If they are not,
but desire their labor, they ought in fairness to
allow them the privileges of workmen&#8212;that is, of
citizens, participating actively in the political,
social, and economic development of the country.</p>
<p>As women enter more largely into every profession
and business, certain results will inevitably
follow. We shall see first of all what pursuits are
particularly adapted to them and which ones are
not. It has already become apparent that as
telephone and typewriter operators women, as a
class, are better fitted than men. They have, in
general, greater patience for details and quickness
of perception in these fields. Similarly, in
architecture some have already achieved conspicuous
success. One who has observed the insufficient
closet space in modern apartments and
<a name="Page_304"></a>kitchenettes with the icebox in front of the
stove,
is inclined to wish that male architects would
consult their mothers or wives more freely. In
law and medicine results are not yet clear. We
shall presently possess more extensive data in all
fields for surer conclusions.</p>
<p>A second result may be, that many women,
instead of leaving the home, will be forced back
into it. This movement will be accelerated if the
granting of equal pay for equal work and a universal
application of the minimum wage take
place. There are a great number of positions,
especially those where personality is not a vital
factor, where employers will prefer women when
they can pay them less; but if they must give equal
pay, they will choose men. Hence the tendency
of the movements mentioned is to throw certain
classes of women back into the home. The home
of the future, however, will have lost much of the
drudgery and monotony once associated with it.
The ingenious labor-saving devices, like the breadmixer,
the fireless cooker, the vacuum cleaner,
and the electric iron, the propagation of scientific
knowledge in the rearing of children, and wider
outlets for outside interests, will tend to make
domestic life an exact science, a profession as
important and attractive as any other.</p>
<p>The home is not necessarily every woman's
sphere and neither is motherhood. Neither is it
every woman's congenital duty to make herself
attractive to men. The "woman's pages" of
<a name="Page_305"></a>newspapers, filled with gratuitous advice on
these
subjects, never tell men that their duty is fatherhood
or that they should make themselves attractive
or that their sphere is also the home. Until
these one-sided points of view are adjusted to a
more reasonable basis, we shall not reach an
understanding. They are as unjust as the farmer
who ploughs with a steam plow and lets his wife
cart water from a distant well instead of providing
convenient plumbing.</p>
<p>Women who are fitted for motherhood and have
a talent for it can enter it with advantage. There
is a talent for motherhood exactly as there is for
other things. Other women have genius which
can be of greatest service to the community in
other ways. They should have opportunity to
find their sphere. If this is "Feminism," it is
also simple justice. One reason that we are at
sea in some of the problems of the women's-rights
movement, is that the history of women has been
mainly written by men. The question of motherhood,
the sexual life of women, and the position
of women as it has been or is likely to be affected
by their sexual characteristics, must be more
exactly ascertained before definite conclusions
can be reached. At present there is too much
that we don't know. We need more scientific
investigations of the type of Mr. Havelock Ellis's
admirable <i>Studies in the Psychology of Sex</i><a name="FNanchor_433"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a>
and less of pseudo-scientific lucubrations like Otto
<a name="Page_306"></a>Weininger's <i>Sex and Character</i>. When
human
society has rid itself of the bogies and nightmares,
superstitions and prejudices, which have borne
upon it with crushing force, it will be in a better
position to construct an ideal system of government.
Meanwhile experiments are and must be
made. Woman suffrage is not necessarily a reform;
it is a necessary step in evolution.</p>
<p>One venerable bogey I wish to dispose of before
I close. It is that the Roman Empire was ruined
and collapsed because the increasing liberty given
to women and the equality granted the sexes under
the Empire produced immorality that destroyed
the State. The trouble with Rome was that it
failed to grasp the fundamentals of economic law.
Slavery, the concentration of land in a few hands,
and the theory that all taxation has for its end the
enriching of a select few, were the fallacies which,
in the last analysis, caused the collapse of the
Roman Empire. The luxury, immorality, and
race-suicide which are popularly conceived to have
been the immediate causes of Rome's decline and
fall, were in reality the logical results, the inevitable
attendant phenomena of a political system
based on a false hypothesis. For when wealth
was concentrated in a few hands, when there
was no all-embracing popular education, all incentives
to thrift, to private initiative, and hence
to the development of the sturdy moral qualities
which thrift and initiative cause and are the product
of, were stifled. A nation can reach its
<a name="Page_307"></a>maximum power only when, through the harmonious
cooperation of all its parts, the initiative and
talents of every individual have free scope, untrammeled
by special privilege, to reach that sphere
for which nature has designed him or her.</p>
<p>NOTE: The official organ of the National American
Woman Suffrage Association is <i>The Woman's
Journal</i>, published weekly. The headquarters
are at 505 Fifth Avenue, New York City.</p>
<p>England has two organisations which differ
in methods. The National Union of Women's
Suffrage Societies has adopted the constitutional
or peaceful policy; it publishes <i>The Common Cause</i>,
a weekly, at 2 Robert Street, Adelphi, W.C.,
London. The "militant" branch of suffragettes
forms the National Women's Social and Political
Union, and its weekly paper is <i>Votes for Women</i>,
Lincoln's Inn House, Kingsway, W.C.</p>
<p>The International Woman Suffrage Alliance
issues the <i>Jus Suffragii</i> monthly at 62 Kruiskade,
Rotterdam.</p>
<p>A good source from which to obtain the present
status of women in Europe is the <i>Englishwoman's
Year Book and Directory for 1914</i>, published by
Adam and Charles Black.<br>

<p> Twenty-six senators did not vote. The question of negro
suffrage complicated the matter with Southern senators. Mr.
Williams of Mississippi wished to limit the franchise to "white
citizens"; but his amendment was voted down. The list of
senators voting for and against the woman suffrage amendment
appears on page 5472 of the Congressional Record, March 19,
1914. The debate is contained in pages 5454-5472. Senator
Tillman of South Carolina inserted a vicious attack on northern
women by the late Albert Bledsoe, who advised them to "cut
their hair short, and their petticoats, too, and enter a la bloomer
the ring of political prizefighters." Bledsoe's article will be
found in the Record, July 28, 1913, 3115-3119.</p>

<p> Any criticism of the Kaiser leads to arrest. The most vigorous
checks to Bourbon rule come from the Socialists, who in
1912 polled 4,250,300 votes. But as the Kaiser, as King of
Prussia, controls a majority of votes in the Bundesrath, or
Federal Council, can dissolve the Reichstag, or House of
Representatives,
at any time with the consent of the Bundesrath,
has sole power to appoint the chancellor, and is lord supreme of
the army and navy, anything like real popular government is
far off.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
https://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

For additional contact information:
     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
