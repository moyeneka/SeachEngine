    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. A CLIENT FOR PAUL HARLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some of Paul Harley&rsquo;s most interesting cases were brought to his notice in
      an almost accidental way. Although he closed his office in Chancery Lane
      sharply at the hour of six, the hour of six by no means marked the end of
      his business day. His work was practically ceaseless. But even in times of
      leisure, at the club or theatre, fate would sometimes cast in his path the
      first slender thread which was ultimately to lead him into some
      unsuspected labyrinth, perhaps in the underworld of London, perhaps in a
      city of the Far East.
    </p>
    <p>
      His investigation of the case of the man with the shaven skull afforded an
      instance of this, and even more notable was his first meeting with Major
      Jack Ragstaff of the Cavalry Club, a meeting which took place after the
      office had been closed, but which led to the unmasking of perhaps the most
      cunning murderer in the annals of crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      One summer&rsquo;s evening when the little clock upon his table was rapidly
      approaching the much-desired hour, Harley lay back in his chair and stared
      meditatively across his private office in the direction of a large and
      very handsome Burmese cabinet, which seemed strangely out of place amid
      the filing drawers, bookshelves, and other usual impedimenta of a
      professional man. A peculiarly uninteresting week was drawing to a close,
      and he was wondering if this betokened a decreased activity in the higher
      criminal circles, or whether it was merely one of those usual quiescent
      periods which characterize every form of warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley, although the fact was unknown to the general public, occupied
      something of the position of an unofficial field marshal of the forces
      arrayed against evildoers. Throughout the war he had undertaken
      confidential work of the highest importance, especially in regard to the
      Near East, with which he was intimately acquainted. A member of the
      English bar, and the last court of appeal to which Home Office and Foreign
      Office alike came in troubled times, the brass plate upon the door of his
      unassuming premises in Chancery Lane conveyed little or nothing to the
      uninitiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man himself, with his tropical bronze and air of eager vitality, must
      have told the most careless observer that he stood in the presence of an
      extraordinary personality. He was slightly gray at the temples in these
      days, but young in mind and body, physically fit, and possessed of an
      intellectual keenness which had forced recognition from two hemispheres.
      His office was part of an old city residence, and his chambers adjoined
      his workroom, so that now, noting that his table clock registered the hour
      of six, he pressed a bell which summoned Innes, his confidential
      secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Innes,&rdquo; said Harley, looking around, &ldquo;another uneventful day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very uneventful, Mr. Harley. About a month of this and you will have to
      resume practice at the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit likely, Innes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;No more briefs for me. I shall
      retire to Norfolk and devote my declining years to fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that fishing would entirely satisfy me,&rdquo; said Innes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would more than satisfy me,&rdquo; returned Harley. &ldquo;But every man to his
      own ambition. Well, there is no occasion to wait; you might as well get
      along. But what&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got in your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Innes, laying a card upon the table, &ldquo;I was just coming in
      with it when you rang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley glanced at the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Charles Abingdon,&rdquo; he read aloud, staring reflectively at his
      secretary. &ldquo;That is the osteologist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Innes, &ldquo;but I fancy he has retired from practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured Harley, &ldquo;I wonder what he wants. I suppose I had better see
      him, as I fancy that he and I met casually some years ago in India. Ask
      him to come in, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Innes retiring, there presently entered a distinguished-looking, elderly
      gentleman upon whose florid face rested an expression not unlike that of
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harley,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I feel somewhat ill at ease in encroaching upon
      your time, for I am by no means sure that my case comes within your
      particular province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said Harley with quiet geniality. &ldquo;Officially, my
      working day is ended; but if nothing comes of your visit beyond a chat it
      will have been very welcome. Calcutta, was it not, where we last met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; replied Sir Charles, placing his hat and cane upon the table and
      sitting down rather wearily in a big leather armchair which Harley had
      pushed forward. &ldquo;If I presume upon so slight an acquaintance, I am sorry,
      but I must confess that only the fact of having met you socially
      encouraged me to make this visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes to Harley&rsquo;s face and gazed at him with that peculiarly
      searching look which belongs to members of his profession; but mingled
      with it was an expression of almost pathetic appeal, of appeal for
      understanding, for sympathy of some kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said Harley. He pushed forward a box of cigars.
      &ldquo;Will you smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, no,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles evidently was oppressed by some secret trouble, thus Harley
      mused silently, as, taking out a tin of tobacco from a cabinet beside him,
      he began in leisurely manner to load a briar. In this he desired to convey
      that he treated the visit as that of a friend, and also, since business
      was over, that Sir Charles might without scruple speak at length and at
      leisure of whatever matters had brought him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; began the surgeon; &ldquo;I am painfully conscious that the
      facts which I am in a position to lay before you are very scanty and
      unsatisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley nodded encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this were not so,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;you would have no occasion to apply
      to me, Sir Charles. It is my business to look for facts. Naturally, I do
      not expect my clients to supply them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles slowly nodded his head, and seemed in some measure to recover
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Briefly, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe my life is in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that there is someone who desires your death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Harley, replacing the tin in the cupboard and striking a
      match. &ldquo;Even if the facts are scanty, no doubt you have fairly substantial
      grounds for such a suspicion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say that they are substantial, Mr. Harley. They are rather more
      circumstantial. Frankly, I have forced myself to come here, and now that I
      have intruded upon your privacy, I realize my difficulties more keenly
      than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of embarrassment upon the speaker&rsquo;s face had grown intense;
      and now he paused, bending forward in his chair. He seemed in his glance
      to appeal for patience on the part of his hearer, and Harley, lighting his
      pipe, nodded in understanding fashion. He was the last man in the world to
      jump to conclusions. He had learned by bitter experience that lightly to
      dismiss such cases as this of Sir Charles as coming within the province of
      delusion, was sometimes tantamount to refusing aid to a man in deadly
      peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are naturally anxious for the particulars,&rdquo; Sir Charles presently
      resumed. &ldquo;They bear, I regret to say, a close resemblance to the symptoms
      of a well-known form of hallucination. In short, with one exception, they
      may practically all be classed under the head of surveillance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surveillance,&rdquo; said Paul Harley. &ldquo;You mean that you are more or less
      constantly followed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your impression of this follower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very hazy one. To-night, as I came to your office, I have every reason
      to believe that someone followed me in a taxicab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came in a car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a cab followed you the whole way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically the whole way, except that as my chauffeur turned into
      Chancery Lane, the cab stopped at the corner of Fleet Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your idea is that your pursuer followed on foot from this point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such was my impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, quite impossible. And is this sort of thing constant, Sir Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been for some time past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One very notable thing, Mr. Harley. I was actually assaulted less than a
      week ago within sight of my own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Tell me of this.&rdquo; Paul Harley became aware of an awakening
      curiosity. Sir Charles Abingdon was not the type of man who is lightly
      intimidated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had been to visit a friend in the neighbourhood,&rdquo; Sir Charles
      continued, &ldquo;whom I am at present attending professionally, although I am
      actually retired. I was returning across the square, close to midnight,
      when, fortunately for myself, I detected the sound of light, pattering
      footsteps immediately behind me. The place was quite deserted at that
      hour, and although I was so near home, the worst would have happened, I
      fear, if my sense of hearing had been less acute. I turned in the very
      instant that a man was about to spring upon me from behind. He was holding
      in his hand what looked like a large silk handkerchief. This encounter
      took place in the shadow of some trees, and beyond the fact that my
      assailant was a small man, I could form no impression of his identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned and struck out with my stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he made no attempt to contest the issue, but simply ran swiftly off,
      always keeping in the shadows of the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very strange,&rdquo; murmured Harley. &ldquo;Do you think he had meant to drug you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; replied Sir Charles. &ldquo;The handkerchief was perhaps saturated with
      some drug, or he may even have designed to attempt to strangle me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you formed absolutely no impression of the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever, Mr. Harley. When you see the spot at which the encounter
      took place, if you care to do so, you will recognize the difficulties. It
      is perfectly dark there after nightfall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; mused Harley. &ldquo;A very alarming occurrence, Sir Charles. It must
      have shaken you very badly. But we must not overlook the possibility that
      this may have been an ordinary footpad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His methods were scarcely those of a footpad,&rdquo; murmured Sir Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree,&rdquo; said Harley. &ldquo;They were rather Oriental, if I may say
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles Abingdon started. &ldquo;Oriental!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Yes, you are
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does this suggest a train of thought?&rdquo; prompted Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles Abingdon cleared his throat nervously. &ldquo;It does, Mr. Harley,&rdquo;
       he admitted, &ldquo;but a very confusing train of thought. It leads me to a
      point which I must mention, but which concerns a very well-known man.
      Before I proceed I should like to make it clear that I do not believe for
      a moment that he is responsible for this unpleasant business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley stared at him curiously. &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there must be
      some data in your possession which suggest to your mind that he has some
      connection with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are, Mr. Harley, and I should be deeply indebted if you could visit
      my house this evening, when I could place this evidence, if evidence it
      may be called, before you. I find myself in so delicate a position. If you
      are free I should welcome your company at dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley seemed to be reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Sir Charles,&rdquo; he said, presently, &ldquo;your statement is very
      interesting and curious, and I shall naturally make a point of going fully
      into the matter. But before proceeding further there are two questions I
      should like to ask you. The first is this: What is the name of the
      &lsquo;well-known&rsquo; man to whom you refer? And the second: If not he then whom do
      you suspect of being behind all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one matter is so hopelessly involved in the other,&rdquo; he finally
      replied, &ldquo;that although I came here prepared as I thought with a full
      statement of the case, I should welcome a further opportunity of
      rearranging the facts before imparting them to you. One thing, however, I
      have omitted to mention. It is, perhaps, of paramount importance. There
      was a robbery at my house less than a week ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! A robbery! Tell me: what was stolen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the slightest value, Mr. Harley, to any one but myself&mdash;or
      so I should have supposed.&rdquo; The speaker coughed nervously. &ldquo;The thief had
      gained admittance to my private study, where there are several cases of
      Oriental jewellery and a number of pieces of valuable gold and silverware,
      all antique. At what hour he came, how he gained admittance, and how he
      retired, I cannot imagine. All the doors were locked as usual in the
      morning and nothing was disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I chanced to have occasion to open my bureau which I invariably keep
      locked. Immediately&mdash;immediately&mdash;I perceived that my papers
      were disarranged. Close examination revealed the fact that a short
      manuscript in my own hand, which had been placed in one of the
      pigeonholes, was missing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A manuscript,&rdquo; murmured Harley. &ldquo;Upon a technical subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely a technical subject, Mr. Harley. It was a brief account which I
      had vaguely contemplated publishing in one of the reviews, a brief account
      of a very extraordinary patient whom I once attended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had you written it recently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; some years ago. But I had recently added to it. I may say that it was
      my purpose still further to add to it, and with this object I had actually
      unlocked the bureau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New facts respecting this patient had come into your possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the date of the attack upon you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before that date, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And before surveillance of your movements began?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I suggest that your patient and the &lsquo;well-known man&rsquo; to whom you
      referred are one and the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; returned Sir Charles in a tired voice.
      &ldquo;Nothing so simple. I realize more than ever that I must arrange my facts
      in some sort of historical order. Therefore I ask you again: will you dine
      with me to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; replied Harley, promptly. &ldquo;I have no other engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That his ready acceptance had immensely relieved the troubled mind of Sir
      Charles was evident enough. His visitor stood up. &ldquo;I am not prone to
      sickly fancies, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But a conviction has been growing
      upon me for some time that I have incurred, how I cannot imagine, but that
      nevertheless I have incurred powerful enmity. I trust our evening&rsquo;s
      counsel may enable you, with your highly specialized faculties, to detect
      an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was instructive to note how fluently he spoke now that he found
      himself temporarily relieved of the necessity of confessing the source of
      his mysterious fears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE SIXTH SENSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Paul Harley stepped into his car in Chancery Lane. &ldquo;Drive in the direction
      of Hyde Park Corner,&rdquo; he directed the chauffeur. &ldquo;Go along the Strand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glancing neither right nor left, he entered the car, and presently they
      were proceeding slowly with the stream of traffic in the Strand. &ldquo;Pull up
      at the Savoy,&rdquo; he said suddenly through the tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car slowed down in that little bay which contains the entrance to the
      hotel, and Harley stared fixedly out of the rear window, observing the
      occupants of all other cars and cabs which were following. For three
      minutes or more he remained there watching. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they proceeded westward and, half-way along Piccadilly, &ldquo;Stop at the
      Ritz,&rdquo; came the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car pulled up before the colonnade and Harley, stepping out, dismissed
      the man and entered the hotel, walked through to the side entrance, and
      directed a porter to get him a taxicab. In this he proceeded to the house
      of Sir Charles Abingdon. He had been seeking to learn whether he was
      followed, but in none of the faces he had scrutinized had he detected any
      interest in himself, so that his idea that whoever was watching Sir
      Charles in all probability would have transferred attention to himself
      remained no more than an idea. For all he had gained by his tactics, Sir
      Charles&rsquo;s theory might be no more than a delusion after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of Sir Charles Abingdon was one of those small, discreet
      establishments, the very neatness of whose appointments inspires respect
      for the occupant. If anything had occurred during the journey to suggest
      to Harley that Sir Charles was indeed under observation by a hidden enemy,
      the suave British security and prosperity of his residence must have
      destroyed the impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cab was driven away around the corner, Harley paused for a moment,
      glancing about him to right and left and up at the neatly curtained
      windows. In the interval which had elapsed since Sir Charles&rsquo;s departure
      from his office, he had had leisure to survey the outstanding features of
      the story, and, discounting in his absence the pathetic sincerity of the
      narrator, he had formed the opinion that there was nothing in the account
      which was not susceptible of an ordinary prosaic explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles&rsquo;s hesitancy in regard to two of the questions asked had
      contained a hint that they might involve intimate personal matters, and
      Harley was prepared to learn that the source of the distinguished
      surgeon&rsquo;s dread lay in some unrevealed episode of the past. Beyond the
      fact that Sir Charles was a widower, he knew little or nothing of his
      private life; and he was far too experienced an investigator to formulate
      theories until all the facts were in his possession. Therefore it was with
      keen interest that he looked forward to the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Familiarity with crime, in its many complexions, East and West, had
      developed in Paul Harley a sort of sixth sense. It was an evasive, fickle
      thing, but was nevertheless the attribute which had made him an
      investigator of genius. Often enough it failed him entirely. It had failed
      him to-night&mdash;or else no one had followed him from Chancery Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had failed him earlier in the evening when, secretly, he had watched
      from the office window Sir Charles&rsquo;s car proceeding toward the Strand.
      That odd, sudden chill, as of an abrupt lowering of the temperature, which
      often advised him of the nearness of malignant activity, had not been
      experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, standing before Sir Charles&rsquo;s house, he &ldquo;sensed&rdquo; the atmosphere
      keenly&mdash;seeking for the note of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a thunder shower just before he had set out, and now,
      although rain had ceased, the sky remained blackly overcast and a curious,
      dull stillness was come. The air had a welcome freshness and the
      glistening pavements looked delightfully cool after the parching heat of
      the day. In the quiet square, no doubt, it was always restful in contrast
      with the more busy highroads, and in the murmur of distant traffic he
      found something very soothing. About him then were peace, prosperity, and
      security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as he stood there, waiting&mdash;it came to him: the note of danger.
      Swiftly he looked to right and left, trying to penetrate the premature
      dusk. The whole complexion of the matter changed. Some menace intangible
      now, but which at any moment might become evident&mdash;lay near him. It
      was sheer intuition, no doubt, but it convinced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he had rung the bell; and as a man opened the door, showing
      a easy and well-lighted lobby within, the fear aura no longer touched Paul
      Harley. Out from the doorway came hominess and that air of security and
      peace which had seemed to characterize the house when viewed from outside.
      The focus of menace, therefore, lay not inside the house of Sir Charles
      but without. It was very curious. In the next instant came a possible
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paul Harley?&rdquo; said the butler tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Charles is expecting you, sir. He apologizes for not being in to
      receive you, but he will only be absent a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Charles has been called out?&rdquo; inquired Harley as he handed hat and
      coat to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. He is attending Mr. Chester Wilson on the other side of the
      square, and Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s man rang up a few moments ago requesting Sir
      Charles to step across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; murmured Harley, as the butler showed him into a small but
      well-filled library on the left of the lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refreshments were set invitingly upon a table beside a deep lounge chair.
      But Harley declined the man&rsquo;s request to refresh himself while waiting and
      began aimlessly to wander about the room, apparently studying the titles
      of the works crowding the bookshelves. As a matter of fact, he was
      endeavouring to arrange certain ideas in order, and if he had been
      questioned on the subject it is improbable that he could have mentioned
      the title of one book in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mental equipment was of a character too rarely met with in the
      profession to which he belonged. While up to the very moment of reaching
      Sir Charles&rsquo;s house he had doubted the reality of the menace which hung
      over this man, the note of danger which he had sensed at the very
      threshold had convinced him, where more ordinary circumstantial evidence
      might have left him in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps pure imagination, but experience had taught him that it was
      closely allied to clairvoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now upon his musing there suddenly intruded sounds of a muffled
      altercation. That is to say, the speakers, who were evidently in the lobby
      beyond the library door, spoke in low tones, perhaps in deference to the
      presence of a visitor. Harley was only mildly interested, but the voices
      had broken his train of thought, and when presently the door opened to
      admit a very neat but rather grim-looking old lady he started, then looked
      across at her with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the grimness faded from the wrinkled old face, and the
      housekeeper, for this her appearance proclaimed her to be, bowed in a
      queer Victorian fashion which suggested that a curtsy might follow. One
      did not follow, however. &ldquo;I am sure I apologize, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Benson
      did not tell me you had arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite all right,&rdquo; said Harley, genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      His smile held a hint of amusement, for in the comprehensive glance which
      the old lady cast across the library, a glance keen to detect disorder and
      from which no speck of dust could hope to conceal itself, there remained a
      trace of that grimness which he had detected at the moment of her
      entrance. In short, she was still bristling from a recent encounter. So
      much so that detecting something sympathetic in Harley&rsquo;s smile she availed
      herself of the presence of a badly arranged vase of flowers to linger and
      to air her grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Servants in these times,&rdquo; she informed him, her fingers busily
      rearranging the blooms, &ldquo;are not what servants were in my young days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, that is so,&rdquo; Harley agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady tossed her head. &ldquo;I do my best,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but that
      girl would not have stayed in the house for one week if I had had my way.
      Miss Phil is altogether too soft-hearted. Thank goodness, she goes
      to-morrow, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t refer to Miss Phil?&rdquo; said Harley, intentionally
      misunderstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious goodness, no!&rdquo; exclaimed the housekeeper, and laughed with
      simple glee at the joke. &ldquo;I mean Jones, the new parlourmaid. When I say
      new, they are all new, for none of them stay longer than three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; smiled Harley, who perceived that the old lady was something of
      a martinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, they don&rsquo;t. Think they are ladies nowadays. Four hours off has
      that girl had to-day, although she was out on Wednesday. Then she has the
      impudence to allow someone to ring her up here at the house; and finally I
      discover her upsetting the table after Benson had laid it and after I had
      rearranged it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced indignantly in the direction of the lobby. &ldquo;Perhaps one day,&rdquo;
       she concluded, pathetically, as she walked slowly from the room, &ldquo;we shall
      find a parlourmaid who is a parlourmaid. Good evening, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said Harley, quietly amused to be made the recipient of
      these domestic confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to smile for some time after the door had been closed. His
      former train of ideas was utterly destroyed, but for this he was not
      ungrateful to the housekeeper, since the outstanding disadvantage of that
      strange gift resembling prescience was that it sometimes blunted the
      purely analytical part of his mind when this should have been at its
      keenest. He was now prepared to listen to what Sir Charles had to say and
      to judge impartially of its evidential value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering from side to side of the library, he presently found himself
      standing still before the mantelpiece and studying a photograph in a
      silver frame which occupied the centre of the shelf. It was the photograph
      of an unusually pretty girl; that is to say, of a girl whose beauty was
      undeniable, but who belonged to a type widely removed from that of the
      ordinary good-looking Englishwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outline of her face was soft and charming, and there was a questioning
      look in her eyes which was alluring and challenging. Her naive expression
      was palpably a pose, and her slightly parted lips promised laughter. She
      possessed delightfully wavy hair and her neck and one shoulder, which were
      bare, had a Grecian purity. Harley discovered himself to be smiling at the
      naive lady of the photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presumably &lsquo;Miss Phil&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He removed his gaze with reluctance from the fascinating picture, and
      dropping into the big lounge chair, he lighted a cigarette. He had just
      placed the match in an ash tray when he heard Sir Charles&rsquo;s voice in the
      lobby, and a moment later Sir Charles himself came hurrying into the
      library. His expression was so peculiar that Harley started up
      immediately, perceiving that something unusual had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Harley,&rdquo; began Sir Charles, &ldquo;in the first place pray accept
      my apologies&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None are necessary,&rdquo; Harley interrupted. &ldquo;Your excellent housekeeper has
      entertained me vastly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; muttered Sir Charles. &ldquo;I am obliged to Mrs. Howett,&rdquo; and it
      was plainly to be seen that his thoughts were elsewhere. &ldquo;But I have to
      relate a most inexplicable occurrence&mdash;inexplicable unless by some
      divine accident the plan has been prevented from maturing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Sir Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was called ten minutes ago by someone purporting to be the servant of
      Mr. Chester Wilson, that friend and neighbour whom I have been attending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your butler informed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; cried Sir Charles, and the expression in his eyes grew
      almost wild, &ldquo;no one in Wilson&rsquo;s house knew anything about the matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! It was a ruse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Palpably a ruse to get me away from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley dropped his cigarette into the ash tray beside the match, where,
      smouldering, it sent up a gray spiral into the air of the library. Whether
      because of his words or because of the presence of the man himself, the
      warning, intuitive finger had again touched Paul Harley. &ldquo;You saw or heard
      nothing on your way across the square to suggest that any one having
      designs on your safety was watching you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I searched the shadows most particularly on my return journey,
      of course. For the thing cannot have been purposeless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; said Paul Harley, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the promptings of that uncanny sixth sense of his and the working
      of the trained deductive reasoning powers, he was momentarily at a loss.
      Some fact, some episode, a memory, was clamouring for recognition, while
      the intuitive, subconscious voice whispered: &ldquo;This man is in danger;
      protect him.&rdquo; What was the meaning of it all? He felt that a clue lay
      somewhere outside the reach of his intelligence, and a sort of anger
      possessed him because of his impotence to grasp it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles was staring at him in that curiously pathetic way which he had
      observed at their earlier interview in Chancery Lane. &ldquo;In any event,&rdquo; said
      his host, &ldquo;let us dine: for already I have kept you waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley merely bowed, and walking out of the library, entered the cosy
      dining room. A dreadful premonition had claimed him as his glance had met
      that of Sir Charles&mdash;a premonition that this man&rsquo;s days were
      numbered. It was uncanny, unnerving; and whereas, at first, the atmosphere
      of Sir Charles Abingdon&rsquo;s home had been laden with prosperous security,
      now from every side, and even penetrating to the warmly lighted dining
      room, came that chilling note of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      In crossing the lobby he had not failed to note that there were many
      Indian curios in the place which could not well have failed to attract the
      attention of a burglar. But that the person who had penetrated to the
      house was no common burglar he was now assured and he required no further
      evidence upon this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he took his seat at the dining table he observed that Sir Charles&rsquo;s
      collection had overflowed even into this room. In the warm shadows about
      him were pictures and ornaments, all of which came from, or had been
      inspired by, the Far East.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Oriental environment lay an inspiration. The terror which had come
      into Sir Charles&rsquo;s life, the invisible menace which, swordlike, hung over
      him, surely belonged in its eerie quality to the land of temple bells, of
      silent, subtle peoples, to the secret land which has bred so many
      mysteries. Yes, he must look into the past, into the Indian life of Sir
      Charles Abingdon, for the birth of this thing which now had grown into a
      shadow almost tangible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benson attended at table, assisted by a dark-faced and very surly-looking
      maid, in whom Harley thought he recognized the housekeeper&rsquo;s bete noire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When presently both servants had temporarily retired. &ldquo;You see, Mr.
      Harley,&rdquo; began Sir Charles, glancing about his own room in a manner almost
      furtive, &ldquo;I realized to-day at your office that the history of this dread
      which has come upon me perhaps went back so far that it was almost
      impossible to acquaint you with it under the circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think perhaps I should inform you in the first place that I have a
      daughter. Her mother has been dead for many years, and perhaps I have not
      given her the attention which a motherless girl is entitled to expect from
      her father. I don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; he said, hastily, &ldquo;that we are in any sense out
      of sympathy, but latterly in some way I must confess that we have got a
      little out of touch.&rdquo; He glanced anxiously at his guest, indeed almost
      apologetically. &ldquo;You will of course understand, Mr. Harley, that this
      seeming preamble may prove to have a direct bearing upon what I propose to
      tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray tell the story in your own way, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said Harley with
      sympathy. &ldquo;I am all attention, and I shall only interrupt you in the event
      of any point not being quite clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Sir Charles. &ldquo;I find it so much easier to explain the
      matter now. To continue, there is a certain distinguished Oriental
      gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused as Benson appeared to remove the soup plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always delightful to chat with one who knows India so well as you
      do,&rdquo; he continued, glancing significantly at his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley, who fully appreciated the purpose of this abrupt change in
      the conversation, nodded in agreement. &ldquo;The call of the East,&rdquo; he replied,
      &ldquo;is a very real thing. Only one who has heard it can understand and
      appreciate all it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler, an excellently trained servant, went about his work with quiet
      efficiency, and once Harley heard him mutter rapid instructions to the
      surly parlourmaid, who hovered disdainfully in the background. When again
      host and guest found themselves alone: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t in any way distrust the
      servants,&rdquo; explained Sir Charles, &ldquo;but one cannot hope to prevent gossip.&rdquo;
       He raised his serviette to his lips and almost immediately resumed: &ldquo;I was
      about to tell you, Mr. Harley, about my daughter&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and cleared his throat, then, hastily pouring out a glass of
      water, he drank a sip or two and Paul Harley noticed that his hand was
      shaking nervously. He thought of the photograph in the library, and now,
      in this reference to a distinguished Oriental gentleman, he suddenly
      perceived the possible drift of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the point to which Sir Charles evidently experienced such
      difficulty in coming. It was something which concerned his daughter; and,
      mentally visualizing the pure oval face and taunting eyes of the library
      photograph, Harley found it impossible to believe that the evil which
      threatened Sir Charles could possibly be associated in any way with
      Phyllis Abingdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, if the revelation which he had to make must be held responsible for
      his present condition, then truly it was a dreadful one. No longer able to
      conceal his concern, Harley stood up. &ldquo;If the story distresses you so
      keenly, Sir Charles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I beg&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles waved his hand reassuringly. &ldquo;A mere nothing. It will pass,&rdquo;
       he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I fear,&rdquo; continued Harley, &ldquo;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased abruptly, and ran to his host&rsquo;s assistance, for the latter,
      evidently enough, was in the throes of some sudden illness or seizure. His
      fresh-coloured face was growing positively livid, and he plucked at the
      edge of the table with twitching fingers. As Harley reached his side he
      made a sudden effort to stand up, throwing out his arm to grasp the
      other&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benson!&rdquo; cried Harley, loudly. &ldquo;Quick! Your master is ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came a sound of swift footsteps and the door was thrown open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; whispered Sir Charles in a choking voice. He began to clutch
      his throat as Benson hurried into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; whispered Harley. &ldquo;He is dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the truth was all too apparent. Sir Charles Abingdon was almost
      past speech. He was glaring across the table as though he saw some ghastly
      apparition there. And now with appalling suddenness he became as a dead
      weight in Harley&rsquo;s supporting grasp. Raspingly, as if forced in agony from
      his lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire-Tongue,&rdquo; he said... &ldquo;Nicol Brinn...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benson, white and terror-stricken, bent over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Charles!&rdquo; he kept muttering. &ldquo;Sir Charles! What is the matter, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stifled shriek sounded from the doorway, and in tottered Mrs. Howett,
      the old housekeeper, with other servants peering over her shoulder into
      that warmly lighted dining room where Sir Charles Abingdon lay huddled in
      his own chair&mdash;dead.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. SHADOWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you reason to suspect any cardiac trouble, Doctor McMurdoch?&rdquo; asked
      Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch, a local practitioner who had been a friend of Sir
      Charles Abingdon, shook his head slowly. He was a tall, preternaturally
      thin Scotsman, clean-shaven, with shaggy dark brows and a most gloomy
      expression in his deep-set eyes. While the presence of his sepulchral
      figure seemed appropriate enough in that stricken house, Harley could not
      help thinking that it must have been far from reassuring in a sick room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had never actually detected anything of the kind,&rdquo; replied the
      physician, and his deep voice was gloomily in keeping with his
      personality. &ldquo;I had observed a certain breathlessness at times, however.
      No doubt it is one of those cases of unsuspected endocarditis. Acute. I
      take it,&rdquo; raising his shaggy brows interrogatively, &ldquo;that nothing had
      occurred to excite Sir Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied Harley, &ldquo;he was highly distressed about some
      family trouble, the nature of which he was about to confide to me when
      this sudden illness seized him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared hard at Doctor McMurdoch, wondering how much he might hope to
      learn from him respecting the affairs of Sir Charles. It seemed almost
      impertinent at that hour to seek to pry into the dead man&rsquo;s private life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the quiet, book-lined apartment stole now and again little significant
      sounds which told of the tragedy in the household. Sometimes when a
      distant door was opened, it would be the sobs of a weeping woman, for the
      poor old housekeeper had been quite prostrated by the blow. Or ghostly
      movements would become audible from the room immediately over the library&mdash;the
      room to which the dead man had been carried; muffled footsteps, vague
      stirrings of furniture; each sound laden with its own peculiar portent,
      awakening the imagination which all too readily filled in the details of
      the scene above. Then, to spur Harley to action, came the thought that Sir
      Charles Abingdon had appealed to him for aid. Did his need terminate with
      his unexpected death or would the shadow under which he had died extend
      now? Harley found himself staring across the library at the photograph of
      Phil Abingdon. It was of her that Sir Charles had been speaking when that
      mysterious seizure had tied his tongue. That strange, fatal illness, mused
      Harley, all the more strange in the case of a man supposedly in robust
      health&mdash;it almost seemed like the working of a malignant will. For
      the revelation, whatever its nature, had almost but not quite been made in
      Harley&rsquo;s office that evening. Something, some embarrassment or mental
      disability, had stopped Sir Charles from completing his statement. Tonight
      death had stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he consulting you professionally, Mr. Harley?&rdquo; asked the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; replied Harley, continuing to stare fascinatedly at the
      photograph on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;I am informed,&rdquo; said he, abruptly, &ldquo;that
      Miss Abingdon is out of town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch nodded in his slow, gloomy fashion. &ldquo;She is staying in
      Devonshire with poor Abingdon&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am wondering how
      we are going to break the news to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that Doctor McMurdoch had clearly been intimate with the late
      Sir Charles, Harley determined to make use of this opportunity to
      endeavour to fathom the mystery of the late surgeon&rsquo;s fears. &ldquo;You will not
      misunderstand me, Doctor McMurdoch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I venture to ask you one
      or two rather personal questions respecting Miss Abingdon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch lowered his shaggy brows and looked gloomily at the
      speaker. &ldquo;Mr. Harley,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I know you by repute for a man of
      integrity. But before I answer your questions will you answer one of
      mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my question is this: Does not your interest cease with the death of
      your client?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor McMurdoch,&rdquo; said Harley, sternly, &ldquo;you no doubt believe yourself
      to be acting as a friend of this bereaved family. You regard me, perhaps,
      as a Paul Pry prompted by idle curiosity. On the contrary, I find myself
      in a delicate and embarrassing situation. From Sir Charles&rsquo;s conversation
      I had gathered that he entertained certain fears on behalf of his
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Doctor McMurdoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If these fears were well grounded, the danger is not removed, but merely
      increased by the death of Miss Abingdon&rsquo;s natural protector. I regret,
      sir, that I approached you for information, since you have misjudged my
      motive. But far from my interest having ceased, it has now as I see the
      matter become a sacred duty to learn what it was that Sir Charles
      apprehended. This duty, Doctor McMurdoch, I propose to fulfil with or
      without your assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Doctor McMurdoch, gloomily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve offended you. But
      I meant well, Mr. Harley.&rdquo; A faint trace of human emotion showed itself in
      his deep voice. &ldquo;Charley Abingdon and I were students together in
      Edinburgh,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I was mayhap a little strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His apology was so evidently sincere that Harley relented at once. &ldquo;Please
      say no more, Doctor McMurdoch,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;I fully appreciate your
      feelings in the matter. At such a time a stranger can only be an intruder;
      but&rdquo;&mdash;he fixed his keen eyes upon the physician&mdash;&ldquo;there is more
      underlying all this than you suspect or could readily believe. You will
      live to know that I have spoken the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it now,&rdquo; declared the Scotsman, solemnly. &ldquo;Abingdon was always
      eccentric, but he didn&rsquo;t know the meaning of fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once that may have been true,&rdquo; replied Harley. &ldquo;But a great fear was upon
      him when he came to me, Doctor McMurdoch, and if it is humanly possible I
      am going to discover its cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Doctor McMurdoch and, turning to the side table, he
      poured out two liberal portions of whiskey. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything I can do
      to help, count me at your service. You tell me he had fears about little
      Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had,&rdquo; answered Harley, &ldquo;and it is maddening to think that he died
      before he could acquaint me with their nature. But I have hopes that you
      can help me in this. For instance&rdquo;&mdash;again he fixed his gaze upon the
      gloomy face of the physician&mdash;&ldquo;who is the distinguished Oriental
      gentleman with whom Sir Charles had recently become acquainted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch&rsquo;s expression remained utterly blank, and he slowly shook
      his head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea in the world,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;A patient,
      perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Harley, conscious of some disappointment; &ldquo;yet from the
      way he spoke of him I scarcely think that he was a patient. Surely Sir
      Charles, having resided so long in India, numbered several Orientals among
      his acquaintances if not among his friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None ever came to his home,&rdquo; replied Doctor McMurdoch. &ldquo;He had all the
      Anglo-Indian&rsquo;s prejudice against men of colour.&rdquo; He rested his massive
      chin in his hand and stared down reflectively at the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have no suggestion to offer in regard to this person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. Did he tell you nothing further about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, nothing. In the next place, Doctor McMurdoch, are you
      aware of any difference of opinion which had arisen latterly between Sir
      Charles and his daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difference of opinion!&rdquo; replied Doctor McMurdoch, raising his brows
      ironically. &ldquo;There would always be difference of opinion between little
      Phil and any man who cared for her. But out-and-out quarrel&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Harley found himself at a deadlock, and it was with scanty hope of
      success that he put his third question to the gloomy Scot. &ldquo;Was Sir
      Charles a friend of Mr. Nicol Brinn?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicol Brinn?&rdquo; echoed the physician. He looked perplexed. &ldquo;You mean the
      American millionaire? I believe they were acquainted. Abingdon knew most
      of the extraordinary people in London; and if half one hears is true Nicol
      Brinn is as mad as a hatter. But they were not in any sense friends as far
      as I know.&rdquo; He was watching Harley curiously. &ldquo;Why do you ask that
      question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you in a moment,&rdquo; said Harley, rapidly, &ldquo;but I have one more
      question to put to you first. Does the term Fire-Tongue convey anything to
      your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch&rsquo;s eyebrows shot upward most amazingly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t insult
      you by supposing that you have chosen such a time for joking,&rdquo; he said,
      dourly. &ldquo;But if your third question surprised me, I must say that your
      fourth sounds simply daft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must,&rdquo; agreed Harley, and his manner was almost fierce; &ldquo;but when I
      tell you why I ask these two questions&mdash;and I only do so on the
      understand ing that my words are to be treated in the strictest confidence&mdash;you
      may regard the matter in a new light. &lsquo;Nicol Brinn&rsquo; and &lsquo;Fire-Tongue&rsquo; were
      the last words which Sir Charles Abingdon uttered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Doctor McMurdoch, displaying a sudden surprising energy.
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I solemnly assure you,&rdquo; declared Harley, &ldquo;that such is the case. Benson,
      the butler, also overheard them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch relapsed once more into gloom, gazing at the whiskey in
      the glass which he held in his hand and slowly shaking his head. &ldquo;Poor old
      Charley Abingdon,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain to me, Mr. Harley, that his
      mind was wandering. May not we find here an explanation, too, of this idea
      of his that some danger overhung Phil? You didn&rsquo;t chance to notice, I
      suppose, whether he had a temperature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; replied Harley, smiling slightly. But the smile quickly left
      his face, which became again grim and stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short silence ensued, during which Doctor McMurdoch sat staring moodily
      down at the carpet and Harley slowly paced up and down the room; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In view of the fact,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, &ldquo;that Sir Charles clearly
      apprehended an attempt upon his life, are you satisfied professionally
      that death was due to natural causes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly satisfied,&rdquo; replied the physician, looking up with a start:
      &ldquo;perfectly satisfied. It was unexpected, of course, but such cases are by
      no means unusual. He was formerly a keen athlete, remember. &lsquo;Tis often so.
      Surely you don&rsquo;t suspect foul play? I understood you to mean that his
      apprehensions were on behalf of Phil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley stood still, staring meditatively in the other&rsquo;s direction.
      &ldquo;There is not a scrap of evidence to support such a theory,&rdquo; he admitted,
      &ldquo;but if you knew of the existence of any poisonous agent which would
      produce effects simulating these familiar symptoms, I should be tempted to
      take certain steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are talking about poisons,&rdquo; said the physician, a rather startled
      look appearing upon his face, &ldquo;there are several I might mention; but the
      idea seems preposterous to me. Why should any one want to harm Charley
      Abingdon? When could poison have been administered and by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, indeed?&rdquo; murmured Harley. &ldquo;Yet I am not satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hinting at&mdash;suicide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emphatically no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had he eaten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but soup, except that he drank a portion of a glass of water. I
      am wondering if he took anything at Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; He stared hard at
      Doctor McMurdoch. &ldquo;It may surprise you to learn that I have already taken
      steps to have the remains of the soup from Sir Charles&rsquo;s plate examined,
      as well as the water in the glass. I now propose to call upon Mr. Wilson
      in order that I may complete this line of enquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sympathize with your suspicions, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; said the physician
      dourly, &ldquo;but you are wasting your time.&rdquo; A touch of the old acidity crept
      back into his manner. &ldquo;My certificate will be &lsquo;syncope due to unusual
      excitement&rsquo;; and I shall stand by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite entitled to your own opinion,&rdquo; Harley conceded, &ldquo;which if I
      were in your place would be my own. But what do you make of the fact that
      Sir Charles received a bogus telephone message some ten minutes before my
      arrival, as a result of which he visited Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s attending Wilson,&rdquo; protested the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, no one there had telephoned. It was a ruse. I don&rsquo;t assume
      for a moment that this ruse was purposeless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch was now staring hard at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may also know,&rdquo; Harley continued, &ldquo;that there was an attempted
      burglary here less than a week ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; admitted the other, &ldquo;but it counts for little. There have
      been several burglaries in the neighbourhood of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley perceived that Doctor McMurdoch was one of those characters, not
      uncommon north of the Tweed, who, if slow in forming an opinion, once
      having done so cling to it as tightly as any barnacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be right and I may be wrong,&rdquo; Harley admitted, &ldquo;but while your
      professional business with Sir Charles unfortunately is ended, mine is
      only beginning. May I count upon you to advise me of Miss Abingdon&rsquo;s
      return? I particularly wish to see her, and I should prefer to meet her in
      the capacity of a friend rather than in that of a professional
      investigator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the earliest moment that I can decently arrange a meeting,&rdquo; replied
      Doctor McMurdoch, &ldquo;I will communicate with you, Mr. Harley. I am just
      cudgelling my brains at the moment to think how the news is to be broken
      to her. Poor little Phil! He was all she had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could help you,&rdquo; declared Harley with sincerity, &ldquo;but in the
      circumstances any suggestion of mine would be mere impertinence.&rdquo; He held
      out his hand to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said the latter, gripping it heartily. &ldquo;If there is any
      mystery surrounding poor Abingdon&rsquo;s death, I believe you are the man to
      clear it up. But, frankly, it was his heart. I believe he had a touch of
      the sun once in India. Who knows? His idea that some danger threatened him
      or threatened Phil may have been merely&mdash;&rdquo; He tapped his brow
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in the whole of your knowledge of Sir Charles,&rdquo; cried Harley,
      exhibiting a certain irritation, &ldquo;have you ever known him to suffer from
      delusions of that kind or any other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied the physician, firmly; &ldquo;but once a man has had the sun
      one cannot tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Harley. &ldquo;Good-night, Doctor McMurdoch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When presently he left the house, carrying a brown leather bag which he
      had borrowed from the butler, he knew that rightly or wrongly his own
      opinion remained unchanged in spite of the stubborn opposition of the
      Scottish physician. The bogus message remained to be explained, and the
      assault in the square, as did the purpose of the burglar to whom gold and
      silver plate made no appeal. More important even than these points were
      the dead man&rsquo;s extraordinary words: &ldquo;Fire-Tongue&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nicol Brinn.&rdquo;
       Finally and conclusively, he had detected the note of danger outside and
      inside the house; and now as he began to cross the square it touched him
      again intimately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at the darkened sky. A black cloud was moving slowly
      overhead, high above the roof of the late Sir Charles Abingdon; and as he
      watched its stealthy approach it seemed to Paul Harley to be the symbol of
      that dread in which latterly Sir Charles&rsquo;s life had lain, beneath which he
      had died, and which now was stretching out, mysterious and menacing, over
      himself.

      CHAPTER IV. INTRODUCING MR. NICOL BRINN
    </h2>
    <p>
      At about nine o&rsquo;clock on the same evening, a man stood at a large window
      which overlooked Piccadilly and the Green Park. The room to which the
      window belonged was justly considered one of the notable sights of London
      and doubtless would have received suitable mention in the &ldquo;Blue Guide&rdquo; had
      the room been accessible to the general public. It was, on the contrary,
      accessible only to the personal friends of Mr. Nicol Brinn. As Mr. Nicol
      Brinn had a rarely critical taste in friendship, none but a fortunate few
      had seen the long room with its two large windows overlooking Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the window was interested in a car which, approaching from the
      direction of the Circus, had slowed down immediately opposite and now was
      being turned, the chauffeur&rsquo;s apparent intention being to pull up at the
      door below. He had seen the face of the occupant and had recognized it
      even from that elevation. He was interested; and since only unusual things
      aroused any semblance of interest in the man who now stood at the window,
      one might have surmised that there was something unusual about the present
      visitor, or in his having decided to call at those chambers; and that such
      was indeed his purpose an upward glance which he cast in the direction of
      the balcony sufficiently proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watcher, who had been standing in a dark recess formed by the presence
      of heavy velvet curtains draped before the window, now opened the curtains
      and stepped into the lighted room. He was a tall, lean man having
      straight, jet-black hair, a sallow complexion, and the features of a
      Sioux. A long black cigar protruded aggressively from the left corner of
      his mouth. His hands were locked behind him and his large and quite
      expressionless blue eyes stared straight across the room at the closed
      door with a dreamy and vacant regard. His dinner jacket fitted him so
      tightly that it might have been expected at any moment to split at the
      seams. As if to precipitate the catastrophe, he wore it buttoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a rap at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In!&rdquo; said the tall man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened silently and a manservant appeared. He was spotlessly neat
      and wore his light hair cropped close to the skull. His fresh-coloured
      face was quite as expressionless as that of his master; his glance
      possessed no meaning. Crossing to the window, he extended a small salver
      upon which lay a visiting card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In!&rdquo; repeated the tall man, looking down at the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      His servant silently retired, and following a short interval rapped again
      upon the door, opened it, and standing just inside the room announced:
      &ldquo;Mr. Paul Harley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door being quietly closed behind him, Paul Harley stood staring across
      the room at Nicol Brinn. At this moment the contrast between the types was
      one to have fascinated a psychologist. About Paul Harley, eagerly alert,
      there was something essentially British. Nicol Brinn, without being
      typical, was nevertheless distinctly a product of the United States. Yet,
      despite the stoic mask worn by Mr. Brinn, whose lack-lustre eyes were so
      unlike the bright gray eyes of his visitor, there existed, if not a
      physical, a certain spiritual affinity between the two; both were men of
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley, after that one comprehensive glance, the photographic glance of a
      trained observer, stepped forward impulsively, hand outstretched. &ldquo;Mr.
      Brinn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have never met before, and it was good of you to wait
      in for me. I hope my telephone message has not interfered with your plans
      for the evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn, without change of pose, no line of the impassive face
      altering, shot out a large, muscular hand, seized that of Paul Harley in a
      tremendous grip, and almost instantly put his hand behind his back again.
      &ldquo;Had no plans,&rdquo; he replied, in a high, monotonous voice; &ldquo;I was bored
      stiff. Take the armchair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley sat down, but in the restless manner of one who has urgent
      business in hand and who is impatient of delay. Mr. Brinn stooped to a
      coffee table which stood upon the rug before the large open fireplace. &ldquo;I
      am going to offer you a cocktail,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall accept your offer,&rdquo; returned Harley, smiling. &ldquo;The &lsquo;N. B.
      cocktail&rsquo; has a reputation which extends throughout the clubs of the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn, exhibiting the swift adroitness of that human dodo, the New
      York bartender, mixed the drinks. Paul Harley watched him, meanwhile
      drumming his fingers restlessly upon the chair arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s success,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to my mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an odd toast, but Mr. Brinn merely nodded and drank in silence.
      Paul Harley set his glass down and glanced about the singular apartment of
      which he had often heard and which no man could ever tire of examining.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this room the poles met, and the most remote civilizations of the world
      rubbed shoulders with modernity. Here, encased, were a family of
      snow-white ermine from Alaska and a pair of black Manchurian leopards. A
      flying lemur from the Pelews contemplated swooping upon the head of a huge
      tigress which glared with glassy eyes across the place at the snarling
      muzzle of a polar bear. Mycenaean vases and gold death masks stood upon
      the same shelf as Venetian goblets, and the mummy of an Egyptian priestess
      of the thirteenth dynasty occupied a sarcophagus upon the top of which
      rested a basrelief found in one of the shrines of the Syrian fish goddess
      Derceto, at Ascalon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrowheads of the Stone Age and medieval rapiers were ranged alongside
      some of the latest examples of the gunsmith&rsquo;s art. There were elephants&rsquo; 
      tusks and Mexican skulls; a stone jar of water from the well of Zem-Zem,
      and an ivory crucifix which had belonged to Torquemada. A mat of human
      hair from Borneo overlay a historical and unique rug woven in Ispahan and
      entirely composed of fragments of Holy Carpets from the Kaaba at Mecca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it,&rdquo; said Mr. Brinn, suddenly, &ldquo;that you are up against a stiff
      proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley, accepting a cigarette from an ebony box (once the property of
      Henry VIII) which the speaker had pushed across the coffee table in his
      direction, stared up curiously into the sallow, aquiline face. &ldquo;You are
      right. But how did you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look that way. Also&mdash;you were followed. Somebody knows you&rsquo;ve
      come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley leaned forward, resting one hand upon the table. &ldquo;I know I was
      followed,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;I was followed because I have entered upon
      the biggest case of my career.&rdquo; He paused and smiled in a very grim
      fashion. &ldquo;A suspicion begins to dawn upon my mind that if I fail it will
      also be my last case. You understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand absolutely,&rdquo; replied Nicol Brinn. &ldquo;These are dull days. It&rsquo;s
      meat and drink to me to smell big danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley lighted a cigarette and watched the speaker closely the while.
      His expression, as he did so, was an odd one. Two courses were open to
      him, and he was mentally debating their respective advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to you to-night, Mr. Brinn,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;to ask you a
      certain question. Unless the theory upon which I am working is entirely
      wrong, then, supposing that you are in a position to answer my question I
      am logically compelled to suppose, also, that you stand in peril of your
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Mr. Brinn. &ldquo;I was getting sluggish.&rdquo; In three long strides he
      crossed the room and locked the door. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt Hoskins&rsquo;s honesty,&rdquo;
       he explained, reading the inquiry in Harley&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;but an A1
      intelligence doesn&rsquo;t fold dress pants at thirty-nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only one very intimate with the taciturn speaker could have perceived any
      evidence of interest in that imperturbable character. But Nicol Brinn took
      his cheroot between his fingers, quickly placed a cone of ash in a little
      silver tray (the work of Benvenuto Cellini), and replaced the cheroot not
      in the left but in the right corner of his mouth. He was excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are out after one of the big heads of the crook world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
      knows it and he&rsquo;s trailing you. My luck&rsquo;s turned. How can I help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley stood up, facing Mr. Brinn. &ldquo;He knows it, as you say,&rdquo; he replied,
      &ldquo;and I hold my life in my hands. But from your answer to the question
      which I have come here to-night to ask you, I shall conclude whether or
      not your danger at the moment is greater than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that unique room, at once library and museum, amid relics of a hundred
      ages, spoil of the chase, the excavator, and the scholar, these two faced
      each other; and despite the peaceful quiet of the apartment up to which as
      a soothing murmur stole the homely sounds of Piccadilly, each saw in the
      other&rsquo;s eyes recognition of a deadly peril. It was a queer, memorable
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My question is simple but strange,&rdquo; said Paul Harley. &ldquo;It is this: What
      do you know of &lsquo;Fire-Tongue&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE GATES OF HELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Paul Harley had counted upon the word &ldquo;Fire-Tongue&rdquo; to have a dramatic
      effect upon Nicol Brinn, he was not disappointed. It was a word which must
      have conveyed little or nothing to the multitude and which might have been
      pronounced without perceptible effect at any public meeting in the land.
      But Mr. Brinn, impassive though his expression remained, could not conceal
      the emotion which he experienced at the sound of it. His gaunt face seemed
      to grow more angular and his eyes to become even less lustrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire-Tongue!&rdquo; he said, tensely, following a short silence. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
      sake, when did you hear that word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it,&rdquo; replied Harley, slowly, &ldquo;to-night.&rdquo; He fixed his gaze
      intently upon the sallow face of the American. &ldquo;It was spoken by Sir
      Charles Abingdon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Closely as he watched Nicol Brinn while pronouncing this name he could not
      detect the slightest change of expression in the stoic features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Charles Abingdon,&rdquo; echoed Brinn; &ldquo;and in what way is it connected
      with your case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way,&rdquo; answered Harley. &ldquo;It was spoken by Sir Charles a few
      moments before he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s drooping lids flickered rapidly. &ldquo;Before he died! Then Sir
      Charles Abingdon is dead! When did he die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died to-night and the last words that he uttered were &lsquo;Fire-Tongue&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He paused, never for a moment removing that fixed gaze from the other&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; prompted Mr. Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &lsquo;Nicol Brinn.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn stood still as a carven man. Indeed, only by an added rigidity
      in his pose did he reward Paul Harley&rsquo;s intense scrutiny. A silence
      charged with drama was finally broken by the American. &ldquo;Mr. Harley,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;you told me that you were up against the big proposition of your
      career. You are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he sat down in an armchair and, resting his chin in his hand,
      gazed fixedly into the empty grate. His pose was that of a man who is
      suddenly called upon to review the course of his life and upon whose
      decision respecting the future that life may depend. Paul Harley watched
      him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the whole story,&rdquo; said Mr. Brinn, &ldquo;right from the beginning.&rdquo; He
      looked up. &ldquo;Do you know what you have done to-night, Mr. Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley shook his head. Swiftly, like the touch of an icy finger, that
      warning note of danger had reached him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; continued Brinn. &ldquo;You have opened the gates of hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not another word did he speak while Paul Harley, pacing slowly up and down
      before the hearth, gave him a plain account of the case, omitting all
      reference to his personal suspicions and to the measures which he had
      taken to confirm them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his cards upon the table deliberately. Whether Sir Charles
      Abingdon had uttered the name of Nicol Brinn as that of one whose aid
      should be sought or as a warning, he had yet to learn. And by this
      apparent frankness he hoped to achieve his object. That the celebrated
      American was in any way concerned in the menace which had overhung Sir
      Charles he was not prepared to believe. But he awaited with curiosity that
      explanation which Nicol Brinn must feel called upon to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he was murdered?&rdquo; said Brinn in his high, toneless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have formed no definite opinion. What is your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not look it,&rdquo; replied Brinn, &ldquo;but at this present moment I am the
      most hopelessly puzzled and badly frightened man in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightened?&rdquo; asked Harley, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said frightened, I also said puzzled; and I am far too puzzled to be
      able to express any opinion respecting the death of Sir Charles Abingdon.
      When I tell you all I know of him you will wonder as much as I do, Mr.
      Harley, why my name should have been the last to pass his lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He half turned in the big chair to face his visitor, who now was standing
      before the fireplace staring down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day last month,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;I got out of my car in a big hurry at
      the top of the Haymarket. A fool on a motorcycle passed between the car
      and the sidewalk just as I stepped down, and I knew nothing further until
      I woke up in a drug store close by, feeling very dazed and with my coat in
      tatters and my left arm numbed from the elbow. A man was standing watching
      me, and presently when I had pulled round he gave me his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was Sir Charles Abingdon, who had been passing at the time of the
      accident. That was how I met him, and as there was nothing seriously wrong
      with me I saw him no more professionally. But he dined with me a week
      later and I had lunch at his club about a fortnight ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at Harley. &ldquo;On my solemn word of honour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      all I know about Sir Charles Abingdon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley returned the other&rsquo;s fixed stare. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt your
      assurance on the point, Mr. Brinn,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;I can well
      understand that you must be badly puzzled; but I would remind you of your
      statement that you were also frightened. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn glanced rapidly about his own luxurious room in an oddly
      apprehensive manner. &ldquo;I said that,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and I meant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can only suppose,&rdquo; resumed Harley, deliberately, &ldquo;that the cause
      of your fear lies in the term, &lsquo;Fire-Tongue&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinn again rested his chin in his hand, staring fixedly into the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And possibly,&rdquo; went on the remorseless voice, &ldquo;you can explain the
      significance of that term?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn remained silent&mdash;but with one foot he was slowly tapping
      the edge of the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harley,&rdquo; he began, abruptly, &ldquo;you have been perfectly frank with me
      and in return I wish to be as frank with you as I can be. I am face to
      face with a thing that has haunted me for seven years, and every step I
      take from now onward has to be considered carefully, for any step might be
      my last. And that&rsquo;s not the worst of the matter. I will risk one of those
      steps here and now. You ask me to explain the significance of Fire-Tongue&rdquo;
       (there was a perceptible pause before he pronounced the word, which Harley
      duly noticed). &ldquo;I am going to tell you that Sir Charles Abingdon, when I
      lunched with him at his club, asked me precisely the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! He asked you that so long as two weeks ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what reason did he give for his inquiry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn began to tap the fender again with his foot. &ldquo;Let me think,&rdquo;
       he replied. &ldquo;I recognize that you must regard my reticence as peculiar,
      Mr. Harley, but if ever a man had reason to look before he leaped, I am
      that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell again, and Paul Harley, staring down at Nicol Brinn, realized
      that this indeed was the most hopelessly mystifying case which fate had
      ever thrown in his way. This millionaire scholar and traveller, whose
      figure was as familiar in remote cities of the world as it was familiar in
      New York, in Paris, and in London, could not conceivably be associated
      with any criminal organization. Yet his hesitancy was indeed difficult to
      explain, and because it seemed to Harley that the cloud which had stolen
      out across the house of Sir Charles Abingdon now hung threateningly over
      those very chambers, he merely waited and wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He referred to an experience which had befallen him in India,&rdquo; came Nicol
      Brinn&rsquo;s belated reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In India? May I ask you to recount that experience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harley,&rdquo; replied Brinn, suddenly standing up, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said so. But I&rsquo;d give a lot more than you might believe to know
      that Abingdon had told you the story which he told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not helping, Mr. Brinn,&rdquo; said Harley, sternly. &ldquo;I believe and I
      think that you share my belief that Sir Charles Abingdon did not die from
      natural causes. You are repressing valuable evidence. Allow me to remind
      you that if anything should come to light necessitating a post-mortem
      examination of the body, you will be forced to divulge in a court of
      justice the facts which you refuse to divulge to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Brinn, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shot out one long arm and grasped Harley&rsquo;s shoulder as in a vice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      counted a wealthy man,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d give every cent I possess
      to see &lsquo;paid&rsquo; put to the bill of a certain person. Listen. You don&rsquo;t think
      I was in any way concerned in the death of Sir Charles Abingdon? It isn&rsquo;t
      thinkable. But you do think I&rsquo;m in possession of facts which would help
      you find out who is. You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Harley. &ldquo;Yet you remain silent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so loud&mdash;not so loud!&rdquo; implored Brinn, repeating that odd,
      almost furtive glance around. &ldquo;Mr. Harley&mdash;you know me. You&rsquo;ve heard
      of me and now you&rsquo;ve met me. You know my place in the world. Do you
      believe me when I say that from this moment onward I don&rsquo;t trust my own
      servants? Nor my own friends?&rdquo; He removed his grip from Harley&rsquo;s shoulder.
      &ldquo;Inanimate things look like enemies. That mummy over yonder may have
      ears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t altogether understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn crossed to a bureau, unlocked it, and while Harley watched him
      curiously, sought among a number of press cuttings. Presently he found the
      cutting for which he was looking. &ldquo;This was said,&rdquo; he explained, handing
      the slip to Harley, &ldquo;at the Players&rsquo; Club in New York, after a big dinner
      in pre-dry days. It was said in confidence. But some disguised reporter
      had got in and it came out in print next morning. Read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley accepted the cutting and read the following:

      Mr. Nicol Brinn of Cincinnati, who is at present in New York, opened his
      heart to members of the Players&rsquo; Club last night. Our prominent citizen,
      responding to a toast, &ldquo;the distinguished visitor,&rdquo; said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to live through months of midnight frozen in among the polar
      ice; I&rsquo;d like to cross Africa from east to west and get lost in the
      middle. I&rsquo;d like to have a Montana sheriff&rsquo;s posse on my heels for horse
      stealing, and I&rsquo;ve prayed to be wrecked on a desert island like Robinson
      Crusoe to see if I am man enough to live it out. I want to stand my trial
      for murder and defend my own case, and I want to be found by the eunuchs
      in the harem of the Shah. I want to dive for pearls and scale the
      Matterhorn. I want to know where the tunnel leads to&mdash;the tunnel down
      under the Great Pyramid of Gizeh&mdash;and I&rsquo;d love to shoot Niagara Falls
      in a barrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds characteristic,&rdquo; murmured Harley, laying the slip on the coffee
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; declared Brinn. &ldquo;I said it and I meant it. I&rsquo;m a glutton for
      danger, Mr. Harley, and I&rsquo;m going to tell you why. Something happened to
      me seven years ago&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In India?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In India. Correct. Something happened to me, sir, which just took the
      sunshine out of life. At the time I didn&rsquo;t know all it meant. I&rsquo;ve learned
      since. For seven years I have been flirting with death and hoping to
      fall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley stared at him uncomprehendingly. &ldquo;More than ever I fail to
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only ask you to be patient, Mr. Harley. Time is a wonderful doctor,
      and I don&rsquo;t say that in seven years the old wound hasn&rsquo;t healed a bit. But
      to-night you have, unknowingly, undone all that time had done. I&rsquo;m a man
      that has been down into hell. I bought myself out. I thought I knew where
      the pit was located. I thought I was well away from it, Mr. Harley, and
      you have told me something tonight which makes me think that it isn&rsquo;t
      where I supposed at all, but hidden down here right under our feet in
      London. And we&rsquo;re both standing on the edge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That Nicol Brinn was deeply moved no student of humanity could have
      doubted. From beneath the stoic&rsquo;s cloak another than the dare-devil
      millionaire whose crazy exploits were notorious had looked out.
      Persistently the note of danger came to Paul Harley. Those luxurious
      Piccadilly chambers were a focus upon which some malignant will was
      concentrated. He became conscious of anger. It was the anger of a just man
      who finds himself impotent&mdash;the rage of Prometheus bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brinn!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I accept unreservedly all that you have told me.
      Its real significance I do not and cannot grasp. But my theory that Sir
      Charles Abingdon was done to death has become a conviction. That a like
      fate threatens yourself and possibly myself I begin to believe.&rdquo; He looked
      almost fiercely into the other&rsquo;s dull eyes. &ldquo;My reputation east and west
      is that of a white man. Mr. Brinn&mdash;I ask you for your confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn dropped his chin into his hand and resumed that unseeing stare
      into the open grate. Paul Harley watched him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any one I would rather confide in,&rdquo; confessed the American.
      &ldquo;We are linked by a common danger. But&rdquo;&mdash;he looked up&mdash;&ldquo;I must
      ask you again to be patient. Give me time to think&mdash;to make plans.
      For your own part&mdash;be cautious. You witnessed the death of Sir
      Charles Abingdon. You don&rsquo;t think and perhaps I don&rsquo;t think that it was
      natural; but whatever steps you may have taken to confirm your theories, I
      dare not hope that you will ever discover even a ghost of a clue. I simply
      warn you, Mr. Harley. You may go the same way. So may I. Others have
      travelled that road before poor Abingdon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly stood up, all at once exhibiting to his watchful visitor that
      tremendous nervous energy which underlay his impassive manner. &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;
       he said, in a cold, even voice. &ldquo;To think that it is here in London. What
      does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased speaking abruptly, and stood with his elbow resting on a corner
      of the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of it being here,&rdquo; prompted Harley. &ldquo;Is it consistent with your
      mysterious difficulties to inform me to what you refer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn glanced aside at him. &ldquo;If I informed you of that,&rdquo; he
      answered, &ldquo;you would know all you want to know. But neither you nor I
      would live to use the knowledge. Give me time. Let me think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell in the big room, Nicol Brinn staring down vacantly into the
      empty fireplace, Paul Harley standing watching him in a state of almost
      stupefied mystification. Muffled to a soothing murmur the sounds of
      Piccadilly penetrated to that curtained chamber which held so many records
      of the troubled past and which seemed to be charged with shadowy portents
      of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something struck with a dull thud upon a windowpane&mdash;once&mdash;twice.
      There followed a faint, sibilant sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley started and the stoical Nicol Brinn turned rapidly and glanced
      across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect&mdash;it was an owl,&rdquo; answered Brinn. &ldquo;We sometimes get them
      over from the Green Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His high voice sounded unemotional as ever. But it seemed to Paul Harley
      that his face, dimly illuminated by the upcast light from the lamp upon
      the coffee table, had paled, had become gaunt.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. PHIL ABINGDON ARRIVES
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the following afternoon Paul Harley was restlessly pacing his private
      office when Innes came in with a letter which had been delivered by hand.
      Harley took it eagerly and tore open the envelope. A look of expectancy
      faded from his eager face almost in the moment that it appeared there. &ldquo;No
      luck, Innes,&rdquo; he said, gloomily. &ldquo;Merton reports that there is no trace of
      any dangerous foreign body in the liquids analyzed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the analyst&rsquo;s report into a wastebasket and resumed his
      restless promenade. Innes, who could see that his principal wanted to
      talk, waited. For it was Paul Harley&rsquo;s custom, when the clue to a
      labyrinth evaded him, to outline his difficulties to his confidential
      secretary, and by the mere exercise of verbal construction Harley would
      often detect the weak spot in his reasoning. This stage come to, he would
      dictate a carefully worded statement of the case to date and thus
      familiarize himself with its complexities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Innes,&rdquo; he began, suddenly, &ldquo;Sir Charles had taken no
      refreshment of any kind at Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s house nor before leaving his own.
      Neither had he smoked. No one had approached him. Therefore, if he was
      poisoned, he was poisoned at his own table. Since he was never out of my
      observation from the moment of entering the library up to that of his
      death, we are reduced to the only two possible mediums&mdash;the soup or
      the water. He had touched nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wine was on the table but none had been poured out. Let us see what
      evidence, capable of being put into writing, exists to support my theory
      that Sir Charles was poisoned. In the first place, he clearly went in fear
      of some such death. It was because of this that he consulted me. What was
      the origin of his fear? Something associated with the term Fire-Tongue. So
      much is clear from Sir Charles&rsquo;s dying words, and his questioning Nicol
      Brinn on the point some weeks earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was afraid, then, of something or someone linked in his mind with the
      word Fire-Tongue. What do we know about Fire-Tongue? One thing only: that
      it had to do with some episode which took place in India. This item we owe
      to Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Sir Charles believed himself to be in danger from some thing
      or person unknown, associated with India and with the term Fire-Tongue.
      What else? His house was entered during the night under circumstances
      suggesting that burglary was not the object of the entrance. And next? He
      was assaulted, with murderous intent. Thirdly, he believed himself to be
      subjected to constant surveillance. Was this a delusion? It was not. After
      failing several times I myself detected someone dogging my movements last
      night at the moment I entered Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s chambers. Nicol Brinn also saw
      this person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short, Sir Charles was, beyond doubt, at the time of his death,
      receiving close attention from some mysterious person or persons the
      object of which he believed to be his death. Have I gone beyond
      established facts, Innes, thus far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Harley. So far you are on solid ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Leaving out of the question those points which we hope to clear up
      when the evidence of Miss Abingdon becomes available&mdash;how did Sir
      Charles learn that Nicol Brinn knew the meaning of Fire-Tongue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have heard something to that effect in India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this were so he would scarcely have awaited a chance encounter to
      prosecute his inquiries, since Nicol Brinn is a well-known figure in
      London and Sir Charles had been home for several years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brinn may have said something after the accident and before he was in
      full possession of his senses which gave Sir Charles a clue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not, Innes. I called at the druggist&rsquo;s establishment this morning.
      They recalled the incident, of course. Mr. Brinn never uttered a word
      until, opening his eyes, he said: &lsquo;Hello! Am I much damaged?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Innes smiled discreetly. &ldquo;A remarkable character, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Your biggest difficulty at the moment is to fit Mr. Nicol Brinn into the
      scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t fit at all, Innes! We come to the final and conclusive item of
      evidence substantiating my theory of Sir Charles&rsquo;s murder: Nicol Brinn
      believes he was murdered. Nicol Brinn has known others, in his own words,
      &lsquo;to go the same way.&rsquo; Yet Nicol Brinn, a millionaire, a scholar, a
      sportsman, and a gentleman, refuses to open his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is afraid of something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is afraid of Fire-Tongue&mdash;whatever Fire-Tongue may be! I never
      saw a man of proved courage more afraid in my life. He prefers to court
      arrest for complicity in a murder rather than tell what he knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be, Innes, if Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s fears were personal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley checked his steps in front of the watchful secretary and gazed
      keenly into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death has no terrors for Nicol Brinn,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;All his life he
      has toyed with danger. He admitted to me that during the past seven years
      he had courted death. Isn&rsquo;t it plain enough, Innes? If ever a man
      possessed all that the world had to offer, Nicol Brinn is that man. In
      such a case and in such circumstances what do we look for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Innes shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We look for the woman!&rdquo; snapped Paul Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a rap at the door and Miss Smith, the typist, entered. &ldquo;Miss
      Phil Abingdon and Doctor McMurdoch,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; muttered Harley. &ldquo;So soon? Why, she can only just&mdash;&rdquo;
       He checked himself. &ldquo;Show them in, Miss Smith,&rdquo; he directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the typist went out, followed by Innes, Paul Harley found himself
      thinking of the photograph in Sir Charles Abingdon&rsquo;s library and waiting
      with an almost feverish expectancy for the appearance of the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately Phil Abingdon came in, accompanied by the sepulchral
      Doctor McMurdoch. And Harley found himself wondering whether her eyes were
      really violet-coloured or whether intense emotion heroically repressed had
      temporarily lent them that appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise was the predominant quality of his first impression. Sir Charles
      Abingdon&rsquo;s daughter was so exceedingly vital&mdash;petite and slender, yet
      instinct with force. The seeming repose of the photograph was misleading.
      That her glance could be naive he realized&mdash;as it could also be gay&mdash;and
      now her eyes were sad with a sadness so deep as to dispel the impression
      of lightness created by her dainty form, her alluring, mobile lips, and
      the fascinating, wavy, red-brown hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not wear mourning. He recalled that there had been no time to
      procure it. She was exquisitely and fashionably dressed, and even the
      pallor of grief could not rob her cheeks of the bloom born of Devon
      sunshine. He had expected her to be pretty. He was surprised to find her
      lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch stood silent in the doorway, saying nothing by way of
      introduction. But nothing was necessary. Phil Abingdon came forward quite
      naturally&mdash;and quite naturally Paul Harley discovered her little
      gloved hand to lie clasped between both his own. It was more like a
      reunion than a first meeting and was so laden with perfect understanding
      that, even yet, speech seemed scarcely worth while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking over that moment, in later days, Paul Harley remembered that he
      had been prompted by some small inner voice to say: &ldquo;So you have come
      back?&rdquo; It was recognition. Of the hundreds of men and women who came into
      his life for a while, and ere long went out of it again, he knew, by
      virtue of that sixth sense of his, that Phil Abingdon had come to stay&mdash;whether
      for joy or sorrow he could not divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really quite brief&mdash;that interval of silence&mdash;although
      perhaps long enough to bridge the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How brave of you, Miss Abingdon!&rdquo; said Harley. &ldquo;How wonderfully brave of
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an Abingdon,&rdquo; came the deep tones of Doctor McMurdoch. &ldquo;She arrived
      only two hours ago and here she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no rest for me, Doctor,&rdquo; said the girl, and strove valiantly
      to control her voice, &ldquo;until this dreadful doubt is removed. Mr. Harley&rdquo;&mdash;she
      turned to him appealingly&mdash;&ldquo;please don&rsquo;t study my feelings in the
      least; I can bear anything&mdash;now; just tell me what happened. Oh! I
      had to come. I felt that I had to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Paul Harley placed an armchair for his visitor, his glance met that of
      Doctor McMurdoch, and in the gloomy eyes he read admiration of this girl
      who could thus conquer the inherent weakness of her sex and at such an
      hour and after a dreadful ordeal set her hand to the task which fate had
      laid upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor McMurdoch sat down on a chair beside the door, setting his silk hat
      upon the floor and clasping his massive chin with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will endeavour to do as you wish, Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; said Harley, glancing
      anxiously at the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Doctor McMurdoch returned only a dull stare. It was evident that this
      man of stone was as clay in the hands of Phil Abingdon. He deprecated the
      strain which she was imposing upon her nervous system, already overwrought
      to the danger point, but he was helpless for all his dour obstinacy.
      Harley, looking down at the girl&rsquo;s profile, read a new meaning into the
      firm line of her chin. He was conscious of an insane desire to put his
      arms around this new acquaintance who seemed in some indefinable yet
      definite way to belong to him and to whisper the tragic story he had to
      tell, comforting her the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to relate what had taken place at the first interview, when Sir
      Charles had told him of the menace which he had believed to hang over his
      life. He spoke slowly, deliberately, choosing his words with a view to
      sparing Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s feelings as far as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no comment throughout, but her fingers alternately tightened and
      relaxed their hold upon the arms of the chair in which she was seated.
      Once, at some reference to words spoken by her father, her sensitive lips
      began to quiver and Harley, watching her, paused. She held the chair arms
      more tightly. &ldquo;Please go on, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were spoken in a very low voice, but the speaker looked up
      bravely, and Harley, reassured, proceeded uninterruptedly to the end of
      the story. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At some future time, Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I hope you will allow
      me to call upon you. There is so much to be discussed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Phil Abingdon looked up into his face. &ldquo;I have forced myself to come
      to see you to-day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I realize there is no service I can
      do poor dad so important as finding out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Harley interrupted, gently. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo; Phil Abingdon shook her head rebelliously. &ldquo;Please ask me what
      you want to know. I came for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He met the glance of violet eyes, and understood something of Doctor
      McMurdoch&rsquo;s helplessness. He found his thoughts again wandering into
      strange, wild byways and was only recalled to the realities by the dry,
      gloomy voice of the physician. &ldquo;Go on, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; said Doctor McMurdoch.
      &ldquo;She has grand courage.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. CONFESSIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Paul Harley crossed the room and stood in front of the tall Burmese
      cabinet. He experienced the utmost difficulty in adopting a judicial
      attitude toward his beautiful visitor. Proximity increased his mental
      confusion. Therefore he stood on the opposite side of the office ere
      beginning to question her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; he said, speaking very deliberately,
      &ldquo;do you attach any particular significance to the term &lsquo;Fire-Tongue&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon glanced rapidly at Doctor McMurdoch. &ldquo;None at all, Mr.
      Harley,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;The doctor has already told me of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why I ask?&rdquo; She inclined her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Nicol Brinn? Have you met this gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. I know that Dad had met him and was very much interested in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea. He told me that he thought Mr. Brinn one of the most
      singular characters he had ever known. But beyond describing his rooms in
      Piccadilly, which had impressed him as extraordinary, he said very little
      about Mr. Brinn. He sounded interesting and &ldquo;&mdash;she hesitated and her
      eyes filled with tears&mdash;&ldquo;I asked Dad to invite him home.&rdquo; Again she
      paused. This retrospection, by making the dead seem to live again, added
      to the horror of her sudden bereavement, and Harley would most gladly have
      spared her more. &ldquo;Dad seemed strangely disinclined to do so,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that the keen investigator came to life within Harley. &ldquo;Your father did
      not appear anxious to bring Mr. Brinn to his home?&rdquo; he asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all anxious. This was all the more strange because Dad invited Mr.
      Brinn to his club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave no reason for his refusal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there was no refusal, Mr. Harley. He merely evaded the matter. I
      never knew why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; muttered Harley. &ldquo;And now, Miss Abingdon, can you enlighten me
      respecting the identity of the Oriental gentleman with whom he had
      latterly become acquainted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon glanced rapidly at Doctor McMurdoch and then lowered her
      head. She did not answer at once. &ldquo;I know to whom you refer, Mr. Harley,&rdquo;
       she said, finally. &ldquo;But it was I who had made this gentleman&rsquo;s
      acquaintance. My father did not know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wonder why he mentioned him?&rdquo; murmured Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I cannot imagine. I have been wondering ever since Doctor McMurdoch
      told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recognize the person to whom Sir Charles referred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He could only have meant Ormuz Khan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ormuz Khan&mdash;&rdquo; echoed Harley. &ldquo;Where have I heard that name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He visits England periodically, I believe. In fact, he has a house
      somewhere near London. I met him at Lady Vail&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Vail&rsquo;s? His excellency moves, then, in diplomatic circles? Odd that
      I cannot place him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a vague idea, Mr. Harley, that he is a financier. I seem to have
      heard that he had something to do with the Imperial Bank of Iran.&rdquo; She
      glanced naively at Harley. &ldquo;Is there such a bank?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Am I to understand that Ormuz Khan is a Persian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he is a Persian,&rdquo; said Phil Abingdon, rather confusedly. &ldquo;To be
      quite frank, I know very little about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley gazed steadily at the speaker for a moment. &ldquo;Can you think of
      any reason why Sir Charles should have worried about this gentleman?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl lowered her head again. &ldquo;He paid me a lot of attention,&rdquo; she
      finally confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This meeting at Lady Vail&rsquo;s, then, was the first of many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;not of many! I saw him two or three times. But he began to
      send me most extravagant presents. I suppose it was his Oriental way of
      paying a compliment, but Dad objected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he would. He knew his Orient and his Oriental. I assume, Miss
      Abingdon, that you were in England during the years that your father lived
      in the East?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I was at school. I have never been in the East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley hesitated. He found himself upon dangerously delicate ground
      and was temporarily at a loss as to how to proceed. Unexpected aid came
      from the taciturn Doctor McMurdoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never breathed a word of this to me, Phil,&rdquo; he said, gloomily. &ldquo;The
      impudence of the man! Small wonder Abingdon objected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon tilted her chin forward rebelliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ormuz Khan was merely unfamiliar with English customs,&rdquo; she retorted.
      &ldquo;There was nothing otherwise in his behaviour to which any one could have
      taken exception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; demanded the physician. &ldquo;If a man of colour paid his
      heathen attentions to my daughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have no daughter, Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But if I had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had,&rdquo; echoed Phil Abingdon, and was about to carry on this wordy
      warfare which, Harley divined, was of old standing between the two, when
      sudden realization of the purpose of the visit came to her. She paused,
      and he saw her biting her lips desperately. Almost at random he began to
      speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as you are aware, then, Miss Abingdon, Sir Charles never met Ormuz
      Khan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never even saw him, Mr. Harley, that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most extraordinary that he should have given me the impression that
      this man&mdash;for I can only suppose that he referred to Ormuz Khan&mdash;was
      in some way associated with his fears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must remind you, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; Doctor McMurdoch interrupted, &ldquo;that poor
      Abingdon was a free talker. His pride, I take it, which was strong, had
      kept him silent on this matter with me, but he welcomed an opportunity of
      easing his mind to one discreet and outside the family circle. His words
      to you may have had no bearing upon the thing he wished to consult you
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; mused Harley. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible. But such was not my impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned again to Phil Abingdon. &ldquo;This Ormuz Khan, I understood you to
      say, actually resides in or near London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is at present living at the Savoy, I believe. He also has a house
      somewhere outside London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were a hundred other questions Paul Harley was anxious to ask: some
      that were professional but more that were personal. He found himself
      resenting the intrusion of this wealthy Oriental into the life of the girl
      who sat there before him. And because he could read a kindred resentment
      in the gloomy eye of Doctor McMurdoch, he was drawn spiritually closer to
      that dour character.
    </p>
    <p>
      By virtue of his training he was a keen psychologist, and he perceived
      clearly enough that Phil Abingdon was one of those women in whom a certain
      latent perversity is fanned to life by opposition. Whether she was really
      attracted by Ormuz Khan or whether she suffered his attentions merely
      because she knew them to be distasteful to others, he could not yet
      decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anger threatened him&mdash;as it had threatened him when he had realized
      that Nicol Brinn meant to remain silent. He combated it, for it had no
      place in the judicial mind of the investigator. But he recognized its
      presence with dismay. Where Phil Abingdon was concerned he could not trust
      himself. In her glance, too, and in the manner of her answers to questions
      concerning the Oriental, there was a provoking femininity&mdash;a
      deliberate and baffling intrusion of the eternal Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared questioningly across at Doctor McMurdoch and perceived a sudden
      look of anxiety in the physician&rsquo;s face. Quick as the thought which the
      look inspired, he turned to Phil Abingdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting quite motionless in the big armchair, and her face had
      grown very pale. Even as he sprang forward he saw her head droop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has fainted,&rdquo; said Doctor McMurdoch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; replied Harley. &ldquo;She should not have come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door communicating with his private apartments and ran out.
      But, quick as he was, Phil Abingdon had recovered before he returned with
      the water for which he had gone. Her reassuring smile was somewhat wan.
      &ldquo;How perfectly silly of me!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall begin to despise myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he went down to the street with his visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be so much more you want to know, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; said Phil
      Abingdon. &ldquo;Will you come and see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He promised to do so. His sentiments were so strangely complex that he
      experienced a desire for solitude in order that he might strive to
      understand them. As he stood at the door watching the car move toward the
      Strand he knew that to-day he could not count upon his intuitive powers to
      warn him of sudden danger. But he keenly examined the faces of passers-by
      and stared at the occupants of those cabs and cars which were proceeding
      in the same direction as the late Sir Charles Abingdon&rsquo;s limousine.
    </p>
    <p>
      No discovery rewarded him, however, and he returned upstairs to his office
      deep in thought. &ldquo;I am in to nobody,&rdquo; he said as he passed the desk at
      which Innes was at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Mr. Harley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley walked through to the private office and, seating himself at
      the big, orderly table, reached over to a cupboard beside him and took out
      a tin of smoking mixture. He began very slowly to load his pipe, gazing
      abstractedly across the room at the tall Burmese cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized that, excepting the extraordinary behaviour and the veiled but
      significant statements of Nicol Brinn, his theory that Sir Charles
      Abingdon had not died from natural causes rested upon data of the most
      flimsy description. From Phil Abingdon he had learned nothing whatever.
      Her evidence merely tended to confuse the case more hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sheer nonsense to suppose that Ormuz Khan, who was evidently
      interested in the girl, could be in any way concerned in the death of her
      father. Nevertheless, as an ordinary matter of routine, Paul Harley,
      having lighted his pipe, made a note on a little block:
    </p>
    <p>
      Cover activities of Ormuz Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoked reflectively for a while and then added another note:
    </p>
    <p>
      Watch Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten minutes or more he sat smoking and thinking, his unseeing gaze set
      upon the gleaming lacquer of the cabinet; and presently, as he smoked, he
      became aware of an abrupt and momentary chill. His sixth sense was awake
      again. Taking up a pencil, he added a third note:
    </p>
    <p>
      Watch yourself. You are in danger.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. A WREATH OF HYACINTHS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Deep in reflection and oblivious of the busy London life around him, Paul
      Harley walked slowly along the Strand. Outwardly he was still the
      keen-eyed investigator who could pry more deeply into a mystery than any
      other in England; but to-day his mood was introspective. He was in a brown
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one figure which had power to recall him to the actual world suddenly
      intruded itself upon his field of vision. From dreams which he recognized
      in the moment of awakening to have been of Phil Abingdon, he was suddenly
      aroused to the fact that Phil Abingdon herself was present. Perhaps, half
      subconsciously, he had been looking for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veiled and dressed in black, he saw her slim figure moving through the
      throng. He conceived the idea that there was something furtive in her
      movements. She seemed to be hurrying along as if desirous of avoiding
      recognition. Every now and again she glanced back, evidently in search of
      a cab, and a dormant suspicion which had lain in Harley&rsquo;s mind now became
      animate. Phil Abingdon was coming from the direction of the Savoy Hotel.
      Was it possible that she had been to visit Ormuz Khan?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley crossed the Strand and paused just in front of the hurrying,
      black-clad figure. &ldquo;Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a sort of instinct told me
      that I should meet you to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly, and through the black veil which she wore he saw her
      eyes grow larger&mdash;or such was the effect as she opened them widely.
      Perhaps he misread their message. To him Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s expression was
      that of detected guilt. More than ever he was convinced of the truth of
      his suspicions. &ldquo;Perhaps you were looking for a cab?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overcoming her surprise, or whatever emotion had claimed her at the moment
      of this unexpected meeting, Phil Abingdon took Harley&rsquo;s outstretched hand
      and held it for a moment before replying. &ldquo;I had almost despaired of
      finding one,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I am late already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The porter at the Savoy would get you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried there and got tired of waiting,&rdquo; she answered quite simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Harley&rsquo;s suspicions were almost dispelled, and, observing an
      empty cab approaching, he signalled to the man to pull up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you want to go to?&rdquo; he inquired, opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am due at Doctor McMurdoch&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she replied, stepping in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley hesitated, glancing from the speaker to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you have time to come with me,&rdquo; said Phil Abingdon. &ldquo;I know
      the doctor wants to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come with pleasure,&rdquo; replied Harley, a statement which was no more
      than true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly he gave the necessary directions to the taxi man and seated
      himself beside the girl in the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am awfully glad of an opportunity of a chat with you, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; said
      Phil Abingdon. &ldquo;The last few days have seemed like one long nightmare to
      me.&rdquo; She sighed pathetically. &ldquo;Surely Doctor McMurdoch is right, and all
      the horrible doubts which troubled us were idle ones, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Harley, looking almost eagerly into his face. &ldquo;Poor daddy
      hadn&rsquo;t an enemy in the world, I am sure,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His extraordinary
      words to you no doubt have some simple explanation. Oh, it would be such a
      relief to know that his end was a natural one. At least it would dull the
      misery of it all a little bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appeal in her eyes was of a kind which Harley found much difficulty in
      resisting. It would have been happiness to offer consolation to this
      sorrowing girl. But, although he could not honestly assure her that he had
      abandoned his theories, he realized that the horror of her suspicions was
      having a dreadful effect upon Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may quite possibly be right,&rdquo; he said, gently. &ldquo;In any event, I hope
      you will think as little as possible about the morbid side of this unhappy
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I try to,&rdquo; she assured him, earnestly, &ldquo;but you can imagine how hard the
      task is. I know that you must have some good reason for your idea;
      something, I mean, other than the mere words which have puzzled us all so
      much. Won&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, Paul Harley had determined, since the girl was unacquainted with
      Nicol Brinn, to conceal from her all that he had learned from that
      extraordinary man. In this determination he had been actuated, too, by the
      promptings of the note of danger which, once seemingly attuned to the
      movements of Sir Charles Abingdon, had, after the surgeon&rsquo;s death,
      apparently become centred upon himself and upon Nicol Brinn. He dreaded
      the thought that the cloud might stretch out over the life of this girl
      who sat beside him and whom he felt so urgently called upon to protect
      from such a menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud? What was this cloud, whence did it emanate, and by whom had it
      been called into being? He looked into the violet eyes, and as a while
      before he had moved alone through the wilderness of London now he seemed
      to be alone with Phil Abingdon on the border of a spirit world which had
      no existence for the multitudes around. Psychically, he was very close to
      her at that moment; and when he replied he replied evasively: &ldquo;I have
      absolutely no scrap of evidence, Miss Abingdon, pointing to foul play. The
      circumstances were peculiar, of course, but I have every confidence in
      Doctor McMurdoch&rsquo;s efficiency. Since he is satisfied, it would be mere
      impertinence on my part to question his verdict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon repeated the weary sigh and turned her head aside, glancing
      down to where with one small shoe she was restlessly tapping the floor of
      the cab. They were both silent for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust me?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly. &ldquo;Or don&rsquo;t you think I am clever
      enough to share your confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she looked at him challengingly, and he felt all the force of
      personality which underlay her outward lightness of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I both trust you and respect your intelligence,&rdquo; he answered, quietly.
      &ldquo;If I withhold anything from you, I am prompted by a very different motive
      from the one you suggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are keeping something from me,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;I knew you
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; replied Harley, &ldquo;when the worst trials of this affair are
      over, I want to have a long talk with you. Until then, won&rsquo;t you believe
      that I am acting for the best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s glance was unrelenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your opinion it may be so, but you won&rsquo;t do me the honour of
      consulting mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley had half anticipated this attitude, but had hoped that she would
      not adopt it. She possessed in a high degree the feminine art of provoking
      a quarrel. But he found much consolation in the fact that she had thus
      shifted the discussion from the abstract to the personal. He smiled
      slightly, and Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s expression relaxed in response and she
      lowered her eyes quickly. &ldquo;Why do you persistently treat me like a child?&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Harley, delighted but bewildered by her sudden
      change of mood. &ldquo;Perhaps because I want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him, but stared abstractedly out of the cab window; and
      Harley did not break this silence, much as he would have liked to do so.
      He was mentally reviewing his labours of the preceding day when, in the
      character of a Colonial visitor with much time on his hands, he had
      haunted the Savoy for hours in the hope of obtaining a glimpse of Ormuz
      Khan. His vigil had been fruitless, and on returning by a roundabout route
      to his office he had bitterly charged himself with wasting valuable time
      upon a side issue. Yet when, later, he had sat in his study endeavouring
      to arrange his ideas in order, he had discovered many points in his own
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If his ineffective surveillance of Ormuz Khan had been dictated by
      interest in Phil Abingdon rather than by strictly professional motives, it
      was, nevertheless, an ordinary part of the conduct of such a case. But
      while he had personally undertaken the matter of his excellency he had
      left the work of studying the activities of Nicol Brinn to an assistant.
      He could not succeed in convincing himself that, on the evidence
      available, the movements of the Oriental gentleman were more important
      than those of the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Phil Abingdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She alighted, and Harley dismissed the cabman and followed the girl into
      Doctor McMurdoch&rsquo;s house. Here he made the acquaintance of Mrs. McMurdoch,
      who, as experience had taught him to anticipate, was as plump and merry
      and vivacious as her husband was lean, gloomy, and taciturn. But she was a
      perfect well of sympathy, as her treatment of the bereaved girl showed.
      She took her in her arms and hugged her in a way that was good to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were waiting for you, dear,&rdquo; she said when the formality of presenting
      Harley was over. &ldquo;Are you quite sure that you want to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon nodded pathetically. She had raised her veil, and Harley
      could see that her eyes were full of tears. &ldquo;I should like to see the
      flowers,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was staying at the McMurdochs&rsquo; house, and as the object at present in
      view was that of a visit to her old home, from which the funeral of Sir
      Charles Abingdon was to take place on the morrow, Harley became suddenly
      conscious of the fact that his presence was inopportune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you want to see me, Doctor McMurdoch,&rdquo; he said, turning to the
      dour physician. &ldquo;Shall I await your return or do you expect to be
      detained?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Phil Abingdon had her own views on the matter. She stepped up beside
      him and linked her arm in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please come with me, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I want you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a result he found himself a few minutes later entering the hall of the
      late Sir Charles&rsquo;s house. The gloved hand resting on his arm trembled, but
      when he looked down solicitously into Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s face she smiled
      bravely, and momentarily her clasp tightened as if to reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed quite natural that she should derive comfort from the presence
      of this comparative stranger; and neither of the two, as they stood there
      looking at the tributes to the memory of the late Sir Charles&mdash;which
      overflowed from a neighbouring room into the lobby and were even piled
      upon the library table&mdash;were conscious of any strangeness in the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that had struck Harley on entering the house had been an
      overpowering perfume of hyacinths. Now he saw whence it arose; for,
      conspicuous amid the wreaths and crosses, was an enormous device formed of
      hyacinths. Its proportions dwarfed those of all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Howett, the housekeeper, a sad-eyed little figure, appeared now from
      behind the bank of flowers. Her grief could not rob her of that Old World
      manner which was hers, and she saluted the visitors with a bow which
      promised to develop into a curtsey. Noting the direction of Phil
      Abingdon&rsquo;s glance, which was set upon a card attached to the wreath of
      hyacinths: &ldquo;It was the first to arrive, Miss Phil,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
      beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; said the girl, moving forward and drawing Harley along
      with her. She glanced from the card up to his face, which was set in a
      rather grim expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ormuz Khan has been so good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He sent his secretary to see if
      he could be of any assistance yesterday, but I certainly had not expected
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes filled with tears again, and, because he thought they were tears
      of gratitude, Harley clenched his hand tightly so that the muscles of his
      forearm became taut to Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s touch. She looked up at him,
      smiling pathetically: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it was awfully kind of him?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dry and sepulchral cough of approval came from Doctor McMurdoch; and
      Harley divined with joy that when the ordeal of the next day was over Phil
      Abingdon would have to face cross-examination by the conscientious
      Scotsman respecting this stranger whose attentions, if Orientally
      extravagant, were instinct with such generous sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason the heavy perfume of the hyacinths affected him
      unpleasantly. All his old doubts and suspicions found a new life, so that
      his share in the conversation which presently arose became confined to a
      few laconic answers to direct questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was angry, and his anger was more than half directed against himself,
      because he knew that he had no shadow of right to question this girl about
      her friendships or even to advise her. He determined, however, even at the
      cost of incurring a rebuke, to urge Doctor McMurdoch to employ all the
      influence he possessed to terminate an acquaintanceship which could not be
      otherwise than undesirable, if it was not actually dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, presently, the party returned to the neighbouring house of the
      physician, however, Harley&rsquo;s plans in this respect were destroyed by the
      action of Doctor McMurdoch, in whose composition tact was not a
      predominant factor. Almost before they were seated in the doctor&rsquo;s drawing
      room he voiced his disapproval. &ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; he said, ignoring a silent appeal
      from his wife, &ldquo;this is, mayhap, no time to speak of the matter, but I&rsquo;m
      not glad to see the hyacinths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s chin quivered rebelliously, and, to Harley&rsquo;s dismay, it
      was upon him that she fixed her gaze in replying. &ldquo;Perhaps you also
      disapprove of his excellency&rsquo;s kindness?&rdquo; she said, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley found himself temporarily at a loss for words. She was perfectly
      well aware that he disapproved, and now was taking a cruel pleasure in
      reminding him of the fact that he was not entitled to do so. Had he been
      capable of that calm analysis to which ordinarily he submitted all
      psychological problems, he must have found matter for rejoicing in this
      desire of the girl&rsquo;s to hurt him. &ldquo;I am afraid, Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; he
      replied, quietly, &ldquo;that the matter is not one in which I am entitled to
      express my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued to look at him challengingly, but:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; said Doctor McMurdoch, &ldquo;but if you were, your
      opinion would be the same as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. McMurdoch&rsquo;s glance became positively beseeching, but the physician
      ignored it. &ldquo;As your father&rsquo;s oldest friend,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I feel called
      upon to remark that it isn&rsquo;t usual for strangers to thrust their
      attentions upon a bereaved family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Phil Abingdon with animation, &ldquo;do I understand that this is
      also your opinion, Mr. Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a man of the world,&rdquo; declared Doctor McMurdoch, gloomily, &ldquo;it cannot
      fail to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tardily enough he now succumbed to the silent entreaties of his wife. &ldquo;I
      will speak of this later,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Mayhap I should not have spoken
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears began to trickle down Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, my dear!&rdquo; cried little Mrs. McMurdoch, running to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl sprang up, escaping from the encircling arm of the motherly
      old lady. She shook her head disdainfully, as if to banish tears and
      weakness, and glanced rapidly around from face to face. &ldquo;I think you are
      all perfectly cruel and horrible,&rdquo; she said in a choking voice, turned,
      and ran out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A distant door banged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; muttered Doctor McMurdoch, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put my foot in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife looked at him in speechless indignation and then followed Phil
      Abingdon from the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. TWO REPORTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On returning to his office Paul Harley found awaiting him the report of
      the man to whom he had entrusted the study of the movements of Nicol
      Brinn. His mood was a disturbed one, and he had observed none of his
      customary precautions in coming from Doctor McMurdoch&rsquo;s house. He wondered
      if the surveillance which he had once detected had ceased. Perhaps the
      chambers of Nicol Brinn were the true danger zone upon which these subtle
      but powerful forces now were focussed. On the other hand, he was quite
      well aware that his movements might have been watched almost
      uninterruptedly since the hour that Sir Charles Abingdon had visited his
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the previous day, in his attempt to learn the identity of Ormuz
      Khan, he had covered his tracks with his customary care. He had sufficient
      faith in his knowledge of disguise, which was extensive, to believe that
      those mysterious persons who were interested in his movements remained
      unaware of the fact that the simple-minded visitor from Vancouver who had
      spent several hours in and about the Savoy, and Paul Harley of Chancery
      Lane, were one and the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brain was far too alertly engaged with troubled thoughts of Phil
      Abingdon to be susceptible to the influence of those delicate etheric
      waves which he had come to recognize as the note of danger. Practically
      there had been no development whatever in the investigation, and he was
      almost tempted to believe that the whole thing was a mirage, when the
      sight of the typewritten report translated him mentally to the luxurious
      chambers in Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, almost clairvoyantly, he saw the stoical American seated before the
      empty fireplace, his foot restlessly tapping the fender. Again he heard
      the curious, high tones: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you... You have opened the gates of
      hell....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole scene, with its tantalizing undercurrent of mystery, was
      reenacted before his inner vision. He seemed to hear Nicol Brinn, startled
      from his reverie, exclaim: &ldquo;I think it was an owl.... We sometimes get
      them over from the Green Park....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why should so simple an incident have produced so singular an effect? For
      the face of the speaker had been ashen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the pendulum swung inevitably back: &ldquo;You are all perfectly cruel and
      horrible....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley clenched his hands, frowning at the Burmese cabinet as though
      he hated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      How persistently the voice of Phil Abingdon rang in his ears! He could not
      forget her lightest words. How hopelessly her bewitching image intruded
      itself between his reasoning mind and the problem upon which he sought to
      concentrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Smith, the typist, had gone, for it was after six o&rsquo;clock, and Innes
      alone was on duty. He came in as Harley, placing his hat and cane upon the
      big writing table, sat down to study the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inspector Wessex rang up, Mr. Harley, about an hour ago. He said he would
      be at the Yard until six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he obtained any information?&rdquo; asked Paul Harley, wearily, glancing at
      his little table clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he had had insufficient time to do much in the matter, but that
      there were one or two outstanding facts which might interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he seem to be surprised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did,&rdquo; confessed Innes. &ldquo;He said that Ormuz Khan was a well-known
      figure in financial circles, and asked me in what way you were interested
      in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Harley. He took up the telephone. &ldquo;City 400,&rdquo; he said....
      &ldquo;Is that the Commissioner&rsquo;s Office, New Scotland Yard? ... Paul Harley
      speaking. Would you please inquire if Detective Inspector Wessex has
      gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While awaiting a reply he looked up at Innes. &ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the letters, Mr. Harley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No callers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the letters, then; I will see to them. You need not wait.&rdquo; A moment
      later, as his secretary bade him good-night and went out of the office:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Harley, speaking into the mouthpiece... &ldquo;The inspector has
      gone? Perhaps you would ask him to ring me up in the morning.&rdquo; He replaced
      the receiver on the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resting his chin in his hands, he began to read from the typewritten pages
      before him. His assistant&rsquo;s report was conceived as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Re Mr. Nicol Brinn of Raleigh House, Piccadilly, W. I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Nicol Brinn is an American citizen, born at Cincinnati, Ohio,
      February 15, 1884. He is the son of John Nicolas Brinn of the same city,
      founder of the firm of J. Nicolas Brinn, Incorporated, later reconstituted
      under the style of Brinn&rsquo;s Universal Electric Supply Corporation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nicol Brinn is a graduate of Harvard. He has travelled extensively in
      nearly all parts of the world and has access to the best society of Europe
      and America. He has a reputation for eccentricity, has won numerous
      sporting events as a gentleman rider; was the first airman to fly over the
      Rockies; took part in the Uruguay rebellion of 1904, and held the rank of
      lieutenant colonel of field artillery with the American forces during the
      Great War.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has published a work on big game and has contributed numerous travel
      articles to American periodicals. On the death of Mr. Brinn, senior, in
      1914, he inherited an enormous fortune and a preponderating influence in
      the B.U.E.S.C. He has never taken any active part in conduct of the
      concern, but has lived a restless and wandering life in various parts of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Nicol Brinn is a confirmed bachelor. I have been unable to find that
      he has ever taken the slightest interest in any woman other than his
      mother throughout his career. Mrs. J. Nicolas Brinn is still living in
      Cincinnati, and there is said to be a strong bond of affection between
      mother and son. His movements on yesterday, 4th June, 1921, were as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He came out of his chambers at eight o&rsquo;clock and rode for an hour in the
      park, when he returned and remained indoors until midday. He then drove to
      the Carlton, where he lunched with the Foreign Secretary, with whom he
      remained engaged in earnest conversation until ten minutes to three. The
      Rt. Hon. gentleman proceeded to the House of Commons and Mr. Brinn to an
      auction at Christie&rsquo;s. He bought two oil paintings. He then returned to
      his chambers and did not reappear again until seven o&rsquo;clock. He dined
      alone at a small and unfashionable restaurant in Soho, went on to his box
      at Covent Garden, where he remained for an hour, also alone, and then went
      home. He had no callers throughout the day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately Paul Harley had read the report, only removing his hand from
      his chin to turn over the pages. Now from the cabinet at his elbow he took
      out his tin of tobacco and, filling and lighting a pipe, lay back, eyes
      half closed, considering what he had learned respecting Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he was concerned in the death of Sir Charles Abingdon he did not
      believe for a moment; but that this elusive case, which upon investigation
      only seemed the more obscure, was nevertheless a case of deliberate murder
      he was as firmly convinced as ever. Of the identity of the murderer, of
      his motive, he had not the haziest idea, but that the cloud which he had
      pictured as overhanging the life of the late Sir Charles was a reality and
      not a myth of the imagination he became more completely convinced with
      each new failure to pick up a clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself helplessly tied. In which direction should he move and to
      what end? Inclination prompted him in one direction, common sense held him
      back. As was his custom, he took a pencil and wrote upon a little block:
    </p>
    <p>
      Find means to force Brinn to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay back in his chair again, deep in thought, and presently added the
      note:
    </p>
    <p>
      Obtain interview with Ormuz Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he replaced the pencil on the table, his telephone bell rang. The
      caller proved to be his friend, Inspector Wessex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; said the inspector. &ldquo;I had occasion to return to the
      Yard, and they told me you had rung up. I don&rsquo;t know why you are
      interested in this Ormuz Khan, unless you want to raise a loan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley laughed. &ldquo;I gather that he is a man of extensive means,&rdquo; he
      replied, &ldquo;but hitherto he has remained outside my radius of observation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And outside mine,&rdquo; declared the inspector. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t the most distant
      connection with anything crooked. It gave me a lot of trouble to find out
      what little I have found out. Briefly, all I have to tell you is this:
      Ormuz Khan&mdash;who is apparently entitled to be addressed as &lsquo;his
      excellency&rsquo;&mdash;is a director of the Imperial Bank of Iran, and is
      associated, too, with one of the Ottoman banks. I presume his nationality
      is Persian, but I can&rsquo;t be sure of it. He periodically turns up in the
      various big capitals when international loans and that sort of thing are
      being negotiated. I understand that he has a flat somewhere in Paris, and
      the Service de Surete tells me that his name is good for several million
      francs over there. He appears to have a certain fondness for London during
      the spring and early summer months, and I am told he has a fine place in
      Surrey. He is at present living at Savoy Court. He appears to be something
      of a dandy and to be very partial to the fair sex, but nevertheless there
      is nothing wrong with his reputation,considering, I mean, that the man is
      a sort of Eastern multimillionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Harley, who had been listening eagerly. &ldquo;Is that the extent of
      your information, Wessex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied Wessex, with a laugh. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll find it useful,
      but I doubt it. He hasn&rsquo;t been picking pockets or anything, has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Harley, shortly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t apprehend that his excellency will
      ever appear in your province, Wessex. My interest in him is of a purely
      personal nature. Thanks for all the trouble you have taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley began to pace the office. From a professional point of view
      the information was uninteresting enough, but from another point of view
      it had awakened again that impotent anger which he had too often
      experienced in these recent, strangely restless days.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all costs he must see Ormuz Khan, although how he was to obtain access
      to this man who apparently never left his private apartments (if the day
      of his vigil at the Savoy had been a typical one) he failed to imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, pausing at the table, he again took up his pencil, and to
      the note &ldquo;Obtain interview with Ormuz Khan&rdquo; he added the one word,
      underlined:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. HIS EXCELLENCY ORMUZ KHAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The city clocks were chiming the hour of ten on the following morning when
      a page from the Savoy approached the shop of Mr. Jarvis, bootmaker, which
      is situated at no great distance from the hotel. The impudent face of the
      small boy wore an expression of serio-comic fright as he pushed open the
      door and entered the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jarvis, the bootmaker, belonged to a rapidly disappearing class of British
      tradesmen. He buckled to no one, but took an artistic pride in his own
      handiwork, criticism from a layman merely provoking a scornful anger which
      had lost Jarvis many good customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was engaged, at the moment of the page&rsquo;s entrance, in a little fitting
      room at the back of his cramped premises, but through the doorway the boy
      could see the red, bespectacled face with its fringe of bristling white
      beard, in which he detected all the tokens of brewing storm. He whistled
      softly in self-sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jarvis was saying to an invisible patron, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a welcome
      sight to see a real Englishman walk into my shop nowadays. London isn&rsquo;t
      London, sir, since the war, and the Strand will never be the Strand
      again.&rdquo; He turned to his assistant, who stood beside him, bootjack in
      hand. &ldquo;If he sends them back again,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;tell him to go to one
      of the French firms in Regent Street who cater to dainty ladies.&rdquo; He
      positively snorted with indignation, while the page, listening, whistled
      again and looked down at the parcel which he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unwelcome customer, Jarvis?&rdquo; inquired the voice of the man in the
      fitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite unwelcome,&rdquo; said Jarvis. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him. I have more work than I
      know how to turn out. I wish he would go elsewhere. I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. He had seen the page boy. The latter, having undone his parcel,
      was holding out a pair of elegant, fawn-coloured shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Moses!&rdquo; breathed Jarvis. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had the cheek to send them back
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His excellency&mdash;&rdquo; began the page, when Jarvis snatched the shoes
      from his hand and hurled them to the other end of the shop. His white
      beard positively bristled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell his excellency,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;to go to the devil, with my
      compliments!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So positively ferocious was his aspect that the boy, with upraised arm,
      backed hastily out into the street. Safety won: &ldquo;Blimey!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      youth. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the warm goods, he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for several moments, staring in a kind of stupefied admiration
      at the closed door of Mr. Jarvis&rsquo;s establishment. He whistled again,
      softly, and then began to run&mdash;for the formidable Mr. Jarvis suddenly
      opened the door. &ldquo;Hi, boy!&rdquo; he called to the page. The page hesitated,
      glancing back doubtfully. &ldquo;Tell his excellency that I will send round in
      about half an hour to remeasure his foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean it?&rdquo; inquired the boy, impudently&mdash;&ldquo;or is there a catch
      in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tan your hide, my lad!&rdquo; cried the bootmaker&mdash;&ldquo;and I mean that!
      Take my message and keep your mouth shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy departed, grinning, and little more than half an hour later a
      respectable-looking man presented himself at Savoy Court, inquiring of the
      attendant near the elevator for the apartments of &ldquo;his excellency,&rdquo;
       followed by an unintelligible word which presumably represented &ldquo;Ormuz
      Khan.&rdquo; The visitor wore a well-brushed but threadbare tweed suit, although
      his soft collar was by no means clean. He had a short, reddish-brown
      beard, and very thick, curling hair of the same hue protruded from beneath
      a bowler hat which had seen long service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Mr. Jarvis, he was bespectacled, and his teeth were much discoloured
      and apparently broken in front, as is usual with cobblers. His hands, too,
      were toil-stained and his nails very black. He carried a cardboard box. He
      seemed to be extremely nervous, and this nervousness palpably increased
      when the impudent page, who was standing in the lobby, giggled on hearing
      his inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s second floor,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;Are you from Hot-Stuff Jarvis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, lad,&rdquo; replied the visitor, speaking with a marked
      Manchester accent; &ldquo;from Mr. Jarvis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you really going up?&rdquo; inquired the boy with mock solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up right enough. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Chivers,&rdquo; snapped the hall porter. &ldquo;Ring the bell.&rdquo; He glanced
      at the cobbler. &ldquo;Second floor,&rdquo; he said, tersely, and resumed his study of
      a newspaper which he had been reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The representative of Mr. Jarvis was carried up to the second floor and
      the lift man, having indicated at which door he should knock, descended
      again. The cobbler&rsquo;s nervousness thereupon became more marked than ever,
      so that a waiter, seeing him looking helplessly from door to door, took
      pity on him and inquired for whom he was searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His excellency,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m hanged if I can remember the
      number or how to pronounce his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter glanced at him oddly. &ldquo;Ormuz Khan,&rdquo; he said, and rang the bell
      beside a door. As he hurried away, &ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; he called back.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short interval, and then the door was opened by a man who
      looked like a Hindu. He wore correct morning dress and through gold-rimmed
      pince-nez he stared inquiringly at the caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his excellency at home?&rdquo; asked the latter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Mr. Jarvis, the
      bootmaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the other, smiling slightly. &ldquo;Come in. What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parker, sir. From Mr. Jarvis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed, Parker found himself in a small lobby. Beside an
      umbrella rack a high-backed chair was placed. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he was directed.
      &ldquo;I will tell his excellency that you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A door was opened and closed again, and Parker found himself alone. He
      twirled his bowler hat, which he held in his hand, and stared about the
      place vacantly. Once he began to whistle, but checked himself and coughed
      nervously. Finally the Hindu gentleman reappeared, beckoning to him to
      enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker stood up very quickly and advanced, hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he remembered the box which he had left on the floor, and, stooping
      to recover it, he dropped his hat. But at last, leaving his hat upon the
      chair and carrying the box under his arm, he entered a room which had been
      converted into a very businesslike office.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a typewriter upon a table near the window at which someone had
      evidently been at work quite recently, and upon a larger table in the
      centre of the room were dispatch boxes, neat parcels of documents,
      ledgers, works of reference, and all the evidence of keen commercial
      activity. Crossing the room, the Hindu rapped upon an inner door, opened
      it, and standing aside, &ldquo;The man from the bootmaker,&rdquo; he said in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker advanced, peering about him as one unfamiliar with his
      surroundings. As he crossed the threshold the door was closed behind him,
      and he found himself in a superheated atmosphere heavy with the perfume of
      hyacinths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was furnished as a sitting room, but some of its appointments
      were obviously importations. Its keynote was orientalism, not of that
      sensuous yet grossly masculine character which surrounds the wealthy
      Eastern esthete but quite markedly feminine. There were an extraordinary
      number of cushions, and many bowls and vases containing hyacinths. What
      other strange appointments were present Parker was far too nervous to
      observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood dumbly before a man who lolled back in a deep, cushioned chair
      and whose almond-shaped eyes, black as night, were set immovably upon him.
      This man was apparently young. He wore a rich, brocaded robe, trimmed with
      marten fur, and out of it his long ivory throat rose statuesquely. His
      complexion was likewise of this uniform ivory colour, and from his low
      smooth brow his hair was brushed back in a series of glossy black waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lips were full and very red. As a woman he might have been considered
      handsome&mdash;even beautiful; in a man this beauty was unnatural and
      repellent. He wore Oriental slippers, fur-lined, and his feet rested on a
      small ottoman. One long, slender hand lay upon a cushion placed on the
      chair arm, and a pretty girl was busily engaged in manicuring his
      excellency&rsquo;s nails. Although the day held every promise of being
      uncomfortably hot, already a huge fire was burning in the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Parker stood before him, the languid, handsome Oriental did not stir a
      muscle, merely keeping the gaze of his strange black eyes fixed upon the
      nervous cobbler. The manicurist, after one quick upward glance, continued
      her work. But in this moment of distraction she had hurt the cuticle of
      one of those delicate, slender fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormuz Khan withdrew his hand sharply from the cushion, glanced aside at
      the girl, and then, extending his hand again, pushed her away from him.
      Because of her half-kneeling posture, she almost fell, but managed to
      recover herself by clutching at the edge of a little table upon which the
      implements of her trade were spread. The table rocked and a bowl of water
      fell crashing on the carpet. His excellency spoke. His voice was very
      musical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clumsy fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have hurt me. Go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl became very white and began to gather up the articles upon the
      table. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish you to speak,&rdquo; continued the musical voice; &ldquo;only to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly collecting the remainder of the implements and placing them in
      an attache case, the manicurist hurried from the room. Her eyes were
      overbright and her lips pathetically tremulous. Ormuz Khan never glanced
      in her direction again, but resumed his disconcerting survey of Parker.
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker bumblingly began to remove the lid of the cardboard box which he
      had brought with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish you to alter the shoes you have made,&rdquo; said his excellency.
      &ldquo;I instructed you to remeasure my foot in order that you might make a pair
      to fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;Quite so, your excellency.&rdquo; And he dropped the
      box and the shoes upon the floor. &ldquo;Just a moment, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From an inner pocket he drew out a large sheet of white paper, a pencil,
      and a tape measure. &ldquo;Will you place your foot upon this sheet of paper,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ormuz Khan raised his right foot listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slipper off, please, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting,&rdquo; replied the other, never removing his gaze from Parker&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon sir, your excellency,&rdquo; muttered the bootmaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping upon one knee, he removed the furred slipper from a slender,
      arched foot, bare, of the delicate colour of ivory, and as small as a
      woman&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ivory foot was placed upon the sheet of paper, and very clumsily
      Parker drew its outline. He then took certain measurements and made a
      number of notes with a stub of thick pencil. Whenever his none too clean
      hands touched Ormuz Khan&rsquo;s delicate skin the Oriental perceptibly
      shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, sir,&rdquo; said Parker at last, &ldquo;I should really have taken your
      measurement with the sock on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wear only the finest silk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir. As you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker replaced paper, pencil, and measure, and, packing up the rejected
      shoes, made for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bootmaker!&rdquo; came the musical voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker turned. &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be ready by Monday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If possible, your excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise I shall not accept them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ormuz Khan drew a hyacinth from a vase close beside him and languidly
      waved it in dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the outer room the courteous secretary awaited Parker, and there was
      apparently no one else in the place, for the Hindu conducted him to the
      lobby and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker said &ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; and would have departed without his hat
      had not the secretary smilingly handed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, presently, the cobbler emerged from the elevator, below, he paused
      before leaving the hotel to mop his perspiring brow with a large, soiled
      handkerchief. The perfume of hyacinths seemed to have pursued him,
      bringing with it a memory of the handsome, effeminate ivory face of the
      man above. He was recalled to his senses by the voice of the impudent
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been kicked out, gov&rsquo;nor?&rdquo; the youth inquired. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the third this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; answered Parker. &ldquo;Who were the other two, lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl wot comes to do his nails. A stunnin&rsquo; bird, too. She came down
      cryin&rsquo; a few minutes ago. Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Chivers!&rdquo; cried the hall porter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking for the sack,
      and I&rsquo;m the man to get it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chivers did not appear to be vastly perturbed by this prospect, and he
      grinned agreeably at Parker as the latter made his way out into the
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any one sufficiently interested to have done so might have found matter
      for surprise had he followed that conscientious bootmaker as he left the
      hotel. He did not proceed to the shop of Mr. Jarvis, but, crossing the
      Strand, mounted a city-bound motor bus and proceeded eastward upon it as
      far as the Law Courts. Here he dismounted and plunged into that maze of
      tortuous lanes which dissects the triangle formed by Chancery Lane and
      Holborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      His step was leisurely, and once he stopped to light his pipe, peering
      with interest into the shop window of a law stationer. Finally he came to
      another little shop which had once formed part of a private house. It was
      of the lock-up variety, and upon the gauze blind which concealed the
      interior appeared the words: &ldquo;The Chancery Agency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether the Chancery Agency was a press agency, a literary or a dramatic
      agency, was not specified, but Mr. Parker was evidently well acquainted
      with the establishment, for he unlocked the door with a key which he
      carried and, entering a tiny shop, closed and locked the door behind him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was not more than ten yards square and the ceiling was very low.
      It was barely furnished as an office, but evidently Mr. Parker&rsquo;s business
      was not of a nature to detain him here. There was a second door to be
      unlocked; and beyond it appeared a flight of narrow stairs&mdash;at some
      time the servant&rsquo;s stair of the partially demolished house which had
      occupied that site in former days. Relocking this door in turn, Mr. Parker
      mounted the stair and presently found himself in a spacious and
      well-furnished bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bedroom contained an extraordinary number of wardrobes, and a big
      dressing table with wing mirrors lent a theatrical touch to the apartment.
      This was still further enhanced by the presence of all sorts of wigs,
      boxes of false hair, and other items of make-up. At the table Mr. Parker
      seated himself, and when, half an hour later, the bedroom door was opened,
      it was not Mr. Parker who crossed the book-lined study within and walked
      through to the private office where Innes was seated writing. It was Mr.
      Paul Harley.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE PURPLE STAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      For more than an hour Harley sat alone, smoking, neglectful of the routine
      duties which should have claimed his attention. His face was set and grim,
      and his expression one of total abstraction. In spirit he stood again in
      that superheated room at the Savoy. Sometimes, as he mused, he would smoke
      with unconscious vigour, surrounding himself with veritable fog banks. An
      imaginary breath of hyacinths would have reached him, to conjure up
      vividly the hateful, perfumed environment of Ormuz Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was savagely aware of a great mental disorderliness. He recognized that
      his brain remained a mere whirlpool from which Phyllis Abingdon, the
      deceased Sir Charles, Nicol Brinn, and another, alternately arose to claim
      supremacy. He clenched his teeth upon the mouthpiece of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after some time, although rebelliously, his thoughts began to marshal
      themselves in a certain definite formation. And outstanding, alone,
      removed from the ordinary, almost from the real, was the bizarre
      personality of Ormuz Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data concerning the Oriental visitor, as supplied by Inspector Wessex,
      had led him to expect quite a different type of character. Inured as Paul
      Harley was to surprise, his first sentiment as he had set eyes upon the
      man had been one of sheer amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of a dandy,&rdquo; inadequately described the repellent sensuousness
      of this veritable potentate, who could contrive to invest a sitting room
      in a modern hotel with the atmosphere of a secret Eastern household. To
      consider Ormuz Khan in connection with matters of international finance
      was wildly incongruous, while the manicurist incident indicated an
      inherent cruelty only possible in one of Oriental race.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a mood of complete mental detachment Paul Harley found himself looking
      again into those black, inscrutable eyes and trying to analyze the elusive
      quality of their regard. They were unlike any eyes that he had met with.
      It were folly to count their possessor a negligible quantity.
      Nevertheless, it was difficult, because of the fellow&rsquo;s scented
      effeminacy, to believe that women could find him attractive. But Harley,
      wise in worldly lore, perceived that the mystery surrounding Ormuz Khan
      must make a strong appeal to a certain type of female mind. He was forced
      to admit that some women, indeed many, would be as clay in the hands of
      the man who possessed those long-lashed, magnetic eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the pretty manicurist. Mortification he had read in her
      white face, and pain; but no anger. Yes, Ormuz Khan was dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what respect was he dangerous?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil Abingdon!&rdquo; Harley whispered, and, in the act of breathing the name,
      laughed at his own folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the name of reason, he mused, what could she find to interest her in a
      man of Ormuz Khan&rsquo;s type? He was prepared to learn that there was a mystic
      side to her personality&mdash;a phase in her character which would be
      responsive to the outre and romantic. But he was loath to admit that she
      could have any place in her affections for the scented devotee of
      hyacinths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as always, his musings brought him back to the same point. He
      suppressed a groan and, standing up, began to pace the room. To and fro he
      walked, before the gleaming cabinet, and presently his expression
      underwent a subtle change. His pipe had long since gone out, but he had
      failed to observe the fact. His eyes had grown unusually bright&mdash;and
      suddenly he stepped to the table and stooping made a note upon the little
      writing block.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell communicating with the outer office. Innes came in.
      &ldquo;Innes,&rdquo; he said, rapidly, &ldquo;is there anything of really first-rate
      importance with which I should deal personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the secretary, glancing at some papers which he carried,
      &ldquo;there is nothing that could not wait until to-morrow at a pinch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pinch has come,&rdquo; said Harley. &ldquo;I am going to interview the two most
      important witnesses in the Abingdon case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom do you refer, Mr. Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Innes stared rather blankly, as he made the inquiry, whereupon:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time to explain,&rdquo; continued Harley. &ldquo;But I have suddenly
      realized the importance of a seemingly trivial incident which I witnessed.
      It is these trivial incidents, Innes, which so often contain the hidden
      clue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you really think you have a clue at last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; The speaker&rsquo;s face grew grimly serious. &ldquo;Innes, if I am right, I
      shall probably proceed to one of two places: the apartments of Ormuz Khan
      or the chambers of Nicol Brinn. Listen. Remain here until I phone&mdash;whatever
      the hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I advise Wessex to stand by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley nodded. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;do so. You understand, Innes, I am engaged and
      not to be disturbed on any account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. You are going out by the private exit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Innes retired, quietly closing the door, Harley took up the telephone
      and called Sir Charles Abingdon&rsquo;s number. He was answered by a voice which
      he recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Paul Harley speaking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is that Benson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the butler. &ldquo;Good morning, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Benson. I have one or two questions to ask you, and there
      is something I want you to do for me. Miss Abingdon is out, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Benson, sadly. &ldquo;At the funeral, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Howett in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be around in about a quarter of an hour, Benson. In the meantime,
      will you be good enough to lay the dining table exactly as it was laid on
      the night of Sir Charles&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benson could be heard nervously clearing his throat, then: &ldquo;Perhaps, sir,&rdquo;
       he said, diffidently, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite understand you. Lay the table, sir,
      for dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For dinner&mdash;exactly. I want everything to be there that was present
      on the night of the tragedy; everything. Naturally you will have to place
      different flowers in the vases, but I want to see the same vases. From the
      soup tureen to the serviette rings, Benson, I wish you to duplicate the
      dinner table as I remember it, paying particular attention to the exact
      position of each article. Mrs. Howett will doubtless be able to assist you
      in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said Benson&mdash;but his voice betokened bewilderment.
      &ldquo;I will see Mrs. Howett at once, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Replacing the receiver, Harley took a bunch of keys from his pocket and,
      crossing the office, locked the door. He then retired to his private
      apartments and also locked the communicating door. A few moments later he
      came out of &ldquo;The Chancery Agency&rdquo; and proceeded in the direction of the
      Strand. Under cover of the wire-gauze curtain which veiled the window he
      had carefully inspected the scene before emerging. But although his eyes
      were keen and his sixth sense whispered &ldquo;Danger&mdash;danger!&rdquo; he had
      failed to detect anything amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      This constant conflict between intuition and tangible evidence was
      beginning to tell upon him. Either his sixth sense had begun to play
      tricks or he was the object of the most perfectly organized and efficient
      system of surveillance with which he had ever come in contact. Once, in
      the past, he had found himself pitted against the secret police of Moscow,
      and hitherto he had counted their methods incomparable. Unless he was the
      victim of an unpleasant hallucination, those Russian spies had their peers
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he alighted from a cab before the house of the late Sir Charles, Benson
      opened the door. &ldquo;We have just finished, sir,&rdquo; he said, as Harley ran up
      the steps. &ldquo;But Mrs. Howett would like to see you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Benson,&rdquo; replied Harley, handing his hat and cane to the
      butler. &ldquo;I will see her in the dining room, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benson throwing open the door, Paul Harley walked into the room which so
      often figured in his vain imaginings. The table was laid for dinner in
      accordance with his directions. The chair which he remembered to have
      occupied was in place and that in which Sir Charles had died was set at
      the head of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brows contracted, Harley stood just inside the room, looking slowly about
      him. And, as he stood so, an interrogatory cough drew his gaze to the
      doorway. He turned sharply, and there was Mrs. Howett, a pathetic little
      figure in black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mrs. Howett,&rdquo; said Harley; kindly, &ldquo;please try to forgive me for this
      unpleasant farce with its painful memories. But I have a good reason. I
      think you know this. Now, as I am naturally anxious to have everything
      clear before Miss Abingdon returns, will you be good enough to tell me if
      the table is at present set exactly as on the night that Sir Charles and I
      came in to dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;that was what I was anxious to explain.
      The table is now laid as Benson left it on that dreadful night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see. Then you, personally, made some modifications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rearranged the flowers and moved the centre vase so.&rdquo; The methodical
      old lady illustrated her words. &ldquo;I also had the dessert spoons changed.
      You remember, Benson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benson inclined his head. From a sideboard he took out two silver spoons
      which he substituted for those already set upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else, Mrs. Howett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The table is now as I left it, sir, a few minutes before your arrival.
      Just after your arrival I found Jones, the parlourmaid&mdash;a most
      incompetent, impudent girl&mdash;altering the position of the serviettes.
      At least, such was my impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the serviettes?&rdquo; murmured Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She denied it,&rdquo; continued the housekeeper, speaking with great animation;
      &ldquo;but she could give no explanation. It was the last straw. She took too
      many liberties altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Harley remained silent, the old lady ran on animatedly, but Harley was
      no longer listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not the same table linen?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, sir,&rdquo; replied Benson. &ldquo;Last week&rsquo;s linen will be at the
      laundry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has not gone yet,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Howett. &ldquo;I was making up the list
      when you brought me Mr. Harley&rsquo;s message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask you to bring the actual linen used at table on that occasion,
      Mrs. Howett?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My request must appear singular, I know, but I
      assure you it is no idle one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benson looked positively stupid, but Mrs. Howett, who had conceived a sort
      of reverence for Paul Harley, hurried away excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, Benson,&rdquo; said Harley, &ldquo;what else did you bring into the room
      after Sir Charles and I had entered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soup, sir. Here is the tureen, on the sideboard, and all the soup plates
      of the service in use that night. Of course, sir, I can&rsquo;t say which were
      the actual plates used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley inspected the plates, a set of fine old Derby ware, and gazed
      meditatively at the silver ladle. &ldquo;Did the maid, Jones, handle any of
      these?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&rdquo;&mdash;emphatically. &ldquo;She was preparing to bring the trout from
      the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I saw her in the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had brought in the fish plates, a sauce boat, and two toast racks,
      sir. She put them here, on the sideboard. But they were never brought to
      the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m. Has Jones left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. She was under notice. But after her rudeness, Mrs. Howett
      packed her off right away. She left the very next day after poor Sir
      Charles died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where has she gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a married sister, I believe, until she finds a new job. Mrs. Howett
      has the address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mrs. Howett entered, bearing a tablecloth and a number of
      serviettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the cloth,&rdquo; she said, spreading it out, &ldquo;but which of the
      serviettes were used I cannot say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to look,&rdquo; replied Paul Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one he began to inspect the serviettes, opening each in turn and
      examining it critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we here!&rdquo; he exclaimed, presently. &ldquo;Have blackberries been
      served within the week, Mrs. Howett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never had them on the table, Mr. Harley. Sir Charles&mdash;God rest
      him&mdash;said they irritated the stomach. Good gracious!&rdquo; She turned to
      Benson. &ldquo;How is it I never noticed those stains, and what can have caused
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The serviette which Paul Harley held outstretched was covered all over
      with dark purple spots.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE VEIL IS RAISED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rising from the writing table in the library, Paul Harley crossed to the
      mantelpiece and stared long and hungrily at a photograph in a silver
      frame. So closely did he concentrate upon it that he induced a sort of
      auto-hypnosis, so that Phil Abingdon seemed to smile at him sadly. Then a
      shadow appeared to obscure the piquant face. The soft outline changed,
      subtly; the lips grew more full, became voluptuous; the eyes lengthened
      and grew languorous. He found himself looking into the face of Ormuz Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; he muttered, awakened from his trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned aside, conscious of a sudden, unaccountable chill. It might have
      been caused by the mental picture which he had conjured up, or it might be
      another of those mysterious warnings of which latterly he had had so many
      without encountering any positive danger. He stood quite still, listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward he sometimes recalled that moment, and often enough asked
      himself what he had expected to hear. It was from this room, on an earlier
      occasion, that he had heard the ominous movements in the apartment above.
      To-day he heard nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benson,&rdquo; he called, opening the library door. As the man came along the
      hall: &ldquo;I have written a note to Mr. Innes, my secretary,&rdquo; he explained.
      &ldquo;There it is, on the table. When the district messenger, for whom you
      telephoned, arrives, give him the parcel and the note. He is to accept no
      other receipt than that of Mr. Innes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley took his hat and cane, and Benson opened the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; said the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, Benson,&rdquo; called Harley, hurrying out to the waiting cab.
      &ldquo;Number 236 South Lambeth Road,&rdquo; he directed the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off moved the taxi, and Harley lay back upon the cushions heaving a long
      sigh. The irksome period of inaction was ended. The cloud which for a time
      had dulled his usually keen wits was lifted. He was by no means sure that
      enlightenment had come in time, but at least he was in hot pursuit of a
      tangible clue, and he must hope that it would lead him, though tardily, to
      the heart of this labyrinth which concealed&mdash;what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Which concealed something, or someone, known and feared as Fire-Tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment he must focus upon establishing, beyond query or doubt, the
      fact that Sir Charles Abingdon had not died from natural causes.
      Premonitions, intuitions, beliefs resting upon a foundation of strange
      dreams&mdash;these were helpful to himself, if properly employed, but they
      were not legal evidence. This first point achieved, the motive of the
      crime must be sought; and then&mdash;the criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing at a time,&rdquo; Harley finally murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning his head, he glanced back at the traffic in the street behind him.
      The action was sheerly automatic. He had ceased to expect to detect the
      presence of any pursuer. Yet he was convinced that his every movement was
      closely watched. It was uncanny, unnerving, this consciousness of
      invisible surveillance. Now, as he looked, he started. The invisible had
      become the visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cab was just on the point of turning on to the slope of Vauxhall
      Bridge. And fifty yards behind, speeding along the Embankment, was a small
      French car. The features of the driver he had no time to observe. But,
      peering eagerly through the window, showed the dark face of the passenger.
      The man&rsquo;s nationality it was impossible to determine, but the keen, almost
      savage interest, betrayed by the glittering black eyes, it was equally
      impossible to mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the following car had turned on to the bridge, Harley, even yet, might
      have entertained a certain doubt. But, mentally putting himself in the
      pursuer&rsquo;s place, he imagined himself detected and knew at once exactly
      what he should do. Since this hypothetical course was actually pursued by
      the other, Harley&rsquo;s belief was confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craning his neck, he saw the little French car turn abruptly and proceed
      in the direction of Victoria Station. Instantly he acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning out of the window he thrust a ten-shilling note into the cabman&rsquo;s
      hand. &ldquo;Slow down, but don&rsquo;t pull up,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;I am going to jump out
      just as you pass that lorry ahead. Ten yards further on stop. Get down and
      crank your engine, and then proceed slowly over the bridge. I shall not
      want you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right-oh, sir,&rdquo; said the man, grinning broadly. As a result, immediately
      he was afforded the necessary cover, Harley jumped from the cab. The man
      reached back and closed the door, proceeding on his leisurely way.
      Excepting the driver of the lorry, no one witnessed this eccentric
      performance, and Harley, stepping on to the footpath, quietly joined the
      stream of pedestrians and strolled slowly along.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presently passed the stationary cab without giving any sign of
      recognition to the dismounted driver. Then, a minute later, the cab
      overtook him and was soon lost in the traffic ahead. Even as it
      disappeared another cab went by rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning forward in order to peer through the front window was the
      dark-faced man whom he had detected on the Embankment!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite correct,&rdquo; murmured Harley, dryly. &ldquo;Exactly what I should have
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spy, knowing himself discovered, had abandoned his own car in favour
      of a passing taxicab, and in the latter had taken up the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley lighted a cigarette. Oddly enough, he was aware of a feeling
      of great relief. In the first place, his sixth sense had been triumphantly
      vindicated; and, in the second place, his hitherto shadowy enemies, with
      their seemingly supernatural methods, had been unmasked. At least they
      were human, almost incredibly clever, but of no more than ordinary flesh
      and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contest had developed into open warfare. Harley&rsquo;s accurate knowledge
      of London had enabled him to locate No. 236 South Lambeth Road without
      recourse to a guide, and now, walking on past the big gas works and the
      railway station, he turned under the dark arches and pressed on to where a
      row of unprepossessing dwellings extended in uniform ugliness from a
      partly demolished building to a patch of waste ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the house was being watched he did not doubt. In fact, he no longer
      believed subterfuge to be of any avail. He was dealing with dangerously
      accomplished criminals. How clever they were he had yet to learn; and it
      was only his keen intuitive which at this juncture enabled him to score a
      point over his cunning opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked quite openly up the dilapidated steps to the door of No. 236,
      and was about to seize the dirty iron knocker when the door opened
      suddenly and a girl came out. She was dressed neatly and wore a pseudo
      fashionable hat from which a heavy figured veil depended so as almost to
      hide her features. She was carrying a bulging cane grip secured by a brown
      leather strap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Harley on the step, she paused for a moment, then, recovering
      herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen!&rdquo; she shouted down the dim passageway revealed by the opening of
      the door. &ldquo;Somebody to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the door open, she hurried past the visitor with averted face. It
      was well done, and, thus disguised by the thick veil, another man than
      Paul Harley might have failed to recognize one of whom he had never had
      more than an imperfect glimpse. But if Paul Harley&rsquo;s memory did not avail
      him greatly, his unerring instinct never failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grasped the girl&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;One moment, Miss Jones,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;it
      is you I am here to see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned angrily, snatching her arm from his grasp. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a
      mistake, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she cried, furiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you and I don&rsquo;t
      want to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be good enough to step inside again. Don&rsquo;t make a scene. If you behave
      yourself, you have nothing to fear. But I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He extended his arm to detain her. But she thrust it aside. &ldquo;My boy&rsquo;s
      waiting round the corner!&rdquo; she said, viciously. &ldquo;Just see what he&rsquo;ll do
      when I tell him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step inside,&rdquo; repeated Harley, quietly. &ldquo;Or accompany me to Kennington
      Lane Police Station&mdash;whichever you think would be the more amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean!&rdquo; blustered the girl. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kid me. I haven&rsquo;t done
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do as I tell you. You have got to answer my questions&mdash;either
      here or at the station. Which shall it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had realized the facts of the situation from the moment when the girl
      had made her sudden appearance, and he knew that his only chance of
      defeating his cunning opponents was to frighten her. Delicate measures
      would be wasted upon such a character. But even as the girl, flinging
      herself sullenly about, returned into the passage, he found himself
      admiring the resourcefulness of his unknown enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tired-looking woman carrying a child appeared from somewhere and stared
      apathetically at Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing the angry girl: &ldquo;Another o&rsquo; your flames, Polly?&rdquo; she inquired
      in a dull voice. &ldquo;Has he made you change your mind already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl addressed as &ldquo;Polly&rdquo; dropped her grip on the floor and, banging
      open a door, entered a shabby little sitting room, followed by Harley.
      Dropping onto a ragged couch, she stared obstinately out of the dirty
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, madam, for intruding,&rdquo; said Harley to the woman with the baby,
      &ldquo;but Polly has some information of use to the police. Oh, don&rsquo;t be
      alarmed. She has committed no crime. I shall only detain her for a few
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to the tired-looking woman and closed the sitting-room door.
      &ldquo;Now, young woman,&rdquo; he said, sternly, adopting this official manner of his
      friend, Inspector Wessex, &ldquo;I am going to give you one warning, and one
      only. Although I don&rsquo;t think you know it, you have got mixed up with a
      gang of crooks. Play the game with me, and I&rsquo;ll stand by you. Try any
      funny business and you&rsquo;ll go to jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The official manner had its effect. Miss Jones looked sharply across at
      the speaker. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything,&rdquo; she said, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley advanced and stood over her. &ldquo;What about the trick with the
      serviettes at Sir Charles Abingdon&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he asked, speaking the words in
      slow and deliberate fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shaft went home, but the girl possessed a stock of obstinate courage.
      &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; she inquired, but her voice had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who made you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley drew out his watch, glanced at the face, and returned the
      timepiece to his pocket. &ldquo;I have warned you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In exactly three
      minutes&rsquo; time I shall put you under arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl suddenly lifted her veil and, raising her face, looked up at him.
      At last he had broken down her obstinate resistance. Already he had noted
      the coarse, elemental formation of her hands, and now, the veil removed,
      he saw that she belonged to a type of character often found in Wales and
      closely duplicated in certain parts of London. There was a curious
      flatness of feature and prominence of upper jaw singularly reminiscent of
      the primitive Briton. Withal the girl was not unprepossessing in her
      coarse way. Utter stupidity and dogged courage are the outstanding
      characteristics of this type. But fear of the law is strong within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t arrest me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. In the first place, then, where were you going when I came here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To meet my boy at Vauxhall Station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you. What&rsquo;s he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has done murder. What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; whispered the girl, and her face blanched swiftly. &ldquo;Murder! I&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t tell you his name&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very dark man,&rdquo; continued Harley &ldquo;with black eyes. He is a
      Hindu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stared straight before her, dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; shouted Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes! He is a foreigner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Hindu?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was here five minutes ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he going to take you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He said he could put me in a good job out of London. We had
      only ten minutes to catch the train. He&rsquo;s gone to get the tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you meet him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Green Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a month ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he going to marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do to the serviettes on the night Sir Charles died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God! I didn&rsquo;t do anything to hurt him&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t do anything
      to hurt him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he called himself Sidney, did he? It isn&rsquo;t his name. But go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me to get one of the serviettes, with the ring, and to lend it
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But he brought it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The afternoon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before Sir Charles&rsquo;s death? Yes. Go on. What did he tell you to do with
      this serviette?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;was in a box. He said I was not to open the box until I put the
      serviette on the table, and that it had to be put by Sir Charles&rsquo;s plate.
      It had to be put there just before the meal began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to burn the box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night I couldn&rsquo;t see how it was to be done. Benson had laid the
      dinner table and Mrs. Howett was pottering about. Then, when I thought I
      had my chance, Sir Charles sat down in the dining room and began to read.
      He was still there and I had the box hidden in the hall stand, all ready,
      when Sidney&mdash;rang up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rang you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We had arranged it. He said he was my brother. I had to tell him I
      couldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said: &lsquo;You must.&rsquo; I told him Sir Charles was in the dining room, and
      he said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get him away. Directly he goes, don&rsquo;t fail to do what I
      told you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another &lsquo;phone call came&mdash;for Sir Charles. I knew who it was,
      because I had told Sidney about the case Sir Charles was attending in the
      square. When Sir Charles went out I changed the serviettes. Mrs. Howett
      found me in the dining room and played hell. But afterward I managed to
      burn the box in the kitchen. That&rsquo;s all I know. What harm was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harm enough!&rdquo; said Harley, grimly. &ldquo;And now&mdash;what was it that
      &lsquo;Sidney&rsquo; stole from Sir Charles&rsquo;s bureau in the study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl started and bit her lip convulsively. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t stealing,&rdquo; she
      muttered. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t worth anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me. What did he take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last time: answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Sidney who took it. I took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you stole Sir Charles&rsquo;s keys and opened his bureau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no stealing. He was out and they were lying on his dressing
      table. Sidney had told me to do it the first time I got a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had he told you to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To search through Sir Charles&rsquo;s papers and see if there was anything with
      the word &lsquo;Fire-Tongue&rsquo; in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Harley, a note of suppressed triumph in his voice. &ldquo;Go
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was only one paper about it,&rdquo; continued the girl, now speaking
      rapidly, &ldquo;or only one that I could find. I put the bureau straight again
      and took this paper to Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have read the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a bit of it. When I came to the word &lsquo;Fire-Tongue,&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t read
      any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it about&mdash;the part you did read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beginning was all about India. I couldn&rsquo;t understand it. I jumped a
      whole lot. I hadn&rsquo;t much time and I was afraid Mrs. Howett would find me.
      Then, further on, I came to &lsquo;Fire-Tongue&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did it say about &lsquo;Fire-Tongue&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make it out, sir. Oh, indeed I&rsquo;m telling you the truth! It
      seemed to me that Fire-Tongue was some sort of mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a mark Sir Charles had seen in India, and then again in London&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In London! Where in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On someone&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Tell me the name of this person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember, sir! Oh, truly I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the name mentioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it Armand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ormond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything like Ormond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not Ormuz Khan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am sure it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley&rsquo;s expression underwent a sudden change. &ldquo;Was it Brown?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. &ldquo;I believe it did begin with a B,&rdquo; she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it Brunn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I remember, sir. It was Brinn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; muttered Harley. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any one of that name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is this positively all you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my oath, it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often have you seen Sidney since your dismissal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him on the morning I left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then not again until to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he live in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He is a valet to a gentleman who lives in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once again&mdash;what is the name of the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer!&rdquo; shouted Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear, sir,&rdquo; cried the girl, beginning suddenly to sob, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t
      know! Oh, please let me go! I swear I have told you all I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley glanced at his watch, crossed the room, and opened the door.
      He turned. &ldquo;You can go now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think you will find
      Sidney waiting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It wanted only three minutes to midnight, and Innes, rather haggard and
      anxious-eyed, was pacing Paul Harley&rsquo;s private office when the &lsquo;phone bell
      rang. Eagerly he took up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; came a voice. &ldquo;That you, Innes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harley!&rdquo; cried Innes. &ldquo;Thank God you are safe! I was growing
      desperately anxious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am by no means safe, Innes! I am in one of the tightest corners of my
      life! Listen: Get Wessex! If he&rsquo;s off duty, get Burton. Tell him to bring&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&mdash;Mr. Harley!&rdquo; called Innes. &ldquo;Mr. Harley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint cry answered him. He distinctly heard the sound of a fall. Then
      the other receiver was replaced on the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful Heavens!&rdquo; whispered Innes. &ldquo;What has happened? Where was he
      speaking from? What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. NICOL BRINN HAS A VISITOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was close upon noon, but Nicol Brinn had not yet left his chambers.
      From that large window which overlooked Piccadilly he surveyed the
      prospect with dull, lack-lustre eyes. His morning attire was at least as
      tightly fitting as that which he favoured in the evening, and now, hands
      clasped behind his back and an unlighted cigar held firmly in the left
      corner of his mouth, he gazed across the park with a dreamy and vacant
      regard. One very familiar with this strange and taciturn man might have
      observed that his sallow features looked even more gaunt than usual. But
      for any trace of emotion in that stoic face the most expert physiognomist
      must have sought in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the motionless figure the Alaskan ermine and Manchurian leopards
      stared glassily across the room. The flying lemur continued apparently to
      contemplate the idea of swooping upon the head of the tigress where she
      crouched upon her near-by pedestal. The death masks grinned; the Egyptian
      priestess smiled. And Nicol Brinn, expressionless, watched the traffic in
      Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In,&rdquo; said Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoskins, his manservant, entered: &ldquo;Detective Inspector Wessex would like
      to see you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn did not turn around. &ldquo;In,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently Hoskins retired, and, following a short interval, ushered into
      the room a typical detective officer, a Scotland Yard man of the best
      type. For Detective Inspector Wessex no less an authority than Paul Harley
      had predicted a brilliant future, and since he had attained to his present
      rank while still a comparatively young man, the prophecy of the celebrated
      private investigator was likely to be realized. Nicol Brinn turned and
      bowed in the direction of a large armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray sit down, Inspector,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high, monotonous voice expressed neither surprise nor welcome, nor any
      other sentiment whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detective Inspector Wessex returned the bow, placed his bowler hat upon
      the carpet, and sat down in the armchair. Nicol Brinn seated himself upon
      a settee over which was draped a very fine piece of Persian tapestry, and
      stared at his visitor with eyes which expressed nothing but a sort of
      philosophic stupidity, but which, as a matter of fact, photographed the
      personality of the man indelibly upon that keen brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detective Inspector Wessex cleared his throat and did not appear to be
      quite at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Nicol Brinn, and proceeded to light his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the detective, frankly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a mighty awkward business,
      and I don&rsquo;t know just how to approach it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shortest way,&rdquo; drawled Nicol Brinn. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t study me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Wessex, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best. It&rsquo;s like this&rdquo;&mdash;he stared
      frankly at the impassive face: &ldquo;Where is Mr. Paul Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn gazed at the lighted end of his cigar meditatively for a
      moment and then replaced it in the right and not in the left corner of his
      mouth. Even to the trained eye of the detective inspector he seemed to be
      quite unmoved, but one who knew him well would have recognized that this
      simple action betokened suppressed excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left these chambers at ten-fifteen on Wednesday night,&rdquo; replied the
      American. &ldquo;I had never seen him before and I have never seen him since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you swear to it before a jury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to doubt my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Inspector Wessex stood up. &ldquo;Mr. Brinn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am in an
      awkward corner. I know you for a man with a fine sporting reputation, and
      therefore I don&rsquo;t doubt your word. But Mr. Paul Harley disappeared last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Nicol Brinn was moved. A second time he took the cigar from his
      mouth, gazed at the end reflectively, and then hurled the cigar across the
      room into the hearth. He stood up, walked to a window, and stared out.
      &ldquo;Just sit quiet a minute,&rdquo; came the toneless voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit me harder
      than you know. I want to think it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the tall, slim figure Detective Inspector Wessex stared
      with a sort of wonder. Mr. Nicol Brinn of Cincinnati was a conundrum which
      he found himself unable to catalogue, although in his gallery of queer
      characters were many eccentric and peculiar. If Nicol Brinn should prove
      to be crooked, then automatically he became insane. This Wessex had
      reasoned out even before he had set eyes upon the celebrated American
      traveller. His very first glimpse of Nicol Brinn had confirmed his
      reasoning, except that the cool, calm strength of the man had done much to
      upset the theory of lunacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed an interval of unbroken silence. Not even the ticking of a clock
      could be heard in that long, singularly furnished apartment. Then, as the
      detective continued to gaze upon the back of Mr. Nicol Brinn, suddenly the
      latter turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detective Inspector Wessex,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there has been a cloud hanging
      over my head for seven years. That cloud is going to burst very soon, and
      it looks as if it were going to do damage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, sir,&rdquo; replied the detective, bluntly. &ldquo;But I have
      been put in charge of the most extraordinary case that has ever come my
      way and I&rsquo;ll ask you to make yourself as clear as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do all I can,&rdquo; Nicol Brinn assured him. &ldquo;But first tell me
      something: Why have you come to me for information in respect to Mr. Paul
      Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer your question,&rdquo; said Wessex, and the fact did not escape the
      keen observing power of Nicol Brinn that the detective&rsquo;s manner had grown
      guarded. &ldquo;He informed Mr. Innes, his secretary, before setting out, that
      he was coming here to your chambers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn stared blankly at the speaker. &ldquo;He told him that? When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he was coming here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn sat down again upon the settee. &ldquo;Detective Inspector,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;I give you my word of honour as a gentleman that I last saw Mr. Paul
      Harley at ten-fifteen on Wednesday night. Since then, not only have I not
      seen him, but I have received no communication from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The keen glance of the detective met and challenged the dull glance of the
      speaker. &ldquo;I accept your word, sir,&rdquo; said Wessex, finally, and he sighed
      and scratched his chin in the manner of a man hopelessly puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell again. The muted sounds of Piccadilly became audible in the
      stillness. Cabs and cars rolled by below, their occupants all unaware of
      the fact that in that long, museum-like room above their heads lay the key
      to a tragedy and the clue to a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, sir,&rdquo; said the detective, suddenly, &ldquo;the result of Mr. Paul
      Harley&rsquo;s investigations right up to date has been placed in my hands,
      together with all his notes. I wonder if you realize the fact that,
      supposing Mr. Harley does not return, I am in repossession of sufficient
      evidence to justify me in putting you under arrest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see your point quite clearly,&rdquo; replied Nicol Brinn. &ldquo;I have seen my
      danger since the evening that Mr. Paul Harley walked into this room: but
      I&rsquo;ll confess I did not anticipate this particular development.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get right down to business,&rdquo; said Wessex, &ldquo;if Mr. Paul Harley did not
      come here, where, in your idea, did he go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn considered the speaker meditatively. &ldquo;If I knew that,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;maybe I could help. I told him here in this very room that the pair
      of us were walking on the edge of hell. I don&rsquo;t like to say it, and you
      don&rsquo;t know all it means, but in my opinion he has taken a step too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Inspector Wessex stood up impatiently. &ldquo;You have already talked
      in that strain to Mr. Harley,&rdquo; he said, a bit brusquely. &ldquo;Mr. Innes has
      reported something of the conversation to me. But I must ask you to
      remember that, whereas Mr. Paul Harley is an unofficial investigator, I am
      an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department, and figures of speech
      are of no use to me. I want facts. I want plain speaking. I ask you for
      help and you answer in parables. Now perhaps I am saying too much, and
      perhaps I am not, but that Mr. Harley was right in what he believed, the
      circumstances of his present disappearance go to prove. He learned too
      much about something called Fire-Tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wessex spoke the word challengingly, staring straight into the eyes of
      Nicol Brinn, but the latter gave no sign, and Wessex, concealing his
      disappointment, continued: &ldquo;You know more about Fire-Tongue than you ever
      told Mr. Paul Harley. All you know I have got to know. Mr. Harley has been
      kidnapped, perhaps done to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say so?&rdquo; asked Nicol Brinn, rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know it is so. It does not matter how I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certain that his absence is not voluntary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have definite evidence to that effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to be frank with me, Detective Inspector, but I&rsquo;ll be
      as frank with you as I can be. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea in the world
      where Mr. Harley is. But I have information which, if I knew where he was,
      would quite possibly enable me to rescue him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided he is alive!&rdquo; added Wessex, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What leads you to suppose that he is not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is alive, he is a prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Nicol Brinn in a low voice. &ldquo;It has come.&rdquo; He took a step
      toward the detective. &ldquo;Mr. Wessex,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell you to do
      whatever your duty indicates; I know you will do it. But in the interests
      of everybody concerned I have a request to make. Have me watched if you
      like&mdash;I suppose that&rsquo;s automatic. But whatever happens, and wherever
      your suspicions point, give me twenty-four hours. As I think you can see,
      I am a man who thinks slowly, but moves with a rush. You can believe me or
      not, but I am even more anxious than you are to see this thing through.
      You think I know what lies back of it all, and I don&rsquo;t say that you are
      not right. But one thing you don&rsquo;t know, and that thing I can&rsquo;t tell you.
      In twenty-four hours I might be able to tell you. Whatever happens, even
      if poor Harley is found dead, don&rsquo;t hamper my movements between now and
      this time tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wessex, who had been watching the speaker intently, suddenly held out his
      hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bet!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my case, and I&rsquo;ll conduct it in my own
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wessex,&rdquo; replied Nicol Brinn, taking the extended hand, &ldquo;I think you
      are a clever man. There are questions you would like to ask me, and there
      are questions I would like to ask you. But we both realize the facts of
      the situation, and we are both silent. One thing I&rsquo;ll say: You are in the
      deadliest peril you have ever known. Be careful. Believe me I mean it. Be
      very careful.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. WESSEX GETS BUSY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Innes rose from the chair usually occupied by Paul Harley as Detective
      Inspector Wessex, with a very blank face, walked into the office. Innes
      looked haggard and exhibited unmistakable signs of anxiety. Since he had
      received that dramatic telephone message from his chief he had not spared
      himself for a moment. The official machinery of Scotland Yard was at work
      endeavouring to trace the missing man, but since it had proved impossible
      to find out from where the message had been sent, the investigation was
      handicapped at the very outset. Close inquiries at the Savoy Hotel had
      shown that Harley had not been there. Wessex, who was a thorough artist
      within his limitations, had satisfied himself that none of the callers who
      had asked for Ormuz Khan, and no one who had loitered about the lobbies,
      could possibly have been even a disguised Paul Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Inspector Wessex the lines along which Paul Harley was operating
      remained a matter of profound amazement and mystification. His interview
      with Mr. Nicol Brinn had only served to baffle him more hopelessly than
      ever. The nature of Paul Harley&rsquo;s inquiries&mdash;inquiries which,
      presumably from the death of Sir Charles Abingdon, had led him to
      investigate the movements of two persons of international repute, neither
      apparently having even the most remote connection with anything crooked&mdash;was
      a conundrum for the answer to which the detective inspector sought in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see you have no news,&rdquo; said Innes, dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be perfectly honest,&rdquo; replied Wessex, &ldquo;I feel like a man who is
      walking in his sleep. Except for the extraordinary words uttered by the
      late Sir Charles Abingdon, I fail to see that there is any possible
      connection between his death and Mr. Nicol Brinn. I simply can&rsquo;t fathom
      what Mr. Harley was working upon. To my mind there is not the slightest
      evidence of foul play in the case. There is no motive; apart from which,
      there is absolutely no link.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; replied Innes, slowly, &ldquo;you know the chief, and therefore
      you know as well as I do that he would not have instructed me to
      communicate with you unless he had definite evidence in his possession. It
      is perfectly clear that he was interrupted in the act of telephoning. He
      was literally dragged away from the instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; said Wessex. &ldquo;He had got into a tight corner somewhere right
      enough. But where does Nicol Brinn come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he receive your communication?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it took him fairly between the eyes. There is no denying that. He
      knows something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he knows,&rdquo; said Innes, slowly, &ldquo;is what Mr. Harley learned last
      night, and what he fears is what has actually befallen the chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Inspector Wessex stood beside the Burmese cabinet, restlessly
      drumming his fingers upon its lacquered surface. &ldquo;I am grateful for one
      thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The press has not got hold of this story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They need never get hold of it if you are moderately careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For several reasons I am going to be more than moderately careful.
      Whatever Fire-Tongue may be, its other name is sudden death! It&rsquo;s a devil
      of a business; a perfect nightmare. But&mdash;&rdquo; he paused&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wondering what on earth induced Mr. Harley to send that parcel of
      linen to the analyst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The result of the analysis may prove that the chief was not engaged upon
      any wild-goose chase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; Wessex sprang up, his eyes brightened, and he reached for
      his hat, &ldquo;that gives me an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The message with the parcel was written upon paper bearing the letterhead
      of the late Sir Charles Abingdon. So Mr. Harley evidently made his first
      call there! I&rsquo;m off, sir! The trail starts from that house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Innes seated at the big table with an expression of despair upon
      his face, Detective Inspector Wessex set out. He blamed himself for
      wasting time upon the obvious, for concentrating too closely upon the clue
      given by Harley&rsquo;s last words to Innes before leaving the office in
      Chancery Lane. It was poor workmanship. He had hoped to take a short cut,
      and it had proved, as usual, to be a long one. Now, as he sat in a laggard
      cab feeling that every minute wasted might be a matter of life and death,
      he suddenly became conscious of personal anxiety. He was a courageous,
      indeed a fearless, man, and he was subconsciously surprised to find
      himself repeating the words of Nicol Brinn: &ldquo;Be careful&mdash;be very
      careful!&rdquo; With all the ardour of the professional, he longed to find a
      clue which should lead him to the heart of the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Innes had frankly outlined the whole of Paul Harley&rsquo;s case to date, and
      Detective Inspector Wessex, although he had not admitted the fact, had
      nevertheless recognized that from start to finish the thing did not offer
      one single line of inquiry which he would have been capable of following
      up. That Paul Harley had found material to work upon, had somehow picked
      up a definite clue from this cloudy maze, earned the envious admiration of
      the Scotland Yard man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at his destination, he asked to see Miss Abingdon, and was shown
      by the butler into a charmingly furnished little sitting room which was
      deeply impressed with the personality of its dainty owner. It was
      essentially and delightfully feminine. Yet in the decorations and in the
      arrangement of the furniture there was a note of independence which was
      almost a note of defiance. Phyllis Abingdon, an appealingly pathetic
      figure in her black dress, rose to greet the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; he said, kindly. &ldquo;My visit does not
      concern you personally in any way, but I thought perhaps you might be able
      to help me trace Mr. Paul Harley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wessex had thus expressed himself with the best intentions, but even
      before the words were fully spoken he realized with a sort of shock that
      he could not well have made a worse opening. Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s eyes seemed
      to grow alarmingly large. She stood quite still, twisting his card between
      her supple fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harley!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not want to alarm you,&rdquo; said the detective, guiltily, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped, at a loss for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has something happened to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry if I have alarmed you,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;but there is some
      doubt respecting Mr. Harley&rsquo;s present whereabouts. Have you any idea where
      he went when he left this house yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. I know where he went, quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benson, the butler, told me all about it when I came in.&rdquo; Phil Abingdon
      spoke excitedly, and took a step nearer Wessex. &ldquo;He went to call upon
      Jones, our late parlourmaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Late parlourmaid?&rdquo; echoed Wessex, uncomprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He seemed to think he had made a discovery of importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something to do with a parcel which he sent away from here to the
      analyst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I have been wondering whatever it could be. In fact, I rang up his
      office this morning, but learned that he was out. It was a serviette which
      he took away. Did you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did know it, Miss Abingdon. I called upon the analyst. I understand you
      were out when Mr. Harley came. May I ask who interviewed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saw Benson and Mrs. Howett, the housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I also see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with pleasure. But please tell me&rdquo;&mdash;Phil Abingdon looked up at
      him pleadingly&mdash;&ldquo;do you think something&mdash;something dreadful has
      happened to Mr. Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself unduly,&rdquo; said Wessex. &ldquo;I hope before the day is over
      to be in touch with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, he had no such hope. It was a lie intended to console
      the girl, to whom the news of Harley&rsquo;s disappearance seemed to have come
      as a terrible blow. More and more Wessex found himself to be groping in
      the dark. And when, in response to the ringing of the bell, Benson came in
      and repeated what had taken place on the previous day, the detective&rsquo;s
      state of mystification grew even more profound. As a matter of routine
      rather than with any hope of learning anything useful, he interviewed Mrs.
      Howett; but the statement of the voluble old lady gave no clue which
      Wessex could perceive to possess the slightest value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both witnesses having been dismissed, he turned again to Phil Abingdon,
      who had been sitting watching him with a pathetic light of hope in her
      eyes throughout his examination of the butler and Mrs. Howett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next step is clear enough,&rdquo; he said, brightly. &ldquo;I am off to South
      Lambeth Road. The woman Jones is the link we are looking for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the link with what, Mr. Wessex?&rdquo; asked Phil Abingdon. &ldquo;What is it all
      about?&mdash;what does it all mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The link with Mr. Paul Harley,&rdquo; replied Wessex. He moved toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you tell me something more before you go?&rdquo; said the girl,
      beseechingly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;feel responsible if anything has happened
      to Mr. Harley. Please be frank with me. Are you afraid he is&mdash;in
      danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, miss,&rdquo; replied the detective, haltingly, &ldquo;he rang up his secretary,
      Mr. Innes, last night&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know where from&mdash;and admitted
      that he was in a rather tight corner. I don&rsquo;t believe for a moment that he
      is in actual danger, but he probably has&mdash;&rdquo; again he hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;good
      reasons of his own for remaining absent at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon looked at him doubtingly. &ldquo;I am almost afraid to ask you,&rdquo;
       she said in a low voice, &ldquo;but&mdash;if you hear anything, will you ring me
      up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chartering a more promising-looking cab than that in which he had come,
      Detective Inspector Wessex proceeded to 236 South Lambeth Road. He had
      knocked several times before the door was opened by the woman to whom the
      girl Jones had called on the occasion of Harley&rsquo;s visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a police officer,&rdquo; said the detective inspector, &ldquo;and I have called
      to see a woman named Jones, formerly in the employ of Sir Charles
      Abingdon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polly&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; was the toneless reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? Gone where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went away last night to a job in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember the time. Just after a gentleman had called here to see
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone from the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She seemed to be very frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you present when he interviewed her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After he had gone, what did Polly do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sat and cried for about half an hour, then Sidney came for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her boy&mdash;the latest one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Describe Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dark fellow, foreign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;French&mdash;German?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. A sort of Indian, like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indian?&rdquo; snapped Wessex. &ldquo;What do you mean by Indian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very dark,&rdquo; replied the woman without emotion, swinging a baby she held
      to and fro in a methodical way which the detective found highly
      irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean a native of India?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I should think so. I never noticed him much. Polly has so many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has she known this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a month or so, but she is crazy about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when he came last night she went away with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She was all ready to go before the other gentleman called. He must
      have told her something which made her think it was all off, and she was
      crazy with joy when Sidney turned up. She had all her things packed, and
      off she went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Experience had taught Detective Inspector Wessex to recognize the truth
      when he met it, and he did not doubt the statement of the woman with the
      baby. &ldquo;Can you give me any idea where this man Sidney came from?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the listless voice. &ldquo;He was in the service
      of some gentleman in the country; that&rsquo;s all I know about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Polly leave no address to which letters were to be forwarded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she said she would write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One other point,&rdquo; said Wessex, and he looked hard into the woman&rsquo;s face:
      &ldquo;What do you know about Fire-Tongue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by a stare of blank stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard you, but I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quick decisions are required from every member of the Criminal
      Investigation Department, and Detective Inspector Wessex came to one now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do for the present,&rdquo; he said, turned, and ran down the steps to
      the waiting cab.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. NAIDA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dusk was falling that evening. Gaily lighted cars offering glimpses of
      women in elaborate toilets and of their black-coated and white-shirted
      cavaliers thronged Piccadilly, bound for theatre or restaurant. The
      workaday shutters were pulled down, and the night life of London had
      commenced. The West End was in possession of an army of pleasure seekers,
      but Nicol Brinn was not among their ranks. Wearing his tightly-buttoned
      dinner jacket, he stood, hands clasped behind him, staring out of the
      window as Detective Inspector Wessex had found him at noon. Only one who
      knew him very well could have detected the fact that anxiety was written
      upon that Sioux-like face. His gaze seemed to be directed, not so much
      upon the fading prospect of the park, as downward, upon the moving
      multitude in the street below. Came a subdued knocking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In,&rdquo; said Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoskins, the neat manservant, entered. &ldquo;A lady to see you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn turned in a flash. For one fleeting instant the dynamic force
      beneath the placid surface exhibited itself in every line of his gaunt
      face. He was transfigured; he was a man of monstrous energy, of tremendous
      enthusiasm. Then the enthusiasm vanished. He was a creature of stone
      again; the familiar and taciturn Nicol Brinn, known and puzzled over in
      the club lands of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, a foreign lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hoskins having retired, and having silently closed the door, Nicol Brinn
      did an extraordinary thing, a thing which none of his friends in London,
      Paris, or New York would ever have supposed him capable of doing. He
      raised his clenched hands. &ldquo;Please God she has come,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Dare
      I believe it? Dare I believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened again, and Hoskins, standing just inside, announced:
      &ldquo;The lady to see you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped aside and bowed as a tall, slender woman entered the room. She
      wore a long wrap trimmed with fur, the collar turned up about her face.
      Three steps forward she took and stopped. Hoskins withdrew and closed the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that, while Nicol Brinn watched her with completely transfigured
      features, the woman allowed the cloak to slip from her shoulders, and,
      raising her head, extended both her hands, uttering a subdued cry of
      greeting that was almost a sob. She was dark, with the darkness of the
      East, but beautiful with a beauty that was tragic. Her eyes were glorious
      wells of sadness, seeming to mirror a soul that had known a hundred ages.
      Withal she had the figure of a girl, slender and supple, possessing the
      poetic grace and poetry of movement born only in the Orient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naida!&rdquo; breathed Nicol Brinn, huskily. &ldquo;Naida!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His high voice had softened, had grown tremulous. He extended his hands
      with a groping movement The woman laughed shudderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cloak lying forgotten upon the carpet, she advanced toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a robe that was distinctly Oriental without being in the
      slightest degree barbaric. Her skin was strangely fair, and jewels
      sparkled upon her fingers. She conjured up dreams of the perfumed luxury
      of the East, and was a figure to fire the imagination. But Nicol Brinn
      seemed incapable of movement; his body was inert, but his eyes were on
      fire. Into the woman&rsquo;s face had come anxiety that was purely feminine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my big American sweetheart,&rdquo; she whispered, and, approaching him with
      a sort of timidity, laid her little hands upon his arm. &ldquo;Do you still
      think I am beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No man could have recognized the voice of Nicol Brinn. Suddenly his arms
      were about her like bands of iron, and with a long, wondering sigh she lay
      back looking up into his face, while he gazed hungrily into her eyes. His
      lips had almost met hers when softly, almost inaudibly, she sighed:
      &ldquo;Nicol!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pronounced the name queerly, giving to i the value of ee, and almost
      dropping the last letter entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their lips met, and for a moment they clung together, this woman of the
      East and man of the West, in utter transgression of that law which
      England&rsquo;s poet has laid down. It was a reunion speaking of a love so deep
      as to be sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifting the woman in his arms lightly as a baby, he carried her to the
      settee between the two high windows and placed her there amid Oriental
      cushions, where she looked like an Eastern queen. He knelt at her feet
      and, holding both her hands, looked into her face with that wondering
      expression in which there was something incredulous and something
      sorrowful; a look of great and selfless tenderness. The face of Naida was
      lighted up, and her big eyes filled with tears. Disengaging one of her
      jewelled hands, she ruffled Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Nicol,&rdquo; she said, tenderly. &ldquo;Have I changed so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her accent was quaint and fascinating, but her voice was very musical. To
      the man who knelt at her feet it was the sweetest music in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naida,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Naida. Even yet I dare not believe that you are
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew I would come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was I to know that you would see my message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her closed left hand and smoothed out a scrap of torn paper
      which she held there. It was from the &ldquo;Agony&rdquo; column of that day&rsquo;s Times.
    </p>
    <p>
      N. November 23, 1913. N. B. See Telephone Directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you long, long ago that I would come if ever you wanted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long, long ago,&rdquo; echoed Nicol Brinn. &ldquo;To me it has seemed a century;
      to-night it seems a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her with a deep and tireless content. Presently her eyes fell.
      &ldquo;Sit here beside me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have not long to be here. Put your arms
      round me. I have something to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself beside her on the settee, and held her close. &ldquo;My
      Naida!&rdquo; he breathed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, no!&rdquo; she entreated. &ldquo;Do you want to break my heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly released her, clenched his big hands, and stared down at the
      carpet. &ldquo;You have broken mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impulsively Naida threw her arms around his neck, coiling herself up
      lithely and characteristically beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My big sweetheart,&rdquo; she whispered, crooningly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said it. It is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning, fiercely he seized her. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you go!&rdquo; he cried, and there
      was a strange light in his eyes. &ldquo;Before I was helpless, now I am not.
      This time you have come to me, and you shall stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank away from him terrified, wild-eyed. &ldquo;Oh, you forget, you
      forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For seven years I have tried to forget. I have been mad, but to-night I
      am sane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trusted you, I trusted you!&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn clenched his teeth grimly for a moment, and then, holding her
      averted face very close to his own, he began to speak in a low, monotonous
      voice. &ldquo;For seven years,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have tried to die, because without
      you I did not care to live. I have gone into the bad lands of the world
      and into the worst spots of those bad lands. Night and day your eyes have
      watched me, and I have wakened from dreams of your kisses and gone out to
      court murder. I have earned the reputation of being something more than
      human, but I am not. I had everything that life could give me except you.
      Now I have got you, and I am going to keep you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naida began to weep silently. The low, even voice of Nicol Brinn ceased.
      He could feel her quivering in his grasp; and, as she sobbed, slowly,
      slowly the fierce light faded from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naida, my Naida, forgive me,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her face, looking up to him pathetically. &ldquo;I came to you, I
      came to you,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I promised long ago that I would come. What use
      is it, all this? You know, you know! Kill me if you like. How often have I
      asked you to kill me. It would be sweet to die in your arms. But what use
      to talk so? You are in great danger or you would not have asked me to
      come. If you don&rsquo;t know it, I tell you&mdash;you are in great danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn released her, stood up, and began slowly to pace about the
      room. He deliberately averted his gaze from the settee. &ldquo;Something has
      happened,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;which has changed everything. Because you are here I
      know that&mdash;someone else is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by a shuddering sigh, but he did not glance in the
      direction of the settee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In India I respected what you told me. Because you were strong, I loved
      you the more. Here in England I can no longer respect the accomplice of
      assassins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assassins? What, is this something new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a man&rsquo;s religion, however bloodthirsty it may be, I don&rsquo;t quarrel so
      long as he sincerely believes in it. But for private assassination I have
      no time and no sympathy.&rdquo; It was the old Nicol Brinn who was speaking,
      coldly and incisively. &ldquo;That&mdash;something we both know about ever moved
      away from those Indian hills was a possibility I had never considered.
      When it was suddenly brought home to me that you, you, might be here in
      London, I almost went mad. But the thing that made me realize it was a
      horrible thing, a black, dastardly thing. See here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and crossed to where the woman was crouching, watching him with
      wide-open, fearful eyes. He took both her hands and looked grimly into her
      face. &ldquo;For seven years I have walked around with a silent tongue and a
      broken heart. All that is finished. I am going to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, no!&rdquo; She was on her feet, her face a mask of tragedy. &ldquo;You swore
      to me, you swore to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No oath holds good in the face of murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that why you bring me here? Is that what your message means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My message means that because of&mdash;the thing you know about&mdash;I
      am suspected of the murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I, I! Good God! when I realize what your presence here means, I wish
      more than ever that I had succeeded in finding death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; came a soft, pleading voice. &ldquo;What can I do? What
      do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to release me from that vow made seven years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naida uttered a stifled cry. &ldquo;How is it possible? You understand that it
      is not possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn seized her by the shoulders. &ldquo;Is it possible for me to remain
      silent while men are murdered here in a civilized country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; moaned Naida, &ldquo;what can I do, what can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me permission to speak and stay here. Leave the rest to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I cannot stay, my Nicol,&rdquo; she replied, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said with deliberate slowness, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let me go. Already I have been here too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw his arms around her and crushed her against him fiercely. &ldquo;Never
      again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Never again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her little hands against his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Oh, listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall listen to nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must&mdash;you must! I want to make you understand something.
      This morning I see your note in the papers. Every day, every day for seven
      whole long years, wherever I have been, I have looked. In the papers of
      India. Sometimes in the papers of France, of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never even dreamed that you left India,&rdquo; said Nicol Brinn, hoarsely.
      &ldquo;It was through the Times of India that I said I would communicate with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once we never left India. Now we do&mdash;sometimes. But listen. I
      prepared to come when&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s clasp of Naida tightened cruelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you hurt me!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Please let me speak. He gave me your name
      and told me to bring you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn dropped his arms and stood, as a man amazed, watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night there was a meeting outside London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me to believe there are English members?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There are. Many. But let me go on. Somehow&mdash;somehow I don&rsquo;t
      understand&mdash;he finds you are one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are not present last night! Now, do you understand? So he sends
      me to tell you that a car will be waiting at nine o&rsquo;clock to-night outside
      the Cavalry Club. The driver will be a Hindu. You know what to say. Oh, my
      Nicol, my Nicol, go for my sake! You know it all! You are clever. You can
      pretend. You can explain you had no call. If you refuse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn nodded grimly. &ldquo;I understand! But, good God! How has he found
      out? How has he found out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; moaned Naida. &ldquo;Oh, I am frightened&mdash;so frightened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A discreet rap sounded upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn crossed and stood, hands clasped behind him, before the
      mantelpiece. &ldquo;In,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoskins entered. &ldquo;Detective Sergeant Stokes wishes to see you at once,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinn drew a watch from his waistcoat pocket. Attached to it was a fob
      from which depended a little Chinese Buddha. He consulted the timepiece
      and returned it to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight-twenty-five,&rdquo; he muttered, and glanced across to where Naida,
      wide-eyed, watched him. &ldquo;Admit Detective Sergeant Stokes at
      eight-twenty-six, and then lock the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hoskins retired imperturbably.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. NICOL BRINN GOES OUT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Detective Sergeant Stokes was a big, dark, florid man, the word
      &ldquo;constable&rdquo; written all over him. Indeed, as Wessex had complained more
      than once, the mere sound of Stokes&rsquo;s footsteps was a danger signal for
      any crook. His respect for his immediate superior, the detective
      inspector, was not great. The methods of Wessex savoured too much of the
      French school to appeal to one of Stokes&rsquo;s temperament and outlook upon
      life, especially upon that phase of life which comes within the province
      of the criminal investigator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wessex&rsquo;s instructions with regard to Nicol Brinn had been succinct: &ldquo;Watch
      Mr. Brinn&rsquo;s chambers, make a note of all his visitors, but take no
      definite steps respecting him personally without consulting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armed with these instructions, the detective sergeant had undertaken his
      duties, which had proved more or less tedious up to the time that a
      fashionably attired woman of striking but unusual appearance had inquired
      of the hall porter upon which floor Mr. Nicol Brinn resided.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her manner the detective sergeant had perceived something furtive.
      There was a hunted look in her eyes, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at the end of some fifteen or twenty minutes, she failed to
      reappear, he determined to take the initiative himself. By intruding upon
      this prolonged conference he hoped to learn something of value. Truth to
      tell, he was no master of finesse, and had but recently been promoted from
      an East End district where prompt physical action was of more value than
      subtlety.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, then, he presently found himself in the presence of the
      immovable Hoskins; and having caused his name to be announced, he was
      requested to wait in the lobby for one minute. Exactly one minute had
      elapsed when he was shown into that long, lofty room, which of late had
      been the scene of strange happenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn was standing before the fireplace, hands clasped behind him,
      and a long cigar protruding from the left corner of his mouth. No one else
      was present, so far as the detective could see, but he glanced rapidly
      about the room in a way which told the man who was watching that he had
      expected to find another present. He looked into the unfathomable, light
      blue eyes of Nicol Brinn, and became conscious of a certain mental
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, sir,&rdquo; he said, awkwardly. &ldquo;I am acting in the case
      concerning the disappearance of Mr. Paul Harley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been instructed to keep an eye on these chambers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated the high voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir&rdquo;&mdash;again he glanced rapidly about-&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to intrude
      more than necessary, but a lady came in here about half an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drawled Brinn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; declared the detective sergeant. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t troubling you
      too much, I should like to know that lady&rsquo;s name. Also, I should like a
      chat with her before she leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; declared Nicol Brinn. &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say. She went some time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stokes stood squarely before Nicol Brinn&mdash;a big, menacing figure; but
      he could not detect the slightest shadow of expression upon the other&rsquo;s
      impassive features. He began to grow angry. He was of that sanguine
      temperament which in anger acts hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, sir,&rdquo; he said, and his dark face flushed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t play
      tricks on me. I&rsquo;ve got my duty to do, and I am going to do it. Ask your
      visitor to step in here, or I shall search the premises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn replaced his cigar in the right corner of his mouth:
      &ldquo;Detective Sergeant Stokes, I give you my word that the lady to whom you
      refer is no longer in these chambers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stokes glared at him angrily. &ldquo;But there is no other way out,&rdquo; he
      blustered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not deal with this matter further,&rdquo; declared Brinn, coldly. &ldquo;I
      may have vices, but I never was a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; muttered the detective sergeant, taken aback by the cold
      incisiveness of the speaker. &ldquo;Then perhaps you will lead the way, as I
      should like to take a look around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn spread his feet more widely upon the hearthrug. &ldquo;Detective
      Sergeant Stokes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are not playing the game. Inspector Wessex
      passed his word to me that for twenty-four hours my movements should not
      be questioned or interfered with. How is it that I find you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stokes thrust his hands in his pockets and coughed uneasily. &ldquo;I am not a
      machine,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and I do my own job in my own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if Inspector Wessex would approve of your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, but it is no affair of yours to interfere with private affairs of
      mine, Detective Sergeant. See here, there is no lady in these chambers.
      Secondly, I have an appointment at nine o&rsquo;clock, and you are detaining
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; answered Stokes, who had now quite lost his temper, &ldquo;I
      intend to go on detaining you until I have searched these chambers and
      searched them thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn glanced at his watch. &ldquo;If I leave in five minutes, I&rsquo;ll be in
      good time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crossing to the centre section of a massive bookcase, he opened it, and it
      proved to be a door. So cunning was the design that the closest scrutiny
      must have failed to detect any difference between the dummy books with
      which it was decorated, and the authentic works which filled the shelves
      to right and to left of it. Within was a small and cosy study. In contrast
      with the museum-like room out of which it opened, it was furnished in a
      severely simple fashion, and one more experienced in the study of complex
      humanity than Detective Sergeant Stokes must have perceived that here the
      real Nicol Brinn spent his leisure hours. Above the mantel was a
      life-sized oil painting of Mrs. Nicolas Brinn; and whereas the great room
      overlooking Piccadilly was exotic to a degree, the atmosphere of the study
      was markedly American.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palpably there was no one there. Nor did the two bedrooms, the kitchen,
      and the lobby afford any more satisfactory evidence. Nicol Brinn led the
      way back from the lobby, through the small study, and into the famous room
      where the Egyptian priestess smiled eternally. He resumed his place upon
      the hearthrug. &ldquo;Are you satisfied, Detective Sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am!&rdquo; Stokes spoke angrily. &ldquo;While you kept me talking, she slipped out
      through that study, and down into the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, the whole business looks very suspicious to me,&rdquo; continued the
      detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; drawled Brinn, again consulting his watch. &ldquo;The five minutes are
      up. I must be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until I have spoken to Scotland Yard, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to speak to Scotland Yard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Stokes, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn strode to the telephone, which stood upon a small table almost
      immediately in front of the bookcase. The masked door remained ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite fixed upon detaining me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Stokes, watching him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one long stride Brinn was through the doorway, telephone in hand!
      Before Stokes had time to move, the door closed violently, in order, no
      doubt, to make it shut over the telephone cable which lay under it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Detective Sergeant Stokes fell back, gazed wildly at the false books for a
      moment, and then, turning, leaped to the outer door. It was locked!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Nicol Brinn, having secured the door which communicated
      with the study, walked out into the lobby where Hoskins was seated.
      Hoskins stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady went, Hoskins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn withdrew the key from the door of the room in which Detective
      Sergeant Stokes was confined. Stokes began banging wildly upon the panels
      from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That row will continue,&rdquo; Nicol Brinn said, coldly; &ldquo;perhaps he will shout
      murder from one of the windows. You have only to say you had no key. I am
      going out now. The light coat, Hoskins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hoskins unemotionally handed coat, hat, and cane to his master and,
      opening the front door, stood aside. The sound of a window being raised
      became audible from within the locked room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; added Nicol Brinn, &ldquo;you will be arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said Hoskins. &ldquo;Good-night, sir...&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. WHAT HAPPENED TO HARLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some two hours after Paul Harley&rsquo;s examination of Jones, the
      ex-parlourmaid, a shabby street hawker appeared in the Strand, bearing a
      tray containing copies of &ldquo;Old Moore&rsquo;s Almanac.&rdquo; He was an ugly-looking
      fellow with a split lip, and appeared to have neglected to shave for at
      least a week. Nobody appeared to be particularly interested, and during
      his slow progression from Wellington Street to the Savoy Hotel he smoked
      cigarettes almost continuously. Trade was far from brisk, and the vendor
      of prophecies filled in his spare time by opening car doors, for which
      menial service he collected one three-penny bit and several sixpences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This commercial optimist was still haunting the courtyard of the hotel at
      a time when a very handsome limousine pulled up beside the curb and a
      sprucely attired Hindu stepped out. One who had been in the apartments of
      Ormuz Khan must have recognized his excellency&rsquo;s private secretary.
      Turning to the chauffeur, a half-caste of some kind, and ignoring the
      presence of the prophet who had generously opened the door, &ldquo;You will
      return at eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said, speaking perfect and cultured English,
      &ldquo;to take his excellency to High Claybury. Make a note, now, as I shall be
      very busy, reminding me to call at Lower Claybury station for a parcel
      which will be awaiting me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the chauffeur, and he touched his cap as the Hindu
      walked into the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salesman reclosed the door of the car, and spat reflectively upon the
      pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limping wearily, he worked his way along in the direction of Chancery
      Lane. But, before reaching Chancery Lane, he plunged into a maze of courts
      with which he was evidently well acquainted. His bookselling enterprise
      presently terminated, as it had commenced, at The Chancery Agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more safe in his dressing room, the pedler rapidly transformed
      himself into Paul Harley, and Paul Harley, laying his watch upon the table
      before him, lighted his pipe and indulged in half an hour&rsquo;s close
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      His again electing to focus his attention upon Ormuz Khan was this time
      beyond reproach. It was the course which logic dictated. Until he had
      attempted the task earlier in the day, he could not have supposed it so
      difficult to trace the country address of a well-known figure like that of
      the Persian.
    </p>
    <p>
      This address he had determined to learn, and, having learned it, was also
      determined to inspect the premises. But for such a stroke of good luck as
      that which had befallen him at the Savoy, he could scarcely have hoped.
      His course now lay clearly before him. And presently, laying his pipe
      aside, he took up a telephone which stood upon the dressing table and rang
      up a garage with which he had an account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, is that you, Mason?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have the racer to meet me at seven
      o&rsquo;clock, half-way along Pall Mall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never for a moment did he relax his vigilance. Observing every precaution
      when he left The Chancery Agency, he spent the intervening time at one of
      his clubs, from which, having made an early dinner, he set off for Pall
      Mall at ten minutes to seven. A rakish-looking gray car resembling a giant
      torpedo was approaching slowly from the direction of Buckingham Palace.
      The driver pulled up as Paul Harley stepped into the road, and following a
      brief conversation Harley set out westward, performing a detour before
      heading south for Lower Claybury, a little town with which he was only
      slightly acquainted. No evidence of espionage could he detect, but the
      note of danger spoke intimately to his inner consciousness; so that when,
      the metropolis left behind, he found himself in the hilly Surrey
      countryside, more than once he pulled up, sitting silent for a while and
      listening intently. He failed, always, to detect any sign of pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was tropically brilliant, hot, and still, but saving the distant
      murmur of the city, and ordinary comings and goings along the country
      roads, there was nothing to account for a growing anxiety of which he
      became conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in gunshot of Old Claybury church tower, when the sight of a
      haystack immediately inside a meadow gate suggested a likely hiding place
      for the racer; and, having run the car under cover, Harley proceeded on
      foot to the little railway station. He approached a porter who leaned in
      the doorway. &ldquo;Could you direct me to the house of his excellency Ormuz
      Khan?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;If you follow the uphill road on the other
      side of the station until you come to the Manor Park&mdash;you will see
      the gates&mdash;and then branch off to the right, taking the road facing
      the gates. Hillside&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name of the house&mdash;is about a
      quarter of a mile along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dusk was beginning to fall and, although the nature of his proposed
      operations demanded secrecy, he recognized that every hour was precious.
      Accordingly he walked immediately back to the spot at which he had left
      the car and, following the porter&rsquo;s directions, drove over the line at the
      level crossing immediately beyond the station, and proceeded up a
      tree-lined road until he found himself skirting the railing of an
      extensive tract of park land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently heavy gates appeared in view; and then, to the right, another
      lane in which the growing dusk had painted many shadows. He determined to
      drive on until he should find a suitable hiding place. And at a spot, as
      he presently learned, not a hundred yards from Hillside, he discovered an
      opening in the hedge which divided the road from a tilled field. Into
      this, without hesitation, he turned the racer, backing in, in order that
      he might be ready for a flying start in case of emergency. Once more he
      set out on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded with caution, walking softly close to the side of the road,
      and frequently pausing to listen. Advancing in this fashion, he found
      himself standing ere long before an open gateway, and gazing along a drive
      which presented a vista of utter blackness. A faint sound reached his ear&mdash;the
      distant drone of a powerful engine. A big car was mounting the slope from
      Lower Claybury Station.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. WHAT HAPPENED TO HARLEY&mdash;CONTINUED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not until Harley came within sight of the house, a low, rambling Jacobean
      building, did he attempt to take cover. He scrambled up a tree and got
      astride of a wall. A swift survey by his electric torch of the ground on
      the other side revealed a jungle of weeds in either direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered an impatient exclamation. He calculated that the car was now
      within a hundred yards of the end of the lane. Suddenly came an idea that
      was born of emergency. Swarming up the tree to where its dense foliage
      began, he perched upon a stout bough and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three minutes later came a blaze of light through the gathering darkness,
      and the car which he had last seen at the Savoy was turned into the drive,
      and presently glided smoothly past him below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior lights were extinguished, so that he was unable to discern
      the occupants. The house itself was also unilluminated. And when the car
      pulled up before the porch, less than ten yards from his observation post,
      he could not have recognized the persons who descended and entered
      Hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, only by the sound of the closing door did he know that they had
      gone in. But two figures were easily discernible; and he judged them to be
      those of Ormuz Khan and his secretary. He waited patiently, and ere long
      the limousine was turned in the little courtyard before the porch and
      driven out into the lane again. He did not fail to note that, the lane
      regained, the chauffeur headed, not toward Lower Claybury, but away from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retained his position until the hum of the motor grew dim in the
      distance, and was about to descend when he detected the sound of a second
      approaching car! Acutely conscious of danger, he remained where he was.
      Almost before the hum of the retiring limousine had become inaudible, a
      second car entered the lane and turned into the drive of Hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley peered eagerly downward, half closing his eyes in order that he
      might not be dazzled by the blaze of the headlight. This was another
      limousine, its most notable characteristic being that the blinds were
      drawn in all the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion, when the chauffeur stepped around and opened the door,
      only one passenger alighted. There seemed to be some delay before he was
      admitted, but Harley found it impossible to detect any details of the
      scene being enacted in the shadowed porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the second car was driven away, pursuing the same direction as
      the first. Hot upon its departure came the drone of a third. The windows
      of the third car also exhibited drawn blinds. As it passed beneath him he
      stifled an exclamation of triumph. Vaguely, nebulously, the secret of this
      dread thing Fire-Tongue, which had uplifted its head in England, appeared
      before his mind&rsquo;s eye. It was only necessary for him to assure himself
      that the latest visitor had been admitted to the house before the next
      move became possible. Accordingly he changed his position, settling
      himself more comfortably upon the bough. And now he watched the three cars
      perform each two journeys to some spot or spots unknown, and, returning,
      deposit their passengers before the porch of Hillside. The limousine used
      by Ormuz Khan, upon its second appearance had partaken of the same
      peculiarity as the others: there were blinds drawn inside the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley believed that he understood precisely what this signified, and
      when, after listening intently in the stillness of the night, he failed to
      detect sounds of any other approach, he descended to the path and stole
      toward the dark house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were French windows upon the ground floor, all of them closely
      shuttered. Although he recognized that he was taking desperate chances, he
      inspected each one of them closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing gently from window to window, his quest ultimately earned its
      reward. Through a crack in one of the shutters a dim light shone out. His
      heart was beating uncomfortably, although he had himself well in hand;
      and, crawling into the recess formed by the window, he pressed his ear
      against a pane and listened intently. At first he could hear nothing, but,
      his investigation being aided by the stillness of the night, he presently
      became aware that a voice was speaking within the room&mdash;deliberately,
      musically. The beating of his heart seemed to make his body throb to the
      very finger tips. He had recognized the voice to be the voice of Ormuz
      Khan!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, his sense of hearing becoming attuned to the muffled tones, he began
      to make out syllables, words, and, finally, sentences. Darkness wrapped
      him about, so that no one watching could have seen his face. But he
      himself knew that under the bronze which he never lost he had grown pale.
      His heartbeats grew suddenly fainter, an eerie chill more intense than any
      which the note of danger had ever occasioned caused him to draw sharply
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he whispered. He drew his automatic swiftly from his pocket,
      and, pressed against the wall beside the window, looked about him as a man
      looks who finds himself surrounded by enemies. Not a sound disturbed the
      stillness of the garden except for sibilant rustlings of the leaves,
      occasioned by a slight breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley retreated step by step to the bushes. He held the pistol
      tightly clenched in his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard his own death sentence pronounced and he knew that it was
      likely to be executed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. WHAT HAPPENED TO HARLEY&mdash;CONCLUDED
    </h2>
    <p>
      He regained the curve of the drive without meeting any opposition. There,
      slipping the pistol into his pocket, he climbed rapidly up the tree from
      which he had watched the arrival of the three cars, climbed over the wall,
      and dropped into the weed jungle beyond. He crept stealthily forward to
      the gap where he had concealed the racer, drawing nearer and nearer to the
      bushes lining the lane. Only by a patch of greater darkness before him did
      he realize that he had reached it. But when the realization came one word
      only he uttered: &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His car had disappeared!
    </p>
    <p>
      Despair was alien to his character: A true Englishman, he never knew when
      he was beaten. Beyond doubt, now, he must accept the presence of hidden
      enemies surrounding him, of enemies whose presence even his trained powers
      of perception had been unable to detect. The intensity of the note of
      danger which he had recognized now was fully explained. He grew icily
      cool, master of his every faculty. &ldquo;We shall see!&rdquo; he muttered, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling his way into the lane, he set out running for the highroad, his
      footsteps ringing out sharply upon the dusty way. The highroad gained, he
      turned, not to the left, but to the right, ran up the bank and threw
      himself flatly down upon it, lying close to the hedge and watching the
      entrance to the lane. Nothing appeared; nothing stirred. He knew the
      silence to be illusive; he blamed himself for having ventured upon such a
      quest without acquainting himself with the geography of the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great issues often rest upon a needle point. He had no idea of the
      direction or extent of the park land adjoining the highroad. Nevertheless,
      further inaction being out of the question, creeping along the grassy
      bank, he began to retreat from the entrance to the lane. Some ten yards he
      had progressed in this fashion when his hidden watchers made their first
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint sound, so faint that only a man in deadly peril could have
      detected it, brought him up sharply. He crouched back against the hedge,
      looking behind him. For a long time he failed to observe anything. Then,
      against the comparatively high tone of the dusty road, he saw a silhouette&mdash;the
      head and shoulders of someone who peered out cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still as the trees above him he crouched, watching, and presently, bent
      forward, questing to right and left, questing in a horribly suggestive
      animal fashion, the entire figure of the man appeared in the roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Paul Harley had prayed would be the case, his pursuers evidently
      believed that he had turned in the direction of Lower Claybury. A vague,
      phantom figure, Harley saw the man wave his arm, whereupon a second man
      joined him&mdash;a third&mdash;and, finally, a fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley clenched his teeth grimly, and as the ominous quartet began to move
      toward the left, he resumed his slow retreat to the right&mdash;going ever
      farther away, of necessity, from the only centre with which he was
      acquainted and from which he could hope to summon assistance. Finally he
      reached a milestone resting almost against the railings of the Manor Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing a deep breath, he sprang upon the milestone, succeeded in grasping
      the top of the high iron railings, and hauled himself up bodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Praying that the turf might be soft, he jumped. Fit though he was, and
      hardened by physical exercise, the impact almost stunned him. He came down
      like an acrobat&mdash;left foot, right foot, and then upon his hands, but
      nevertheless he lay there for a moment breathless and temporarily numbed
      by the shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than a minute he was on his feet again and looking alertly about
      him. Striking into the park land, turning to the left, and paralleling the
      highroad, he presently came out upon the roadway, along which under
      shelter of a straggling hedge, he began to double back. In sight of the
      road dipping down to Lower Claybury he crossed, forcing his way through a
      second hedge thickly sown with thorns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Badly torn, but careless of such minor injuries, he plunged heavily
      through a turnip field, and, bearing always to the left, came out finally
      upon the road leading to the station, and only some fifty yards from the
      bottom of the declivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment he paused, questioning the silence. He was unwilling to believe
      that he had outwitted his pursuers. His nerves were strung to highest
      tension, and his strange gift of semi-prescience told him that danger was
      at least as imminent as ever, even though he could neither see nor hear
      his enemies. Therefore, pistol in hand again, he descended to the foot of
      the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered having noticed, when he had applied to the porter for
      information respecting the residence of Ormuz Khan, that upon a window
      adjoining the entrance had appeared the words &ldquo;Station Master.&rdquo; The
      station master&rsquo;s office, therefore, was upon the distant side of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now came the hardest blow of all. The station was closed for the night.
      Nor was there any light in the signal box. Evidently no other train was
      due upon that branch line until some time in the early morning. The level
      crossing gate was open, but before breaking cover he paused a while to
      consider what he should do. Lower Claybury was one of those stations which
      have no intimate connection with any township. The nearest house, so far
      as Harley could recall, was fully twenty yards from the spot at which he
      stood. Furthermore, the urgency of the case had fired the soul of the
      professional investigator.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made up his mind, and, darting out into the road, he ran across the
      line, turned sharply, and did not pause until he stood before the station
      master&rsquo;s window. Then his quick wits were put to their ultimate test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right, left, it seemed from all about him, came swiftly pattering
      footsteps! Instantly he divined the truth. Losing his tracks upon the
      highroad above, a section of his pursuers had surrounded the station,
      believing that he would head for it in retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley whipped off his coat in a flash, and using it as a ram,
      smashed the window. He reached up, found the catch, and opened the sash.
      In ten seconds he was in the room, and a great clatter told him that he
      had overturned some piece of furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disentangling his coat, he sought and found the electric torch. He pressed
      the button. No light came. It was broken! He drew a hissing breath, and
      began to grope about the little room. At last his hand touched the
      telephone, and, taking it up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the voice of the operator&mdash;&ldquo;what number?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;City 8951. Police business! Urgent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One, two, three seconds elapsed, four, five, six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; came the voice of Innes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Innes?&rdquo; said Harley. And, interrupting the other&rsquo;s reply: &ldquo;I am
      by no means safe, Innes! I am in one of the tightest corners of my life.
      Listen: Get Wessex! If he&rsquo;s off duty, get Burton. Tell him to bring&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Someone leaped in at the broken window behind the speaker. Resting the
      telephone upon the table, where he had found it, Harley reached into his
      hip pocket and snapped out his automatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimly he could hear Innes speaking. He half-turned, raised the pistol, and
      knew a sudden intense pain at the back of his skull. A thousand lights
      seemed suddenly to split the darkness. He felt himself sinking into an
      apparently bottomless pit.

      CHAPTER XX. CONFLICTING CLUBS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news, Wessex?&rdquo; asked Innes, eagerly, starting up from his chair as
      the inspector entered the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wessex shook his head, and sitting down took out and lighted a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News of a sort,&rdquo; he replied, slowly, &ldquo;but nothing of any value, I am
      afraid. My assistant, Stokes, has distinguished himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Innes, dully, dropping back into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were trying days for the indefatigable secretary. Believing that
      some clue of importance might come to light at any hour of the day or
      night he remained at the chambers in Chancery Lane, sleeping nightly in
      the spare room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued the inspector, &ldquo;I had detailed him to watch Nicol Brinn,
      but my explicit instructions were that Nicol Brinn was not to be molested
      in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night Nicol Brinn had a visitor&mdash;possibly a valuable witness.
      Stokes, like an idiot, allowed her to slip through his fingers and tried
      to arrest Brinn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Arrest him!&rdquo; cried Innes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. But I rather fancy,&rdquo; added the inspector, grimly, &ldquo;that Mr.
      Stokes will think twice before taking leaps like that in the dark again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say he tried to arrest him. What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that Nicol Brinn, leaving Stokes locked in his chambers, went out
      and has completely disappeared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the woman! There&rsquo;s the rub. If he had lain low and followed the
      woman, all might have been well. But who she was, where she came from, and
      where she has gone, we have no idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicol Brinn must have been desperate to adopt such measures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Inspector Wessex nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He evidently had an appointment of such urgency that he could permit
      nothing to stand in his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very clever man, Mr. Innes. He removed the telephone from the
      room in which he had locked Stokes, so that my blundering assistant was
      detained for nearly fifteen minutes&mdash;detained, in fact, until his
      cries from the window attracted the attention of a passing constable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s man did not release him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he said he had no key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stokes wanted to detain the servant, whose name is Hoskins, but I simply
      wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. I am a poor man, but I would cheerfully give fifty
      pounds to know where Nicol Brinn is at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Innes stood up restlessly and began to drum his fingers upon the table
      edge. Presently he looked up, and:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a shadow of hope,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Rector&mdash;you know Rector?&mdash;had
      been detailed by the chief to cover the activities of Nicol Brinn. He has
      not reported to me so far to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he may be following him?&rdquo; cried Wessex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite possible&mdash;following either Nicol Brinn or the woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, I hope you&rsquo;re right!&mdash;even though it makes the Criminal
      Investigation Department look a bit silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Innes, &ldquo;there is something else which you should know. I
      heard to-day from a garage, with which Mr. Harley does business, that he
      hired a racing car last night. He has often used it before. It met him
      half-way along Pall Mall at seven o&rsquo;clock, and he drove away in it in the
      direction of Trafalgar Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, unfortunately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward Trafalgar Square,&rdquo; murmured Wessex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Innes, shaking his head, &ldquo;that clue is of no importance. Under
      the circumstances the chief would be much more likely to head away from
      his objective than toward it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; murmured Wessex. &ldquo;I agree with you. But what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telephone bell was ringing, and as Innes eagerly took up the receiver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Mr. Innes speaking,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;Is that you, Rector?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Rector, one of Paul Harley&rsquo;s assistants, answered him over
      the wire:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking from Victoria Station, Mr. Innes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Innes. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very odd-looking woman visited Mr. Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s chambers this evening.
      She was beautifully dressed, but wore the collar of her fur coat turned up
      about her face, so that it was difficult to see her. But somehow I think
      she was an Oriental.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Oriental!&rdquo; exclaimed Innes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waited for her to come out,&rdquo; Rector continued. &ldquo;She had arrived in a
      cab, which was waiting, and I learned from the man that he had picked her
      up at Victoria Station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came out some time later in rather a hurry. In fact, I think there
      was no doubt that she was frightened. By this time I had another cab
      waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did she go?&rdquo; asked Innes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to Victoria Station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, Mr. Innes, my story does not go much further. I wasted
      very little time, you may be sure. But although no train had left from the
      South Eastern station, which she had entered, there was no sign of her
      anywhere. So that I can only suppose she ran through to the Brighton side,
      or possibly out to a car, which may have been waiting for her somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Innes, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, Mr. Innes. But I thought I would report it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Rector; you could do no more. Did you see anything of
      Detective Sergeant Stokes before you left Piccadilly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;He also was intensely interested in Nicol
      Brinn&rsquo;s visitor. And about five minutes before she came out he went
      upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. She came out almost immediately after Stokes had gone up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Rector. Return to Piccadilly, and report to me as soon as
      possible.&rdquo; Innes hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you follow, Wessex?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Stokes was on the right track, but
      made a bad blunder. You see, his appearance led to the woman&rsquo;s retreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He explained that to me,&rdquo; returned the inspector, gloomily. &ldquo;She got out
      by another door as he came in. Oh! a pretty mess he has made of it. If he
      and Rector had been cooperating, they could have covered her movements
      perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no use crying over spilt milk,&rdquo; returned Innes. He glanced
      significantly in the inspector&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Miss Abingdon has rung up
      practically every hour all day,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wessex nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a married man myself,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and happily married, too. But if
      you had seen the look in her eyes when I told her that Mr. Harley had
      disappeared, I believe you would have envied him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Innes. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t known each other long, but I should
      say from what little I have seen of them that she cares too much for her
      peace of mind.&rdquo; He stared hard at the inspector. &ldquo;I think it will break
      her heart if anything has happened to the chief. The sound of her voice
      over the telephone brings a lump into my throat, Wessex. She rang up an
      hour ago. She will ring up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I never thought he was a marrying man,&rdquo; muttered the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; returned Innes, smiling sadly. &ldquo;But even he can be
      forgiven for changing his mind in the case of Phil Abingdon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the inspector. &ldquo;I am not sorry to know that he is human like
      the rest of us.&rdquo; His expression grew retrospective, and: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out
      how the garage you were speaking about didn&rsquo;t report that matter before,&rdquo;
       he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; explained Innes, &ldquo;they were used to the chief making long
      journeys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long journeys,&rdquo; muttered the inspector. &ldquo;Did he make a long journey? I
      wonder&mdash;I wonder.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE SEVENTH KAMA
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Nicol Brinn strolled out from the door below his chambers in
      Piccadilly, a hoarse voice made itself audible above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police!&rdquo; he heard over the roar of the traffic. &ldquo;Help! Police!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Sergeant Stokes had come out upon the balcony. But up to the
      time that Nicol Brinn turned and proceeded in leisurely fashion in the
      direction of the Cavalry Club, the sergeant had not succeeded in
      attracting any attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn did not hurry. Having his hands thrust in the pockets of his
      light overcoat, he sauntered along Piccadilly as an idle man might do. He
      knew that he had ample time to keep his appointment, and recognizing the
      vital urgency of the situation, he was grateful for some little leisure to
      reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      One who had obtained a glimpse of his face in the light of the shop
      windows which he passed must have failed to discern any evidence of
      anxiety. Yet Nicol Brinn knew that death was beckoning to him. He knew
      that his keen wit was the only weapon which could avail him to-night; and
      he knew that he must show himself a master of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lonely man, of few but enduring friendships, he had admitted but one
      love to his life, except the love of his mother. This one love for seven
      years he had sought to kill. But anything forceful enough to penetrate to
      the stronghold of Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s soul was indestructible, even by Nicol
      Brinn himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, now, at the end of a mighty struggle, he had philosophically accepted
      this hopeless passion which Fate had thrust upon him. Yet he whose world
      was a chaos outwardly remained unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps even that evil presence whose name was Fire-Tongue might have
      paused, might have hesitated, might even have changed his plans, which, in
      a certain part of the world, were counted immutable, had he known the
      manner of man whom he had summoned to him that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just outside the Cavalry Club a limousine was waiting, driven by a
      chauffeur who looked like some kind of Oriental. Nicol Brinn walked up to
      the man, and bending forward:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire-Tongue,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur immediately descended and opened the door of the car. The
      interior was unlighted, but Nicol Brinn cast a comprehensive glance around
      ere entering. As he settled himself upon the cushions, the door was closed
      again, and he found himself in absolute darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Might have foreseen it.&rdquo; All the windows were
      curtained, or rather, as a rough investigation revealed, were closed with
      aluminium shutters which were immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later, as the car moved off, a lamp became lighted above him.
      Then he saw that several current periodicals were placed invitingly in the
      rack, as well as a box of very choice Egyptian cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a close investigation upon every side, but he knew enough of the
      organization with which he was dealing to be prepared for failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He failed. There was no cranny through which he could look out. Palpably,
      it would be impossible to learn where he was being taken. The journey
      might be a direct one, or might be a detour. He wished that he could have
      foreseen this device. Above all, he wished that Detective Sergeant Stokes
      had been a more clever man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been good to know that he was followed. His only hope was
      that someone detailed by Paul Harley might be in pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lighting a fresh cigar, Nicol Brinn drew a copy of the Sketch from the
      rack, and studied the photographs of more or less pretty actresses with
      apparent contentment. He had finished the Sketch, and was perusing the
      Bystander, when, the car having climbed a steep hill and swerved sharply
      to the right, he heard the rustling of leaves, and divined that they were
      proceeding along a drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replaced the paper in the rack, and took out his watch. Consulting it,
      he returned it to his pocket as the car stopped and the light went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door, which, with its fellow, Nicol Brinn had discovered to be locked,
      was opened by the Oriental chauffeur, and Brinn descended upon the steps
      of a shadowed porch. The house door was open, and although there was no
      light within:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; said a voice, speaking out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn entered a hallway the atmosphere of which seemed to be very
      hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to take your hat and coat,&rdquo; continued the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was relieved of these, guided along a dark passage; and presently, an
      inner door being opened, he found himself in a small, barely furnished
      room where one shaded lamp burned upon a large writing table.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conductor, who did not enter, closed the door quietly, and Nicol Brinn
      found himself looking into the smiling face of a Hindu gentleman who sat
      at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was decorated with queer-looking Indian carvings, pictures upon
      silk, and other products of Eastern craftsmanship. The table and the
      several chairs were Oriental in character, but the articles upon the table
      were very European and businesslike in appearance. Furthermore, the Hindu
      gentleman, who wore correct evening dress, might have been the
      representative of an Eastern banking house, as indeed he happened to be,
      amongst other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; he said, speaking perfect English &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed with a pen which he was holding in the direction of a heavily
      carved chair which stood near the table. Nicol Brinn sat down, regarding
      the speaker with lack-lustre eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A query has arisen respecting your fraternal rights,&rdquo; continued the
      Hindu. &ldquo;Am I to understand that you claim to belong to the Seventh Kama?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Brinn in a toneless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hindu drew his cuff back from a slender yellow wrist, revealing a
      curious mark which appeared to be branded upon the flesh. It was in the
      form of a torch or flambeau surmounted by a tongue of flame. He raised his
      black brows, smiling significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn stood up, removing his tight dinner jacket. Then, rolling back
      his sleeve from a lean, sinuous forearm, he extended the powerful member,
      having his fist tightly clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the inside of his arm, just above the elbow, an identical mark had
      been branded!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hindu stood up and saluted Nicol Brinn in a peculiar manner. That is
      to say, he touched the second finger of his right hand with the tip of his
      tongue, and then laid the finger upon his forehead, at the same time
      bowing deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn repeated the salutation, and quietly put his coat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We greet you,&rdquo; said the Hindu. &ldquo;I am Rama Dass of the Bengal Lodge. Have
      you Hindustani?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you initiated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Moon Ali Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the Hindu. &ldquo;I see it all. In Bombay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Bombay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, and by whom, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Ruhmani, November 23, 1913.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; murmured Rama Dass. &ldquo;Brother Ruhmani died in that year; which
      accounts for our having lost touch with you. What is your grade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fifth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not proceeded far, brother. How do you come to be unacquainted
      with our presence in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What work has been allotted to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More and more strange,&rdquo; murmured the Hindu, watching Nicol Brinn through
      the gold-rimmed spectacles which he wore. &ldquo;I have only known one other
      case. Such cases are dangerous, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No blame attaches to me,&rdquo; replied Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not said so,&rdquo; returned Rama Dass. &ldquo;But in the Seventh Kama all
      brothers must work. A thousand lives are as nothing so the Fire lives. We
      had thought our information perfect, but only by accident did we learn of
      your existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; murmured Nicol Brinn, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even this smiling Hindu gentleman, whose smile concealed so much,
      could read any meaning in those lack-lustre eyes, nor detect any emotion
      in that high, cool voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A document was found, and in this it was recorded that you bore upon your
      arm the sign of the Seventh Kama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Fire that moves the grains of dust,&rdquo; murmured Nicol Brinn,
      tonelessly, &ldquo;which one day make a mountain for the gods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rama Dass stood up at once and repeated his strange gesture of salutation,
      which Nicol Brinn returned ceremoniously; and resumed his seat at the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are advanced beyond your grade, brother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are worthy
      the next step. Do you wish to take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every little drop swells the ocean,&rdquo; returned Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak well,&rdquo; the Hindu said. &ldquo;We have here your complete record. It
      shall not be consulted. To do so were unnecessary. We are satisfied. We
      regret only that one so happily circumstanced to promote the coming of the
      Fire should have been lost sight of. Last night there were three
      promotions and several rejections. You were expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was not summoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; murmured Rama Dass. &ldquo;We had learned of you as I have said. However,
      great honour results. You will be received alone. Do you desire to
      advance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Give me time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rama Dass again performed the strange salutation, and again Nicol Brinn
      returned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wisdom is a potent wine,&rdquo; said the latter, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We respect your decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Hindu rang a little silver bell upon his table, and the double doors
      which occupied one end of the small room opened silently, revealing a
      large shadowy apartment beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rama Dass stood up, crossed the room, and standing just outside the open
      doors, beckoned to Nicol Brinn to advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no fear,&rdquo; he said, in a queer, chanting tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no fear,&rdquo; repeated Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire alone is eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire alone is eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he pronounced those words Nicol Brinn crossed the threshold of the dark
      room, and the double doors closed silently behind him.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. FIRE-TONGUE SPEAKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Absolute darkness surrounded Nicol Brinn. Darkness, unpleasant heat, and a
      stifling odour of hyacinths. He had been well coached, and thus far his
      memory had served him admirably. But now he knew not what to expect.
      Therefore inwardly on fire but outwardly composed, muscles taut and nerves
      strung highly, he waited for the next development.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took the form, first, of the tinkling of a silver bell, and then of the
      coming of a dim light at the end of what was evidently a long apartment.
      The light grew brighter, assuming the form of a bluish flame burning in a
      little flambeau. Nicol Brinn watched it fascinatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolutely no sound was discernible, until a voice began to speak, a
      musical voice of curiously arresting quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;You are of the Bombay Lodge, although
      a citizen of the United States. Because of some strange error, no work has
      been allotted to you hitherto. This shall be remedied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the weird impressiveness of the scene there could be no doubt. It even
      touched some unfamiliar chord in the soul of Nicol Brinn. The effect of
      such an interview upon an imaginative, highly strung temperament, could be
      well imagined. It was perhaps theatrical, but that by such means great
      ends had already been achieved he knew to his cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction of Maskelyne illusions into an English country house must
      ordinarily have touched his sense of humour, but knowing something of the
      invisible presence in which he stood in that darkened chamber, there was
      no laughter in the heart of Nicol Brinn, but rather an unfamiliar
      coldness, the nearest approach to fear of which this steel-nerved man was
      capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Temporarily,&rdquo; the sweet voice continued, &ldquo;you will be affiliated with the
      London Lodge, to whom you will look for instructions. These will reach you
      almost immediately. There is great work to be done in England. It has been
      decided, however, that you shall be transferred as quickly as possible in
      our New York Lodge. You will await orders. Only Fire is eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the voice ceased. But, Nicol Brinn remained silent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reply is awaited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire is life,&rdquo; replied Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue tongue of flame subsided, lower and lower, and finally
      disappeared, so that the apartment became enwrapped in absolute darkness.
      A faint rustling sound suggested that a heavy curtain had been lowered,
      and almost immediately the doors behind Nicol Brinn were opened again by
      Rama Dass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We congratulate you, brother,&rdquo; he said, extending his hand. &ldquo;Yet the
      ordeal was no light one, for all the force of the Fire was focussed upon
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn reentered the room where the shaded lamp stood upon the
      writing table. In the past he had moved unscathed through peril unknown to
      the ordinary man. He was well acquainted with the resources of the
      organization whose agents, unseen, surrounded him in that remote country
      house, but that their pretensions were extravagant his present immunity
      would seem to prove.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the speaker with the strangely arresting voice were indeed that
      Fire-Tongue whose mere name was synonymous with dread in certain parts of
      the East, then Fire-Tongue was an impostor. He who claimed to read the
      thoughts of all men had signally failed in the present instance, unless
      Nicol Brinn stared dully into the smiling face of Rama Dass. Not yet must
      he congratulate himself. Perhaps the Hindu&rsquo;s smile concealed as much as
      the mask worn by Nicol Brinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We congratulate you,&rdquo; said Rama Dass. &ldquo;You are a worthy brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He performed the secret salutation, which Nicol Brinn automatically
      acknowledged. Then, without another word, Rama Dass led the way to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out into the dark hallway Nicol Brinn stepped, his muscles taut, his brain
      alert for instant action. But no one offered to molest him. He was
      assisted into his coat, and his hat was placed in his hands. Then, the
      front door being opened, he saw the headlights of the waiting car shining
      on a pillar of the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later he was seated again in the shuttered limousine, and as it
      moved off, and the lights leapt up above him, he lay back upon the
      cushions and uttered a long sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already he divined that, following a night&rsquo;s sleep, these scenes would
      seem like the episodes of a dream. Taking off his hat, he raised his hand
      to his forehead, and discovered it to be slightly damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing out a silk handkerchief from the breast pocket of his dinner
      jacket, he wiped his face and forehead deliberately. Then, selecting a
      long black cigar from a case which bore the monogram of the late Czar of
      Russia, he lighted it, dropped the match in the tray, and lolling back in
      a corner, closed his eyes wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, almost unmoving, he remained throughout the drive. His only actions
      were, first, to assure himself that both doors were locked again, and then
      at intervals tidily to place a little cone of ash in the tray provided for
      the purpose. Finally, the car drew up and a door was unlocked by the
      chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn, placing his hat upon his head, stepped out before the porch
      of the Cavalry Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur closed the door, and returned again to the wheel.
      Immediately the car moved away. At the illuminated number Nicol Brinn
      scarcely troubled to glance. Common sense told him that it was not that
      under which the car was registered. His interest, on the contrary, was
      entirely focussed upon a beautiful Rolls Royce, which was evidently
      awaiting some visitor or member of the club. Glancing shrewdly at the
      chauffeur, a smart, military-looking fellow, Nicol Brinn drew a card from
      his waistcoat pocket, and resting it upon a wing in the light of one of
      the lamps, wrote something rapidly upon it in pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning the pencil to his pocket:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose car, my man?&rdquo; he inquired of the chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Lord Wolverham&rsquo;s, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Nicol Brinn, and put the card and a ten-shilling note into
      the man&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Go right into the club and personally give Colonel Lord
      Wolverham this card. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man understood. Used to discipline, he recognized the note of command
      in the speaker&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; he returned, without hesitation; and stepping down upon
      the pavement he walked into the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than two minutes afterward a highly infuriated military gentleman&mdash;who,
      as it chanced, had never even heard of the distinguished American
      traveller&mdash;came running out hatless into Piccadilly, holding a
      crumpled visiting card in his hand. The card, which his chauffeur had
      given him in the midst of a thrilling game, read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. NICOL BRINN RALEIGH HOUSE, PICCADILLY, W. I.
    </p>
    <p>
      And written in pencil beneath the name appeared the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      Borrowed your Rolls. Urgent. Will explain tomorrow. Apologize. N.B.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. PHIL ABINGDON&rsquo;S VISITOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the following morning the card of His Excellency Ormuz Khan was brought
      to Phil Abingdon in the charming little room which Mrs. McMurdoch had
      allotted to her for a private sanctum during the period of her stay under
      this hospitable roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she exclaimed, and looked at the maid in a startled way. &ldquo;I suppose
      I must see him. Will you ask him to come in, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Ormuz Khan entered. He wore faultless morning dress,
      too faultless; so devoid of any flaw or crease as to have lost its
      masculine character. In his buttonhole was a hyacinth, and in one slender
      ivory hand he carried a huge bunch of pink roses, which, bowing deeply, he
      presented to the embarrassed girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare I venture,&rdquo; he said in his musical voice, bending deeply over her
      extended hand, &ldquo;to ask you to accept these flowers? It would honour me.
      Pray do not refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your excellency is very kind,&rdquo; she replied, painfully conscious of acute
      nervousness. &ldquo;It is more than good of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good of you to grant me so much pleasure,&rdquo; he returned, sinking
      gracefully upon a settee, as Phil Abingdon resumed her seat. &ldquo;Condolences
      are meaningless. Why should I offer them to one of your acute perceptions?
      But you know&mdash;&rdquo; the long, magnetic eyes regarded her fixedly&mdash;&ldquo;you
      know what is in my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon bit her lip, merely nodding in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us then try to forget, if only for a while,&rdquo; said Ormuz Khan. &ldquo;I
      could show you so easily, if you would consent to allow me, that those we
      love never leave us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spell of his haunting voice was beginning to have its effect. Phil
      Abingdon found herself fighting against something which at once repelled
      and attracted her. She had experienced this unusual attraction before, and
      this was not the first time that she had combated it. But whereas formerly
      she had more or less resigned herself to the strange magic which lay in
      the voice and in the eyes of Ormuz Khan, this morning there was something
      within her which rebelled fiercely against the Oriental seductiveness of
      his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recognized that a hot flush had covered her cheeks. For the image of
      Paul Harley, bronzed, gray-eyed, and reproachful, had appeared before her
      mind&rsquo;s eye, and she knew why her resentment of the Persian&rsquo;s charm of
      manner had suddenly grown so intense. Yet she was not wholly immune from
      it, for:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Your Excellency really mean that?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile appeared upon his face, an alluring smile, but rather that of a
      beautiful woman than of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you of the West,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have advanced step by step, ever upward in
      the mechanical sciences, we of the East have advanced also step by step in
      other and greater sciences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;you have spoken of such things before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak of things which I know. From that hour when you entered upon your
      first Kama, back in the dawn of time, until now, those within the
      ever-moving cycle which bears you on through the ages have been beside
      you, at times unseen by the world, at times unseen by you, veiled by the
      mist which men call death, but which is no more than a curtain behind
      which we sometimes step for a while. In the East we have learned to raise
      that curtain; in the West are triflers who make like claims, but whose
      knowledge of the secret of the veil is&mdash;&rdquo; And he snapped his fingers
      contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange personality of the man was having its effect. Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s
      eyes were widely open, and she was hanging upon his words. Underneath the
      soft effeminate exterior lay a masterful spirit&mdash;a spirit which had
      known few obstacles. The world of womanhood could have produced no more
      difficult subject than Phil Abingdon. Yet she realized, and became
      conscious of a sense of helplessness, that under certain conditions she
      would be as a child in the hands of this Persian mystic, whose weird eyes
      appeared to be watching not her body, nor even her mind, but her soul,
      whose voice touched unfamiliar chords within her&mdash;chords which had
      never responded to any other human voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thrilling, vaguely pleasurable, but deep terror underlay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency almost frightens me,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Yet I do not doubt
      that you speak of what you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; he returned, gravely. &ldquo;At any hour, day or night, if you care
      to make the request, I shall be happy to prove my words. But,&rdquo; he lowered
      his dark lashes and then raised them again, &ldquo;the real object of my visit
      is concerned with more material things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Phil Abingdon, and whether because of the words of Ormuz
      Khan, or because of some bond of telepathy which he had established
      between them, she immediately found herself to be thinking of Paul Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bring you a message,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;from a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With eyes widely open, Phil Abingdon watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From,&rdquo; she began&mdash;but her lips would not frame the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Mr. Paul Harley,&rdquo; he said, inclining his head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! tell me, tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here to tell you, Miss Abingdon. Mr. Harley feels that his absence
      may have distressed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in pursuit of a certain matter which is known to you, he has found it
      necessary in the interests of his safety to remain out of London for a
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Phil Abingdon heaved a great sigh. &ldquo;Oh, Your Excellency, how glad I
      am to hear that he is safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The long, dark eyes regarded her intently, unemotionally, noting that the
      flush had faded from her face, leaving it very pale, and noting also the
      expression of gladness in her eyes, the quivering of her sweet lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my guest,&rdquo; continued Ormuz Khan, &ldquo;my honoured guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is with you?&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, almost incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me, at my home in Surrey. In me he found a natural ally, since my
      concern was as great as his own. I do not conceal from you, Miss Abingdon,
      that he is danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In danger?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, but beneath my roof he is safe. There is a matter of vital
      urgency, however, in which you can assist him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one but you.&rdquo; Ormuz Khan raised his slender hand gracefully. &ldquo;I beg
      you, do not misunderstand me. In the first place, would Mr. Harley have
      asked you to visit him at my home, if he had not been well assured that
      you could do so with propriety? In the second place, should I, who respect
      you more deeply than any woman in the world, consent to your coming
      unchaperoned? Miss Abingdon, you know me better. I beg of you in Mr.
      Harley&rsquo;s name and in my own, prevail upon Mrs. McMurdoch to accept the
      invitation which I bring to lunch with me at Hillside, my Surrey home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with the deep respect of a courtier addressing his queen. His low
      musical voice held a note that was almost a note of adoration. Phil
      Abingdon withdrew her gaze from the handsome ivory face, and strove for
      mental composure before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subtly, insidiously, the man had cast his spell upon her. Of this she was
      well aware. In other words, her thoughts were not entirely her own, but in
      a measure were promptings from that powerful will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, her heart was beating wildly at the mere thought that she was to
      see Paul Harley again that very day. She had counted the hours since their
      last meeting, and knew exactly how many had elapsed. Because each one had
      seemed like twelve, she had ceased to rebel against this sweet weakness,
      which, for the first time in her life, had robbed her of some of her
      individuality, and had taught her that she was a woman to whom mastery by
      man is exquisite slavery. Suddenly she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will come, Your Excellency,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will see Mrs.
      McMurdoch at once, but I know she will not refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally she will not refuse, Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; he returned in a grave
      voice. &ldquo;The happiness of so many people is involved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so good of you,&rdquo; she said, standing up. &ldquo;I shall never forget your
      kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, bowing deeply, from a European standpoint too deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindness is a spiritual investment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which returns us interest
      tenfold. If I can be sure of Mrs. McMurdoch&rsquo;s acceptance, I will request
      permission to take my leave now, for I have an urgent business appointment
      to keep, after which I will call for you. Can you be ready by noon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we shall be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon held out her hand in a curiously hesitant manner. The image
      of Paul Harley had become more real, more insistent. Her mind was in a
      strangely chaotic state, so that when the hand of Ormuz Khan touched her
      own, she repressed a start and laughed in an embarrassed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that her heart was singing, but under the song lay something
      cold, and when Ormuz Khan had bowed himself from the room, she found
      herself thinking, not of the newly departed visitor, nor even of Paul
      Harley, but of her dead father. In spite of the sunshine which flooded the
      room, her flesh turned cold and she wondered if the uncanny Persian
      possessed some strange power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly as though he had stood beside her, she seemed to hear the beloved
      voice of her father. It was imagination, of course, she knew this; but it
      was uncannily real.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that he was calling her, urgently, beseechingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phil.... Phil....&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. THE SCREEN OF GOLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Paul Harley raised his aching head and looked wearily about him. At first,
      as might be expected, he thought that he was dreaming. He lay upon a low
      divan and could only suppose that he had been transported to India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, painfully, memory reasserted itself and he realized that he had
      been rendered unconscious by the blow of a sandbag or some similar weapon
      while telephoning from the station master&rsquo;s office at Lower Claybury. How
      long a time had elapsed since that moment he was unable to judge, for his
      watch had been removed from his pocket. He stared about him with a sort of
      fearful interest. He lay in a small barely furnished room having white
      distempered walls, wholly undecorated. Its few appointments were Oriental,
      and the only window which it boasted was set so high as to be well out of
      reach. Moreover, it was iron-barred, and at the moment admitted no light,
      whether because it did not communicate with the outer world, or because
      night was fallen, he was unable to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two doors in the room, one of very massive construction, and
      the other a smaller one. The place was dimly lighted by a brass lantern
      which hung from the ceiling. Harley stood up, staggered slightly, and then
      sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he groaned and raised his hand to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments he remained seated, victim of a deadly nausea. Then,
      clenching his jaws grimly, again he stood up, and this time succeeded in
      reaching the heavy door.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had supposed, it was firmly locked, and a glance was sufficient to
      show him that his unaided effort could never force it. He turned his
      attention to the smaller door, which opened at his touch, revealing a
      sleeping apartment not unlike a monk&rsquo;s cell, adjoining which was a tiny
      bathroom. Neither rooms boasted windows, both being lighted by brass
      lanterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley examined them and their appointments with the utmost care, and then
      returned again to the outer room, one feature of which, and quite the most
      remarkable, he had reserved for special investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a massive screen of gilded iron scroll work, which occupied
      nearly the whole of one end of the room. Beyond the screen hung a
      violet-coloured curtain of Oriental fabric; but so closely woven was the
      metal design that although he could touch this curtain with his finger at
      certain points, it proved impossible for him to move it aside in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noted that its lower fringe did not quite touch the door. By stooping
      down, he could see a few feet into some room beyond. It was in darkness,
      however, and beyond the fact that it was carpeted with a rich Persian rug,
      he learned but little from his scrutiny. The gilded screen was solid and
      immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nodding his head grimly, Harley felt in his pockets for pipe and pouch,
      wondering if these, too, had been taken from him. They had not, however,
      and the first nausea of his awakening having passed, he filled and lighted
      his briar and dropped down upon the divan to consider his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      That it was fairly desperate was a fact he was unable to hide from
      himself, but at least he was still alive, which was a matter at once for
      congratulation and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had noticed before, in raising his hand to his head, that his forehead
      felt cold and wet, and now, considering the matter closely, he came to the
      conclusion that an attempt had been made to aid his recovery, by some
      person or persons who must have retired at the moment that he had shown
      signs of returning consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His salvation, then, was not accidental but deliberate. He wondered what
      awaited him and why his life had been spared. That he had walked blindly
      into a trap prepared for him by that mysterious personality known as
      Fire-Tongue, he no longer could doubt. Intense anxiety and an egotistical
      faith in his own acumen had led him to underestimate the cleverness of his
      enemies, a vice from which ordinarily he was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what hour they had taken a leading interest in his movements, he
      would probably never know, but that they had detected Paul Harley beneath
      the vendor of &ldquo;Old Moore&rsquo;s Almanac&rdquo; was certain enough. What a fool he had
      been!
    </p>
    <p>
      He reproached himself bitterly. Ordinary common sense should have told him
      that the Hindu secretary had given those instructions to the chauffeur in
      the courtyard of the Savoy Hotel for his, Paul Harley&rsquo;s, special benefit.
      It was palpable enough now. He wondered how he had ever fallen into such a
      trap, and biting savagely upon his pipe, he strove to imagine what ordeal
      lay ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So his thoughts ran, drifting from his personal danger, which he knew to
      be great, to other matters, which he dreaded to consider, because they
      meant far more to him than his own life. Upon these bitter reflections a
      slight sound intruded, the first which had disturbed the stillness about
      him since the moment of his awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone had entered the room beyond the gilded screen, and now a faint
      light showed beneath the fringe of the curtain. Paul Harley sat quite
      still, smoking and watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had learned to face the inevitable with composure, and now,
      apprehending the worst, he waited, puffing at his pipe. Presently he
      detected the sound of someone crossing the room toward him, or rather
      toward the screen. He lay back against the mattress which formed the back
      of the divan, and watched the gap below the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he perceived a pair of glossy black boots. Their wearer was
      evidently standing quite near the screen, possibly listening. Harley had
      an idea that some second person stood immediately behind the first. Of
      this idea he presently had confirmation. He was gripping the stem of his
      pipe very tightly and any one who could have seen him sitting there must
      have perceived that although his face wore an unusual pallor, he was
      composed and entirely master of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice uttered his name:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paul Harley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not be sure, but he thought it was the voice of Ormuz Khan&rsquo;s
      secretary. He drew his pipe from between his teeth, and:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what do you want with me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your attention, Mr. Harley, for a few moments, if you feel sufficiently
      recovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray proceed,&rdquo; said Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the presence of a second person beyond the screen he was now assured,
      for he had detected the sound of whispered instructions; and sinking lower
      and lower upon the divan, he peered surreptitiously under the border of
      the curtain, believing it to be more than probable that his movements were
      watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to a notable discovery. A pair of gray suede shoes became visible
      a few inches behind the glossy black boots&mdash;curiously small shoes
      with unusually high heels. The identity of their wearer was beyond dispute
      to the man who had measured that delicate foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormuz Khan stood behind the screen!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. AN ENGLISHMAN&rsquo;S HONOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been guilty of a series of unfortunate mistakes, Mr. Harley,&rdquo;
       continued the speaker. &ldquo;Notably, you have relied upon the clumsy device of
      disguise. To the organization in which you have chosen to interest
      yourself, this has provided some mild amusement. Your pedlar of almanacs
      was a clever impersonation, but fortunately your appearance at the Savoy
      had been anticipated, and no one was deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley did not reply. He concluded, quite correctly, that the
      organization had failed to detect himself in the person of the nervous
      cobbler. He drew courage from this deduction. Fire-Tongue was not
      omniscient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; continued the unseen speaker, in whom Harley had now
      definitely recognized Ormuz Khan&rsquo;s secretary, &ldquo;that you recently overheard
      a resolution respecting yourself. Your death, in fact, had been determined
      upon. Life and death being synonymous, the philosopher contemplates either
      with equanimity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am contemplating the latter with equanimity at the moment,&rdquo; said
      Harley, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brave man does so,&rdquo; the Hindu continued, smoothly. &ldquo;The world only
      seems to grow older; its youth is really eternal, but as age succeeds age,
      new creeds must take the place of the old ones which are burned out. Fire,
      Mr. Harley, sweeps everything from its path irresistibly. You have dared
      to stand in the path of a fiery dawn; therefore, like all specks of dust
      which clog the wheels of progress, you must be brushed aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harley nodded grimly, watching a ring of smoke floating slowly upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a little thing to those who know the truth,&rdquo; the speaker resumed.
      &ldquo;To the purblind laws of the West it may seem a great thing. We seek in
      Rome to do as Rome does. We judge every man as we find him. Therefore,
      recognizing that your total disappearance might compromise our movements
      in the near future, we have decided to offer you an alternative. This
      offer is based upon the British character. Where the oath of some men is a
      thing of smoke, the word of honour of an Englishman we are prepared to
      accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; murmured Harley. &ldquo;On behalf of Great Britain I accept the
      compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have such faith in the completeness of our plans, and in the nearness
      of the hour of triumph, that if you will pledge yourself to silence, in
      writing, you will not be molested in any way. You occupy at the moment the
      apartment reserved for neophytes of a certain order. But we do not ask you
      to become a neophyte. Disciples must seek us, we do not seek disciples. We
      only ask for your word that you will be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; said Harley, tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think well of the matter. It may not seem so impossible to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline definitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sustaining yourself with false hopes, Mr. Harley. You think you
      have clues which will enable you to destroy a system rooted in the remote
      past. Also you forget that you have lost your freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley offered no further answer to the speaker concealed behind the
      violet curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not misunderstand us,&rdquo; the voice continued. &ldquo;We bind you to nothing
      but silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse,&rdquo; said Harley, sharply. &ldquo;Dismiss the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of your refusal, time for consideration will be given to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faintly Paul Harley detected the sounds made by Ormuz Khan and his
      secretary in withdrawing. The light beneath the curtain disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      For perhaps a space of two hours, Paul Harley sat smoking and
      contemplating the situation from every conceivable angle. It was certainly
      desperate enough, and after a time he rose with a weary sigh, and made a
      second and more detailed examination of the several apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It availed him nothing, but one point he definitely established. Escape
      was impossible, failing outside assistance. A certain coldness in the
      atmosphere, which was perceptible immediately beneath the barred window,
      led him to believe that this communicated with the outer air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was disposed to think that his unconsciousness had lasted less than an
      hour, and that it was still dark without. He was full of distrust. He no
      longer believed his immediate death to have been decided upon. For some
      reason it would seem that the group wished him to live, at any rate,
      temporarily. But now a complete theory touching the death of Sir Charles
      Abingdon had presented itself to his mind. Knowing little, but suspecting
      much of the resources of Fire-Tongue, he endeavoured to avoid contact with
      anything in the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night attire was provided in the sleeping chamber, but he did not avail
      himself of this hospitality. Absolute silence reigned about him. Yet so
      immutable are Nature&rsquo;s laws, that presently Paul Harley sank back upon the
      mattresses, and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke, acutely uncomfortable and ill-rested. He found a shaft of light
      streaming into the room, and casting shadows of the iron bars upon the
      opposite wall. The brass lantern still burned above him, and the silence
      remained complete as when he had fallen asleep. He stood up yawning and
      stretching himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, it was good to be still alive. He was vaguely conscious of the
      fact that he had been dreaming of Phil Abingdon, and suppressing a sigh,
      he clenched his teeth grimly and entered the little bathroom. There proved
      to be a plentiful supply of hot and cold water. At this he sniffed
      suspiciously, but at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He undressed and revelled in the joy of a hot bath, concluding with a cold
      plunge. A razor and excellent toilet requisites were set upon the dressing
      table, and whilst his imagination whispered that the soap might be
      poisoned and the razor possess a septic blade, he shaved, and having
      shaved, lighted his pipe and redressed himself at leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had nearly completed his toilet when a slight sound in the outer room
      arrested his attention. He turned sharply, stepping through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low carved table, the only one which the apartment boasted, displayed an
      excellent English breakfast laid upon a spotless cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he murmured, and by the sight was mentally translated to that
      celebrated apartment of the palace at Versailles, where Louis XIV and his
      notorious favourite once were accustomed to dine, alone, and unsuitably
      dressed, the courses being served in just this fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley held his pipe in his hand, and contemplated the repast. It was only
      logical to suppose it to be innocuous, and a keen appetite hastened the
      issue. He sidetracked his suspicion, and made an excellent breakfast. So
      the first day of his captivity began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing used to the stillness about him, he presently began to detect, as
      the hours wore on, distant familiar sounds. Automobiles on the highroad,
      trains leaving and entering a tunnel which he judged to be from two to
      three miles distant; even human voices at long intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noises of an English countryside crept through the barred windows.
      Beyond a doubt he was in the house known as Hillside. Probably at night
      the lights of London could be seen from the garden. He was within ordinary
      telephone call of Chancery Lane. Yet he resumed his pipe and smiled
      philosophically. He had hoped to see the table disappear beneath the
      floor. As evidence that he was constantly watched, this had occurred
      during a brief visit which he had made to the bedroom in quest of matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned the table was in its former place, but the cover had been
      removed. He carefully examined the floor beneath it, and realized that
      there was no hope of depressing the trap from above. Then, at an hour
      which he judged to be that of noon, the same voice addressed him from
      beyond the gilded screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paul Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what have you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time, Mr. Harley, you must have recognized that opposition is
      futile. At any moment we could visit death upon you. Escape, on the other
      hand, is out of the question. We desire you no harm. For diplomatic
      reasons, we should prefer you to live. Our cause is a sacred one. Do not
      misjudge it by minor incidents. A short statement and a copy of your
      English testament shall be placed upon the table, if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish,&rdquo; Paul Harley returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your last word, Mr. Harley? We warn you that the third time of
      asking will be the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my last word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own life is not the only stake at issue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will learn what we mean, if you insist upon withholding your consent
      until we next invite it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, you may regard it as withheld, definitely and finally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell, and Paul Harley knew himself to be once more alone. Luncheon
      appeared upon the table whilst he was washing in the bathroom. Remembering
      the change in the tone of the unseen speaker&rsquo;s voice, he avoided touching
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the divan, through half-closed eyes, he examined every inch of the
      walls, seeking for the spy-hole through which he knew himself to be
      watched. He detected it at last: a little grating, like a ventilator,
      immediately above him where he sat. This communicated with some room where
      a silent watcher was constantly on duty!
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley gave no sign that he had made this discovery. But already his
      keen wits were at work upon a plan. He watched the bar of light fading,
      fading, until, judging it to be dinner time, he retired discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned, he found dinner spread upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered for what ordeal the neophyte was prepared in this singular
      apartment. He wondered how such neophytes were chosen, and to what tests
      they were submitted before being accepted as members of the bloodthirsty
      order. He could not even surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently no neophyte had been accepted on the previous night, unless
      there were other like chambers in the house. The occupants of the
      shuttered cars must therefore have been more advanced members. He spent
      the night in the little cell-like bedchamber, and his second day of
      captivity began as the first had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his dinner he had eaten nothing but bread and fruit. For his breakfast
      he ate an egg and drank water from the tap in the bathroom. His plan was
      now nearing completion. Only one point remained doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon the voice again addressed him from behind the gilded screen:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paul Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your last opportunity has come. For your own future or for that of the
      world you seem to care little or nothing. Are you still determined to
      oppose our wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have yet an hour. Your final decision will be demanded of you at the
      end of that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faint sounds of withdrawal followed these words and Harley suddenly
      discovered himself to be very cold. The note of danger had touched him.
      For long it had been silent. Now it clamoured insistently. He knew beyond
      all doubt that he was approaching a crisis in his life. At its nature he
      could not even guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to pace the room nervously, listening for he knew not what. His
      mind was filled with vague imaginings; when at last came an overture to
      the grim test to be imposed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight metallic sound drew his glance in the direction of the gilded
      screen. A sliding door of thick plate glass had been closed behind it,
      filling the space between the metal work and the curtain. Then&mdash;the
      light in the brass lantern became extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing rigidly, fists clenched, Paul Harley watched the curtain. And as
      he watched, slowly it was drawn aside. He found himself looking into a
      long room which appeared to be practically unfurnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floor was spread with rugs and at the farther end folding doors had
      been opened, so that he could see into a second room, most elegantly
      appointed in Persian fashion. Here were silver lanterns, and many silken
      cushions, out of which, as from a sea of colour, arose slender pillars,
      the scheme possessing an air of exotic luxury peculiarly Oriental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated in a carved chair over which a leopard skin had been thrown, and
      talking earnestly to some invisible companion, whose conversation seemed
      wholly to enthrall her, was Phil Abingdon!

      CHAPTER XXVI. THE ORCHID OF SLEEP
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Innes, &ldquo;here is proof that the chief was right!&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Wessex nodded in silent agreement. On the table lay the report of Merton,
      the analyst, concerning the stains upon the serviette which Harley had
      sent from the house of the late Sir Charles Abingdon. Briefly, it stated
      that the serviette had been sprinkled with some essential oil, the exact
      character of which Merton had found himself unable to determine, its
      perfume, if it ever possessed any, having disappeared. And the minute
      quantity obtainable from the linen rendered ordinary tests difficult to
      apply. The analyst&rsquo;s report, however, concluded as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harley, having foreseen these difficulties, and having apparently
      suspected that the oil was of Oriental origin, recommended me, in the note
      which he enclosed with the serviette, to confer with Dr. Warwick Grey. I
      send a copy of a highly interesting letter which I have received from
      Doctor Grey, whose knowledge of Eastern poison is unparalleled, and to
      whose opinion I attach immense importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the contents of this appended letter which had inspired Innes&rsquo;s
      remarks. Indeed, it contained matter which triumphantly established Paul
      Harley&rsquo;s theory that Sir Charles Abingdon had not died from natural
      causes. The letter was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&mdash;&mdash; Harley Street London, W. I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MY DEAR MERTON:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am indebted to you and to Mr. Harley for an opportunity of examining
      the serviette, which I return herewith. I agree that the oil does not
      respond to ordinary tests, nor is any smell perceptible. But you have
      noticed in your microscopic examination of the stains that there is a
      peculiar crystalline formation upon the surface. You state that this is
      quite unfamiliar to you, which is not at all strange, since outside of the
      Himalayan districts of Northwest India I have never met with it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Respecting the character of the oil employed, however, I am in no doubt,
      and I actually possess a dried specimen of the flower from which it is
      expressed. This is poetically known among the Mangars, one of the fighting
      tribes of Nepal, as the Bloom or Orchid of Sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is found upon the lower Himalayan slopes, and bears a close
      resemblance to the white odontoglossum of commerce, except that the flower
      is much smaller. Its perfume attracts insects and sometimes small animals
      and reptiles, although inhalation seems to induce instant death. It may be
      detected in its natural state by the presence of hundreds of dead flies
      and insects upon the ground surrounding the plant. It is especially fatal
      to nocturnal insects, its perfume being stronger at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Preparation of the oil is an art peculiar to members of an obscure sect
      established in that district, by whom it is said to be employed for the
      removal of enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An article is sprinkled with it, and whilst the perfume, which is
      reported to resemble that of cloves, remains perceptible, to inhale it
      results in immediate syncope, although by what physiological process I
      have never been enabled to determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the one exception which I have mentioned, during my stay in Nepal
      and the surrounding districts I failed to obtain a specimen of this
      orchid. I have twice seen the curious purple stain upon articles of
      clothing worn by natives who had died suddenly and mysteriously. The
      Mangars simply say, &ldquo;He has offended someone. It is the flower of sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I immediately recognized the colour of the stains upon the enclosed
      serviette, and also the curious crystalline formation on their surface.
      The identity of the &ldquo;someone&rdquo; to whom the Mangars refer, I never
      established. I shall welcome any particulars respecting the history of the
      serviette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very truly yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;WARWICK GREY.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Charles Abingdon was poisoned,&rdquo; said Wessex in a hushed voice. &ldquo;For
      the girl&rsquo;s sake I hate the idea, but we shall have to get an exhumation
      order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; returned Innes, shortly. &ldquo;He was cremated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; murmured Wessex, &ldquo;I never knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; continued Inures, &ldquo;it is just as well for everyone
      concerned. The known facts are sufficient to establish the murder,
      together with the report of Dr. Warwick Grey. But, meanwhile, are we any
      nearer to learning the identity of the murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not!&rdquo; said Wessex, grimly. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more, when I get to
      Scotland Yard, I have got to face the music. First Mr. Harley goes, and
      now Nicol Brinn has disappeared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost unbelievable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took him for a white man,&rdquo; said the detective, earnestly. &ldquo;I accepted
      his parole for twenty-four hours. The twenty-four hours expired about noon
      to-day, but since he played that trick on Stokes last night and went out
      of his chambers, he has vanished utterly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Innes stood up excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ideas may be all wrong, Wessex!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that he
      may have gone the same way as the chief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was mightily anxious to get out, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no idea where he went?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the slightest. Following his performance of last night, of course I
      was compelled to instal a man in the chambers, and this morning someone
      rang up from the house of Lord Wolverham; he is commanding officer of one
      of the Guards battalions, I believe. It appears that Mr. Nicol Brinn not
      only locked up a representative of the Criminal Investigation Department,
      but also stole a Rolls Royce car from outside the Cavalry Club!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Innes. &ldquo;Stole a car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stole Lord Wolverham&rsquo;s car and calmly drove away in it. We have failed to
      trace both car and man!&rdquo; The detective inspector sighed wearily. &ldquo;Well, I
      suppose I must get along to the Yard. Stokes has got the laugh on me this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wearing a very gloomy expression, the detective inspector proceeded on
      foot to New Scotland Yard, and being informed on his arrival upstairs that
      the Assistant Commissioner was expecting him, he entered the office of
      that great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Assistant Commissioner, who had palpably seen military service, was a
      big man with very tired eyes, and a quiet, almost apologetic manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Detective Inspector,&rdquo; he said, as Wessex entered. &ldquo;I wanted to see
      you about this business of Mr. Nicol Brinn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Wessex; &ldquo;naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the Assistant Commissioner turned wearily in his chair, and glanced
      up at his subordinate&mdash;&ldquo;your accepting the parole of a suspect, under
      the circumstances, was officially improper, but I am not blaming you&mdash;I
      am not blaming you for a moment. Mr. Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s well-known reputation
      justified your behaviour.&rdquo; He laid one large hand firmly upon the table.
      &ldquo;Mr. Nicol Brinn&rsquo;s absence alters the matter entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well aware of it,&rdquo; murmured the inspector. &ldquo;Although,&rdquo; continued the
      Assistant Commissioner, &ldquo;Mr. Brinn&rsquo;s record leads me to believe that he
      will have some suitable explanation to offer, his behaviour, you will
      admit, is that of a guilty man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, sir; it certainly is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Press, fortunately, has learned nothing of this unpleasant business,
      particularly unpleasant because it involves such well-known people. You
      will see to it, Detective Inspector, that all publicity is avoided if
      possible. Meanwhile, as a matter of ordinary departmental routine, you
      will circulate Mr. Brinn&rsquo;s description through the usual channels, and&mdash;&rdquo;
       the Assistant Commissioner raised his eyebrows slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo; asked Wessex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. He must be arrested by the first officer who recognizes him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir. I will move in the matter at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, please.&rdquo; The Assistant Commissioner sighed wearily, as one of his
      telephones set up a muted buzzing. &ldquo;That is all for the moment, I think.
      Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Inspector Wessex came out, quietly closing the door behind him.
      He felt that he had been let down very lightly. But nevertheless he was
      unpleasantly warm, and as he walked slowly along the corridor he whistled
      softly, and:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest of Mr. Nicol Brinn,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What a headline, if they ever
      get it!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. AT HILLSIDE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon arrived at Hillside in a state of mind which she found
      herself unable to understand. Mrs. McMurdoch, who had accepted the
      invitation under protest, saying that if Doctor McMurdoch had been at home
      he would certainly have disapproved, had so utterly fallen under the
      strange spell of Ormuz Khan, that long before they had come to Hillside
      she was hanging upon his every word in a way which was almost pathetic to
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Phil Abingdon had taken up a definite attitude of
      defense; and perceiving this, because of his uncanny intuitiveness, the
      Persian had exerted himself to the utmost, more often addressing Phil than
      her companion, and striving to regain that mastery of her emotions which
      he had formerly achieved, at least in part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her feelings, however, were largely compounded of fear, and fear
      strengthened her defense. The repulsive part of Ormuz Khan&rsquo;s character
      became more apparent to her than did the fascination which she had once
      experienced. She distrusted him, distrusted him keenly. She knew at the
      bottom of her heart that this had always been so, but she had suffered his
      attentions in much the same spirit as that which imbues the naturalist who
      studies the habits of a poisonous reptile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that she was playing with fire, and in this knowledge lay a
      dangerous pleasure. She had the utmost faith in her own common sense, and
      was ambitious to fence with edged tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last the car was drawn up before the porch of Hillside, and Ormuz
      Khan, stepping out, assisted the ladies to alight, for one moment Phil
      Abingdon hesitated, although she knew that it was already too late to do
      so. They were received by Mr. Rama Dass, his excellency&rsquo;s courteous
      secretary, whom she had already met, and whom Ormuz Khan presented to Mrs.
      McMurdoch. Almost immediately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have missed Mr. Harley by only a few minutes,&rdquo; said Rama Dass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, her eyes opening very widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is no occasion for alarm,&rdquo; explained the secretary in his
      urbane manner. &ldquo;He has ventured as far as Lower Claybury station. The
      visit was unavoidable. He particularly requested that we should commence
      luncheon, but hoped to be back before we should have finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon glanced rapidly from the face of the speaker to that of
      Ormuz Khan. But her scrutiny of those unreadable countenances availed her
      nothing. She was conscious of a great and growing uneasiness; and Mrs.
      McMurdoch, misunderstanding the expression upon her face, squeezed her arm
      playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, dear,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;he will be here soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil knew that her face had flushed deeply. Partly she was glad of her
      emotions, and partly ashamed. This sweet embarrassment in which there was
      a sort of pain was a new experience, but one wholly delightful. She
      laughed, and accepting the arm of Ormuz Khan, walked into a very
      English-looking library, followed by Rama Dass and Mrs. McMurdoch. The
      house, she thought, was very silent, and she found herself wondering why
      no servants had appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rama Dass had taken charge of the ladies&rsquo; cloaks in the hall, and in spite
      of the typical English environment in which she found herself, Phil sat
      very near to Mrs. McMurdoch on a settee, scarcely listening to the
      conversation, and taking no part in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there was a strange and disturbing air of loneliness about Hillside.
      She would have welcomed the appearance of a butler or a parlourmaid, or
      any representative of the white race. Yes: there lay the root of the
      matter&mdash;this feeling of aloofness from all that was occidental, a
      feeling which the English appointments of the room did nothing to dispel.
      Then a gong sounded and the party went in to lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white-robed Hindu waited at table, and Phil discovered his movements to
      be unpleasantly silent. There was something very unreal about it all. She
      found herself constantly listening for the sound of an approaching car, of
      a footstep, of a voice, the voice of Paul Harley. This waiting presently
      grew unendurable, and:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Mr. Harley is safe,&rdquo; she said, in a rather unnatural tone. &ldquo;Surely
      he should have returned by now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ormuz Khan shrugged his slight shoulders and glanced at a diamond-studded
      wrist watch which he wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to fear,&rdquo; he declared, in his soft, musical voice. &ldquo;He
      knows how to take care of himself. And&rdquo;&mdash;with a significant glance of
      his long, magnetic eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I am certain he will return as speedily as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, luncheon terminated, and Harley had not appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have sometimes expressed a desire,&rdquo; said Ormuz Khan, &ldquo;to see the
      interior of a Persian house. Permit me to show you the only really
      characteristic room which I allow myself in my English home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Endeavouring to conceal her great anxiety, Phil allowed herself to be
      conducted by the Persian to an apartment which realized her dreams of that
      Orient which she had never visited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three beautiful silver lanterns depended from a domed ceiling in which
      wonderfully woven tapestry was draped. The windows were partly obscured by
      carved wooden screens, and the light entered through little panels of
      coloured glass. There were cushioned divans, exquisite pottery, and a
      playful fountain plashing in a marble pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormuz Khan conducted her to a wonderfully carven chair over which a
      leopard&rsquo;s skin was draped and there she seated herself. She saw through a
      wide doorway before her a long and apparently unfurnished room dimly
      lighted. At the farther end she could vaguely discern violet-coloured
      draperies. Ormuz Khan gracefully threw himself upon a divan to the right
      of this open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, Miss Abingdon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a nearly exact reproduction of a room
      of a house which I have in Ispahan. I do not claim that it is typical, but
      does its manner appeal to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immensely,&rdquo; she replied, looking around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became aware of a heavy perfume of hyacinths, and presently observed
      that there were many bowls of those flowers set upon little tables, and in
      niches in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet its atmosphere is not truly of the Orient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are such apartments uncommon, then, in Persia?&rdquo; asked Phil, striving
      valiantly to interest herself in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say so,&rdquo; he returned, crossing one delicate foot over the other,
      in languorous fashion. &ldquo;But many things which are typically of the Orient
      would probably disillusion you, Miss Abingdon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; she asked, wondering why Mrs. McMurdoch had not joined
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In many subtle ways. The real wonder and the mystery of the East lie not
      upon the surface, but beneath it. And beneath the East of to-day lies the
      East of yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker&rsquo;s expression grew rapt, and he spoke in the mystic manner
      which she knew and now dreaded. Her anxiety for the return of Paul Harley
      grew urgent&mdash;a positive need, as, meeting the gaze of the long,
      magnetic eyes, she felt again, like the touch of cold steel, all the
      penetrating force of this man&rsquo;s will. She was angrily aware of the fact
      that his gaze was holding hers hypnotically, that she was meeting it
      contrary to her wish and inclination. She wanted to look away but found
      herself looking steadily into the coal-black eyes of Ormuz Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The East of yesterday&rdquo;&mdash;his haunting voice seemed to reach her from
      a great distance&mdash;&ldquo;saw the birth of all human knowledge and human
      power; and to us the East of yesterday is the East of today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil became aware that a sort of dreamy abstraction was creeping over her,
      when in upon this mood came a sound which stimulated her weakening powers
      of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimly, for all the windows of the room were closed, she heard a car come
      up and stop before the house. It aroused her from the curious condition of
      lethargy into which she was falling. She turned her head sharply aside,
      the physical reflection of a mental effort to remove her gaze from the
      long, magnetic eyes of Ormuz Khan. And:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that is Mr. Harley?&rdquo; she asked, and failed to recognize her
      own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; returned the Persian, speaking very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one ivory hand he touched his knee for a moment, the only expression
      of disappointment which he allowed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask you to go and enquire?&rdquo; continued Phil, now wholly mistress of
      herself again. &ldquo;I am wondering, too, what can have become of Mrs.
      McMurdoch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will find out,&rdquo; said Ormuz Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, his every movement possessing a sort of feline grace. He bowed
      and walked out of the room. Phil Abingdon heard in the distance the motor
      restarted and the car being driven away from Hillside. She stood up
      restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the calm of the Persian&rsquo;s manner she had detected the presence of
      dangerous fires. The silence of the house oppressed her. She was not
      actually frightened yet, but intuitively she knew that all was not well.
      Then came a new sound arousing active fear at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone was rapping upon one of the long, masked windows! Phil Abingdon
      started back with a smothered exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; came a high, cool voice, &ldquo;open this window. You are in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice was odd, peculiar, but of one thing she was certain. It was not
      the voice of an Oriental. Furthermore, it held a note of command, and
      something, too, which inspired trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked quickly about her to make sure that she was alone. And then,
      running swiftly to the window from which the sound had come, she moved a
      heavy gilded fastening which closed it, and drew open the heavy leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      A narrow terrace was revealed with a shrubbery beyond; and standing on the
      terrace was a tall, thin man wearing a light coat over evening dress. He
      looked pale, gaunt, and unshaven, and although the regard of his light
      eyes was almost dreamy, there was something very tense in his pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Nicol Brinn,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;I knew your father. You have
      walked into a trap. I am here to get you out of it. Can you drive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean an automobile?&rdquo; asked Phil, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Rolls Royce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My furs! my hat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something bigger is at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all wildly bizarre, almost unbelievable. Phil Abingdon had
      experienced in her own person the insidious power of Ormuz Khan. She now
      found herself under the spell of a personality at least as forceful,
      although in a totally different way. She found herself running through a
      winding path amid bushes, piloted by this strange, unshaven man, to whom
      on sight she had given her trust unquestioningly!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we reach the car,&rdquo; he said over his shoulder, &ldquo;ask no questions&mdash;head
      for home, and don&rsquo;t stop for anything&mdash;on two legs or on four. That&rsquo;s
      the first thing&mdash;most important; then, when you know you&rsquo;re safe,
      telephone Scotland Yard to send a raid squad down by road, and do it
      quick.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. THE CHASE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The events which led to the presence of Mr. Nicol Brinn at so opportune a
      moment were&mdash;consistent with the character of that remarkable man&mdash;of
      a sensational nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having commandeered the Rolls Royce from the door of the Cavalry Club, he
      had immediately, by a mental process which many perils had perfected,
      dismissed the question of rightful ownership from his mind. The fact that
      he might be intercepted by police scouts he refused to entertain. The
      limousine driven by the Hindu chauffeur was still in sight, and until Mr.
      Nicol Brinn had seen it garaged, nothing else mattered, nothing else
      counted, and nothing else must be permitted to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jamming his hat tightly upon his head, he settled down at the wheel,
      drawing up rather closer to the limousine as the chase lay through crowded
      thoroughfares and keeping his quarry comfortably in sight across
      Westminster Bridge and through the outskirts of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had carefully timed the drive to the unknown abode of Fire-Tongue, and
      unless it had been prolonged, the more completely to deceive him, he had
      determined that the house lay not more than twenty miles from Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mitcham was passed, and the limousine headed straight on into Surrey,
      he decided that there had been no doubling, but that the house to which he
      had been taken lay in one of these unsuspected country backwaters, which,
      while they are literally within sight of the lights of London, have
      nevertheless a remoteness as complete as secrecy could desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the deserted country roads which he feared, for if the man ahead of
      him should suspect pursuit, a difficult problem might arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      By happy chance Nicol Brinn, an enthusiastic motorist, knew the map of
      Surrey as few Englishmen knew it. Indeed, there was no beauty spot within
      a forty-mile radius of London to which he could not have driven by the
      best and shortest route, at a moment&rsquo;s notice. This knowledge aided him
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      For presently at a fork in the road he saw that the driver of the
      limousine had swung to the left, taking the low road, that to the right
      offering a steep gradient. The high road was the direct road to Lower
      Claybury, the low road a detour to the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn mentally reviewed the intervening countryside, and taking a
      gambler&rsquo;s chance, took the Rolls Royce up the hill. He knew exactly what
      he was about, and he knew that the powerful engine would eat up the slope
      with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its behaviour exceeded his expectations, and he found himself mounting the
      acclivity at racing speed. At its highest point, the road, skirting a
      hilltop, offered an extensive view of the valley below. Here Nicol Brinn
      pulled up and, descending, watched and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the stillness he could plainly hear the other automobile humming
      steadily along the lowland road below. He concentrated his mind upon the
      latter part of that strange journey, striving to recall any details which
      had marked it immediately preceding the time when he had detected the
      rustling of leaves and knew that they had entered a carriage drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there had been a short but steep hill; and immediately before this
      the car had passed over a deeply rutted road, or&mdash;he had a sudden
      inspiration&mdash;over a level crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew of just such a hilly road immediately behind Lower Claybury
      station. Indeed, it was that by which he should be compelled to descend if
      he continued to pursue his present route to the town. He could think of no
      large, detached house, the Manor Park excepted, which corresponded to the
      one which he sought. But that in taking the high road he had acted even
      more wisely than he knew, he was now firmly convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined to proceed as far as the park gates as speedily as possible.
      Therefore, returning to the wheel, he sent the car along the now level
      road at top speed, so that the railings of the Manor Park, when presently
      he found himself skirting the grounds, had the semblance of a continuous
      iron fence wherever the moonlight touched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed the head of the road dipping down to Lower Claybury, but forty
      yards beyond pulled up and descended. Again he stood listening, and:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear the other car labouring up the slope. He ran along to the
      corner of the lane, and, crouching close under the bushes, waited for its
      appearance. As he had supposed, the chauffeur turned the car to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; muttered Nicol Brinn again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a baggage-rack immediately above the number plate. Upon this
      Nicol Brinn sprang with the agility of a wildcat, settling himself upon
      his perilous perch before the engine had had time to gather speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When presently the car turned into the drive of Hillside, Nicol Brinn
      dropped off and dived into the bushes on the right of the path. From this
      hiding place he saw the automobile driven around the front of the house to
      the garage, which was built out from the east wing. Not daring to pursue
      his investigations until the chauffeur had retired, he sought a more
      comfortable spot near a corner of the lawn and there, behind a bank of
      neglected flowers, lay down, watching the man&rsquo;s shadowy figure moving
      about in the garage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he was some distance from the doors he could see that there was a
      second car in the place&mdash;a low, torpedo-bodied racer, painted
      battleship gray. This sight turned his thoughts in another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very cautiously he withdrew to the drive again, retracing his steps to the
      lane, and walking back to the spot where he had left the Rolls Royce, all
      the time peering about him to right and left. He was looking for a
      temporary garage for the car, but one from which, if necessary, he could
      depart in a hurry. The shell of an ancient barn, roofless and desolate,
      presently invited inspection and, as a result, a few minutes later Colonel
      Lord Wolverham&rsquo;s luxurious automobile was housed for the night in these
      strange quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Nicol Brinn returned to Hillside, he found the garage locked and the
      lights extinguished. Standing under a moss-grown wall which sheltered him
      from the house, from his case he selected a long black cigar, lighted it
      with care and, having his hands thrust in the pockets of his light
      overcoat and the cigar protruding aggressively from the left corner of his
      mouth, he moved along to an angle of the wall and stared reflectively at
      the silent house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mental picture arose of a secret temple in the shadow of the distant
      Himalayas. Was it credible that this quiet country house, so typical of
      rural England, harboured that same dread secret which he had believed to
      be locked away in those Indian hills? Could he believe that the dark and
      death-dealing power which he had seen at work in the East was now centred
      here, within telephone-call of London?
    </p>
    <p>
      The fate of Sir Charles Abingdon and of Paul Harley would seem to indicate
      that such was the case. Beyond doubt, the document of which Rama Dass had
      spoken was some paper in the possession of the late Sir Charles. Much that
      had been mysterious was cleared up. He wondered why it had not occurred to
      him from the first that Sir Charles&rsquo;s inquiry, which he had mentioned to
      Paul Harley, respecting Fire-Tongue, had been due to the fact that the
      surgeon had seen the secret mark upon his arm after the accident in the
      Haymarket. He remembered distinctly that his sleeve had been torn upon
      that occasion. He could not imagine, however, what had directed the
      attention of the organization to Sir Charles, and for what reason his
      death had been decided upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled his cigar from corner to corner of his mouth, staring
      reflectively with lack-lustre eyes at the silent house before him. In the
      moonlight it made a peaceful picture enough. A cautious tour of the place
      revealed a lighted window upon the first floor. Standing in the shadow of
      an old apple tree, Nicol Brinn watched the blind of this window minute
      after minute, patiently waiting for a shadow to appear upon it; and at
      last his patience was rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shadow appeared&mdash;the shadow of a woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn dropped his cigar at his feet and set his heel upon it. A
      bitter-sweet memory which had been with him for seven years arose again in
      his mind. There is a kind of mountain owl in certain parts of northern
      India which possesses a curiously high, plaintive note. He wondered if he
      could remember and reproduce that note.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made the attempt, repeating the cry three times. At the third
      repetition the light in the first floor window went out. He heard the
      sound of the window being gently opened. Then a voice&mdash;a voice which
      held the sweetest music in the world for the man who listened below&mdash;spoke
      softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicol!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naida!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Come down to me. You must. Don&rsquo;t answer. I will wait
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise you will let me return!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. THE CATASTROPHE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first faint spears of morning creeping through the trees which
      surrounded Hillside revealed two figures upon a rustic bench in the little
      orchard adjoining the house. A pair incongruous enough&mdash;this
      dark-eyed Eastern woman, wrapped in a long fur cloak, and Nicol Brinn,
      gaunt, unshaven, fantastic in his evening dress, revealed now in the gray
      morning light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; whispered Naida. &ldquo;It is the dawn. I must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn clenched his teeth tightly but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised,&rdquo; she said, and although her voice was very tender she
      strove to detach his arm, which was locked about her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my word. I made a contract with hell with my eyes open, and
      I&rsquo;ll stick to it.&rdquo; He stood up suddenly. &ldquo;Go back, Naida!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go
      back! You have my promise, now, and I&rsquo;m helpless. But at last I see a way,
      and I&rsquo;m going to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she cried, standing up and clutching his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind.&rdquo; His tone was cool again. &ldquo;Just go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never broke my word in my life, and even now I&rsquo;m not going to begin.
      While you live I stay silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the growing light Naida looked about her affrightedly. Then, throwing
      her arms impulsively around Brinn, she kissed him&mdash;a caress that was
      passionate but sexless; rather the kiss of a mother who parts with a
      beloved son than that which a woman bestows upon the man she loves; an act
      of renunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered a low cry and would have seized her in his arms but, lithely
      evading him, she turned, stifling a sob, and darted away through the trees
      toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      For long he stood looking after her, fists clenched and his face very gray
      in the morning light. Some small inner voice told him that his new plan,
      and the others which he had built upon it, must crumble and fall as a
      castle of sand. He groaned and, turning aside, made his way through the
      shrubbery to the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was become accessory to a murder; for he had learned for what reason
      and by what means Sir Charles Abingdon had been assassinated. He had even
      learned the identity of his assassin; had learned that the dreaded being
      called Fire-Tongue in India was known and respected throughout the
      civilized world as His Excellency Ormuz Khan!
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley had learned these things also, and now at this very hour Paul
      Harley lay a captive in Hillside. Naida had assured him that Paul Harley
      was alive and safe. It had been decided that his death would lead to the
      destruction of the movement, but pressure was being brought upon him to
      ensure his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he, Nicol Brinn, was bound and manacled to a gang of assassins; and
      because his tongue was tied, because the woman he loved better than
      anything in the world was actually a member of the murderous group, he
      must pace the deserted country lanes inactive; he must hold his hand,
      although he might summon the resources of New Scotland Yard by phoning
      from Lower Claybury station!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through life his word had been his bond, and Nicol Brinn was incapable of
      compromising with his conscience. But the direct way was barred to him.
      Nevertheless, no task could appal the inflexible spirit of the man, and he
      had registered a silent vow that Ormuz Khan should never leave England
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a soul was astir yet upon the country roads, and sitting down upon a
      grassy bank, Nicol Brinn lighted one of his black cigars, which in times
      of stress were his food and drink, upon which if necessary he could
      carry-on for forty-eight hours upon end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In connection with his plan for coercing Harley, Ormuz Khan had gone to
      London by rail on the previous night, departing from Lower Claybury
      station at about the time that Colonel Lord Wolverham came out of the
      Cavalry Club to discover his Rolls Royce to be missing. This same Rolls
      Royce was now a source of some anxiety to Nicol Brinn, for its discovery
      by a passing labourer in the deserted barn seemed highly probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he had matters of greater urgency to think about, not the least
      of these being the necessity of concealing his presence in the
      neighbourhood of Hillside. Perhaps his Sioux-like face reflected a spirit
      allied in some respects to that of the once great Indian tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      His genius for taking cover, perfected upon many a big-game expedition,
      enabled him successfully to accomplish the feat; so that, when the
      limousine, which he had watched go by during the morning, returned shortly
      after noon, the lack-lustre eyes were peering out through the bushes near
      the entrance to the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinct told him that the pretty girl with whom Ormuz Khan was deep in
      conversation could be none other than Phil Abingdon, but the identity of
      her companion he could not even guess. On the other hand, that this
      poisonously handsome Hindu, who bent forward so solicitously toward his
      charming travelling companion, was none other than the dreaded
      Fire-Tongue, he did not doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to a strategic position which he had discovered during the
      night. In a measure he was nonplussed. That the presence of the girl was
      primarily associated with the coercion of Paul Harley, he understood; but
      might it not portend something even more sinister?
    </p>
    <p>
      When, later, the limousine departed again, at great risk of detection he
      ran across a corner of the lawn to peer out into the lane, in order that
      he might obtain a glimpse of its occupant. This proved to be none other
      than Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s elderly companion. She had apparently been taken ill,
      and a dignified Hindu gentleman, wearing gold-rimmed pince-nez, was in
      attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn clenched his jaws hard. The girl had fallen into a trap. He
      turned rapidly, facing the house. Only at one point did the shrubbery
      approach the wall, but for that point he set out hot foot, passing from
      bush to bush with Indian cleverness, tense, alert, and cool in despite of
      his long vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he came to the shallow veranda with its four sightless windows
      backed by fancifully carven screens. He stepped up to the first of these
      and pressed his ear against the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate was with him, for almost immediately he detected a smooth, musical
      voice speaking in the room beyond. A woman&rsquo;s voice answered and, listening
      intently, he detected the sound of a closing door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he acted: with the result, as has appeared, that Phil Abingdon,
      hatless, without her furs, breathless and more frightened than she had
      ever been in her life, presently found herself driving a luxurious Rolls
      Royce out of a roofless barn on to the highroad, and down the slope to
      Claybury station.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at about this time, or a little later, that Paul Harley put into
      execution a project which he had formed. The ventilator above the divan,
      which he had determined to be the spy-hole through which his every
      movement was watched, had an ornamental framework studded with metal
      knobs. He had recently discovered an electric bell-push in the centre
      panel of the massive door of his prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly on fire, imagining a thousand and one horrors centring about the
      figure of Phil Abingdon, but retaining his outward calm by dint of a giant
      effort, he pressed this bell and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps two minutes elapsed. Then the glass doors beyond the gilded screen
      were drawn open, and the now-familiar voice spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paul Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have made my final decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wise,&rdquo; the voice replied. &ldquo;A statement will be placed before you
      for signature. When you have signed it, ring the bell again, and in a few
      minutes you will be free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely he detected the speaker withdrawing. Thereupon, heaving a loud
      sigh, he removed his coat, looked about him as if in quest of some place
      to hang it, and finally, fixing his gaze upon the studded grating, stood
      upon the divan and hung his coat over the spy-hole! This accomplished, he
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table was slowly sinking through the gap in the floor beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treading softly, he moved forward and seated himself cross-legged upon it!
      It continued to descend, and he found himself in absolute darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn ran on to the veranda and paused for a moment to take breath.
      The window remained open, as Phil Abingdon had left it. He stepped into
      the room with its elegant Persian appointments. It was empty. But as he
      crossed the threshold, he paused, arrested by the sound of a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A statement will be placed before you,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;and when you
      have signed it, in a few minutes you will be free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn silently dropped flat at the back of a divan, as Rama Dass,
      coming out of the room which communicated with the golden screen, made his
      way toward the distant door. Having one eye raised above the top of the
      cushions, Nicol Brinn watched him, recognizing the man who had accompanied
      the swooning lady. She had been deposited, then, at no great distance from
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to learn later that poor Mrs. McMurdoch, in her artificially
      induced swoon, had been left in charge of a hospitable cottager, while her
      solicitous Oriental escort had sped away in quest of a physician. But at
      the moment matters of even greater urgency engaged his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeping forward to the doorway by which Rama Dass had gone out, Nicol
      Brinn emerged upon a landing from which stairs both ascended and
      descended. Faint sounds of footsteps below guided him, and although from
      all outward seeming he appeared to saunter casually down, his left hand
      was clutching the butt of a Colt automatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presently found himself in a maze of basements&mdash;kitchens of the
      establishment, no doubt. The sound of footsteps no longer guided him. He
      walked along, and in a smaller deserted pantry discovered the base of a
      lift shaft in which some sort of small elevator worked. He was staring at
      this reflectively, when, for the second time in his adventurous career, a
      silken cord was slipped tightly about his throat!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tripped and thrown. He fought furiously, but the fatal knee
      pressure came upon his spine so shrewdly as to deprive him of the strength
      to raise his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My finish!&rdquo; were the words that flashed through his mind, as sounds like
      the waves of a great ocean beat upon his ears and darkness began to
      descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, miraculously, the pressure ceased; the sound of great waters
      subsided; and choking, coughing, he fought his way back to life, groping
      like a blind man and striving to regain his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brinn!&rdquo; said a vaguely familiar voice. &ldquo;Mr. Brinn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The realities reasserted themselves. Before him, pale, wide-eyed, and
      breathing heavily, stood Paul Harley; and prone upon the floor of the
      pantry lay Rama Dass, still clutching one end of the silken rope in his
      hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harley!&rdquo; gasped Brinn. &ldquo;My God, sir!&rdquo; He clutched at his bruised
      throat. &ldquo;I have to thank you for my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, looking down at the prone figure as Harley, dropping upon his
      knees, turned the man over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I struck him behind the ear,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and gave him every ounce.
      Good heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had slipped his hand inside Rama Dass&rsquo;s vest, and now he looked up, his
      face very grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; said Brinn, coolly. &ldquo;He asked for it; he&rsquo;s got it. Take
      this.&rdquo; He thrust the Colt automatic into Harley&rsquo;s hand as the latter stood
      up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; asked Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search the house,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Everything coloured you see, shoot,
      unless I say no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abingdon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s safe. Follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Straight up two flights of stairs led Nicol Brinn, taking three steps at a
      stride. Palpably enough the place was deserted. Ormuz Khan&rsquo;s plans for
      departure were complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into two rooms on the first floor they burst, to find them stripped and
      bare. On the threshold of the third Brinn stopped dead, and his gaunt face
      grew ashen. Then he tottered across the room, arms outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naida,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;My love, my love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley withdrew quietly. He had begun to walk along the corridor when
      the sound of a motor brought him up sharply. A limousine was being driven
      away from the side entrance! Not alone had he heard that sound. His face
      deathly, and the lack-lustre eyes dully on fire, Nicol Brinn burst out of
      the room and, not heeding the presence of Harley, hurled himself down the
      stairs. He was as a man demented, an avenging angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; cried Harley&mdash;&ldquo;heading for the Dover Road!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicol Brinn, at the wheel of the racer&mdash;the same in which Harley had
      made his fateful journey and which had afterward been concealed in the
      garage at Hillside&mdash;scarcely nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer they drew to the quarry, and nearer. Once&mdash;twice&mdash;and
      again, the face of Ormuz Khan peered out of the window at the rear of the
      limousine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew abreast; the road was deserted. And they passed slightly ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Harley glanced at the granite face of his companion with an
      apprehension he was unable to conceal. This was a cool madman who drove.
      What did he intend to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Inch by inch, Nicol Brinn edged the torpedo body nearer to the wheels of
      the racing limousine. The Oriental chauffeur drew in ever closer to the
      ditch bordering the roadside. He shouted hoarsely and was about to apply
      the brakes when the two cars touched!
    </p>
    <p>
      A rending crash came&mdash;a hoarse scream&mdash;and the big limousine
      toppled over into the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley felt himself hurled through space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I follow on to Lower Claybury, sir?&rdquo; asked Inspector Wessex,
      excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil Abingdon&rsquo;s message had come through nearly an hour before, and a
      party had been despatched in accordance with Brinn&rsquo;s instructions. Wessex
      had returned to New Scotland Yard too late to take charge, and now, before
      the Assistant Commissioner had time to reply, a &lsquo;phone buzzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the Assistant Commissioner, taking up one of the several
      instruments: &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even this great man, so justly celebrated for his placid demeanour, was
      unable to conceal his amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Let him come up!&rdquo; He replaced the receiver and turning
      to Wessex: &ldquo;Mr. Nicol Brinn is here!&rdquo; he informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; cried the inspector, quite startled out of his usual
      deferential manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Footsteps sounded in the corridor. Came a rap at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the Assistant Commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was thrown open and Nicol Brinn entered. One who knew him well
      would have said that he had aged ten years. Even to the eye of Wessex he
      looked an older man. He wore a shoddy suit and a rough tweed cap and his
      left arm was bandaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, without other greeting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to make a
      statement. I desire that a shorthand-writer attend to take it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped weakly into a chair which Wessex placed for him. The Assistant
      Commissioner, doubtless stimulated by the manner of his extraordinary
      visitor, who now extracted a cigar from the breast pocket of his
      ill-fitting jacket and nonchalantly lighted it, successfully resumed his
      well-known tired manner, and, pressing a bell:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One shall attend, Mr. Brinn,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock came at the door and a sergeant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Ferris,&rdquo; directed the Assistant Commissioner. &ldquo;Quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later a man came in carrying a note book and fountain pen. The
      Assistant Commissioner motioned him to a chair, and:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray proceed, Mr. Brinn,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. NICOL BRINN&rsquo;S STORY OF THE CITY OF FIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The statement which I have to make, gentlemen, will almost certainly
      appear incredible to you. However, when it has been transcribed I will
      sign it. And I am going to say here and now that there are points in the
      narrative which I am in a position to substantiate. What I can&rsquo;t prove you
      must take my word for. But I warn you that the story is tough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a certain reputation for recklessness. I don&rsquo;t say it may not be
      inherent; but if you care to look the matter up, you will find that the
      craziest phase of my life is that covering the last seven years. The
      reason why I have courted death during that period I am now about to
      explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although my father was no traveller, I think I was born with the
      wanderlust. I started to explore the world in my Harvard vacations, and
      when college days were over I set about the business whole-heartedly.
      Where I went and what I did, up to the time that my travels led me to
      India, is of no interest to you or to anybody else, because in India I
      found heaven and hell&mdash;a discovery enough to satisfy the most
      adventurous man alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this present time, gentlemen, I am not going to load you with
      geographical details. The exact spot at which my life ended, in a sense
      which I presently hope to make clear, can be located at leisure by the
      proper authorities, to whom I will supply a detailed map which I have in
      my possession. I am even prepared to guide the expedition, if the Indian
      Government considers an expedition necessary and cares to accept my
      services. It&rsquo;s good enough for you to know that pig-sticking and
      tiger-hunting having begun to pall upon me somewhat, I broke away from
      Anglo-Indian hospitality, and headed up country, where the Himalayas
      beckoned. I had figured on crossing at a point where no man has crossed
      yet, but that project was interrupted, and I&rsquo;m here to tell you why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up there in the northwest provinces they told me I was crazy when I
      outlined, one night in a mess, of which I was a guest at the time, my
      scheme for heading northeast toward a tributary of the Ganges which would
      bring me to the neighbourhood of Khatmandu, right under the shadow of
      Everest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Once you leave Khatmandu,&rsquo; said the mess president, &lsquo;you are outside the
      pale as far as British influence is concerned. I suppose you understand
      that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him I quite understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t reach Tibet that way,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind, sir,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;I can try, if I feel like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three days later I set out. I am not superstitious, and if I take a long
      time to make a plan, once I&rsquo;ve made it I generally stick to it. But right
      at the very beginning of my expedition I had a warning, if ever a man had
      one. The country through which my route lay is of very curious formation.
      If you can imagine a section of your own west country viewed through a
      giant magnifying glass, you have some sort of picture of the territory in
      which I found myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gigantic rocks stand up like monstrous tors, or towers, sometimes
      offering sheer precipices of many hundreds of feet in height. On those
      sides of these giant tors, however, which are less precipitous, miniature
      forests are sometimes found, and absolutely impassable jungles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bordering an independent state, this territory is not at all well known,
      but I had secured as a guide a man named Vadi&mdash;or that was the name
      he gave me whom I knew to be a high-caste Brahmin of good family. He had
      been with me for some time, and I thought I could trust him. Therefore,
      once clear of British territory, I took him into my confidence respecting
      the real object of my journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was not primarily to scale a peak of the Himalayas, nor even to
      visit Khatmandu, but to endeavour to obtain a glimpse of the Temple of
      Fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has excited your curiosity, gentlemen. I don&rsquo;t suppose any one here
      has ever heard of the Temple of Fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By some it is regarded as a sort of native legend but it is more than a
      legend. It is a fact. For seven years I have known it to be a fact, but my
      tongue has been tied. Listen. Even down in Bombay, the coming of the next
      great Master is awaited by certain of the natives; and for more than ten
      years now it has been whispered from end to end of India that he was about
      to proclaim himself, that disciples moved secretly among the people of
      every province, and that the unknown teacher in person awaited his hour in
      a secret temple up near the Tibetan frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A golden key opens many doors, gentlemen, and at the time of which I am
      speaking I had obtained more information respecting this secret religion
      or cult than any other member of the white races had ever collected, or so
      I thought at the time. I had definite evidence to show that the existence
      of this man, or demi-god&mdash;for by some he was said to possess
      superhuman powers&mdash;was no myth, but an actual fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The collecting of this data was extremely perilous, and one of my
      informants, with whom I had come in contact while passing through the
      central provinces, died mysteriously the night before I left Nagpur. I
      wondered very much on my way north why I was not molested, for I did not
      fail to see that the death of the man in Nagpur was connected with the
      fact that he had divulged to me some of the secrets of the religion of
      Fire-Tongue. Indeed, it was from him that I first learned the name of the
      high priest of the cult of Fire. Why I was not molested I learned later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to return to Vadi, my Brahmin guide. We had camped for the night in
      the shadow of one of those giant tors which I have mentioned. The bearers
      were seated around their fire at some little distance from us, and Vadi
      and I were consulting respecting our route in the morning, when I decided
      to take him into my confidence. Accordingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Vadi,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I know for a positive fact that we are within ten miles
      of the secret Temple of Fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget the look in his eyes, with the reflection of the
      firelight dancing in them; but he never moved a muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The sahib is wise,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So is Vadi,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Therefore he knows how happy a thousand pounds of
      English money would make him. It is his in return for a sight of the
      Temple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still as a carven image, he squatted there watching me, unmoving,
      expressionless. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A man may die for nothing,&rsquo; he returned, softly. &lsquo;Why should the sahib
      pay a thousand pounds?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why should the sahib die?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is forbidden for any to see the Temple, even from a distance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But if no one ever knows that I have seen it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fire-Tongue knows everything,&rsquo; he replied, and as he pronounced the
      name, he performed a curious salutation, touching his forefinger with the
      tip of his tongue, and then laying his hand upon his brow, upon his lips,
      and upon his breast, at the same time bowing deeply. &lsquo;His vengeance is
      swift and terrible. He wills a man to die, and the man is dead. None save
      those who have passed through the tests may set eyes upon his temple, nor
      even speak his name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This conversation took place, as I have already mentioned, in the shadow
      of one of those strange stone hillocks which abounded here, and it was at
      this point that I received a warning which might have deterred many men,
      since it was inexplicable and strangely awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My attention was drawn to the phenomenon by a sudden cessation of chatter
      amongst the bearers seated around their fire. I became aware that an
      absolute stillness had fallen, and in the eyes of the Brahmin who sat
      facing me I saw a look of exaltation, of wild fanaticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jerked my head around, looking back over my shoulder, and what I saw I
      shall never forget, nor to this day have I been able to explain the means
      by which the illusion was produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moving downward toward me through the jungle darkness, slowly, evenly,
      but at a height above the ground of what I judged to be about fifteen
      feet, was a sort of torch or flambeau, visible because it was faintly
      luminous; and surmounting it was a darting tongue of blue flame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the moment that I set eyes upon this apparently supernatural spectacle
      the bearers, crying some word in Hindustani which I did not understand,
      rose and fled in a body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may say here that I never saw any of them again; although, considering
      that they took nothing with them, how they regained the nearest village is
      a mystery which I have never solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I know the East as few of my fellow-citizens know it. I know
      something of the powers which are latent in some Orientals and active in
      others. That my Brahmin guide was a hypnotist and an illusionist, I have
      since thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For, even as the pattering footsteps of the bearers grew faint in the
      distance, the fiery torch disappeared as if by magic, and a silken cord
      was about my throat!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I began a desperate fight for life, I realized that, whatever else
      Vadi might be, he was certainly an expert thug. The jungle, the rocks,
      seemed to swim around me as I crashed to the ground and felt the Brahmin&rsquo;s
      knee in the small of my back.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. STORY OF THE CITY OF FIRE (CONTINUED)
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I managed to think of any defense against such an attack, and
      especially in the circumstances, is a matter I have often wondered about
      since. How, having thought of it, I succeeded in putting it into
      execution, is probably more wonderful still. But I will just state what
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may observe that I have large hands. Their size and strength served
      me well on this occasion. At the moment that the rope tightened about my
      throat I reached up and grasped the Brahmin&rsquo;s left thumb. Desperation gave
      me additional strength, and I snapped it like a stick of candy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just in the nick of time I felt the cord relax, and, although the veins
      in my head seemed to be bursting, I managed to get my fingers under that
      damnable rope. To this very hour I can hear Vadi&rsquo;s shriek of pain as I
      broke his thumb, and it brings the whole scene back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clutching the rope with my left hand, I groaned and lay still. The
      Brahmin slightly shifted his position, which was what I wanted him to do.
      The brief respite had been sufficient. As he moved, I managed to draw my
      knees up, very slightly, for he was a big, heavy man, but sufficiently to
      enable me to throw him off and roll over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, gentlemen, I dealt with him as he had meant to deal with me; only I
      used my bare hands and made a job of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stood up, breathing heavily, and looked down at him where he lay in the
      shadows at my feet. Dusk had come with a million stars, and almost above
      my head were flowering creepers festooned from bough to bough. The two
      campfires danced up and cast their red light upon the jagged rocks of the
      hillock, which started up from the very heart of the thicket, to stand out
      like some giant pyramid against the newly risen moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were night things on the wing, and strange whispering sounds came
      from the forests clothing the hills. Then came a distant, hollow booming
      like the sound of artillery, which echoed down the mountain gorges and
      seemed to roll away over the lowland swamps and die, inaudible, by the
      remote river. Yet I stood still, looking down at the dead man at my feet.
      For this strange, mysterious artillery was a phenomenon I had already met
      with on this fateful march&mdash;weird enough and inexplicable, but no
      novelty to me, for I had previously met with it in the Shan Hills of
      Burma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking rapidly. It was clear enough now why I had hitherto been
      unmolested. To Vadi the task had been allotted by the mysterious
      organization of which he was a member, of removing me quietly and
      decently, under circumstances which would lead to no official inquiry.
      Although only animals, insects, and reptiles seemed to be awake about me,
      yet I could not get rid of the idea that I was watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remembered the phantom light, and that memory was an unpleasant one.
      For ten minutes or more I stood there watching and listening, but nothing
      molested me, nothing human approached. With a rifle resting across my
      knees, I sat down in the entrance to my tent to await the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later in the night, those phantom guns boomed out again, and again their
      booming died away in the far valleys. The fires burned lower and lower,
      but I made no attempt to replenish them; and because I sat there so
      silent, all kinds of jungle creatures crept furtively out of the shadows
      and watched me with their glittering eyes. Once a snake crossed almost at
      my feet, and once some large creature of the cat species, possibly a puma,
      showed like a silhouette upon the rocky slopes above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the night passed, and dawn found me still sitting there, the dead man
      huddled on the ground not three paces from me. I am a man who as a rule
      thinks slowly, but when the light came my mind was fully made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the man who had died in Nagpur I had learned more about the location
      of the City of Fire than I had confided to Vadi. In fact, I thought I
      could undertake to find the way. Upon the most important point of all,
      however, I had no information: that is to say, I had no idea how to obtain
      entrance to the place; for I had been given to understand that the way in
      was a secret known only to the initiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I had no intention of turning back; and, although I
      realized that from this point onward I must largely trust to luck, I had
      no intention of taking unnecessary chances. Accordingly, I dressed myself
      in Vadi&rsquo;s clothes, and, being very tanned at this time, I think I made a
      fairly creditable native.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faintly throughout the night, above the other sounds of the jungle, I had
      heard that of distant falling water. Now, my informant at Nagpur, in
      speaking of the secret temple, had used the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whoever would see the fire must quit air and pass through water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This mysterious formula he had firmly declined to translate into
      comprehensible English; but during my journey I had been considering it
      from every angle, and I had recently come to the conclusion that the
      entrance to this mysterious place was in some way concealed by water.
      Recollecting the gallery under Niagara Falls, I wondered if some similar
      natural formation was to be looked for here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, in the light of the morning sun, looking around me from the little
      plateau upon which I stood, and remembering a vague description of the
      country which had been given to me, I decided that I was indeed in the
      neighbourhood of the Temple of Fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had followed a fairly well-defined path right to this plateau, and
      that it was nothing less than the high road to the citadel of Fire-Tongue,
      I no longer doubted. Beneath me stretched a panorama limned in feverish
      greens and unhealthy yellows. Scar-like rocks striated the jungle clothing
      the foothills, and through the dancing air, viewed from the arid heights,
      they had the appearance of running water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swamps to the southeast showed like unhealing wounds upon the face of the
      landscape. Beyond them spread the lower river waters, the bank of the
      stream proper being discernible only by reason of a greater greenness in
      the palm-tops. Venomous green slopes beyond them again, a fringe of dwarf
      forest, and the brazen skyline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the right, and above me yet, the path entered a district of volcanic
      rocks, gnarled, twisted, and contorted as with the agonies of some mighty
      plague which in a forgotten past had seized on the very bowels of the
      world and had contorted whole mountains and laid waste vast forests and
      endless plains. Above, the sun, growing hourly more cruel; ahead, more
      plague-twisted rocks and the scars dancing like running water; and all
      around the swooning stillness of the tropics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night sounds of the jungle had ceased, giving place to the ceaseless
      humming of insects. North, south, east, and west lay that haze of heat,
      like a moving mantle clothing hills and valleys. The sound of falling
      water remained perceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, gentlemen, I must relate a discovery which I had made in the act
      of removing Vadi&rsquo;s clothing. Upon his right forearm was branded a mark
      resembling the apparition which I had witnessed in the night, namely, a
      little torch, or flambeau, surmounted by a tongue of fire. Even in the
      light of the morning, amid that oppressive stillness, I could scarcely
      believe in my own safety, for that to Vadi the duty of assassinating me
      had been assigned by this ever-watchful, secret organization, whose
      stronghold I had dared to approach, was a fact beyond dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I seemed to be quite alone on the plateau, I could only suppose
      that the issue had been regarded as definitely settled, that no doubt had
      been entertained by Vadi&rsquo;s instructors respecting his success. The plateau
      upon which I stood was one of a series of giant steps, and on the west was
      a sheer descent to a dense jungle, where banks of rotten vegetation,
      sun-dried upon the top, lay heaped about the tree stems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dragging the heavy body of Vadi to the brink of this precipice, I toppled
      it over, swaying dizzily as I watched it crash down into the poisonous
      undergrowth two hundred feet below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made a rough cache, where I stored the bulk of my provisions; and,
      selecting only such articles as I thought necessary for my purpose, I set
      out again northward, guided by the sound of falling water, and having my
      face turned toward the silver pencillings in the blue sky, which marked
      the giant peaks of the distant mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At midday the heat grew so great that a halt became imperative. The path
      was still clearly discernible; and in a little cave beside it, which
      afforded grateful shelter from the merciless rays of the sun, I unfastened
      my bundle and prepared to take a frugal lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so employed, gentlemen, when I heard the sound of approaching
      footsteps on the path behind me&mdash;the path which I had recently
      traversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hastily concealing my bundle, I slipped into some dense undergrowth by
      the entrance to the cave, and crouched there, waiting and watching. I had
      not waited very long before a yellow-robed mendicant passed by, carrying a
      bundle not unlike my own, whereby I concluded that he had come some
      distance. There was nothing remarkable in his appearance except the fact
      of his travelling during the hottest part of the day. Therefore I did not
      doubt that he was one of the members of the secret organization and was
      bound for headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave him half an hour&rsquo;s start and then resumed my march. If he could
      travel beneath a noonday sun, so could I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this fashion I presently came out upon a larger and higher plateau,
      carpeted with a uniform, stunted undergrowth, and extending, as flat as a
      table, to the very edge of a sheer precipice, which rose from it to a
      height of three or four hundred feet&mdash;gnarled, naked rock, showing no
      vestige of vegetation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time the sound of falling water had become very loud, and as I
      emerged from the gorge through which the path ran on to this plateau I
      saw, on the further side of this tableland, the yellow robe of the
      mendicant. He was walking straight for the face of the precipice, and
      straight for the spot at which, from a fissure in the rock, a little
      stream leapt out, to fall sheerly ten or fifteen feet into a winding
      channel, along which it bubbled away westward, doubtless to form a greater
      waterfall beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mendicant was fully half a mile away from me, but in that clear
      tropical air was plainly visible; and, fearing that he might look around,
      I stepped back into the comparative shadow of the gorge and watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I saw a strange thing. Placing his bundle upon his head, he
      walked squarely into the face of the waterfall and disappeared!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. STORY OF THE CITY OF FIRE (CONTINUED)
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Quitting air, must pass through water.&rsquo; The meaning of those words
      became apparent enough. I stood at the foot of the waterfall, looking up
      at the fissure from which it issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although the fact had been most artistically disguised, I could not doubt
      that this fissure was artificial. A tunnel had been hewn through the rock,
      and a mountain stream diverted into it. Indeed, on close inspection, I saw
      that it was little more than a thin curtain of water, partly concealing
      what looked like the entrance of a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal of mist arose from it. But I could see that, beyond a
      ducking, I had little to fear; and, stepping down into the bed of the
      little stream which frothed and bubbled pleasantly about my bare legs, I
      set my bundle on my head as the mendicant had done, and plunged through
      the waterfall, into a place of delicious coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strange greenish light prevailed here and directly before me I saw a
      flight of stone steps leading upward through a tunnel in the rock. By the
      light of a pocket torch with which I had provided myself, I began to
      ascend the steps. These, as I have said, were hewn out of the solid rock,
      and as they numbered something like seven hundred, the labour expended
      upon the making of this extraordinary staircase must have been stupendous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first the character of the surrounding tunnel suggested that it was,
      in part at least, a natural cavern. But as I mounted higher and higher,
      solid masonry appeared in places, some of it displaying unusual carvings,
      of a character with which I was quite unfamiliar. I concluded that it was
      very ancient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should explain, gentlemen, that this ascending tunnel zigzagged in a
      peculiar fashion, which may have been due to the natural formation of the
      volcanic rock, or may have been part of the design of the original
      builder. I had ascended more than five hundred steps, and felt that a rest
      would shortly be necessary, when I reached a sort of cavern, or interior
      platform, from which seven corridors branched out like the spokes of a
      wheel. The top of this place was lost in shadows, which the ray of my
      torch failed to penetrate; and here I paused, setting down my bundle and
      wondering what my next move should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the damp coolness of the lower stairs an oppressive heat had now
      succeeded, and I became aware of a continuous roaring sound, which I found
      myself unable to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attached to a belt beneath my native dress I carried a Colt revolver; and
      therefore, leaving my rifle and bundle in a corner of the cavern, I
      selected one of these corridors more or less at random, and set out to
      explore. This corridor proved to slope very gently upward from the
      platform, and I could not fail to notice that at every step the heat grew
      greater and greater. A suffocating, sulphurous smell became perceptible
      also, and the roaring sound grew almost deafening. It became possible to
      discern the walls of the corridor ahead because of a sort of eerie bluish
      light which had now become visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I don&rsquo;t say that I hesitated in a physical sense: I went right
      on walking ahead. But a voice somewhere deep down inside me was whispering
      that this was the road to hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a point where the heat and the smell were almost unendurable the
      corridor was blocked by massive iron bars beyond which the reflection of
      some gigantic fire danced upon the walls of a vast cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heat was so great that my garments, saturated by the curtain of water
      through which I had passed, were now bone dry, and I stood peering through
      those bars at a spectacle which will remain with me to the merciful day of
      my death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred feet beneath me was a lake of fire! That is the only way I can
      describe it: a seething, bubbling lake of fire. And above, where the roof
      of the cavern formed a natural cone, was a square section formed of
      massive stone blocks, and quite obviously the handiwork of man. The bars
      were too hot to touch, and the heat was like that of a furnace, but while
      I stood, peering first upward and then downward, a thing happened which I
      almost hesitate to describe, for it sounds like an incident from a
      nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heralded by a rumbling sound which was perceptible above the roar of the
      fire below, the centre block in the roof slid open. A tremendous draught
      of air swept along the passage in which I was standing, and doubtless
      along other passages which opened upon this hell-pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if conjured up by magic, a monstrous column of blue flame arose, swept
      up scorchingly, and licked like the tongue of a hungry dragon upon the
      roof of the cavern. Instantly the trap was closed again; the tongue of
      fire dropped back into the lake from which it had arisen on the draught of
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And right past me where I stood, rigid with horror, looking through those
      bars, fell a white-robed figure&mdash;whether man or woman I could not
      determine! Down, down into the fiery pit, a hundred feet below!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One long-drawn, dying shriek reached my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my return to the place at which I had left my bundle and rifle I
      retain absolutely not one recollection. I was aroused from a sort of
      stupor of horror by the sight of a faint light moving across the platform
      ahead of me, as I was about to emerge from the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the light of a lantern, carried by a man who might have been the
      double of that yellow-robed mendicant who had first unconsciously led me
      to this accursed place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that, up to the moment of sighting him, my one idea had been
      to escape, to return, to quit this unholy spot. But now, as I watched the
      bearer of the lantern cross the platform and enter one of the seven
      corridors, that old, unquenchable thirst for new experiences got me by the
      throat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the light of the lantern was swallowed up in the passage, I found my
      bundle and rifle and set out to follow the man. Four paces brought me to
      the foot of more steps. I walked barefooted, frequently pausing to listen.
      There were many carvings upon the walls, but I had no leisure to examine
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contrary to my anticipations, however, there were no branches in this
      zigzag staircase, which communicated directly with the top of the lofty
      plateau. When presently I felt the fresh mountain air upon my face, I
      wondered why I could perceive no light ahead of me. Yet the reason was
      simple enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I had passed through that strange watergate to the City of Fire,
      the day had ended: it was night. And when, finding no further steps ahead
      of me, I passed along a level, narrow corridor for some ten paces and,
      looking upward, saw the stars, I was astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The yellow-robed man had disappeared, and I stood alone, looking down
      upon that secret city which I had come so far to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found myself standing in deep undergrowth, and, pressing this gently
      aside, I saw a wonderful spectacle. Away to my left was a great white
      marble building, which I judged to be a temple; and forming a crescent
      before it was a miniature town, each white-walled house surrounded by a
      garden. It was Damascus reduced to fairy dimensions, a spectacle quite
      unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact which made the whole thing awesome and unreal was the presence,
      along the top of the temple (which, like that of Hatshepsu at Deir
      elBahari, seemed to be hewn out of the living rock but was faced with
      white marble) of seven giant flambeaux, each surmounted by a darting
      tongue of blue flame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legend had it that this was the temple built by Zoroaster and preserved
      intact by that wonderful secretiveness of the Orient through the
      generations, by a cult who awaited the coming of Zoroaster&rsquo;s successor, of
      that Fire-Tongue who was to redeem and revolutionize the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid to move too far from the mouth of the tunnel, but
      nevertheless was anxious to obtain a good view of the little city at my
      feet. Gingerly I moved farther forward and forward, ever craning out for a
      glimpse of the buildings more immediately below me, forgetful of the fact
      that I walked upon the brink of a precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly my outstretched foot failed to touch ground. I clutched wildly
      at the bushes around me. Their roots were not firm in the shallow soil,
      and, enveloped like some pagan god in a mass of foliage, I toppled over
      the cliff and fell!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. STORY OF THE CITY OF FIRE (CONTINUED)
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My awakening was as strange as anything which had befallen me. I lay upon
      a silken bed in a pavilion which was furnished with exquisite, if somewhat
      barbaric, taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A silken shaded lamp hung upon a golden chain near to my couch, but it
      was dimmed by the rosy light streaming in through the open door&mdash;a
      light which I believed to be that of dawn. I ached in every limb and felt
      weak and ill. There was a bandage about my head, too, but this great
      physical weakness numbed my curiosity, and I just lay still, looking out
      through the doorway into a lovely garden. I could form no impression of
      what had happened, and the ceaseless throbbing in my head rendered any
      attempt to do so very painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was lying there, in this curious and apathetic state, when the curtains
      draped in the doorway were pulled more widely aside and a woman came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I will not endeavour to describe her, except to say that she
      was so darkly lovely that I doubted the evidence of my senses; tall and
      lithe, with the grace of some beautiful jungle creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she saw that I was awake, she paused and lowered her head in
      confusion. She wore a gossamer robe of sheeny golden silk, and, standing
      there with the light of the dawn behind her, she made a picture that I
      think would have driven a painter crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am supposed to be an unimpressionable man, and perhaps it is true; but
      there at that moment, as the glance of her dark eyes met the wondering
      look in mine, I knew that my hour had come for good or ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not the time nor the place for personal reminiscences. I am here
      for another purpose. One of those accidents which are really due to the
      hand of fate had precipitated me into the garden of the house of Naida,
      and she in her great compassion had tended me and sheltered me, keeping my
      presence secret from those who would have dealt with me in summary
      fashion, and, indeed, who were actually on the look-out for my arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so Naida informed me. To my great surprise she spoke almost perfect
      English, and that sort of understanding sprang up between us immediately
      which, in the case of a man and a beautiful woman thrown together as we
      were, can only terminate in one way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was some sort of priestess of the temple which I had seen from the
      top of the cliff. What else she was I very shortly learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In accordance with one of the many strange customs of the City of Fire,
      her personal servants, or rather slaves, were blind mutes! Gentlemen, I
      warned you that my story was tough. Doubtless you are beginning to
      appreciate the fact that I spoke no more than the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naida, for such was her name, told me that the Brahmin, Vadi, who had
      acted as my guide, was one of the followers of the Prophet of Fire, to
      whom had been given the duty of intercepting me. His failure to report
      within a certain time had resulted in two of the priests of this strange
      cult being sent out to obtain information. That these were the
      yellow-robed mendicants who had passed me in the mountains, I did not
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their reports, so Naida informed me, had led to a belief that Vadi had
      perished with me; but as an extra measure of precaution, that very night&mdash;indeed,
      shortly after I had passed that way&mdash;a guard had been set upon the
      secret entrance. Therefore, even if my strength had permitted, I should
      have been unable to return by the way I had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But indeed I was as weak as a child, and only to the presence of much
      foliage upon the acclivity down which I had rolled, and to the fact that I
      had fallen upon soft soil in a bed of flowers, can I ascribe my having
      failed to break my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way, gentlemen, I entered upon a brief period of my life at once
      more sweet and more bitter than any I had known. Next to that strange,
      invisible prophet whose name was Fire-Tongue, Naida held unquestioned sway
      in this secret city. Her house was separated from the others, and she
      travelled to and from the temple in a covered litter. To look upon her, as
      upon Fire-Tongue himself, was death. Women, I learned, were eligible for
      admission to this order, and these were initiated by Naida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the days of my strange but delightful captivity wore on, I learned
      more and more of the weird people who, unseen, surrounded me. There were
      lodges of the Cult of Fire all over the East, all having power to make
      initiates and some to pass disciples into the higher grades. Those who
      aspired to the highest rank in the order, however, were compelled to visit
      this secret city in the Indian hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then at last I learned a secret which Naida had for long kept back from
      me. These followers of the new Zoroaster were polygamists, and she was the
      first or chief wife of the mysterious personage known as Fire-Tongue. I
      gathered that others had superseded her, and her lord and master rarely
      visited this marble house set amid its extensive gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her dignities remained, however, and no one had aspired to dethrone her
      as high priestess of the temple. She evidently knew all the secrets of the
      organization, and I gathered that she was indispensable to the group who
      controlled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respecting Fire-Tongue himself, his origin, his appearance, she was
      resolutely silent, a second Acte, faithful to the last. That the ends of
      this cult were not only religious but political, she did not deny, but
      upon this point she was very reticent. An elaborate system of espionage
      was established throughout the East, Near and Far, and death was the
      penalty of any breach of fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respecting the tests to which candidates were put, she spoke with more
      freedom. Those who, having reached the second grade, aspired to the first,
      were submitted to three very severe ones, to make trial of their courage,
      purity, and humility. Failure in any of these trials resulted in instant
      death, and the final test, the trial by fire, which took place in a
      subterranean chamber of the great temple, resulted in a candidate whose
      courage failed him being precipitated into that lake of flame which I have
      already described&mdash;a dreadful form of death, which by accident I had
      witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, realizing what the existence of such an organization meant,
      what a menace to the peace of the world must lie here, what dreadful
      things were almost hourly happening about me at behest of this invisible
      monster known as Fire-Tongue, I yet confess&mdash;for I am here to speak
      the truth&mdash;that, although I had now fully recovered my strength, I
      lingered on in a delicious idleness, which you who hear me must find it
      hard to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the reputation of being a cold, hard man. So had Antony before he
      met Cleopatra. But seven years ago, under the Indian moon, I learned
      tolerance for the human weakness which forgets the world for the smiles of
      a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to end. Sooner or later, discovery was inevitable. One night I
      told Naida that I must go. Over the scene that followed I will pass in
      silence. It needed all the strength of a fairly straight, hard life to
      help me keep to my decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She understood at last, and consented to release me. But there were
      obstacles&mdash;big ones. The snow on the lower mountain slopes had begun
      to melt, and the water-gate in the valley by which I had entered was now
      impassable. As a result, I must use another gate, which opened into a
      mountain path, but which was always guarded. At first, on hearing this, I
      gave myself up for lost, but Naida had a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Removing a bangle which she always wore, she showed me the secret mark of
      Fire-Tongue branded upon the creamy skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will put this mark upon your arm,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;In no other way can you
      escape. I will teach you some of the passwords by which the brethren know
      one another, and if you are ever questioned you will say that you were
      admitted to the order by the Master of the Bombay Lodge, news of whose
      death has just reached us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;how can I hope to pass for an Oriental?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It does not matter,&rsquo; Naida replied. &lsquo;There are some who are not
      Orientals among us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, those words staggered me, opening up a possibility which had
      seemed only shadowy before. But Naida, who had tremendous strength of
      character, definitely refused to discuss this aspect of the matter, merely
      assuring me that it was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Those who have successfully passed the ordeal of fire,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;are
      put under a vow of silence for one month, and from moon to moon must speak
      to no living creature. Therefore, once you bear the mark of the Fiery
      Tongue, you may safely pass the gate, except that there are certain signs
      which it is necessary you should know. Afterward, if you should ever be in
      danger of discovery anywhere in the East, you will remember the passwords,
      which I shall teach you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was branded with the mark of Fire-Tongue, and I spent my last night
      with Naida learning from her lips the words by which members of this order
      were enabled to recognize one another. In vain I entreated Naida to
      accompany me. She would allow herself to love and be loved; but the vows
      of this singular priesthood were to her inviolable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She exacted an oath from me that I would never divulge anything which I
      had seen or heard in the City of Fire. She urged that I must leave India
      as quickly as possible. I had already learned that this remote society was
      closely in touch with the affairs of the outside world. And, because I
      knew I was leaving my heart behind there in the Indian hills, I recognized
      that this dreadful parting must be final.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore I scarcely heeded her when she assured me that, should I ever
      be in danger because of what had happened, a message in the Times of India
      would reach her. I never intended to insert such a message, gentlemen. I
      knew that it would need all my strength to close this door which I had
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will spare you and myself the details of our parting. I passed out from
      the City of Fire in the darkest hour of the night, through a long winding
      tunnel, half a mile in length. I had protested to Naida that the secret
      mark might be painted upon my arm and not branded, but she had assured me
      that the latter was a necessity, and this now became evident; for, not
      only three times was it subjected to scrutiny, but by the last of the
      guards, posted near the outer end of the tunnel, it was tested with some
      kind of solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence and the salutation with the moistened finger tips, together with
      the brand upon my arm, won me freedom from the abode of Fire-Tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a village situated upon one of the tributaries of the Ganges I
      readily obtained a guide, to whom such silent, yellow-robed figures as
      mine were evidently not unfamiliar; and, crossing the east of Nepal, I
      entered Bengal, bearing a strange secret. I found myself in an empty world&mdash;a
      world which had nothing to offer me. For every step south took me farther
      from all that made life worth living.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. NICOL BRINN&rsquo;S STORY (CONCLUDED)
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The incidents of the next seven years do not concern you, gentlemen. I
      had one aim in life&mdash;to forget. I earned an unenviable reputation for
      foolhardy enterprises. Until this very hour, no man has known why I did
      the things that I did do. From the time that I left India until the moment
      when fate literally threw me in the way of the late Sir Charles Abingdon,
      I had heard nothing of the cult of Fire-Tongue; and in spite of Naida&rsquo;s
      assurance that its membership was not confined to Orientals, I had long
      ago supposed it to be a manifestation of local fanaticism, having no
      political or international significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, lunching with the late Sir Charles after my accident in the
      Haymarket, he put to me a question which literally made me hold my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know anything of the significance of the term Fire-Tongue?&rsquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not accustomed to any display of feeling in public, and I replied in
      what I think was an ordinary tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In what connection, Sir Charles?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, watching me oddly, &lsquo;I know you have travelled in India,
      and I wondered if you had ever come in contact with the legend which
      prevails there, that a second Zoroaster has arisen, to preach the doctrine
      of eternal fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have heard it,&rsquo; I replied, guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I thought it possible,&rsquo; continued Sir Charles, &lsquo;and I am tempted to tell
      you of a curious experience which once befell me during the time that I
      was a guest of my late friend Colonel Banfield in Delhi. My reputation as
      an osteologist was not at that time so fully established as it later
      became, but I already had some reputation in this branch of surgery; and
      one evening a very dignified Hindu gentleman sought an interview with me,
      saying that a distinguished native noble, who was a guest of his, had met
      with a serious accident, and offering me a fee equivalent to nearly five
      hundred pounds to perform an operation which he believed to be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I assured him that my services were at his disposal, and blankly
      declined to accept so large a fee. He thereupon explained that the
      circumstances were peculiar. His friend belonged to a religious cult of an
      extremely high order. He would lose caste if it became known that he had
      been attended by a Christian surgeon; therefore my visit must be a secret
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It made no difference,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;I quite understood; and he might
      rely upon my discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Accordingly I was driven in a car which was waiting to some house upon
      the outskirts of the city and conducted to a room where the patient had
      been carried. I saw him to be a singularly handsome young man, apparently
      about twenty-three years of age. His features were flawless, and he
      possessed light ivory skin and wavy jet-black hair. His eyes, which were
      very dark and almond-shaped, had a strange and arresting beauty. But there
      was something effeminate about him which repelled me, I cannot say in what
      way; nor did I approve of the presence of many bowls of hyacinths in the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;However, I performed the operation, which, although slight, demanded
      some skill, and with the nature of which I will not trouble you. Intense
      anxiety was manifested by the young man&rsquo;s attendants, and one of these, a
      strikingly beautiful woman, insisted on remaining while the operation was
      performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She seemed more especially to concern herself with preserving intact a
      lock of the young man&rsquo;s jet-black hair, which was brushed in rather an odd
      manner across his ivory forehead. Naturally enough, this circumstance
      excited my curiosity and, distracting the woman&rsquo;s attention for a moment&mdash;I
      asked her to bring me something from a table at the opposite side of the
      room&mdash;I lightly raised this wayward lock and immediately replaced it
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know what it concealed, Mr. Brinn?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assured him that I did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A mark, apparently natural, resembling a torch surmounted by a tongue of
      fire!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was amazed, gentlemen, by Sir Charles&rsquo;s story. He was given his fee and
      driven back to his quarters. But that he had succeeded where I had failed,
      that he had actually looked upon Fire-Tongue in person, I could not doubt.
      I learned from this, too, that the Prophet of Fire did not always remain
      in his mountain stronghold, for Delhi is a long way from the Secret City.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange though it must appear, at this time I failed to account for Sir
      Charles confiding this thing to me. Later, I realized that he must have
      seen the mark on my arm, although he never referred to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the past leapt out at me, as you see, and worse was to come. The
      death of Sir Charles Abingdon told me what I hated to know: that
      Fire-Tongue was in England!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I moved at once. I inserted in the Times the prearranged message, hardly
      daring to hope that it would come to the eye of Naida; but it did! She
      visited me. And I learned that not only Sir Charles Abingdon, but another,
      knew of the mark which I bore!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was summoned to appear before the Prophet of fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, what I saw and how I succeeded in finding out the location of
      his abode are matters that can wait. The important things are these:
      first, I learned why Sir Charles Abingdon had been done to death!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The unwelcome attentions of the man known as Ormuz Khan led Sir Charles
      to seek an interview with him. I may say here and now that Ormuz Khan is
      Fire-Tongue! Oh! it&rsquo;s a tough statement&mdash;but I can prove it. Sir
      Charles practically forced his way into this man&rsquo;s presence&mdash;and
      immediately recognized his mysterious patient of years ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He accused him of having set spies upon his daughter&rsquo;s movements&mdash;an
      accusation which was true&mdash;and forbade him to see her again. From
      that hour the fate of Sir Charles was sealed. What he knew, the world must
      never know. He had recorded, in a private paper, all that he had learned.
      This paper was stolen from his bureau&mdash;and its contents led to my
      being summoned to the house of Fire-Tongue! It also spurred the
      organization to renewed efforts, for it revealed the fact that Sir Charles
      contemplated confiding the story to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were the intentions of the man Ormuz in regard to Miss Abingdon, I
      don&rsquo;t know. His entourage all left England some days ago&mdash;with three
      exceptions. I believe him to have been capable of almost anything. He was
      desperate. He knew that Ormuz Khan must finally and definitely disappear.
      It is just possible that he meant Miss Abingdon to disappear along with
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, that danger is past. Mrs. McMurdoch, who to-day accompanied her
      to his house, was drugged by these past-masters in the use of poisons, and
      left unconscious in a cottage a few miles from Hillside, the abode of
      Ormuz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have observed, gentlemen, that I am somewhat damaged. However,
      it was worth it! That the organization of the Fire-Worshippers is
      destroyed I am not prepared to assert. But I made a discovery to-day which
      untied my hands. Hearing, I shall never know how, that Naida had had a
      secret interview with me, Fire-Tongue visited upon her the penalty paid
      seven years ago by my informant in Nagpur, by Sir Charles Abingdon,
      recently, by God alone knows how many scores&mdash;hundreds&mdash;in the
      history of this damnable group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found her lying on a silken divan in the deserted house, her hands
      clasped over a little white flower like an odontoglossum, which lay on her
      breast. It was the flower of sleep&mdash;and she was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My seven years&rsquo; silence was ended. One thing I could do for the world:
      remove Fire-Tongue&mdash;and do it with my own hands!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, at the angle where the high road from Upper Claybury joins the
      Dover Road is the Merton Cottage Hospital. Mr. Harley is awaiting us
      there. He is less damaged than I am. A native chauffeur, whose name I
      don&rsquo;t know, is lying insensible in one of the beds&mdash;and in another is
      a dead man, unrecognizable, except for a birthmark resembling a torch on
      his forehead, his head crushed and his neck broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That dead man is Fire-Tongue. I should like, Mr. Commissioner, to sign
      the statement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
