<a name="PREFACE"></a>
<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>It has been suggested by Mr. Reginald Smith, to whose
friendliness and skill the fortunes of this book have been so
greatly indebted, that a rather fuller preface might be suitably
prefixed to this Edition.</p>
<p>When the book first appeared, it was stated on the title-page
to be written "by One who has kept a Diary." My
claim to that modest title will scarcely be challenged by even
the most carping critic who is conversant with the facts. On
August 13, 1865, being then twelve years old, I began my
Diary. Several attempts at diary-keeping I had already
made and abandoned. This more serious endeavour was
due to the fact that a young lady gave me a manuscript-book
attractively bound in scarlet leather; and such a gift inspired
a resolution to live up to it. Shall I be deemed to lift the veil
of private life too roughly if I transcribe some early entries?
"23rd: Dear Kate came; very nice." "25th: Kate is very
delightful." "26th: Kate is a darling girl. <i>She kissed me</i>."</p>
<p>Before long, Love's young dream was dispersed by the
realities of Harrow; but the scarlet book continued to receive
my daily confidences. Soon&#8212;alas for puerile fickleness!&#8212;
the name of "Kate" disappears, and is replaced by rougher
appellations, such as "Bob" and "Charlie;" "Carrots"
this, and "Chaw" that. To Harrow succeeds Oxford, and
now more recognizable names begin to appear&#8212;"Liddon"
and "Holland," "Gore" and "Milner", and "Lymington."</p>
<p>But through all these personal permutations the continuous
Life of the Diary remained unbroken, and so remains
even to the present date. Not a day is missing. When I
have been laid low by any of the rather numerous ills to
which, if to little else, my flesh has been heir, I have always
been able to jot down such pregnant entries as "Temperature
102&deg;;" "Salicine;" "Boiled Chicken;" "Bath Chair."
It is many a year since the scarlet book was laid aside; but
it has had a long line of successors; and together they
contain the record of what I have been, done, seen, and
heard during thirty-eight years of chequered existence.
Entertaining a strong and well-founded suspicion that Posterity
would burn these precious volumes unread, I was
moved, some few years ago, to compress into small compass
the little that seemed worth remembering. At that time
my friend Mr. James Payn was already confined to the
house by the beginnings of what proved to be his last illness.
His host of friends did what they could to relieve the tedium
of his suffering days; and the only contribution which I
could make was to tell him at my weekly visits anything
interesting or amusing which I collected from the reperusal
of my diary. Greatly to my surprise, he urged me to make
these "Collections" into a book, and to add to them whatever
"Recollections" they might suggest. Acting on this
advice, I published during the year 1897 a series of weekly
papers in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>. They were received
more kindly than I had any right to expect; and early in
1898 I reproduced them in the present volume&#8212;just too
late to offer it, except in memory, to dear James Payn.</p>
<p>The fortunes of the book, from that time till now, would
not interest the public, but are extremely interesting to me.
The book brought me many friends. One story, at any rate,
elicited the gracious laughter of Queen Victoria. A pauper
who had known better days wrote to thank me for enlivening
the monotony of a workhouse infirmary. Literary clerks
plied me with questions about the sources of my quotations.
A Scotch doctor demurred to the prayer&#8212;"Water that
spark"&#8212;on the ground that the water would put the
spark out. Elderly clergymen in country parsonages revived
the rollicking memories of their undergraduate days, and
sent me academic quips of the forties and fifties. From the
most various quarters I received suggestions, corrections,
and enrichments which have made each edition an improvement
on the last. The public notices were, on the whole,
extremely kind, and some were unintentionally amusing.
Thus one editor, putting two and two together, calculated
that the writer could not be less than eighty years old; while
another, like Mrs. Prig, "didn't believe there was no sich
a person," and acutely divined that the book was a journalistic
squib directed against my amiable garrulity. The most
pleasing notice was that of Jean La Frette, some extracts
from which I venture to append. It is true that competent
judges have questioned the accuracy of M. La Frette's idiom,
but his sentiments are unimpeachable. The necessary corrective
was not wanting, for a weekly journal of high culture
described my poor handiwork as "Snobbery and Snippets."
There was a boisterousness&#8212;almost a brutality&#8212;about the
phrase which deterred me from reading the review; but I
am fain to admit that there was a certain rude justice in the
implied criticism.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_11"></a>I.</h2>
<h2>LINKS WITH THE PAST.</h2>
<p>Of the celebrated Mrs. Disraeli her husband is reported
to have said, "She is an excellent creature, but she
never can remember which came first, the Greeks or the
Romans." In my walk through life I have constantly
found myself among excellent creatures of this sort.
The world is full of vague people, and in the average
man, and still more in the average woman, the chronological
sense seems to be entirely wanting. Thus, when
I have occasionally stated in a mixed company that my
first distinct recollection was the burning of Covent Garden
Theatre, I have seen a general expression of surprised
interest, and have been told, in a tone meant to be kind
and complimentary, that my hearers would hardly have
thought that my memory went back so far. The explanation
has been that these excellent creatures had some
vague notions of <i>Rejected Addresses</i> floating in their minds,
and confounded the burning of Covent Garden Theatre in
1856 with that of Drury Lane Theatre in 1809. It was
<a name="Page_12"></a>pleasant to feel that one bore one's years so
well as to make
the error possible.</p>
<p>But events, however striking, are only landmarks in
memory. They are isolated and detached, and begin and
end in themselves. The real interest of one's early life
is in its Links with the Past, through the old people whom
one has known. Though I place my first distinct recollection
in 1856, I have memories more or less hazy of an
earlier date.</p>
<p>There was an old Lady Robert Seymour, who lived in
Portland Place, and died there in 1855, in her ninety-first
year. Probably she is my most direct link with the past,
for she carried down to the time of the Crimean War the
habits and phraseology of Queen Charlotte's early Court.
"Goold" of course she said for gold, and "yaller" for
yellow, and "laylock" for lilac. She laid the stress on the
second syllable of "balcony." She called her maid her
"'ooman;" instead of sleeping at a place, she "lay" there,
and when she consulted the doctor she spoke of having
"used the 'potticary."</p>
<p>There still lives, in full possession of all her faculties, a
venerable lady who can say that her husband was born at
Boston when America was a British dependency. This is
the widow of Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst, who was born
in 1772, and helped to defeat Mr. Gladstone's Paper Bill
in the House of Lords on his eighty-eighth birthday. He
died in 1862.<a name="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>A conspicuous figure in my early recollections is Sir
Henry Holland, M.D., father of the present Lord Knutsford.
He was born in 1788, and died in 1873. The stories
of his superhuman vigour and activity would fill a volume.
In 1863 Bishop Wilberforce wrote to a friend abroad: "Sir
Henry Holland, who got back safe from all his American
rambles, has been taken by Palmerston through the river at
<a name="Page_13"></a>Broadlands, and lies very ill." However, he
completely
threw off the effects of this mischance, and survived his
aquaceous host for some eight years. I well remember his
telling me in 1868 that his first famous patient was the
mysterious "Pamela," who became the wife of the Irish
patriot, Lord Edward FitzGerald.</p>
<p>Every one who went about in London in the 'seventies
will remember the dyed locks and crimson velvet waistcoat
of William, fifth Earl Bathurst, who was born in 1791 and
died in 1878. He told me that he was at a private school
at Sunbury-on-Thames with William and John Russell,
the latter of whom became the author of the Reform Bill
and Prime Minister. At this delightful seminary, the peers'
sons, including my informant, who was then the Hon.
William Bathurst, had a bench to themselves. William and
John Russell were not peers' sons, as their father had not
then succeeded to the Dukedom of Bedford. In 1802 he succeeded,
on the sudden death of his elder brother, and
became sixth Duke of Bedford; and his sons, becoming
<i>Lord</i> William and <i>Lord</i> John, were duly promoted to the
privileged bench. Nothing in <i>Pelham</i> or <i>Vivian Grey</i>
quite
equals this.</p>
<p>When I went to Harrow, in 1868, there was an old
woman, by name Polly Arnold, still keeping a stationer's
shop in the town, who had sold cribs to Byron when he
was a Harrow boy; and Byron's fag, a funny old gentleman
in a brown wig&#8212;called Baron Heath&#8212;was a standing dish
on our school Speech-Day.</p>
<p>Once at a London dinner I happened to say in the hearing
of Mrs. Procter (widow of "Barry Cornwall," and mother
of the poetess) that I was going next day to the Harrow
Speeches. "Ah," said Mrs. Procter, "that used to be a
pleasant outing. The last time I went I drove down with
Lord Byron and Dr Parr, who had been breakfasting with
my father." Mrs. Procter died in 1888.</p>
<p><a name="Page_14"></a>Among the remarkable women of our time, if
merely in
respect of longevity, must be reckoned Lady Louisa Stuart,
sister and heir of the last Earl of Traquair. She was a
friend and correspondent of Sir Walter Scott, who in
describing "Tully Veolan" drew Traquair House with
literal exactness, even down to the rampant bears which
still guard the locked entrance-gates against all comers
until the Royal Stuarts shall return to claim their own.
Lady Louisa Stuart lived to be ninety-nine, and died in
1876.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable old lady whom I knew
intimately was Caroline Lowther, Duchess of Cleveland,
who was born in 1792 and died in 1883. She had been
presented to Queen Charlotte when there were only forty
people at the Drawing-room, had danced with the Prince
of Orange, and had attended the "breakfasts" given by
Albinia Countess of Buckinghamshire (who died in 1816),
at her villa just outside London. The site of that villa is
now Hobart Place, having taken its name from that of the
Buckinghamshire family. The trees of its orchard are still
discoverable in the back-gardens of Hobart Place and
Wilton Street, and I am looking out upon them as I write
this page.</p>
<p>Stories of highwaymen are excellent Links with the Past,
and here is one. The fifth Earl of Berkeley, who died in
1810, had always declared that any one might without disgrace
be overcome by superior numbers, but that he would
never surrender to a single highwayman. As he was
crossing Hounslow Heath one night, on his way from
Berkeley Castle to London, his travelling carriage was
stopped by a man on horseback, who put his head in at
the window and said, "I believe you are Lord Berkeley?"
"I am." "I believe you have always boasted that you
would never surrender to a single highwayman?" "I
have." "Well," presenting a pistol, "I am a single high<a name="Page_15"></a>wayman,
and I say, 'Your money or your life.'" "You
cowardly dog," said Lord Berkeley, "do you think I can't
see your confederate skulking behind you?" The highwayman,
who was really alone, looked hurriedly round, and
Lord Berkeley shot him through the head. I asked Lady
Caroline Maxse (1803-1886), who was born a Berkeley, if
this story was true. I can never forget my thrill when she
replied, "Yes; and I am proud to say that I am that man's
daughter."</p>
<p>Sir Moses Montefiore was born in 1784, and died in
1885. It is a disheartening fact for the teetotallers that he
had drunk a bottle of port wine every day since he grew up.
He had dined with Lord Nelson on board his ship, and
vividly remembered the transcendent beauty of Lady
Hamilton. The last time Sir Moses appeared in public
was, if I mistake not, at a garden-party at Marlborough
House. The party was given on a Saturday. Sir Moses
was restrained by religious scruples from using his horses,
and was of course too feeble to walk, so he was conveyed
to the party in a magnificent sedan-chair. That was the
only occasion on which I have seen such an article in use.</p>
<p>When I began to go out in London, a conspicuous figure
in dinner-society and on Protestant platforms was Captain
Francis Maude, R.N. He was born in 1798 and died in
1886. He used to say, "My grandfather was nine years old
when Charles II. died." And so, if pedigrees may be
trusted, he was. Charles II. died in 1685. Sir Robert
Maude was born in 1676. His son, the first Lord Hawarden,
was born in 1727, and Captain Francis Maude was this Lord
Hawarden's youngest son. The year of his death (1880) saw
also that of a truly venerable woman, Mrs. Hodgson, mother
of Kirkman and Stewart Hodgson, the well-known partners
in Barings' house. Her age was not precisely known, but
when a schoolgirl in Paris she had seen Robespierre executed,
and distinctly recollected the appearance of his bandaged
<a name="Page_16"></a>face. Her granddaughters, Mr. Stewart Hodgson's
children,
are quite young women, and if they live to the age which,
with such ancestry, they are entitled to anticipate, they
will carry down into the middle of the twentieth century
the account, derived from an eye-witness, of the central
event of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>One year later, in 1887, there died, at her house in St.
James's Square, Mrs. Anne Penelope Hoare, mother of the
late Sir Henry Hoare, M.P. She recollected being at a
children's party when the lady of the house came in and
stopped the dancing because news had come that the King
of France had been put to death. Her range of conscious
knowledge extended from the execution of Louis XVI. to
the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. So short a thing is history.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Stirling, who was born in 1802 and died in
1888, was a little old gentleman of ubiquitous activity,
running about London with a yellow wig, short trousers,
and a cotton umbrella. I well remember his saying to me,
when Mr. Bradlaugh was committed to the Clock Tower,
"I don't like this. I am afraid it will mean mischief. I
am old enough to remember seeing Sir Francis Burdett
taken to the Tower by the Sergeant-at-Arms with a military
force. I saw the riot then, and I am afraid I shall see a
riot again."</p>
<p>In the same year (1888) died Mrs. Thomson Hankey,
wife of a former M.P. for Peterborough. Her father, a
Mr. Alexander, was born in 1729, and she had inherited
from him traditions of London as it appeared to a young
Scotsman in the year of the decapitation of the rebels after
the rising of 1745.</p>
<p>One of the most venerable and interesting figures in
London, down to his death in 1891, was George Thomas,
sixth Earl of Albemarle. He was born in 1799. He had
played bat-trap-and-ball at St. Anne's Hill with Mr. Fox, and,
excepting his old comrade General Whichcote, who outlived
<a name="Page_17"></a>him by a few months, was the last survivor of
Waterloo.
A man whom I knew longer and more intimately than any
of those whom I have described was the late Lord Charles
James Fox Russell. He was born in 1807, and died in
1894. His father's groom had led the uproar of London
servants which in the eighteenth century damned the play
<i>High Life Below Stairs</i>. He remembered a Highlander
who had followed the army of Prince Charles Edward in
1745, and had learned from another Highlander the
Jacobite soldiers' song&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>"I would I were at Manchester,</p>
<p class="i1">A-sitting on the grass,</p>
<p>And by my side a bottle of wine,</p>
<p class="i1">And on my lap a lass."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He had officiated as a page at the coronation of George
IV.; had conversed with Sir Walter Scott about <i>The Bride
of Lammermoor</i> before its authorship was disclosed; had
served in the Blues under Ernest Duke of Cumberland;
and had lost his way in trying to find the newly developed
quarter of London called Belgrave Square.</p>
<p>Among living<a name="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
links, I hope it is not ungallant to
enumerate Lady Georgiana Grey, only surviving child of</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>And wrought in brave old age what youth had planned;"</p>

<p>Lady Louisa Tighe, who as Lady Louisa Lennox buckled
the Duke of Wellington's sword when he set out from her
mother's ball at Brussels for the field of Waterloo; and
Miss Eliza Smith of Brighton, the vivacious and evergreen
daughter of Horace Smith, who wrote the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>.
But these admirable and accomplished ladies hate garrulity,
and the mere mention of their names is a signal to bring
these disjointed reminiscences to a close.<br>

<h2>LORD RUSSELL</h2>
<p>These chapters are founded on Links with the Past.
Let me now describe in rather fuller detail three or four
remarkable people with whom I had more than a cursory
acquaintance, and who allowed me for many years the privilege
of drawing without restriction on the rich stores of
their political and social recollections.</p>
<p>First among these in point of date, if of nothing else, I
must place John Earl Russell, the only person I have ever
known who knew Napoleon the Great. Lord Russell&#8212;or,
to give him the name by which he was most familiar to his
countrymen, Lord John Russell&#8212;was born in 1792, and
when I first knew him he was already old; but it might
have been said of him with perfect truth that</p>

<p>After he resigned the leadership of the Liberal party, at
Christmas 1867, Lord Russell spent the greater part of his
time at Pembroke Lodge, a house in Richmond Park which
takes its name from Elizabeth Countess of Pembroke, long
remembered as the object of King George the Third's
hopeless and pathetic love. As a token of his affection the
King allowed Lady Pembroke to build herself a "lodge"
in the "vast wilderness" of Richmond Park, amid sur<a name="Page_19"></a>roundings
which went far to realize Cowper's idea of a
"boundless contiguity of shade."</p>
<p>On her death, in 1831, Pembroke Lodge was assigned by
William IV. to his son-in-law, Lord Erroll, and in 1847 it
was offered by the Queen to her Prime Minister, Lord John
Russell, who then had no home except his house in
Chesham Place. It was gratefully accepted, for indeed it
had already been coveted as an ideal residence for a busy
politician who wanted fresh air, and could not safely be far
from the House of Commons. As years went on Lord John
spent more and more of his time in this delicious retreat,
and in his declining years it was practically his only home.</p>
<p>A quarter of a century ago it was a curious and interesting
privilege for a young man to sit in the trellised dining-room
of Pembroke Lodge, or to pace its terrace-walk
looking down upon the Thames, in intimate converse with
a statesman who had enjoyed the genial society of Charles
Fox, and had been the travelling companion of Lord
Holland; had corresponded with Tom Moore, debated
with Francis Jeffrey, and dined with Dr. Parr; had visited
Melrose Abbey in the company of Sir Walter Scott, and
criticized the acting of Mrs. Siddons; conversed with
Napoleon in his seclusion at Elba, and ridden with the
Duke of Wellington along the lines of Torres Vedras.</p>
<p>The genius of John Leech, constantly exercised on the
subject for twenty years, has made all students of <i>Punch</i>
familiar with Lord John Russell's outward aspect. We
know from his boyish diary that on his eleventh birthday
he was "4 feet 2 inches high, and 3 stone 12 lb. weight;"
and though, as time went on, these extremely modest
dimensions were slightly exceeded, he was an unusually short
man. His massive head and broad shoulders gave him
when he sate the appearance of greater size, and when he
rose to his feet the diminutive stature caused a feeling of
surprise. Sydney Smith declared that when Lord John
<a name="Page_20"></a>first contested Devonshire the burly electors
were disappointed
by the exiguity of their candidate, but were
satisfied when it was explained to them that he had once
been much larger, but was worn away by the anxieties and
struggles of the Reform Bill of 1832. Never was so robust
a spirit enshrined in so fragile a form. He inherited the
miserable legacy of congenital weakness. Even in those
untender days he was considered too delicate to remain at
a Public School. It was thought impossible for him to
live through his first session of Parliament. When he was
fighting the Reform Bill through the House of Commons
he had to be fed with arrowroot by a benevolent lady who
was moved to compassion by his pitiful appearance. For
years afterwards he was liable to fainting-fits, had a wretched
digestion, and was easily upset by hot rooms, late hours,
and bad air. These circumstances, combined with his love
of domestic life and his fondness for the country, led him
to spend every evening that he could spare in his seclusion
at Pembroke Lodge, and consequently cut him off, very
much to his political disadvantage, from constant and
intimate associations with official colleagues and parliamentary
supporters.</p>
<p>There were other characteristics which enhanced this
unfortunate impression of aloofness. His voice had what
used to be described in satirical writings of the first half of
the century as "an aristocratic drawl," and his pronunciation
was archaic. Like other high-bred people of his time,
he talked of "cowcumbers" and "laylocks," called a
woman an "'ooman," and was "much obleeged" where a
degenerate age is content to be obliged. The frigidity of
his address and the seeming stiffness of his manner, due
really to an innate and incurable shyness, produced even
among people who ought to have known him well a totally
erroneous notion of his character and temperament. To
Bulwer Lytton he seemed&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_21"></a>
<p>"How formed to lead, if not too proud to please!</p>
<p>His fame would fire you, but his manners freeze.</p>

<p>He wants your vote, but your affections not;</p>
<p>Vet human hearts need sun as well as oats&#8212;</p>
<p>So cold a climate plays the deuce with votes."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It must be admitted that in some of the small social arts
which are so valuable an equipment for a political leader
Lord John was funnily deficient. He had no memory for
faces, and was painfully apt to ignore his political followers
when he met them beyond the walls of Parliament. Once,
staying in a Scotch country-house, he found himself thrown
with young Lord D----, now Earl of S----. He liked the
young man's conversation, and was pleased to find that he
was a Whig. When the party broke up, Lord John
conquered his shyness sufficiently to say to his new friend,
"Well, Lord D----, I am very glad to have made your
acquaintance, and now you must come into the House of
Commons and support me there." "I have been doing
that for the last ten years, Lord John," was the reply of the
gratified follower.</p>
<p>This inability to remember faces was allied in Lord John
with a curious artlessness of disposition which made it
impossible for him to feign a cordiality he did not feel.
Once, at a concert at Buckingham Palace, he was seen
to get up suddenly, turn his back on the Duchess of
Sutherland, by whom he had been sitting, walk to the
remotest part of the room, and sit down by the Duchess
of Inverness. When questioned afterwards as to the cause
of his unceremonious move, which had the look of a
quarrel, he said, "I could not have sate any longer by
that great fire; I should have fainted."</p>
<p>"Oh, that was a very good reason for moving; but I
hope you told the Duchess of Sutherland why you left her."</p>
<p>"Well&#8212;no; I don't think I did that. But I told the
Duchess of Inverness why I came and sate by her!"</p>
<p><a name="Page_22"></a>Thus were opportunities of paying harmless
compliments
recklessly thrown away.</p>
<p>It was once remarked by a competent critic that "there
have been Ministers who knew the springs of that public
opinion which is delivered ready digested to the nation
every morning, and who have not scrupled to work them
for their own diurnal glorification, even although the recoil
might injure their colleagues. But Lord Russell has never
bowed the knee to the potentates of the Press; he has
offered no sacrifice of invitations to social editors; and
social editors have accordingly failed to discover the merits
of a statesman who so little appreciated them, until they
have almost made the nation forget the services that Lord
Russell has so faithfully and courageously rendered."</p>
<p>Be this as it may, there is no doubt that the old Whig
statesman lacked those gifts or arts which make a man
widely popular in a large society of superficial acquaintances.
On his deathbed he said with touching pathos,
"I have seemed cold to my friends, but it was not in my
heart." The friends needed no such assurance. He was
the idol of those who were most closely associated with
him by the ties of blood or duty. Even to people outside
the innermost circle of intimacy there was something
peculiarly attractive in his singular mixture of gentleness
and dignity. He excelled as a host, doing the honours of
his table with the old-fashioned grace which he had learned
at Woburn Abbey and at Holland House when the century
was young; and in the charm of his conversation he was
not easily equalled--never, in my experience, surpassed.
He had the happy knack of expressing a judgment which
might be antagonistic to the sentiments of those with
whom he was dealing in language which, while perfectly
void of offence, was calmly decisive. His reply to Sir
Francis Burdett was pronounced by Mr. Gladstone to be
the best repartee ever made in Parliament. Sir Francis,
<a name="Page_23"></a>an ex-Radical, attacking his former associates
with all the
bitterness of a renegade, had said, "The most offensive
thing in the world is the cant of Patriotism." Lord John
replied, "I quite agree that the cant of Patriotism is a
very offensive thing; but the <i>recant</i> of Patriotism is more
offensive still." His letter to the Dean of Hereford about
the election of Bishop Hampden is a classical instance of
courteous controversy. Once a most Illustrious Personage
asked him if it was true that he taught that under certain
circumstances it was lawful for a subject to disobey the
Sovereign. "Well, speaking to a Sovereign of the House
of Hanover, I can only answer in the affirmative."</p>
<p>His copiousness of anecdote was inexhaustible. His
stories always fitted the point, and the droll gravity of
his way of telling them added greatly to their zest. Of his
conversation with Napoleon at Elba I recollect one curious
question and answer. The Emperor took the little
Englishman by the ear and asked him what was thought
in England of his chances of returning to the throne of
France. "I said, 'Sire, they think you have no chance at
all.'" The Emperor said that the English Government had
made a great mistake in sending the Duke of Wellington
to Paris&#8212;"On n'aime pas voir un homme par qui on a &eacute;t&eacute;
battu;" and on War he made this characteristic comment:
"Eh bien, c'est un grand jeu&#8212;belle occupation."</p>
<p>This interview took place when Lord John was making
a tour with Lord and Lady Holland, and much of his
earlier life had been spent at Holland House, in the heart
of that brilliant society which Macaulay so picturesquely
described, and in which Luttrell and Samuel Rogers were
conspicuous figures. Their conversation supplied Lord
John with an anecdote which he used to bring out, with a
twinkling eye and a chuckling laugh, whenever he heard
that any public reform was regarded with misgiving by
sensible men. Luttrell and Rogers were passing in a
<a name="Page_24"></a>wherry under old London Bridge when its
destruction Was
contemplated, and Rogers said, "Some very sensible men
think that, if these works are carried into effect, the tide
will flow so rapidly under the bridge that dangerous consequences
will follow." "My dear Rogers," answered
Luttrell, "if some very sensible men had been attended to,
we should still be eating acorns."</p>
<p>Of William and John Scott, afterwards Lord Stowell and
Lord Eldon, Lord Russell used to tell with infinite zest a
story which he declared to be highly characteristic of the
methods by which they made their fortunes and position.
When they were young men at the Bar, having had a
stroke of professional luck, they determined to celebrate
the occasion by having a dinner at a tavern and going to
the play. When it was time to call for the reckoning,
William Scott dropped a guinea. He and his brother
searched for it in vain, and came to the conclusion that it
had fallen between the boards of the uncarpeted floor.</p>
<p>"This is a bad job," said William; "we must give up
the play."</p>
<p>"Stop a bit," said John; "I know a trick worth two of
that," and called the waitress.</p>
<p>"Betty," said he, "we've dropped two guineas. See if
you can find them." Betty went down on her hands and
knees, and found the one guinea, which had rolled under
the fender.</p>
<p>"That's a very good girl, Betty," said John Scott,
pocketing the coin; "and when you find the other you
can keep it for your trouble." And the prudent brothers
went with a light heart to the play, and so eventually to
the Bench and the Woolsack.</p>
<p>In spite of profound differences of political opinion,
Lord Russell had a high regard for the memory of the Duke
of Wellington, and had been much in his society in early
life. Travelling in the Peninsula in 1812, he visited Lord
<a name="Page_25"></a>Wellington at his headquarters near Burgos. On
the
morning after his arrival he rode out with his host and an
aide-de-camp, and surveyed the position of the French
army. Lord Wellington, peering through his glass, suddenly
exclaimed, "By G----! they've changed their position!"
and said no more.</p>
<p>When they returned from their ride, the aide-de-camp
said to Lord John, "You had better get away as quick as
you can. I am confident that Lord Wellington means to
make a move." Lord John took the hint, made his excuses,
and went on his way. That evening the British army was
in full retreat, and Lord Russell used to tell the story as
illustrating the old Duke's extreme reticence when there was
a chance of a military secret leaking out.</p>
<p>Lord Russell's father, the sixth Duke of Bedford, belonged
to that section of the Whigs who thought that, while a
Whig ministry was impossible, it was wiser to support the
Duke of Wellington, whom they believed to be a thoroughly
honest man, than Canning, whom they regarded as an unscrupulous
adventurer. Accordingly the Duke of Wellington
was a frequent visitor at Woburn Abbey, and showed consistent
friendliness to Lord Russell and his many brothers, all of
whom were full of anecdotes illustrative of his grim humour
and robust common sense. Let a few of them be recorded.</p>
<p>The Government was contemplating the dispatch of an
expedition to Burma, with a view of taking Rangoon, and
a question arose as to who would be the fittest general to
be sent in command of the expedition. The Cabinet sent
for the Duke of Wellington, and asked his advice. He
instantly replied, "Send Lord Combermere."</p>
<p>"But we have always understood that your Grace thought
Lord Combermere a fool."</p>
<p>"So he is a fool, and a d----d fool; but he can take
Rangoon."</p>
<p>At the time of Queen Caroline's trial the mob of London
<a name="Page_26"></a>sided with the Queen, and the Duke's strong
adhesion to
the King made him extremely unpopular. Riding up
Grosvenor Place one day towards Apsley House, he was
beset by a gang of workmen who were mending the road.
They formed a cordon, shouldered their pickaxes, and swore
they would not let the Duke pass till he said "God save the
Queen." "Well, gentlemen, since you will have it so&#8212;
'God save the Queen,' and may all your wives be like her!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot (wife of the Duke's private secretary,
familiarly called "Gosh") was fond of parading her intimacy
with the Duke before miscellaneous company. One day,
in a large party, she said to him,&#8212;</p>
<p>"Duke, I know you won't mind my asking you, but is it
true that you were surprised at Waterloo?"</p>
<p>"By G----! not half as much surprised as I am now,
mum."</p>
<p>When the Queen came to the throne her first public act
was to go in state to St. James's Palace to be proclaimed.
She naturally wished to be accompanied in her State coach
only by the Duchess of Kent and one of the Ladies of the
Household; but Lord Albemarle, who was Master of the
Horse, insisted that he had a right to travel with her Majesty
in the coach, as he had done with William IV. The
point was submitted to the Duke of Wellington, as a kind
of universal referee in matters of precedence and usage.
His judgment was delightfully unflattering to the outraged
magnate&#8212;"The Queen can make you go inside the coach
or outside the coach, or run behind like a tinker's dog."</p>
<p>And surely the whole literary profession, of which the
present writer is a feeble unit, must cherish a sentiment of
grateful respect for the memory of a man who, in refusing
the dedication of a song, informed Mrs. Norton that he
had been obliged to make a rule of refusing dedications,
"because, in his situation as Chancellor of the University
of Oxford, he had been <i>much exposed to authors</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="Page_27"></a>III.</h2>
<h2>LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h2>
<br>
<p>If the Christian Socialists ever frame a Kalendar of
Worthies (after the manner of Auguste Comte), it is to be
hoped that they will mark among the most sacred of their
anniversaries the day&#8212;April 28, 1801&#8212;which gave birth
to Anthony Ashley, seventh Earl of Shaftesbury. His life
of eighty-four years was consecrated, from boyhood till
death, to the social service of humanity; and, for my own
part, I must always regard the privilege of his friendship as
among the highest honours of my life. Let me try to
recall some of the outward and inward characteristics of this
truly illustrious man.</p>
<p>Lord Shaftesbury was tall and spare&#8212;almost gaunt&#8212;in
figure, but powerfully framed, and capable of great exertion.
His features were handsome and strongly marked&#8212;an
aquiline nose and very prominent chin. His complexion
was as pale as marble, and contrasted effectively with
a thick crop of jet-black hair which extreme old age scarcely
tinged with silver.</p>
<p>When he first entered Parliament a contemporary observer
wrote: "It would be difficult to imagine a more complete
beau-ideal of aristocracy. His whole countenance has the
coldness as well as the grace of a chiselled one, and expresses
precision, prudence, and determination in no common
degree." The stateliness of bearing, the unbroken figure,
<a name="Page_28"></a>the high glance of stern though melancholy
resolve, he
retained to the end. But the incessant labour and anxiety
of sixty years made their mark, and Sir John Millais's noble
portrait, painted in 1877, shows a countenance on which
a lifelong contact with human suffering had written its tale
in legible characters.</p>
<p>Temperament is, I suppose, hereditary. Lord Shaftesbury's
father, who was for nearly forty years Chairman of
Committees in the House of Lords, was distinguished by a
strong intellect, an imperious temper, and a character
singularly deficient in amiability. His mother (whose
childish beauty is familiar to all lovers of Sir Joshua's art
as the little girl frightened by the mask in the great
"Marlborough Group") was the daughter of the third Duke
of Marlborough by that Duchess whom Queen Charlotte
pronounced to be the proudest woman in England. It is
reasonable to suppose that from such a parentage and such
an ancestry Lord Shaftesbury derived some of the most
conspicuous features of his character. From his father he
inherited his keenness of intellect, his habits of laborious
industry, and his iron tenacity of purpose. From his
mother he may have acquired that strong sense of personal
dignity&#8212;that intuitive and perhaps unconscious feeling of
what was due to his station as well as to his
individuality&#8212;which
made his presence and address so impressive and
sometimes alarming.</p>
<p>Dignity was indeed the quality which immediately struck
one on one's first encounter with Lord Shaftesbury; and
with dignity were associated a marked imperiousness and
an eager rapidity of thought, utterance, and action. As
one got to know him better, one began to realize his
intense tenderness towards all weakness and suffering;
his overflowing affection for those who stood nearest to
him; his almost morbid sensitiveness; his passionate indignation
against cruelty or oppression. Now and then
<a name="Page_29"></a>his conversation was brightened by brief and
sudden gleams
of genuine humour, but these gleams were rare. He had seen
too much of human misery to be habitually jocose, and his
whole nature was underlain by a groundwork of melancholy.</p>
<p>The marble of manhood retained the impression stamped
upon the wax of childhood. His early years had been
profoundly unhappy. His parents were stern disciplinarians
of the antique type. His private school was a hell on
earth; and yet he used to say that he feared the master and
the bullies less than he feared his parents. One element
of joy, and one only, he recognized in looking back to
those dark days, and that was the devotion of an old nurse,
who comforted him in his childish sorrows, and taught him
the rudiments of Christian faith. In all the struggles and
distresses of boyhood and manhood, he used the words of
prayer which he had learned from this good woman before
he was seven years old; and of a keepsake which she left
him&#8212;the gold watch which he wore to the last day of his
life&#8212;he used to say, "That was given to me by the best
friend I ever had in the world."</p>
<p>At twelve years old Anthony Ashley went to Harrow,
where he boarded with the Head Master, Dr. Butler, father
of the present Master of Trinity. I have heard him say
that the master in whose form he was, being a bad sleeper,
held "first school" at four o'clock on a winter's morning;
and that the boy for whom he fagged, being anxious to
shine as a reciter, and finding it difficult to secure an
audience, compelled him and his fellow-fag to listen night
after night to his recitations, perched on a high stool where
a nap was impossible.</p>
<p>But in spite of these austerities, Anthony Ashley was
happy at Harrow; and the place should be sacred in the
eyes of all philanthropists, because it was there that, when
he was fourteen years old, he consciously and definitely
gave his life to the service of his fellow-men. He chanced
<a name="Page_30"></a>to see a scene of drunken indecency and neglect
at the
funeral of one of the villagers, and exclaimed in horror,
"Good heavens! Can this be permitted simply because
the man was poor and friendless?" What resulted is
told by a tablet on the wall of the Old School, which bears
the following inscription:&#8212;</p>

</div>
<p>After leaving Harrow Lord Ashley (as he now was) spent
two years at a private tutor's, and in 1819 he went up to
Christ Church. In 1822 he took a First Class in Classics.
The next four years were spent in study and travel, and in
1826 he was returned to Parliament, by the influence of his
uncle the Duke of Marlborough, for the Borough of Woodstock.
On November 16 he recorded in his diary: "Took
the oaths of Parliament with great good will; a slight prayer
for assistance in my thoughts and deeds." Never was a
politician's prayer more abundantly granted.</p>
<p>In 1830 Lord Ashley married a daughter of Lord Cowper,
and this marriage, independently of the radiant happiness
which it brought, had an important bearing on his political
career; for Lady Ashley's uncle was Lord Melbourne, and
her mother became, by a second marriage, the wife of Lord
Palmerston. Of Lord Melbourne and his strong common
sense Lord Shaftesbury, in 1882, told me the following
characteristic story. When the Queen became engaged to
<a name="Page_31"></a>Prince Albert, she wished him to be made King
Consort
by Act of Parliament, and urged her wish upon the Prime
Minister, Lord Melbourne. At first that sagacious man
simply evaded the point, but when her Majesty insisted on
a categorical answer, "I thought it my duty to be very
plain with her. I said, 'For G---- 's sake, let's hear no
more of it, ma'am; for if you once get the English people
into the way of making kings, you will get them into the
way of unmaking them.'"</p>
<p>By this time Lord Ashley was deeply immersed in those
philanthropic enterprises which he had deliberately chosen
as the occupation of his lifetime. Reform of the Lunacy
Law and a humaner treatment of lunatics were the earliest
objects to which he devoted himself. To attain them the
more effectually he got himself made a member, and subsequently
chairman, of the Lunacy Commission, and threw
himself into the work with characteristic thoroughness. He
used to pay "surprise visits" both by day and night to
public and private asylums, and discovered by those means
a system of regulated and sanctioned cruelty which, as he
narrated it in his old age, seemed almost too horrible for
credence.</p>
<p>The abolition of slavery all over the world was a cause
which very early enlisted his sympathy, and he used to tell,
with grim humour, how, when, after he had become Lord
Shaftesbury, he signed an Open Letter to America in
favour of emancipation, a Southern newspaper sarcastically
inquired, "Where was this Lord Shaftesbury when the
noble-hearted Lord Ashley was doing his single-handed
work on behalf of the English slaves in the factories of
Lancashire and Yorkshire?"</p>
<p>Sanitary reform and the promotion of the public health
were objects at which, in the middle part of his life, he
worked hard, both as a landowner and as the unpaid Chairman
of the Board of Health. The crusade against vivisection
<a name="Page_32"></a>warmed his heart and woke his indignant eloquence
in his
declining years. His Memorial Service in Westminster
Abbey was attended by representatives of nearly two
hundred religious and philanthropic institutions with which
he had been connected, and which, in one way or another,
he had served. But, of course, it is with the reform of the
Factory Laws that his name is most inseparably associated.</p>
<p>In 1833 Lord Ashley took up the Ten Hours Bill,
previously in the charge of Mr. Sadler, who had now lost
his seat. He carried his Bill through the Second Reading,
but it was opposed by Lord Althorp, who threw it out, and
carried a modified proposal in 1833. In 1844 the introduction
of a new Bill for the regulation of labour in factories
brought Lord Ashley back to his old battlefield. A desperate
struggle was made to amend the Bill into a Ten Hours Bill,
but this failed, owing to Sir Robert Peel's threat of
resignation. In 1845 Lord Ashley refused the Chief
Secretaryship for Ireland in order to be able to devote
himself wholly to the Ten Hours Bill; and, as soon as
Parliament rose, he went on a tour through the manufacturing
districts, speaking in public, mediating between masters
and men, and organizing the Ten Hours movement.</p>
<p>In 1847 the Bill passed into law. On June 1 in that
year Lord Ashley wrote in his diary: "News that the
Factory Bill has just passed the Third Reading. I am
humbled that my heart is not bursting with thankfulness
to Almighty God&#8212;that I can find breath and sense to
express my joy. What reward shall we give unto the Lord
for all the benefits He hath conferred upon us?&#8212;God in His
mercy prosper the work, and grant that these operatives
may receive the cup of salvation and call upon the name of
the Lord!"</p>
<p>The perfervid vein of philanthropic zeal which is apparent
in this extract animated every part of Lord Shaftesbury's
nature and every action of his life. He had, if ever man
<a name="Page_33"></a>had, "the Enthusiasm of Humanity." His religion,
on its
interior side, was rapt, emotional, and sometimes mystic;
but at the same time it was, in its outward manifestations,
definite, tangible, and, beyond most men's, practical. At
the age of twenty-seven he wrote in his diary: "On my
soul, I believe that I desire the welfare of mankind." At
eighty-four he exclaimed, in view of his approaching end,
"I cannot bear to leave the world with all the misery in it."
And this was no mere effusive declamation, but the genuine
utterance of a zeal which condescended to the most minute
and laborious forms of practical expression. "Poor dear
children!" he exclaimed to the superintendent of a ragged
school, after hearing from some of the children their tale of
cold and hunger. "What can we do for them?"</p>
<p>"My God shall supply all their need," replied the superintendent
with easy faith.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Lord Shaftesbury, "He will, but they must
have some food directly." He drove home, and instantly
sent two churns of soup, enough to feed four hundred.
That winter ten thousand basins of soup, made in Grosvenor
Square, were distributed among the "dear little hearts"
of Whitechapel.</p>
<p>And as in small things, so in great. One principle
consecrated his whole life. His love of God constrained
him to the service of men, and no earthly object or
consideration&#8212;however
natural, innocent, or even laudable&#8212;was
allowed for a moment to interpose itself between him
and the supreme purpose for which he lived. He was by
nature a man of keen ambition, and yet he twice refused
office in the Household, once the Chief Secretaryship, and
three times a seat in the Cabinet, because acceptance
would have hindered him in his social legislation and
philanthropic business. When we consider his singular
qualifications for public life&#8212;his physical gifts, his power
of speech, his habits of business, his intimate connections
<a name="Page_34"></a>with the official caste&#8212;when we remember that he
did
not succeed to his paternal property till he was fifty years
old, and then found it grossly neglected and burdened
with debt; and that his purse had been constantly drained
by his philanthropic enterprises&#8212;we are justified in saying
that very few men have ever sacrificed so much for a cause
which brought neither honours, nor riches, nor power, nor
any visible reward, except the diminished suffering and
increased happiness of multitudes who were the least able
to help themselves.</p>
<p>Lord Shaftesbury's devotion to the cause of Labour led
him to make the Factory Acts a touchstone of character.
To the end of his days his view of public men was largely
governed by the part which they had played in that great
controversy. "Gladstone voted against me," was a stern
sentence not seldom on his lips. "Bright was the most
malignant opponent the Factory Bill ever had." "Cobden,
though bitterly hostile, was better than Bright." Even men
whom on general grounds he disliked and despised&#8212;such
as Lord Beaconsfield and Bishop Wilberforce&#8212;found a
saving clause in his judgment if he could truthfully say,
"He helped me with the chimney-sweeps," or, "He felt for
the wretched operatives."</p>
<p>But even apart from questions of humane sentiment and
the supreme interests of social legislation, I always felt in
my intercourse with Lord Shaftesbury that it would have
been impossible for him to act for long together in subordination
to, or even in concert with, any political leader.
Resolute, self-reliant, inflexible; hating compromise; never
turning aside by a hair's-breadth from the path of duty;
incapable of flattering high or low; dreading leaps in the
dark, but dreading more than anything else the sacrifice of
principle to party&#8212;he was essentially the type of politician
who is the despair of the official wire-puller.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Lord Palmerston was the statesman with
<a name="Page_35"></a>whom, despite all ethical dissimilarity, he had
the most
sympathy, and this arose partly from their near relationship
and partly from Lord Palmerston's easy-going habit of
placing his ecclesiastical patronage in Lord Shaftesbury's
hands. It was this unseen but not unfelt power as a confidential
yet irresponsible adviser that Lord Shaftesbury
really enjoyed and, indeed, his political opinions were too
individual to have allowed of binding association with either
political party. He was, in the truest and best sense of the
word, a Conservative. To call him a Tory would be quite
misleading. He was not averse from Roman Catholic
emancipation. He took no prominent part against the
first Reform Bill. His resistance to the admission of the
Jews to Parliament was directed rather against the method
than the principle. Though not friendly to Women's
Suffrage, he said: "I shall feel myself bound to conform to
the national will, but I am not prepared to stimulate it."</p>
<p>But while no blind and unreasoning opponent of all
change, he had a deep and lively veneration for the past.
Institutions, doctrines, ceremonies, dignities, even social
customs, which had descended from old time, had for him
a fascination and an awe. In his high sense of the privileges
and the duties of kingship, of aristocracy, of territorial possession,
of established religions, he recalled the doctrine of
Burke; and he resembled that illustrious man in his passionate
love of principle, in his proud hatred of shifts and compromises,
in his contempt for the whole race of mechanical
politicians and their ignoble strife for place and power.</p>
<p>When Lord Derby formed his Government in 1866, on
the defeat of Lord Russell's second Reform Bill, he endeavoured
to obtain the sanction of Lord Shaftesbury's name
and authority by offering him a seat in his Cabinet. This
offer was promptly declined; had it been accepted, it might
have had an important bearing on the following event, which
was narrated to me by Lord Shaftesbury in 1882. One
<a name="Page_36"></a>winter evening in 1867 he was sitting in his
library in
Grosvenor Square, when the servant told him that there was a
poor man waiting to see him. The man was shown in, and
proved to be a labourer from Clerkenwell, and one of the
innumerable recipients of the old Earl's charity. He said,
"My Lord, you have been very good to me, and I have
come to tell you what I have heard." It appeared that at
the public-house which he frequented he had overheard
some Irishmen of desperate character plotting to blow up
Clerkenwell prison. He gave Lord Shaftesbury the information
to be used as he thought best, but made it a condition
that his name should not be divulged. If it were, his
life would not be worth an hour's purchase. Lord Shaftesbury
pledged himself to secrecy, ordered his carriage, and
drove instantly to Whitehall. The authorities there refused,
on grounds of official practice, to entertain the information
without the name and address of the informant. These, of
course, could not be given. The warning was rejected, and
the jail blown up. Had Lord Shaftesbury been a Cabinet
Minister, this triumph of officialism would probably not
have occurred.</p>
<p>What I have said of this favourite hero of mine in his
public aspects will have prepared the sympathetic reader
for the presentment of the man as he appeared in private
life. For what he was abroad that he was at home. He
was not a man who showed two natures or lived two lives.
He was profoundly religious, eagerly benevolent, utterly
impatient of whatever stood between him and the laudable
object of the moment, warmly attached to those who shared
his sympathies and helped his enterprises&#8212;<i>Fort comme le
diamant; plus tendre qu'une m&egrave;re</i>. The imperiousness
which I described at the outset remained a leading characteristic
to the last. His opinions were strong, his judgment
was emphatic, his language unmeasured. He had been, all
through his public life, surrounded by a cohort of admiring
<a name="Page_37"></a>and obedient coadjutors, and he was unused to,
and intolerant
of, disagreement or opposition. It was a disconcerting
experience to speak on a platform where he was chairman,
and, just as one was warming to an impressive passage, to
feel a vigorous pull at one's coat-tail, and to hear a quick,
imperative voice say, in no muffled tone, "My dear fellow,
are you never going to stop? We shall be here all night."</p>
<p>But when due allowance was made for this natural habit
of command, Lord Shaftesbury was delightful company.
Given to hospitality, he did the honours with stately grace;
and, on the rare occasions when he could be induced to
dine out, his presence was sure to make the party a success.
In early life he had been pestered by a delicate digestion,
and had accustomed himself to a regimen of rigid
simplicity; but, though the most abstemious of men, he
knew and liked a good glass of wine, and in a small party
would bring out of the treasures of his memory things new
and old with a copiousness and a vivacity which fairly fascinated
his hearers. His conversation had a certain flavour
of literature. His classical scholarship was easy and graceful.
He had the Latin poets at his fingers' ends, spoke
French fluently, knew Milton by heart, and was a great
admirer of Crabbe. His own style, both in speech and
writing, was copious, vigorous, and often really eloquent.
It had the same ornamental precision as his exquisite handwriting.
When he was among friends whom he thoroughly
enjoyed, the sombre dignity of his conversation was constantly
enlivened by flashes of a genuine humour, which
relieved, by the force of vivid contrast, the habitual austerity
of his demeanour.</p>
<p>A kind of proud humility was constantly present in his
speech and bearing. Ostentation, display, lavish expenditure
would have been abhorrent alike to his taste and his principles.
The stately figure which bore itself so majestically
in Courts and Parliaments naturally unbent among the
<a name="Page_38"></a>costermongers of Whitechapel and the labourers of
Dorsetshire.
His personal appointments were simple to a degree;
his own expenditure was restricted within the narrowest
limits. But he loved, and was honestly proud of, his beautiful
home&#8212;St. Giles's House, near Cranbourne; and when
he received his guests, gentle or simple, at "The Saint," as
he affectionately called it, the mixture of stateliness and
geniality in his bearing and address was an object-lesson in
high breeding. Once Lord Beaconsfield, who was staying
with Lord Alington at Crichel, was driven over to call on
Lord Shaftesbury at St. Giles's. When he rose to take his
leave, he said, with characteristic magniloquence, but not
without an element of truth, "Good-bye, my dear Lord.
You have given me the privilege of seeing one of the most
impressive of all spectacles&#8212;a great English nobleman
living in patriarchal state in his own hereditary halls."</p>

<h2><a name="Page_39"></a>IV.</h2>
<h2>CARDINAL MANNING.</h2>
<p>I have described a great philanthropist and a great
statesman. My present subject is a man who combined
in singular harmony the qualities of philanthropy and of
statesmanship&#8212;Henry Edward, Cardinal Manning, and
titular Archbishop of Westminster.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with Cardinal Manning began in 1833.
Early in the Parliamentary session of that year he intimated,
through a common friend, a desire to make my acquaintance.
He wished to get an independent Member of
Parliament, and especially, if possible, a Liberal and a
Churchman, to take up in the House of Commons the
cause of Denominational Education. His scheme was
much the same as that now<a name="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
adopted by the Government&#8212;the
concurrent endowment of all denominational schools;
which, as he remarked, would practically come to mean
those of the Anglicans, the Romans, and the Wesleyans.
In compliance with his request, I presented myself at that
barrack-like building off the Vauxhall Bridge Road, which
was formerly the Guards' Institute, and is now the Archbishop's
House. Of course, I had long been familiar with
the Cardinal's shrunken form and finely-cut features, and
that extraordinary dignity of bearing which gave him,
<a name="Page_40"></a>though in reality below the middle height, the
air and
aspect of a tall man. But I only knew him as a conspicuous
and impressive figure in society, on public platforms,
and (where he specially loved to be) in the precincts
of the House of Commons. I had never exchanged a word
with him, and it was with a feeling of very special interest
that I entered his presence.</p>
<p>We had little in common. I was still a young man, and
the Cardinal was already old. I was a staunch Anglican;
he, the most devoted of Papalists. I was strongly opposed
both to his Ultramontane policy and to those dexterous
methods by which he was commonly supposed to promote
it; and, as far as the circumstances of my life had given me
any insight into the interior of Romanism, I sympathized
with the great Oratorian of Birmingham rather than with
his brother-cardinal of Westminster. But though I hope
that my principles stood firm, all my prejudices melted away
in that fascinating presence. Though there was something
like half a century's difference in our ages, I felt at once
and completely at home with him.</p>
<p>What made our perfect ease of intercourse more remarkable
was that, as far as the Cardinal's immediate object
was concerned, my visit was a total failure. I had no
sympathy with his scheme for the endowment of denominational
teaching, and, with all the will in the world to
please him, I could not even meet him half way. But this
untoward circumstance did not import the least difficulty
or restraint into our conversation. He gently glided from
business into general topics; knew all about my career,
congratulated me on some recent success, remembered some
of my belongings, inquired about my school and college,
was interested to find that, like himself, I had been at
Harrow and Oxford, and, after an hour's pleasant chat,
said, "Now you must stay and have some luncheon."
From that day to the end of his life I was a frequent
<a name="Page_41"></a>visitor at his house, and every year that I knew
him I
learned to regard and respect him increasingly.</p>
<p>Looking back over these fourteen years, and reviewing
my impressions of his personality, I must put first the
physical aspect of the man. He seemed older than he was,
and even more ascetic, for he looked as if, like the
cardinal in <i>Lothair</i>, he lived on biscuits and soda-water;
whereas he had a hearty appetite for his midday meal, and,
in his own words, "enjoyed his tea." Still, he carried the
irreducible minimum of flesh on his bones, and his hollow
cheeks and shrunken jaws threw his massive forehead into
striking prominence. His line of features was absolutely
faultless in its statuesque regularity, but his face was saved
from the insipidity of too great perfection by the
imperious&#8212;rather
ruthless&#8212;lines of his mouth and the penetrating
lustre of his deep-set eyes. His dress&#8212;a black cassock
edged and buttoned with crimson, with a crimson skullcap
and biretta, and a pectoral cross of gold&#8212;enhanced the
picturesqueness of his aspect, and as he entered the anteroom
where one awaited his approach, the most Protestant
knee instinctively bent.</p>
<p>His dignity was astonishing. The position of a cardinal
with a princely rank recognized abroad but officially ignored
in England was difficult to carry off, but his exquisite
tact enabled him to sustain it to perfection. He never
put himself forward; never asserted his rank; never exposed
himself to rebuffs; still, he always contrived to be the
most conspicuous figure in any company which he entered;
and whether one greeted him with the homage due to a
prince of the Church or merely with the respect which no
one refuses to a courtly old gentleman, his manner was
equally easy, natural, and unembarrassed. The fact that
the Cardinal's name, after due consideration, was inserted
in the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Poor
immediately after that of the Prince of Wales and before
<a name="Page_42"></a>Lord Salisbury's was the formal recognition of a
social
precedence which adroitness and judgment had already
made his own.</p>
<p>To imagine that Cardinal Manning regarded station, or
dignity, or even power, as treasures to be valued in themselves
would be ridiculously to misconceive the man. He
had two supreme and absorbing objects in life&#8212;if, indeed,
they may not be more properly spoken of as one&#8212;the
glory of God and the salvation of men. These were, in his
intellect and conscience, identified with the victory of the
Roman Church. To these all else was subordinated; by
its relation to these all else was weighed and calculated.
His ecclesiastical dignity, and the secular recognition of it,
were valuable as means to high ends. They attracted
public notice to his person and mission; they secured him
a wider hearing; they gave him access to circles which,
perhaps, would otherwise have been closed. Hence, and
for no other reason, they were valuable.</p>
<p>It has always to be borne in mind that Manning was
essentially a man of the world, though he was much more
than that. Be it far from me to disparage the ordinary
type of Roman ecclesiastic, who is bred in a seminary,
and perhaps spends his lifetime in a religious community.
That peculiar training produces, often enough, a character
of saintliness and unworldly grace on which one can only
"look," to use a phrase of Mr. Gladstone's, "as men look
up at the stars." But it was a very different process that
had made Cardinal Manning what he was. He had touched
life at many points. A wealthy home, four years at Harrow,
Balliol in its palmiest days, a good degree, a College
Fellowship, political and secular ambitions of no common
kind, apprenticeship to the practical work of a Government
office, a marriage brightly but all too briefly happy, the
charge of a country parish, and an early initiation into
the duties of ecclesiastical rulership&#8212;all these experiences
<a name="Page_43"></a>had made Henry Manning, by the time of his
momentous
change, an accomplished man of the world.</p>
<p>His subsequent career, though, of course, it superadded
certain characteristics of its own, never obliterated or even
concealed the marks left by those earlier phases, and the
octogenarian Cardinal was a beautifully-mannered, well-informed,
sagacious old gentleman who, but for his dress,
might have passed for a Cabinet Minister, an eminent
judge, or a great county magnate.</p>
<p>His mental alertness was remarkable. He seemed to
read everything that came out, and to know all that was
going on. He probed character with a glance, and was
particularly sharp on pretentiousness and self-importance.
A well-known publicist, who perhaps thinks of himself
rather more highly than he ought to think, once ventured
to tell the Cardinal that he knew nothing about the
subject of a painful agitation which pervaded London in
the summer of 1885. "I have been hearing confessions
in London for thirty years, and I fancy more people have
confided their secrets to me than to you, Mr.----," was the
Cardinal's reply.</p>
<p>Once, when his burning sympathy with suffering and his
profound contempt for Political Economy had led him, in
his own words, to "poke fun at the Dismal Science," the
<i>Times</i> lectured him in its most superior manner, and said
that the venerable prelate seemed to mistake cause and
effect. "That," said the Cardinal to me, "is the sort of
criticism that an undergraduate makes, and thinks himself
very clever. But I am told that in the present day the
<i>Times</i> is chiefly written by undergraduates."</p>
<p>I once asked him what he thought of a high dignitary
of the English Church, who had gone a certain way in a
public movement, and then had been frightened back by
clamour. His reply was the single word "<i>infirmus</i>,"
accompanied
by that peculiar sniff which every one who ever
<a name="Page_44"></a>conversed with him must remember as adding so
much to
the piquancy of his terse judgments. When he was asked
his opinion of a famous biography in which a son had
disclosed, with too absolute frankness, his father's innermost
thoughts and feelings, the Cardinal replied, "I think
that ---- has committed the sin of Ham."</p>
<p>His sense of humour was peculiarly keen, and though it
was habitually kept under control, it was sometimes used
to point a moral with admirable effect.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do in life?" he asked a rather
flippant undergraduate at Oxford.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm going to take Holy Orders," was the airy
reply.</p>
<p>"Take care you get them, my son."</p>
<p>Though he was intolerant of bumptiousness, the Cardinal
liked young men. He often had some about him, and in
speaking to them the friendliness of his manner was touched
with fatherliness in a truly attractive fashion. And as with
young men, so with children. Surely nothing could be
prettier than this answer to a little girl in New York who
had addressed some of her domestic experiences to
"Cardinal Manning, England."</p>
<p>"My Dear Child,&#8212;You ask me whether I am glad to
receive letters from little children. I am always glad, for
they write kindly and give me no trouble. I wish all my
letters were like theirs. Give my blessing to your father,
and tell him that our good Master will reward him a
hundredfold for all he has lost for the sake of his faith.
Tell him that when he comes over to England he must
come to see me. And mind you bring your violin, for I
love music, but seldom have any time to hear it. The next
three or four years of your life are very precious. They are
like the ploughing-time and the sowing-time in the year.
You are learning to know God, the Holy Trinity, the
Incarnation, the presence and voice of the Holy Ghost in
<a name="Page_45"></a>the Church of Jesus Christ. Learn all these
things solidly,
and you will love the Blessed Sacrament and our Blessed
Mother with all your heart. And now you will pray for
me that I may make a good end of a long life, which
cannot be far off. And may God guide you and guard
you in innocence and in fidelity through this evil, evil
world! And may His blessing be on your home and all
belonging to you! Believe me always a true friend, Henry
Edward, Card. Abp. of Westminster."</p>
<p>The Cardinal had, I should say, rather a contempt for
women. He exercised a great influence over them, but I
question if he rated their intellectual and moral qualities as
highly as he ought, and their "rights" he held in utter detestation.
General society, though in his later days he saw
little of it except at the Athenaeum, he thoroughly enjoyed.
Like most old people, he was fond of talking about old
days, and as he had known hosts of important and interesting
men, had a tenacious memory, and spoke the most
finished English, it was a pleasure to listen to his reminiscences.
He wrote as well as he talked. His pointed and
lucid style gave to his printed performances a semblance
of cogency which they did not really possess; and his
letters&#8212;even
his shortest notes&#8212;were as exquisite in wording as
in penmanship. As he grew older, he became increasingly
sensible of the charms of "Auld Lang Syne," and he delighted
to renew his acquaintance with the scenes and
associations of his youth.</p>
<p>On July 15, 1888, being the first day of the Eton and
Harrow Match at Lord's, a few old Harrovians of different
generations met at a Harrow dinner. The Cardinal, who
had just turned eighty, was invited. He declined to dine,
on the ground that he never dined out, but he would on
no account forego the opportunity of meeting the members
of his old school, and he recalled with pride that he had
played for two years in the Harrow Eleven. He appeared
<a name="Page_46"></a>as soon as dinner was over, gallantly faced the
cloud of
cigar-smoke, was in his very best vein of anecdote and
reminiscence, and stayed till the party broke up.</p>
<p>The Cardinal's friendships were not, I believe, numerous,
but his affection for Mr. Gladstone is well known. It dated
from Oxford. Through Manning and Hope-Scott the
influence of the Catholic revival reached the young member
for Newark, and they were the godfathers of his eldest son.
After their secession to Rome in 1851 this profound friendship
fell into abeyance. As far as Manning was concerned,
it was renewed when, in 1868, Mr. Gladstone took in hand
to disestablish the Irish Church. It was broken again by
the controversy about <i>Vaticanism</i>, in 1875, and some fifteen
years later was happily revived by the good offices of a
common friend. "Gladstone is a very fine fellow," said
the Cardinal to me in 1890. "He is not vindictive. You
may fight him as hard as you like, and when the fight is
over you will find that it has left no rancour behind it."</p>
<p>This affection for Mr. Gladstone was a personal matter,
quite independent of politics; but in political matters also
they had much in common. "You know," wrote the
Cardinal to Mrs. Gladstone on her Golden Wedding, "how
nearly I have agreed in William's political career, especially
in his Irish policy of the last twenty years." He accepted
the principle of Home Rule, though he thought badly of
the Bill of 1886, and predicted its failure from the day
when it was brought in. The exclusion of the Irish members
was in his eyes a fatal blot, as tending rather to separation
than to that Imperial federation which was his political
ideal. But the Cardinal always held his politics in subordination
to his religion, and at the General Election of 1885 his
vigorous intervention on behalf of denominational education
which he considered to be imperilled by the Radical policy,
considerably embarrassed the Liberal cause in those districts
of London where there is a Roman Catholic vote.</p>
<p><a name="Page_47"></a>It is necessary to say a word about Cardinal
Manning's
method of religious propagandism. He excelled in the art
of driving a nail where it would go. He never worried his
acquaintance with controversy, never introduced religious
topics unseasonably, never cast his pearls before unappreciative
animals. But when he saw a chance, an opening,
a sympathetic tendency, or a weak spot, he fastened on it
with unerring instinct. His line was rather admonitory
than persuasive. When he thought that the person whom
he was addressing had an inkling of the truth, but was held
back from avowing it by cowardice or indecision, he would
utter the most startling warnings about the danger of dallying
with grace.</p>
<p>"I promise you to become a Catholic when I am twenty-one,"
said a young lady whom he was trying to convert.</p>
<p>"But can you promise to live so long?" was the searching
rejoinder.</p>
<p>In Manning's belief, the Roman Church was the one
oracle of truth and the one ark of salvation; and his was
the faith which would compass sea and land, sacrifice all
that it possessed, and give its body to be burned, if it might
by any means bring one more soul to safety. If he could
win a single human being to see the truth and act on it, he
was supremely happy. To make the Church of Rome
attractive, to enlarge her borders, to win recruits for her,
was therefore his constant effort. He had an ulterior eye
to it in all his public works&#8212;his zealous teetotalism, his
advocacy of the claims of labour, his sympathy with the
demand for Home Rule; and the same principle which
animated him in these large schemes of philanthropy and
public policy made itself felt in the minutest details of
daily life and personal dealing. Where he saw the possibility
of making a convert, or even of dissipating prejudice
and inclining a single Protestant more favourably towards
Rome, he left no stone unturned to secure this all-important
<a name="Page_48"></a>end. Hence it came that he was constantly, and
not
wholly without reason, depicted as a man whom in religious
matters it was impossible to trust; with whom the end
justified the means; and whose every act and word, where
the interests of his Church were involved, must be watched
with the most jealous suspicion.</p>
<p>All this was grossly overstated. Whatever else Cardinal
Manning was, he was an English gentleman of the old
school, with a nice sense of honour and propriety. But
still, under a mass of calumny and exaggeration, there lay
this substratum of truth&#8212;that he who wills the end wills
the means; and that where the interests of a sacred cause
are at stake, an enthusiastic adherent will sometimes use
methods to which, in enterprises of less pith and moment,
recourse could not properly be had.</p>
<p>Manning had what has been called "the ambition of
distinctiveness." He felt that he had a special mission
which no other man could so adequately fulfil, and this
was to establish and popularize in England his own robust
faith in the cause of the Papacy as identical with the cause
of God. There never lived a stronger Papalist. He was
more Ultramontane than the Ultramontanes. Everything
Roman was to him divine. Italian architecture, Italian
vestments, the Italian mode of pronouncing ecclesiastical
Latin were dear to him, because they visibly and audibly
implied the all-pervading presence and power of Rome.
Rightly or wrongly, he conceived that English Romanism,
as it was when he joined the Roman Church, was practically
Gallicanism; that it minimized the Papal supremacy, was
disloyal to the Temporal Power, and was prone to accommodate
itself to its Protestant and secular environment.
Against this time-serving spirit he set his face like a flint.
He believed that he had been divinely appointed to Papalize
England. The cause of the Pope was the cause of God;
Manning was the person who could best serve the Pope's
<a name="Page_49"></a>cause, and therefore all forces which opposed him
were
in effect opposing the Divine Will. This seems to have
been his simple and sufficient creed, and certainly it had
the merit of supplying a clear rule of action. It made
itself felt in his hostility to the Religious Orders, and
especially the Society of Jesus. Religious Orders are
extra-episcopal. The Jesuits are scarcely subject to the
Pope himself. Certainly neither the Orders nor the
Society would, or could, be subject to Manning. A power
independent of, or hostile to, his authority was inimical
to religion, and must, as a religious duty, be checked, and,
if possible, destroyed. Exactly the same principle animated
his dealings with Cardinal Newman. Rightly or wrongly,
Manning thought Newman a half-hearted Papalist. He
dreaded alike his way of putting things and his practical
policy. Newman's favourite scheme of establishing a
Roman Catholic college at Oxford, Manning regarded as
fraught with peril to the faith of the rising generation. The
scheme must therefore be crushed and its author snubbed.</p>
<p>I must in candour add that these differences of opinion
between the two Cardinals were mixed with and embittered
by a sense of personal dislike. When Newman died there
appeared in a monthly magazine a series of very unflattering
sketches by one who had lived under his roof. I ventured
to ask Cardinal Manning if he had seen these sketches.
He replied that he had, and thought them very shocking;
the writer must have a very unenviable mind, &amp;c., and
then, having thus sacrificed to propriety, after a moment's
pause he added, "But if you ask me if they are like poor
Newman, I am bound to say&#8212;<i>a photograph</i>."</p>
<p>It was, I suppose, matter of common knowledge that
Manning's early and conspicuous ascendency in the
counsels of the Papacy rested mainly on the intimacy
of his personal relations with Pius IX. But it was news
to most of us that (if his biographer is right) he wished
<a name="Page_50"></a>to succeed Antonelli as Secretary of State in
1876, and to
transfer the scene of his activities from Westminster to
Rome, and that he attributed the Pope's disregard of his
wishes to mental decrepitude. The point, if true, is an
important one, for his accession to the Secretaryship of
State, and permanent residence in Rome, could not have
failed to affect the development of events when, two years
later, the Papal throne became vacant by the death of Pius
IX. But <i>Deo aliter visum</i>. It was ordained that he should
pass the evening of his days in England, and that he should
outlive his intimacy at the Vatican and his influence on the
general policy of the Church of Rome. With the accession
of Leo XIII. a new order began, and Newman's elevation
to the sacred purple seemed to affix the sanction of Infallibility
to views and methods against which Manning had
waged a Thirty Years' War. Henceforward he felt himself
a stranger at the Vatican, and powerless beyond the limits
of his own jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Perhaps this restriction of exterior activities in the
ecclesiastical sphere drove the venerable Cardinal to find a
vent for his untiring energies in those various efforts of
social reform in which, during the last ten years of his life,
he played so conspicuous a part. If this be so, though
Rome may have lost, England was unquestionably a gainer.
It was during those ten years that I was honoured by his
friendship. The storms, the struggles, the ambitions, the
intrigues which had filled so large a part of his middle life
lay far behind. He was revered, useful, and, I think,
contented in his present life, and looked forward with
serene confidence to the final, and not distant, issue.
Thrice happy is the man who, in spite of increasing infirmity
and the loss of much that once made life enjoyable, thus</p>

<h2><a name="Page_51"></a>V.</h2>
<h2>LORD HOUGHTON.</h2>
<p>It is narrated of an ancient Fellow of All Souls' that,
lamenting the changes which had transformed his College
from the nest of aristocratic idlers into a society of accomplished
scholars, he exclaimed: "Hang it all, sir, we were
<i>sui generis</i>." What the unreformed Fellows of All Souls'
were among the common run of Oxford dons, that, it may
truly (and with better syntax) be said, the late Lord
Houghton was among his fellow-citizens. Of all the men I
have ever known he was, I think, the most completely <i>sui
generis</i>. His temperament and turn of mind were, as far as
I know, quite unlike anything that obtained among his
predecessors and contemporaries; nor do I see them reproduced
among the men who have come after him. His
peculiarities were not external. His appearance accorded
with his position. He looked very much what one would
have expected in a country gentleman of large means and
prosperous circumstances. His early portraits show that
he was very like all the other young gentlemen of fashion
whom D'Orsay drew, with their long hair, high collars, and
stupendous neckcloths. The admirably faithful work of
Mr. Lehmann will enable all posterity to know exactly how
he looked in his later years with his loose-fitting clothes,
comfortable figure, and air of genial gravity. Externally
all was normal. His peculiarities were those of mental
habit, temperament, and taste. As far as I know, he had
<a name="Page_52"></a>not a drop of foreign blood in his veins, yet his
nature was
essentially un-English.</p>
<p>A country gentleman who frankly preferred living in
London, and a Yorkshireman who detested sport, made
a sufficiently strange phenomenon; but in Lord Houghton
the astonished world beheld as well a politician who wrote
poetry, a railway-director who lived in literature, a <i>libre-penseur</i>
who championed the Tractarians, a sentimentalist
who talked like a cynic, and a philosopher who had elevated
conviviality to the dignity of an exact science. Here,
indeed, was a "living oxymoron"&#8212;a combination of inconsistent
and incongruous qualities which to the typical John
Bull&#8212;Lord Palmerston's "Fat man with a white hat in the
twopenny omnibus"&#8212;was a sealed and hopeless mystery.</p>
<p>Something of this unlikeness to his fellow-Englishmen
was due, no doubt, to the fact that Lord Houghton, the
only son of a gifted, eccentric, and indulgent father, was
brought up at home. The glorification of the Public
School has been ridiculously overdone. But it argues no
blind faith in that strange system of unnatural restraints
and scarcely more reasonable indulgences to share Gibbon's
opinion that the training of a Public School is the best
adapted to the common run of Englishmen. "It made us
what we were, sir," said Major Bagstock to Mr. Dombey;
"we were iron, sir, and it forged us." The average English
boy being what he is by nature&#8212;"a soaring human boy,"
as Mr. Chadband called him&#8212;a Public School simply
makes him more so. It confirms alike his characteristic
faults and his peculiar virtues, and turns him out after
five or six years that altogether lovely and gracious product
&#8212;the Average Englishman. This may be readily conceded;
but, after all, the pleasantness of the world as a
place of residence, and the growing good of the human
race, do not depend exclusively on the Average Englishman;
and something may be said for the system of
<a name="Page_53"></a>training which has produced, not only all famous
foreigners
(for they, of course, are a negligible quantity), but such
exceptional Englishmen as William Pitt and Thomas
Macaulay, and John Keble and Samuel Wilberforce, and
Richard Monckton Milnes.</p>
<p>From an opulent and cultivated home young Milnes
passed to the most famous college in the world, and found
himself under the tuition of Whewell and Thirlwall, and
in the companionship of Alfred Tennyson and Julius Hare,
Charles Buller and John Sterling&#8212;a high-hearted brotherhood
who made their deep mark on the spiritual and intellectual
life of their own generation and of that which succeeded it.</p>
<p>After Cambridge came foreign travel, on a scale and
plan quite outside the beaten track of the conventional
"grand tour" as our fathers knew it. From the Continent
Richard Milnes brought back a gaiety of spirit, a frankness
of bearing, a lightness of touch which were quite un-English,
and "a taste for French novels, French cookery, and
French wines" with which Miss Crawley would have
sympathized. In 1837 he entered Parliament as a "Liberal
Conservative" for the Borough of Pontefract, over which
his father exercised considerable influence, and he immediately
became a conspicuous figure in the social life of
London. A few years later his position and character
were drawn by the hand of a master in a passage which
will well bear yet one more reproduction:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Vavasour was a social favourite; a poet, and a
real poet, and a troubadour, as well as a Member of
Parliament; travelled, sweet-tempered, and good-hearted;
amusing and clever. With catholic sympathies and an
eclectic turn of mind, Mr. Vavasour saw something good
in everybody and everything; which is certainly amiable,
and perhaps just, but disqualifies a man in some degree for
the business of life, which requires for its conduct a certain
degree of prejudice. Mr. Vavasour's breakfasts were <a name="Page_54"></a>renowned.
Whatever your creed, class, or
country&#8212;one
might almost add your character&#8212;you were a welcome
guest at his matutinal meal, provided you were celebrated.
That qualification, however, was rigidly enforced. A real
philosopher, alike from his genial disposition and from the
influence of his rich and various information, Vavasour
moved amid the strife, sympathizing with every one; and
perhaps, after all, the philanthropy which was his boast
was not untinged by a dash of humour, of which rare and
charming quality he possessed no inconsiderable portion.
Vavasour liked to know everybody who was known, and to
see everything which ought to be seen. His life was a
gyration of energetic curiosity; an insatiable whirl of social
celebrity. There was not a congregation of sages and
philosophers in any part of Europe which he did not attend
as a brother. He was present at the camp of Kalisch in
his yeomanry uniform, and assisted at the festivals of
Barcelona in an Andalusian jacket. He was everywhere
and at everything: he had gone down in a diving-bell and
gone up in a balloon. As for his acquaintances, he was
welcomed in every land; his universal sympathies seemed
omnipotent. Emperor and King, Jacobin and Carbonaro,
alike cherished him. He was the steward of Polish balls,
and the vindicator of Russian humanity; he dined with
Louis Philippe, and gave dinners to Louis Blanc."</blockquote>
<p>Lord Beaconsfield's penetration in reading character
and skill in delineating it were never, I think, displayed to
better advantage than in the foregoing passage. Divested
of its intentional and humorous exaggerations, it is not a
caricature, but a portrait. It exhibits with singular fidelity
the qualities which made Lord Houghton, to the end of his
long life, at once unique and lovable. We recognize the
overflowing sympathy, the keen interest in life, the vivid
faculty of enjoyment, the absolute freedom from national
prejudice, the love of seeing and of being seen.</p>
<p><a name="Page_55"></a>During the Chartist riots of 1848 Matthew
Arnold wrote
to his mother: "Tell Miss Martineau it is said here that
Monckton Milnes refused to be sworn in a special constable,
that he might be free to assume the post of President of the
Republic at a moment's notice." And those who knew
Lord Houghton best suspect that he himself originated the
joke at his own expense. The assured ease of young
Milnes's social manner, even among complete strangers,
so unlike the morbid self-repression and proud humility
of the typical Englishman, won for him the nickname of
"The Cool of the Evening." His wholly un-English
tolerance and constant effort to put himself in the place
of others whom the world condemned, procured for him
from Carlyle (who genuinely loved him) the title of
"President of the Heaven-and-Hell-Amalgamation Company."
Bishop Wilberforce wrote, describing a dinner-party
in 1847: "Carlyle was very great. Monckton Milnes
drew him out. Milnes began the young man's cant of the
present day&#8212;the barbarity and wickedness of capital
punishment; that, after all, we could not be sure others
were wicked, etc. Carlyle broke out on him with, 'None
of your Heaven-and-Hell-Amalgamation Companies for me.
We <i>do</i> know what is wickedness, <i>I</i> know wicked men, men
whom I <i>would not live with</i>&#8212;men whom under some
conceivable circumstances I would kill or they should kill
me. No, Milnes, there's no truth or greatness in all that.
It's just poor, miserable littleness.'"</p>
<p>Lord Houghton's faculty of enjoyment was peculiarly
keen. He warmed not only both hands but indeed all
his nature before the fire of life. "All impulses of soul and
sense" affected him with agreeable emotions; no pleasure
of body or spirit came amiss to him. And in nothing was
he more characteristically un-English than in the frank
manifestation of his enjoyment, bubbling over with an
infectious jollity, and never, even when touched by years
<a name="Page_56"></a>and illness, taking his pleasures after that
melancholy
manner of our nation to which it is a point of literary
honour not more directly to allude. Equally un-English
was his frank openness of speech and bearing. His address
was pre-eminently what old-fashioned people called "forthcoming."
It was strikingly&#8212;even amusingly&#8212;free from
that frigid dignity and arrogant reserve for which as a
nation we are so justly famed. I never saw him kiss a
guest on both cheeks, but if I had I should not have felt
the least surprised.</p>
<p>What would have surprised me would have been if the
guest (whatever his difference of age or station) had not
felt immediately and completely at home, or if Lord
Houghton had not seemed and spoken as if they had
known one another from the days of short frocks and
skipping-ropes. There never lived so perfect a host. His
sympathy was genius, and his hospitality a fine art. He was
peculiarly sensitive to the claims of "Auld Lang Syne,"
and when a young man came up from Oxford or Cambridge
to begin life in London, he was certain to find that Lord
Houghton had travelled on the Continent with his father,
or had danced with his mother, or had made love to his
aunt, and was eagerly on the look-out for an opportunity
of showing gracious and valuable kindness to the son of
his ancient friends.</p>
<p>When I first lived in London Lord Houghton was
occupying a house in Arlington Street made famous by
the fact that Hogarth drew its interior and decorations in
his pictures of "Marriage a la Mode." And nowhere
did the social neophyte receive a warmer welcome, or
find himself amid a more eclectic and representative
society. Queens of fashion, professional beauties, authors
and authoresses, ambassadors, philosophers, discoverers,
actors&#8212;every one who was famous or even notorious;
who had been anywhere or had done anything, from a
<a name="Page_57"></a>successful speech in Parliament to a hazardous
leap at
the Aquarium&#8212;jostled one another on the wide staircase
and in the gravely ornate drawing-rooms. And amid the
motley crowd the genial host was omnipresent, with a warm
greeting and a twinkling smile for each successive guest&#8212;a
good story, a happy quotation, the last morsel of piquant
gossip, the newest theory of ethics or of politics.</p>
<p>Lord Houghton's humour had a quality which was quite
its own. Nothing was sacred to it&#8212;neither age, nor sex,
nor subject was spared; but it was essentially good-natured.
It was the property of a famous spear to heal the wounds
which itself had made; the shafts of Lord Houghton's fun
needed no healing virtue, for they made no wound. When
that saintly friend of temperance and all good causes, Mr.
Cowper-Temple, was raised to the peerage as Lord Mount
Temple, Lord Houghton went about saying, "You know
that the precedent for Billy Cowper's title is in <i>Don
Juan?</i>&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'And Lord Mount Coffee-house, the Irish peer,</p>
<p>Who killed himself for love, with drink, last year.'"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When a very impecunious youth, who could barely afford
to pay for his cab fares, lost a pound to him at whist, Lord
Houghton said, as he pocketed the coin, "Ah, my dear
boy, the <i>great</i> Lord Hertford, whom foolish people called
the <i>wicked</i> Lord Hertford&#8212;Thackeray's Steyne and Dizzy's
Monmouth&#8212;used to say, 'There is no pleasure in winning
money from a man who does not feel it.' How true that
was!--" And when he saw a young friend at a club supping
on <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras</i> and champagne, he said
encouragingly,
"That's quite right. All the pleasant things in life are unwholesome,
or expensive, or wrong." And amid these rather
grim morsels of experimental philosophy he would interject
certain <i>obiter dicta</i> which came straight from the unspoiled
goodness of a really kind heart. "All men are improved
<a name="Page_58"></a>by prosperity," he used to say. Envy, hatred, and
malice
had no place in his nature. It was a positive enjoyment
to him to see other people happy, and a friend's success
was as gratifying as his own. His life, though in most
respects singularly happy, had not been without its disappointments.
At one time he had nursed political ambitions,
and his peculiar knowledge of foreign affairs had
seemed to indicate a special line of activity and success.
But things went differently. He always professed to regard
his peerage as "a Second Class in the School of Life," and
himself as a political failure. Yet no tinge of sourness, or
jealousy, or cynical disbelief in his more successful contemporaries
ever marred the geniality of his political
conversation.</p>
<p>As years advanced he became not (as the manner of
most men is) less Liberal, but more so; keener in sympathy
with all popular causes; livelier in his indignation against
monopoly and injustice. Thirty years ago, in the struggle
for the Reform Bill of 1866, his character and position
were happily hit off by Sir George Trevelyan in a description
of a walk down Piccadilly:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"There on warm midsummer Sundays Fryston's Bard is wont to wend,</p>
<p>Whom the Ridings trust and honour, Freedom's staunch and jovial
friend:</p>
<p>Loved where shrewd hard-handed craftsmen cluster round the northern
kilns&#8212;</p>
<p>He whom men style Baron Houghton, but the Gods call Dicky Milnes."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And eighteen years later there was a whimsical pathos in
the phrase in which he announced his fatal illness to a
friend: "Yes, I am going to join the Majority&#8212;and you
know I have always preferred Minorities."</p>
<p>It would be foreign to my purpose to criticize Lord
Houghton as a poet. My object in these chapters is
merely to record the characteristic traits of eminent men
<a name="Page_59"></a>who have honoured me with their friendship, and
among
those there is none for whose memory I cherish a warmer
sentiment of affectionate gratitude than for him whose
likeness I have now tried to sketch. His was the most
precious of combinations&#8212;a genius and a heart. An
estimate of his literary gifts and performances lies altogether
outside my scope, but the political circumstances of the
present hour<a name="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
impel me to conclude this paper with a
quotation which, even if it stood alone, would, I think,
justify Lord Beaconsfield's judgment quoted above&#8212;that
"he was a poet, and a true poet." Here is the lyrical cry
which, writing in 1843, he puts into the mouth of Greece:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And if to his old Asian seat,</p>
<p class="i1">From this usurped, unnatural throne,</p>
<p>The Turk is driven, 'tis surely meet</p>

<h2><a name="Page_60"></a>VI.</h2>
<h2>RELIGION AND MORALITY.</h2>
<p>In these chapters I have been trying to recall some notable
people through whom I have been brought into contact
with the social life of the past. I now propose to give the
impressions which they conveyed to me of the moral,
material, and political condition of England just at the
moment when the old order was yielding place to new, and
modern Society was emerging from the birth-throes of the
French Revolution. All testimony seems to me to point
to the fact that towards the close of the eighteenth century
Religion was almost extinct in the highest and lowest classes
of English society. The poor were sunk in ignorance and
barbarism, and the aristocracy was honeycombed by profligacy.
Morality, discarded alike by high and low, took
refuge in the great Middle Class, then, as now, deeply
influenced by Evangelical Dissent. A dissolute Heir-Apparent
presided over a social system in which not merely
religion but decency was habitually disregarded. At his
wedding he was so drunk that his attendant dukes "could
scarcely support him from falling."<a name="FNanchor_6"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The Princes of the
Blood were notorious for a freedom of life and manners
which would be ludicrous if it were not shocking. Here I
may cite an unpublished diary<a name="FNanchor_7"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> of Lord Robert Seymour
<a name="Page_61"></a>(son of the first Marquis of Hertford), who was
born in 1748
and died in 1831. He was a man of fashion and a Member
of Parliament; and these are some of the incidents which
he notes in 1788:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The Prince of Wales declares there is not an honest
Woman in London, excepting Ly. Parker and Ly. Westmoreland,
and those are so stupid he can make nothing of
them; they are scarcely fit to blow their own Noses."</p>
  <p>"At Mrs. Vaneck's assembly last week, the Prince of
Wales, very much to the honour of his polite and elegant
Behaviour, measured the breadth of Mrs. V. behind with his
Handkerchief, and shew'd the measurement to most of the
Company."</p>
  <p>"Another Trait of the P. of Wales's Respectful Conduct
is that at an assembly he beckoned to the poor old Dutchess
of Bedford across a large Room, and, when she had taken
the trouble of crossing the Room, he very abruptly told her
he had nothing to say to her."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The Prince of Wales very much affronted the D. of
Orleans and his natural Brother, L'Abb&eacute; de la Fai, at Newmarket,
L'Abb&eacute; declaring it possible to charm a Fish out of the
Water, which being disputed occasioned a Bett; and the Abb&eacute;
stooped down over the water to tickle the Fish with a little
switch. Fearing, however, the Prince said play him some
Trick, he declared he hoped the Prince would not use him unfairly
by throwing him into the water. The Prince answer'd him that
he would not upon his Honor. The Abb&eacute; had no sooner began
the operation by leaning over a little Bridge when the Prince
took hold of his Heels and threw him into the Water, which
was rather deep. The Abb&eacute;, much enraged, the moment
he got himself out run at the Prince with great violence, a Horse-whip
in his Hand, saying he thought very meanly of a Prince
who cou'd not keep his word. The Prince flew from him, and
getting to the Inn locked himself in one of the Rooms."</p>
<p>"Prince of Wales, Mrs. Fitzherbert, the Duke and
<a name="Page_62"></a>Dutchess of Cumberland, and Miss Pigott, Mrs.
F.'s companion,
went a Party to Windsor during the absence of
<i>The Family</i> fm. Windsor; and going to see a cold Bath,
Miss P. expressed a great wish to bathe this hot weather.
The D. of C. very imprudently pushed her in, and the Dut.
of C. having the presence of mind to throw out the Rope
saved her when in such a disagreeable State from fear and
surprise as to be near sinking. Mrs. F. went into convulsion
Fits, and the Dut. fainted away, and the scene proved ridiculous
in the extreme, as Report says the Duke called out
to Miss P. that he was instantly coming to her in the water,
and continued undressing himself. Poor Miss P.'s clothes
entirely laid upon the Water, and made her appear an
awkward figure. They afterwards pushed in one of the
Prince's attendants."</p>
<p>So much for High Life at the close of the eighteenth
century. It is more difficult to realize that we are separated
only by some sixty years from a time when a Cabinet Minister
and a brother of the Sovereign conducted a business-like
correspondence on the question whether the Minister had
or had not turned the Prince out of the house for insulting
his wife. The journals, newspapers, and memoirs of the
time throw (especially for those who can read between the
lines) a startling light on that hereditary principle which
plays so important a part in our political system. All the
ancillary vices flourished with a rank luxuriance. Hard
drinking was the indispensable accomplishment of a fine
gentleman, and great estates were constantly changing
owners at the gaming-table.</p>
<p>The fifth Duke of Bedford (who had the temerity to
attack Burke's pension, and thereby drew down upon himself
the most splendid repartee in literature) was a bosom-friend
of Fox, and lived in a like-minded society. One
night at Newmarket he lost a colossal sum at hazard, and,
jumping up in a passion, he swore that the dice were loaded,
<a name="Page_63"></a>put them in his pocket, and went to bed. Next
morning
he examined the dice in the presence of his boon companions,
found that they were not loaded, and had to
apologize and pay. Some years afterwards one of the party
was lying on his death-bed, and he sent for the duke. "I
have sent for you to tell you that you were right. The dice
<i>were</i> loaded. We waited till you were asleep, went to your
bedroom, took them out of your waistcoat pocket, replaced
them with unloaded ones, and retired."</p>
<p>"But suppose I had woke and caught you doing it."</p>
<p>"Well, we were desperate men&#8212;<i>and we had pistols</i>."</p>
<p>Anecdotes of the same type might be multiplied endlessly,
and would serve to confirm the strong impression which all
contemporary evidence leaves upon the mind&#8212;that the
closing years of the eighteenth century witnessed the <i>nadir</i>
of English virtue. The national conscience was in truth
asleep, and it had a rude awakening. "I have heard
persons of great weight and authority," writes Mr. Gladstone,
"such as Mr. Grenville, and also, I think, Archbishop
Howley, ascribe the beginnings of a reviving seriousness in
the upper classes of lay society to a reaction against the
horrors and impieties of the first French Revolution in its
later stages." And this reviving seriousness was by no
means confined to Nonconformist circles. In the eighteenth
century the religious activities of the time proceeded largely
(though not exclusively) from persons who, from one cause
or another, were separated from the Established Church.
Much theological learning and controversial skill, with the
old traditions of Anglican divinity, had been drawn aside
from the highway of the Establishment into the secluded
byways of the Nonjurors. Whitefield and the Wesleys, and
that grim but grand old Mother in Israel, Selina Countess
of Huntingdon, found their evangelistic energies fatally
cramped by episcopal authority, and, quite against their
natural inclinations, were forced to act through independent
<a name="Page_64"></a>organizations of their own making. But at the
beginning
of the nineteenth century things took a different turn.</p>
<p>The distinguishing mark of the religious revival which
issued from the French Revolution was that it lived and
moved and had its being within the precincts of the Church
of England. Of that Church, as it existed at the close of
the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth,
the characteristic feature had been a quiet worldliness. The
typical clergyman, as drawn, for instance, in Crabbe's poems
and Miss Austen's novels, is a well-bred, respectable, and
kindly person, playing an agreeable part in the social life
of his neighbourhood, and doing a secular work of solid
value, but equally removed from the sacerdotal pretensions
of the Caroline divines and from the awakening fervour of
the Evangelical preachers. The professors of a more
spiritual or a more aggressive religion were at once disliked
and despised. Sydney Smith was never tired of poking fun
at the "sanctified village of Clapham" and its "serious"
inhabitants, at missionary effort and revivalist enthusiasm.
When Lady Louisa Lennox was engaged to a prominent
Evangelical and Liberal&#8212;Mr. Tighe of Woodstock&#8212;her
mother, the Duchess of Richmond, said, "Poor Louisa
is going to make a shocking marriage&#8212;a man called <i>Tiggy</i>,
my dear, a Saint and a Radical." When Lord Melbourne
had accidently found himself the unwilling hearer of a
rousing Evangelical sermon about sin and its consequences,
he exclaimed in much disgust as he left the church,
"Things have come to a pretty pass when religion is
allowed to invade the sphere of private life!"</p>
<p>Arthur Young tells us that a daughter of the first Lord
Carrington said to a visitor, "My papa used to have
prayers in his family, but none since he has been a Peer."
A venerable Canon of Windsor, who was a younger son of
a great family, told me that his old nurse, when she was
putting him and his little brothers to bed, used to say,
"<a name="Page_65"></a>If you're very good little boys, and go to bed
without
giving trouble, you needn't say your prayers to-night."
When the late Lord Mount Temple was a youth, he wished
to take Holy Orders; and the project so horrified his
parents that, after holding a family council, they plunged
him into fashionable society in the hope of distracting his
mind from religion, and accomplished their end by making
him join the Blues.</p>
<p>The quiet worldliness which characterized the English
Church as a whole was unpleasantly varied here and there
by instances of grave and monstrous scandal. The system
of Pluralities left isolated parishes in a condition of practical
heathenism. Even bare morality was not always observed.
In solitary places clerical drunkenness was common. On
Saturday afternoon the parson would return from the
nearest town "market-merry." He consorted freely with
the farmers, shared their habits, and spoke their language.
I have known a lady to whom a country clergyman said,
pointing to the darkened windows where a corpse lay
awaiting burial, "There's a stiff 'un in that house." I
have known a country gentleman in Shropshire who had
seen his own vicar drop the chalice at the Holy Communion
because he was too drunk to hold it. I know a corner of
Bedfordshire where, within the recollection of persons
living thirty<a name="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
years ago, three clerical neighbours used to
meet for dinner at one another's parsonages in turn. One
winter afternoon a corpse was brought for burial to the
village church. The vicar of the place came from his
dinner so drunk that he could not read the service,
although his sister supported him with one hand and held
the lantern with the other. He retired beaten, and both
his guests made the same attempt with no better success.
So the corpse was left in the church, and the vicar buried
it next day when he had recovered from his debauch.</p>
<p><a name="Page_66"></a>While the prevailing tone of quiet worldliness
was thus
broken, here and there, by horrid scandals, in other places
it was conspicuously relieved by splendid instances of piety
and self-devotion, such as George Eliot drew in the
character of Edgar Tryan of Milby. But the innovating
clergy of the Evangelical persuasion had to force their way
through "the teeth of clenched antagonisms." The
bishops, as a rule, were opposed to enthusiasm, and the
bishops of that day were, in virtue of their wealth, their
secular importance, and their professional cohesiveness, a
formidable force in the life of the Church.</p>
<p>In the "good old days" of Erastian Churchmanship,
before the Catholic revival had begun to breathe new life
into ancient forms, a bishop was enthroned by proxy!
Sydney Smith, rebuking Archbishop Howley for his undue
readiness to surrender cathedral property to the Ecclesiastical
Commission, pointed out that his conduct was
inconsistent with having sworn at his enthronement that
he would not alienate the possessions of the Church of
Canterbury. "The oath," he goes on, "may be less
present to the Archbishop's memory from the fact of his
not having taken the oath in person, but by the medium of
a gentleman sent down by the coach to take it for him&#8212;
a practice which, though I believe it to have been long
established in the Church, surprised me, I confess, not
a little. A proxy to vote, if you please&#8212;a proxy to consent
to arrangements of estates, if wanted; but a proxy sent
down in the Canterbury Fly to take the Creator to witness
that the Archbishop, detained in town by business or
pleasure, will never violate that foundation of piety over
which he presides&#8212;all this seems to me an act of the most
extraordinary indolence ever recorded in history." In this
judgment the least ritualistic of laymen will heartily
concur. But from Archbishop Howley to Archbishop
Temple is a far cry, and the latest enthronement in Canter<a
 name="Page_67"></a>bury
Cathedral must have made clear to the most casual
eye the enormous transformation which sixty years have
wrought alike in the inner temper and the outward aspect
of the Church of England.</p>
<p>Once Dr. Liddon, walking with me down the hall of
Christ Church, pointed to the portrait of an extremely
bloated and sensual-looking prelate on the wall, and said,
with that peculiar kind of mincing precision which added
so much to the point of his sarcasms, "How singular, dear
friend, to reflect that <i>that person</i> was chosen, in the
providential
order, to connect Mr. Keble with the Apostles!"
And certainly this connecting link bore little resemblance
to either end of the chain. The considerations which
governed the selection of a bishop in those good old days
were indeed not a little singular. Perhaps he was chosen
because he was a sprig of good family, like Archbishop
Cornwallis, whose junketings at Lambeth drew down upon
him the ire of Lady Huntingdon and the threats of George
III., and whose sole qualification for the clerical office was
that when an undergraduate he had suffered from a stroke
of palsy which partially crippled him, but "did not, however,
prevent him from holding a hand at cards." Perhaps
he had been, like Bishop Sumner, "bear-leader" to a great
man's son, and had won the gratitude of a powerful patron
by extricating young hopeful from a matrimonial scrape.
Perhaps, like Marsh or Van Mildert, he was a controversial
pamphleteer who had tossed a Calvinist or gored an
Evangelical. Or perhaps he was, like Blomfield and Monk,
a "Greek Play Bishop," who had annotated Aeschylus or
composed a Sapphic Ode on a Royal marriage. "Young
Crumpet is sent to school; takes to his books; spends the
best years of his life in making Latin verses; knows that
the <i>Crum</i> in Crumpet is long and the <i>pet</i> short; goes to
the University; gets a prize for an Essay on the Dispersion
of the Jews; takes Orders; becomes a bishop's chaplain;
<a name="Page_68"></a>has a young nobleman for his pupil; publishes a
useless
classic and a Serious Call to the Unconverted; and then
goes through the Elysian transitions of Prebendary, Dean,
Prelate, and the long train of purple, profit, and power."</p>
<p>Few&#8212;and very few&#8212;are the adducible instances in
which, in the reigns of George III., George IV., and
William IV., a bishop was appointed for evangelistic zeal
or pastoral efficiency.</p>
<p>But, on whatever principle chosen, the bishop, once duly
consecrated and enthroned, was a formidable person, and
surrounded by a dignity scarcely less than royal. "Nobody
likes our bishop," says Parson Lingon in <i>Felix Holt</i>.
"He's all Greek and greediness, and too proud to dine
with his own father." People still living can remember the
days when the Archbishop of Canterbury was preceded
by servants bearing flambeaux when he walked across from
Lambeth Chapel to what were called "Mrs. Howley's
Lodgings." When the Archbishop dined out he was
treated with princely honours, and no one left the party till
His Grace had made his bow. Once a week he dined
in state in the great hall of Lambeth, presiding over a
company of self-invited guests&#8212;strange perversion of the
old archiepiscopal charity to travellers and the poor&#8212;while,
as Sydney Smith said, "the domestics of the prelacy stood,
with swords and bag-wigs, round pig and turkey and venison,
to defend, as it were, the orthodox gastronome from the
fierce Unitarian, the fell Baptist, and all the famished
children of Dissent." When Sir John Coleridge, father
of the late Lord Chief Justice, was a young man at the
Bar, he wished to obtain a small legal post in the Archbishop's
Prerogative Court. An influential friend undertook
to forward his application to the Archbishop. "But
remember," he said, "in writing your letter, that his Grace
can only be approached on gilt-edged paper." Archbishop
Harcourt never went from Bishopthorpe to York Minster
<a name="Page_69"></a>except attended by his chaplains, in a coach and
six, while
Lady Anne was made to follow in a pair-horse carriage, to
show her that her position was not the same thing among
women that her husband's was among men. At Durham,
which was worth &pound;40,000 a year, the Bishop, as Prince
Palatine, exercised a secular jurisdiction, both civil and
criminal, and the Commission at the Assizes ran in the
name of "Our Lord the Bishop." At Ely, Bishop Sparke
gave so many of his best livings to his family that it was
locally said that you could find your way across the Fens
on a dark night by the number of little Sparkes along
the road. When this good prelate secured a residential
canonry for his eldest son, the event was so much a matter
of course that he did not deem it worthy of special notice;
but when he secured a second canonry for his second son,
he was so filled with pious gratitude that, as a thank-offering,
he gave a ball at the Palace of Ely to all the
county of Cambridge. "And I think," said Bishop Woodford,
in telling me the story, "that the achievement and
the way of celebrating it were equally remarkable."</p>
<p>This grand tradition of mingled splendour and profit
ran down, in due degree, through all ranks of the
hierarchy. The poorer bishoprics were commonly held
in conjunction with a rich deanery or prebend, and not
seldom with some important living; so that the most
impecunious successor of the Apostles could manage to
have four horses to his carriage and his daily bottle of
Madeira. Not so splendid as a palace, but quite as comfortable,
was a first-class deanery. A "Golden Stall" at
Durham or St. Paul's made its occupant a rich man. And
even the rectors of the more opulent parishes contrived to
"live," as the phrase went, "very much like gentleman."</p>
<p>The old Prince Bishops are as extinct as the dodo. The
Ecclesiastical Commission has made an end of them.
Bishop Sumner of Winchester, who died in 1874, was the
<a name="Page_70"></a>last of his race. But the dignified country
clergyman, who
combined private means with a rich living, did his county
business in person, and performed his religious duties by
deputy, survived into very recent times. I have known a
fine old specimen of this class&#8212;a man who never entered
his church on a week-day, nor wore a white neckcloth
except on Sunday; who was an active magistrate, a keen
sportsman, an acknowledged authority on horticulture and
farming; and who boasted that he had never written a
sermon in his life, but could alter one with any man in
England&#8212;which, in truth, he did so effectively that the
author would never have recognized his own handiwork.
When the neighbouring parsons first tried to get up a
periodical "clerical meeting" for the study of theology, he
responded genially to the suggestion: "Oh yes; I think
it sounds a capital thing, and I suppose we shall finish up
with a rubber and a bit of supper."</p>
<p>The reverence in which a rector of this type was held,
and the difference, not merely of degree but of kind, which
was supposed to separate him from the inferior order of
curates, were amusingly exemplified in the case of an old
friend of mine. Returning to his parish after his autumn
holiday, and noticing a woman at her cottage door with
a baby in her arms, he asked, "Has that child been
baptised?" "Well, sir," replied the curtsying mother,
"I shouldn't like to say as much as that; but your young
man came and <i>did what he could</i>."</p>
<p>Lost in these entrancing recollections of Anglicanism as
it once was, but will never be again, I have wandered far
from my theme. I began by saying that all one has read,
all one has heard, all one has been able to collect by study
or by conversation, points to the close of the eighteenth
century as the low-water mark of English religion and
morality. The first thirty years of the nineteenth century
witnessed a great revival, due chiefly to the Evangelical
<a name="Page_71"></a>movement, and not only, as in the previous
century, on
lines outside the Establishment, but in the very heart and
core of the Church of England. That movement, though
little countenanced by ecclesiastical authority, changed the
whole tone of religious thought and life in England. It
recalled men to serious ideas of faith and duty; it curbed
profligacy, it made decency fashionable, it revived the
external usages of piety, and it prepared the way for that
later movement which, issuing from Oxford in 1833, has
transfigured the Church of England.</p>
<p>"I do not mean to say," wrote Mr. Gladstone in 1879,
"that the founders of the Oxford School announced, or
even that they knew, to how large an extent they were to
be pupils and continuators of the Evangelical work, besides
being something else.... Their distinctive speech was
of Church and priesthood, of Sacraments and services, as
the vesture under the varied folds of which the Form of
the Divine Redeemer was to be exhibited to the world
in a way capable of, and suited for, transmission by a
collective body from generation to generation. It may
well have happened that, in straining to secure for their
ideas what they thought their due place, some at least
may have forgotten or disparaged that personal and experimental
life of the human soul with God which profits by
all ordinances but is tied to none, dwelling ever, through
all its varying moods, in the inner courts of the sanctuary
whereof the walls are not built with hands. The only
matter, however, with which I am now concerned is to
record the fact that the pith and life of the Evangelical
teaching, as it consists in the reintroduction of Christ
our Lord to be the woof and warp of preaching, was the
great gift of the movement to the teaching Church, and
has now penetrated and possessed it on a scale so general
that it may be considered as pervading the whole mass."<br>

<h2><a name="Page_72"></a>VII.</h2>
<h2>SOCIAL EQUALIZATION.</h2>
<p>It was a characteristic saying of Talleyrand that no one
could conceive how pleasant life was capable of being
who had not belonged to the French aristocracy before the
Revolution. There were, no doubt, in the case of that
great man's congeners some legal and constitutional prerogatives
which rendered their condition supremely enviable;
but so far as splendour, stateliness, and exclusive
privilege are elements of a pleasant life, he might have
extended his remark to England. Similar conditions of
social existence here and in France were similarly and
simultaneously transformed by the same tremendous upheaval
which marked the final disappearance of the feudal
spirit and the birth of the modern world.</p>
<p>The old order passed away, and the face of human society
was made new. The law-abiding and temperate genius of
the Anglo-Saxon race saved England from the excesses,
the horrors, and the dramatic incidents which marked this
period of transition in France; but though more quietly
effected, the change in England was not less marked, less
momentous, or less permanent than on the Continent. I
have spoken in a former chapter of the religious revival
which was the most striking result in England of the
Revolution in France. To-day I shall say a word about
another result, or group of results, which may be summarized
as Social Equalization.</p>
<p><a name="Page_73"></a>The barriers between ranks and classes were to
a large
extent broken down. The prescriptive privileges of aristocracy
were reduced. The ceremoniousness of social demeanour
was diminished. Great men were content with
less elaboration and display in their retinues, equipages, and
mode of living. Dress lost its richness of ornament and
its distinctive characteristics. Young men of fashion no
longer bedizened themselves in velvet, brocade, and gold
lace. Knights of the Garter no longer displayed the Blue
Ribbon in Parliament. Officers no longer went into
society with uniform and sword. Bishops laid aside their
wigs; dignified clergy discarded the cassock. Coloured
coats, silk stockings, lace ruffles, and hair-powder survived
only in the footmen's liveries. When the Reform Bill of
1832 received the Royal Assent, the Lord Bathurst of the
period, who had been a member of the Duke of Wellington's
Cabinet, solemnly cut off his pigtail, saying, "Ichabod, for
the glory is departed;" and to the first Reformed Parliament
only one pigtail was returned (it pertained to Mr.
Sheppard, M.P. for Frome)&#8212;an impressive symbol of social
transformation.</p>
<p>The lines of demarcation between the peerage and the
untitled classes were partially obliterated. How clear and
rigid those lines had been it is difficult for us to conceive.
In <i>Humphrey Clinker</i> the nobleman refuses to fight a duel
with the squire on the ground of their social inequality.
Mr. Wilberforce declined a peerage because it would exclude
his sons from intimacy with private gentlemen, clergymen,
and mercantile families. I have stated in a previous
chapter that Lord Bathurst, who was born in 1791, told me
that at his private school he and the other sons of peers
sate together on a privileged bench apart from the rest of
the boys. A typical aristocrat was the first Marquis of
Abercorn. He died in 1818, but he is still revered in
Ulster under the name of "The Owld Marquis." This
<a name="Page_74"></a>admirable nobleman always went out shooting in
his Blue
Ribbon, and required his housemaids to wear white kid
gloves when they made his bed. Before he married his
first cousin, Miss Cecil Hamilton, he induced the Crown
to confer on her the titular rank of an Earl's daughter, that
he might not marry beneath his position; and when he
discovered that she contemplated eloping, he sent a message
begging her to take the family coach, as it ought never to
be said that Lady Abercorn left her husband's roof in a
hack chaise. By such endearing traits do the truly great
live in the hearts of posterity.</p>
<p>In the earlier part of this century Dr. Arnold inveighed
with characteristic vigour against "the insolencies of our
aristocracy, the scandalous exemption of the peers from all
ignominious punishments short of death, and the insolent
practice of allowing peers to vote in criminal trials on their
honour, while other men vote on their oath." But generally
the claims of rank and birth were admitted with a childlike
cheerfulness. The high function of government was the
birthright of the few. The people, according to episcopal
showing, had nothing to do with the laws but to obey them.
The ingenious author of <i>Russell's Modern Europe</i> states in
his preface to that immortal work that his object in adopting
the form of a Series of Letters from a Nobleman to his
Son is "to give more Weight to the Moral and Political
Maxims, and to entitle the author to offer, without seeming
to dictate to the World, such reflections on Life and
Manners as are supposed more immediately to belong to
the higher orders in Society." Nor were the privileges of
rank held to pertain merely to temporal concerns. When
Selina Countess of Huntingdon asked the Duchess of
Buckingham to accompany her to a sermon of Whitefield's,
the Duchess replied: "I thank your ladyship for the information
concerning the Methodist preachers; their
doctrines are most repulsive, and strongly tinctured with
<a name="Page_75"></a>impertinence and disrespect towards their
superiors, in
perpetually endeavouring to level all ranks and do away
with all distinctions. It is monstrous to be told you have
a heart as sinful as the common wretches that crawl on the
earth; and I cannot but wonder that your ladyship should
relish any sentiments so much at variance with high rank
and good breeding."</p>
<p>The exclusive and almost feudal character of the English
peerage was destroyed, finally and of set purpose, by Pitt
when he declared that every man who had an estate of ten
thousand a year had a right to be a peer. In Lord Beaconsfield's
words, "He created a plebeian aristocracy and blended
it with the patrician oligarchy. He made peers of second-rate
squires and fat graziers. He caught them in the alleys
of Lombard Street, and clutched them from the counting-houses
of Cornhill." This democratization of the peerage
was accompanied by great modifications of pomp and stateliness
in the daily life of the peers. In the eighteenth
century the Duke and Duchess of Atholl were always served
at their own table before their guests, in recognition of their
royal rank as Sovereigns of the Isle of Man; and the Duke
and Duchess of Argyll observed the same courteous usage
for no better reason than because they liked it. The
"Household Book" of Alnwick Castle records the amplitude
and complexity of the domestic hierarchy which
ministered to the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland;
and at Arundel and Belvoir, and Trentham and Wentworth,
the magnates of the peerage lived in a state little less than
regal. Seneschals and gentlemen-ushers, ladies-in-waiting
and pages-of-the-presence adorned noble as well as royal
households. The private chaplain of a great Whig duke,
within the recollection of people whom I have known,
used to preface his sermon with a prayer for the nobility,
and "especially for the noble duke to whom I am indebted
for my scarf"&#8212;the badge of chaplaincy&#8212;accompanying the
<a name="Page_76"></a>words by a profound bow toward his Grace's pew.
The
last "running footman" pertained to "Old Q."&#8212;the
notorious Duke of Queensberry, who died in 1810. Horace
Walpole describes how, when a guest playing cards at
Woburn Abbey dropped a silver piece on the floor, and
said, "Oh, never mind; let the Groom of the Chambers
have it," the Duchess replied, "Let the carpet-sweeper have
it; the Groom of the Chambers never takes anything but
gold."</p>
<p>These grotesque splendours of domestic living went out
with the eighteenth century. Dr. Johnson, who died in 1784,
had already noted their decline. There was a general approach
towards external equalization of ranks, and that
approach was accompanied by a general diffusion of material
enjoyment. The luxury of the period was prodigal rather
than refined. There lies before me as I write a tavern
bill for a dinner for seven persons in the year 1751. I reproduce
the items verbally and literally, and certainly the
bill of fare is worth studying as a record of gastronomical
exertion on a heroic scale:&#8212;</p>

<p>The total charge for this dinner for seven amounted to
&pound;81, 11s. 6d., and a footnote informs the curious reader
that there was also "a turtle sent as a Present to the
Company, and dressed in a very high <i>Gout</i> after the West
Indian Manner." Old cookery-books, such as the misquoted
work of Mrs. Glasse, Dr. Kitchener's <i>Cook's Oracle</i>,
and the anonymous but admirable <i>Culina</i>, all concur in
their testimony to the enormous amount of animal food
which went to make an ordinary meal, and the amazing
variety of irreconcilable ingredients which were combined
in a single dish. Lord Beaconsfield, whose knowledge of
this recondite branch of English literature was curiously
minute, thus describes&#8212;no doubt from authentic sources&#8212;
a family dinner at the end of the eighteenth century:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"The ample tureen of <i>potage royal</i> had a boned duck
swimming in its centre. At the other end of the table
scowled in death the grim countenance of a huge roast
pike, flanked on one side by a leg of mutton <i>&agrave; la daube</i>,
and on the other by the tempting delicacies of Bombarded
Veal. To these succeeded that masterpiece of the culinary
art a grand Battalia Pie, in which the bodies of chickens,
pigeons, and rabbits were embalmed in spices, cocks'
combs, and savoury balls, and well bedewed with one of
those rich sauces of claret, anchovy, and sweet herbs in
which our grandfathers delighted, and which was technically
termed a Lear. A Florentine tourte or tansy, an old
English custard, a more refined blamango, and a riband
jelly of many colours offered a pleasant relief after these <a
 name="Page_78"></a>vaster inventions, and the repast closed with a
dish of
oyster-loaves and a pomepetone of larks."</blockquote>
<p>As the old order yielded place to the new, this enormous
profusion of rich food became by degrees less fashionable,
though its terrible traditions endured, through the days of
Soyer and Francatelli, almost to our own time. But
gradually refinement began to supersede profusion. Simultaneously
all forms of luxury spread from the aristocracy to
the plutocracy; while the middle and lower classes attained
a degree of solid comfort which would a few years before
have been impossible. Under Pitt's administration wealth
increased rapidly. Great fortunes were amassed through
the improvement of agricultural methods and the application
of machinery to manufacture. The Indian Nabobs,
as they were called, became a recognized and powerful
element in society, and their habits of "Asiatic luxury"
are represented by Chatham, Burke, Voltaire, and Home
Tooke as producing a marked effect upon the social life
of the time. Lord Robert Seymour notes in his diary for
1788 that a fashionable lady gave &pound;100 a year to the cook
who superintended her suppers; that at a sale of bric-&agrave;-brac
230 guineas were paid for a mirror; and that, at a ball
given by the Knights of the Bath at the Pantheon, the
decorations cost upwards of &pound;3000. The general consumption
of French and Portuguese wines in place of
beer, which had till recently been the beverage even of the
affluent, was regarded by grave writers as a most alarming
sign of the times, and the cause of a great increase of
drunkenness among the upper classes. The habits and
manners prevalent in London spread into the country. As
the distinction between the nobility, who, roughly speaking,
had been the frequenters of the capital, and the minor
gentry, who had lived almost entirely on their own estates,
gradually disappeared, the distinction between town and
country life sensibly diminished.</p>
<p><a name="Page_79"></a>The enormous increase in the facilities for
travelling and
for the interchange of information contributed to the same
result; and grave men lamented the growing fondness of
the provincial ladies for the card-table, the theatre, the
assembly, the masquerade, and&#8212;singular social juxtaposition&#8212;the
Circulating Library. The process of social
assimilation, while it spread from town to country and
from nobility to gentry, reached down from the gentry to
the merchants, and from the merchants to the tradesmen.
The merchant had his villa three or four miles away from
his place of business, and lived at Clapham or Dulwich
in a degree and kind of luxury which had a few years before
been the monopoly of the aristocracy. The tradesman no
longer inhabited the rooms over his shop, but a house in
Bloomsbury or Soho. Where, fifty years before, one fire
in the kitchen served the whole family, and one dish of
meat appeared on the table, now a footman waited at the
banquet of imported luxuries, and small beer and punch
had made way for Burgundy and Madeira.</p>
<p>But the subject expands before us, and it is time to
close. Now I propose to inquire how far this Social
Equalization was accompanied by Social Amelioration.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;">
<a name="VIII"></a>
<h2><a name="Page_80"></a>VIII.</h2>
<h2>SOCIAL AMELIORATION.</h2>
<p>At this point it is necessary to look back a little, and
to clear our minds of the delusion that an age of
splendour is necessarily an age of refinement. We have
seen something of the regal state and prodigal luxury
which surrounded the English aristocracy in the middle of
the eighteenth century. Yet at no period of our national
history&#8212;unless, perhaps, during the orgies of the Restoration
were aristocratic morals at so low an ebb. Edmund
Burke, in a passage which is as ethically questionable as it
is rhetorically beautiful, taught that vice loses half its evil
when it loses all its grossness. But in the English society
of his time grossness was as conspicuous as vice itself, and
it infected not only the region of morals, but also that of
manners.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott has described how, in his youth, refined
gentlewomen read aloud to their families the most startling
passages of the most outrageous authors. I have been
told by one who heard it from an eye-witness that a great
Whig duchess, who figures brilliantly in the social and
political memoirs of the eighteenth century, turning to the
footman who was waiting on her at dinner, exclaimed, "I
wish to G---- that you wouldn't keep rubbing your great
greasy belly against the back of my chair." Men and
women of the highest fashion swore like troopers; the
<a name="Page_81"></a>Princes of the Blood, who carried down into the
middle of
the nineteenth century the courtly habits of their youth,
setting the example. Mr. Gladstone told me the following
anecdote, which he had from the Lord Pembroke of the
period, who was present at the scene.</p>
<p>In the early days of the first Reformed Parliament the
Whig Government were contemplating a reform of the
law of Church Rates. Success was certain in the House
of Commons, but the Tory peers, headed by the Duke of
Cumberland, determined to defeat the Bill in the House
of Lords. A meeting of the party was held, when it
appeared that, in the balanced state of parties, the Tory
peers could not effect their purpose unless they could
rally the bishops to their aid. The question was, What
would the Archbishop of Canterbury do? He was Dr. Howley,
the mildest and most apostolic of men, and the most
averse from strife and contention. It was impossible to be
certain of his action, and the Duke of Cumberland posted
off to Lambeth to ascertain it. Returning in hot haste to
the caucus, he burst into the room, exclaiming, "It's
all right, my lords; the Archbishop says he will be d----d
to hell if he doesn't throw the Bill out." The Duke of
Wellington's "Twopenny d----n" has become proverbial;
and Sydney Smith neatly rebuked a similar propensity in
Lord Melbourne by saying, "Let us assume everybody and
everything to be d--- d, and come to the point." The Miss
Berrys, who had been the correspondents of Horace Walpole,
and who carried down to the 'fifties the most refined
traditions of social life in the previous century, habitually
"d----d" the tea-kettle if it burned their fingers, and called
their male friends by their surnames&#8212;"Come, Milnes, will
you have a cup of tea?" "Now, Macaulay, we have had
enough of that subject."</p>
<p>So much, then, for the refinement of the upper classes.
Did the Social Equalization of which we have spoken
<a name="Page_82"></a>bring with it anything in the way of Social
Amelioration?
A philosophical orator of my time at the Oxford Union,
now a valued member of the House of Lords, once said in
a debate on national intemperance that he had made a
careful study of the subject, and, with much show of
scientific analysis, he thus announced the result of his
researches: "The causes of national intemperance are
three: first, the adulteration of liquor; second, the love
of drink; and third, the desire for more." Knowing my
incapacity to rival this masterpiece of exact thinking, I
have not thought it necessary in these chapters to enlarge
on the national habit of excessive drinking in the late
years of the eighteenth century. The grossness and the
universality of the vice are too well known to need elaborating.
All oral tradition, all contemporary literature, all
satiric art, tell the same horrid tale; and the number of
bottles which a single toper would consume at a sitting
not only, in Burke's phrase, "outraged economy," but
"staggered credibility." Even as late as 1831, Samuel
Wilberforce, afterwards Bishop, wrote thus in his diary:&#8212;"A
good Audit Dinner: 23 people drank 11 bottles of
wine, 28 quarts of beer, 2-1/2 of spirits, and 12 bowls of
punch; and would have drunk twice as much if not
restrained. <i>None, we hope, drunk!</i>" Mr. Gladstone told
me that once, when he was a young man, he was dining
at a house where the principal guest was a Bishop. When
the decanters had made a sufficient number of circuits, the
host said, "Shall we have any more wine, my Lord?"
"Thank you&#8212;not till we have disposed of what is before
us," was the bland episcopal reply.</p>
<p>But still, in the matter of drinking, the turn of the
century witnessed some social amelioration among the
upper classes. There was a change, if not in quantity,
at least in quality. Where port and Madeira had been the
Staple drinks, corrected by libations of brandy, less potent
<a name="Page_83"></a>beverages became fashionable. The late Mr.
Thomson
Hankey, formerly M.P. for Peterborough, told me that he
remembered his father coming home from the city one day
and saying to his mother, "My dear, I have ordered a
dozen bottles of a new white wine. It is called sherry, and
I am told the Prince Regent drinks nothing else." The
fifteenth Lord Derby told me that the cellar-books at
Knowsley and St. James's Square had been carefully kept
for a hundred years, and that&#8212;contrary to what every one
would have supposed&#8212;the number of bottles drunk in a
year had not diminished. The alteration was in the
alcoholic strength of the wines consumed. Burgundy, port,
and Madeira had made way for light claret, champagne, and
hock. That, even under these changed conditions of
potency, the actual number of bottles consumed showed no
diminution, was accounted for by the fact that at balls
and evening parties a great deal more champagne was drunk
than formerly, and that luncheon in a large house had now
become practically an earlier dinner.</p>
<p>The growth of these subsidiary meals was a curious
feature of the nineteenth century. We exclaim with horror
at such preposterous bills of fare as that which I quoted
in my last chapter, but it should be remembered, in justice
to our fathers, that dinner was the only substantial meal
of the day. Holland House was always regarded as the
very temple of luxury, and Macaulay tells us that the
viands at a breakfast-party there were tea and coffee, eggs,
rolls, and butter. The fashion, which began in the nineteenth
century, of going to the Highlands for shooting,
popularized in England certain northern habits of feeding,
and a morning meal at which game and cold meat appeared
was known in England as a "Scotch breakfast." Apparently
it had made some way by 1840, for the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>
published in that year thus describe the morning meal of
the ill-fated Sir Thomas:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_84"></a>
<p>"It seems he had taken A light breakfast&#8212;bacon,</p>
<p>An egg, with a little broiled haddock; at most</p>
<p>A round and a half of some hot buttered toast;</p>
<p>With a slice of cold sirloin from yesterday's roast."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Luncheon, or "nuncheon" as some very ancient friends
of mine always called it, was the merest mouthful. Men
went out shooting with a sandwich in their pocket; the
ladies who sat at home had some cold chicken and wine
and water brought into the drawing-room on a tray. Miss
Austen in her novels always dismisses the midday meal
under the cursory appellation of "cold meat." The celebrated
Dr. Kitchener, the sympathetic author of the <i>Cook's
Oracle</i>, writing in 1825, says: "Your luncheon may consist
of a bit of roasted poultry, a basin of beef tea, or eggs
poached, or boiled in the shell; fish plainly dressed, or a
sandwich; stale bread; and half a pint of good homebrewed
beer, or toast-and-water, with about one-fourth or
one-third part of its measure of wine." And this prescription
would no doubt have worn an aspect of liberal
concession to the demands of the patient's appetite. It is
difficult, by any effort of a morbid imagination, to realize a
time when there was no five-o'clock tea; and yet that most
sacred of our national institutions was only invented by the
Duchess of Bedford who died in 1857, and whose name
should surely be enrolled in the Positivist Kalendar as a
benefactress of the human race. No wonder that by seven
o'clock our fathers, and even our mothers, were ready to
tackle a dinner of solid properties; and even to supplement
it with the amazing supper (which Dr. Kitchener prescribes
for "those who dine very late") of "gruel, or a little bread
and cheese, or pounded cheese, and a glass of beer."</p>
<p>This is a long digression from the subject of excessive
drinking, with which, however, it is not remotely connected;
and, both in respect of drunkenness and of gluttony, the
habits of English society in the years which immediately
<a name="Page_85"></a>succeeded the French Revolution showed a marked
amelioration.
To a company of enthusiastic Wordsworthians
who were deploring their master's confession that he got
drunk at Cambridge, I heard Mr. Shorthouse, the accomplished
author of <i>John Inglesant</i>, soothingly remark that in
all probability "Wordsworth's standard of intoxication was
miserably low."<a name="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
Simultaneously with the restriction of excess there was
seen a corresponding increase in refinement of taste and
manners. Some of the more brutal forms of so-called sport,
such as bull-baiting and cock-fighting, became less fashionable.
The more civilized forms, such as fox-hunting and
racing, increased in favour. Aesthetic culture was more
generally diffused. The stage was at the height of its
glory. Music was a favourite form of public recreation.
Great prices were given for works of art. The study
of physical science, or "natural philosophy" as it was
called, became popular. Public Libraries and local "book
societies" sprang up, and there was a wide demand for
encyclopaedias and similar vehicles for the diffusion of general
knowledge. The love of natural beauty was beginning to
move the hearts of men, and it found expression at once
in an entirely new school of landscape painting, and in a
more romantic and natural form of poetry.</p>
<p>But against these marked instances of social amelioration
must be set some darker traits of national life. The public
conscience had not yet revolted against violence and
brutality. The prize-ring, patronized by Royalty, was at
its zenith. Humanitarians and philanthropists were as yet
an obscure and ridiculed sect. The slave trade, though
menaced, was still undisturbed. Under a system scarcely
distinguishable from slavery, pauper children were bound
over to the owners of factories and subjected to the utmost
<a name="Page_86"></a>rigour of enforced labour. The treatment of the
insane
was darkened by incredible barbarities. As late as 1828
Lord Shaftesbury found that the lunatics in Bedlam were
chained to their straw beds, and left from Saturday to
Monday without attendance, and with only bread and water
within their reach, while the keepers were enjoying themselves.
Discipline in the services, in poorhouses, and in
schools was of the most brutal type. Our prisons were
unreformed. Our penal code was inconceivably sanguinary
and savage. In 1770 there were one hundred and sixty
capital offences on the Statute-book, and by the beginning
of the nineteenth century the number had greatly increased.
To steal five shillings' worth of goods from a shop was
punishable by death. A girl of twenty-two was hanged for
receiving a piece of woollen stuff from the man who had
stolen it.</p>
<p>In 1789 a woman was burnt at the stake for coining.
People still living have seen the skeletons of pirates and
highwaymen hanging in chains. I have heard that the
children of the Bluecoat School at Hertford were always
taken to see the executions there; and as late as 1820 the
dead bodies of the Cato Street conspirators were decapitated
in front of Newgate, and the Westminster boys had a
special holiday to enable them to see the sight, which was
thus described by an eye-witness, the late Lord de Ros:
"The executioner and his assistant cut down one of the
corpses from the gallows, and placed it in the coffin, but
with the head hanging over on the block. The man with
the knife instantly severed the head from the body, and the
executioner, receiving it in his hands, held it up, saying in
a loud voice, 'This is the head of a traitor.' He then
dropped it into the coffin, which being removed, another
was brought forward, and they proceeded to cut down the
next body and to go through the same ghastly operation.
It was observed that the mob, which was very large, gazed
<a name="Page_87"></a>in silence at the hanging of the conspirators,
and showed
not the least sympathy; but when each head as cut off
and held up, a loud and deep groan of horror burst
from all sides, which was not soon forgotten by those who
heard it."</p>
<p>Duelling was the recognized mode of settling all personal
disputes, and no attempt was made to enforce the law
which, theoretically, treated the killing of a man in a duel
as wilful murder; but, on the other hand, debt was
punished with what often was imprisonment for life. A
woman died in the County Jail at Exeter after forty-five
years' incarceration for a debt of &pound;19. Crime was rampant.
Daring burglaries, accompanied by every circumstance of
violence, took place nightly. Highwaymen infested the
suburban roads, and not seldom plied their calling in the
capital itself. The iron post at the end of the narrow
footway between the gardens of Devonshire House and
Lansdowne House is said by tradition to have been placed
there after a Knight of the Road had eluded the officers of
justice by galloping down the stone steps and along the
flagged path. Sir Hamilton Seymour (1797-1880) was in
his father's carriage when it was "stopped" by a highwayman
in Upper Brook Street. Young gentlemen of broken
fortunes, and tradesmen whose business had grown slack,
swelled the ranks of these desperadoes. It was even said
that an Irish prelate&#8212;Dr. Twysden, Bishop of Raphoe&#8212;whose
incurable love of adventure had drawn him to "the
road," received the penalty of his uncanonical diversion in
the shape of a bullet from a traveller whom he had stopped
on Hounslow Heath. The Lord Mayor was made to stand
and deliver on Turnham Green. Stars and "Georges"
were snipped off ambassadors and peers as they entered
St. James's Palace.</p>
<p>It is superfluous to multiply illustrations. Enough has
been said to show that the circumscription of aristocratic
<a name="Page_88"></a>privilege and the diffusion of material luxury
did not precipitate
the millennium. Social Equalization was not synonymous
with Social Amelioration. Some improvement, indeed,
in the tone and habit of society occurred at the turn of the
century; but it was little more than a beginning. I proceed
to trace its development, and to indicate its source.<br>

<h2>THE EVANGELICAL INFLUENCE.</h2>
<p>Mr. Lecky justly remarks that "it is difficult to measure
the change which must have passed over the public
mind since the days when the lunatics in Bedlam were constantly
spoken of as one of the sights of London; when the
maintenance of the African slave-trade was a foremost
object of English commercial policy; when men and even
women were publicly whipped through the streets when
skulls lined the top of Temple Bar and rotting corpses
hung on gibbets along the Edgware Road; when persons
exposed in the pillory not unfrequently died through the ill-usage
of the mob; and when the procession every six weeks
of condemned criminals to Tyburn was one of the great
festivals of London."</p>
<p>Difficult, indeed, it is to measure so great a change, and
it is not wholly easy to ascertain with precision its various
and concurrent causes, and to attribute to each its proper
potency. But we shall certainly not be wrong if, among
those causes, we assign a prominent place to the Evangelical
revival of religion. It would be a mistake to claim for
the Evangelical movement the whole credit of our social
reform and philanthropic work. Even in the darkest times
of spiritual torpor and general profligacy England could
show a creditable amount of practical benevolence. The
public charities of London were large and excellent. The
first Foundling Hospital was established in 1739; the first
<a name="Page_90"></a>Magdalen Hospital in 1769. In 1795 it was
estimated that
the annual expenditure on charity-schools, asylums, hospitals,
and similar institutions in London was &pound;750,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Lecky, whose study of these social phenomena is
exhaustive, imagines that the habit of unostentatious charity,
which seems indigenous to England, was powerfully stimulated
by the philosophy of Shaftesbury and Voltaire, by
Rousseau's sentiment and Fielding's fiction. This theory
may have something to say for itself, and indeed it is antecedently
plausible; but I can hardly believe that purely
literary influences counted for so very much in the sphere
of practice. I doubt if any considerable number of Englishmen
were effectively swayed by that humanitarian philosophy
of France which in the actions of its maturity so awfully
belied the promise of its youth. We are, I think, on surer
ground when, admitting a national bias towards material
benevolence, and not denying some stimulus from literature
and philosophy, we assign the main credit of our social
regeneration to the Evangelical revival.</p>
<p>The life of John Wesley, practically coterminous with the
eighteenth century, witnessed both the lowest point of our
moral degradation and also the earliest promise of our moral
restoration. He cannot, indeed, be reckoned the founder
of the Evangelical school; that title belongs rather to
George Whitefield. But his influence, combined with that
of his brother Charles, acting on such men as Newton and
Cecil and Venn and Scott of Aston Sandford; on Selina
Lady Huntingdon and Mrs. Hannah More; on Howard and
Clarkson and William Wilberforce; made a deep mark on
the Established Church, gave new and permanent life to
English Nonconformity, and sensibly affected the character
and aspect of secular society.</p>
<p>Wesley himself had received the governing impulse of his
life from Law's <i>Serious Call</i> and <i>Christian Perfection</i>,
and he had been a member of one of those religious societies
<a name="Page_91"></a>(or guilds, as they would now be called) with
which the
piety of Bishop Beveridge and Dr. Horneck had enriched
the Church of England. These societies were, of course,
distinctly Anglican in origin and character, and were stamped
with the High Church theology. They constituted, so to
say, a church within the Church, and, though they raised
the level of personal piety among their members to a very
high point, they did not widely affect the general tone and
character of national religion. The Evangelical leaders,
relying on less exclusively ecclesiastical methods, diffused
their influence over a much wider area, and, under the
impulse of their teaching, drunkenness, indecency, and profanity
were sensibly abated. The reaction from the rampant
wickedness of the eighteenth century drove men into strict
and even puritanical courses.</p>
<p>Lord Robert Seymour wrote on the 20th of March, 1788:
"Tho' Good Friday, Mrs. Sawbridge has an assembly this
evening; tells her invited Friends they really are only to
play for a Watch which she has had some time on her Hands
and wishes to dispose of."</p>
<p>"'Really, I declare 'pon my honor it's true' (said Ly.
Bridget Talmash to the Dutchess of Bolton) 'that a great
many People now go to Chapel. I saw a vaste number of
Carriages at Portman Chapel last Sunday.' The Dut.
told her she always went to Chapel on Sunday, and in
the country read Prayers in the Hall to her Family."</p>
<p>But where the Evangelical influence reached, it brought
a marked abstention from such forms of recreation as
dancing, card-playing, and the drama. Sunday was
observed with a Judaical rigour. A more frequent attendance
on public worship was accompanied by the revival
of family prayers and grace before meat. Manuals of
private devotion were multiplied. Religious literature
of all kinds was published in great quantity. A higher
standard of morals was generally professed. Marriage was
<a name="Page_92"></a>gradually restored in public estimation to its
proper place,
not merely as a civil bond or social festival, but as a chief
solemnity of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>There was no more significant sign of the times than
this alteration. In the eighteenth century some of the
gravest of our social offences had clustered round the
institution of marriage, which was almost as much dishonoured
in the observance as in the breach. In the first
half of that century the irregular and clandestine weddings,
celebrated without banns or licence in the Fleet Prison,
had been one of the crying scandals of the middle and lower classes;
and in the second half, the nocturnal flittings
to Gretna Green of young couples who could afford such
a Pilgrimage of Passion lowered the whole conception of
marriage. It was through the elopement of Miss Child&#8212;heiress
of the opulent banker at Temple Bar&#8212;from her
father's house in Berkeley Square (now Lord Rosebery's)
that the ownership of the great banking business passed
eventually to the present Lord Jersey; and the annals of
almost every aristocratic family contain the record of
similar escapades.</p>
<p>The Evangelical movement, not content with permeating
England, sought to expand itself all over the Empire.
The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge had been
essentially Anglican institutions; and similar societies, but
less ecclesiastical in character, now sprang up in great
numbers. The London Missionary Society was founded
in 1795, the Church Missionary Society in 1799, the
Religious Tract Society in the same year, and the British
and Foreign Bible Society three years later. All these
were distinctly creations of the Evangelical movement, as
were also the Societies for the Reformation of Manners
and for the Better Observance of the Lord's Day.
Religious education found in the Evangelical party its
<a name="Page_93"></a>most active friends. The Sunday School Society
was
founded in 1785. Two years later it was educating two
hundred thousand children. Its most earnest champions
were Rowland Hill and Mrs. Hannah More; but it is worthy
of note that this excellent lady, justly honoured as a pioneer
of elementary education, confined her curriculum to the Bible
and the Catechism, and "such coarse works as may fit the
children for servants. <i>I allow of no writing for the poor</i>."</p>
<p>To the Society of Friends&#8212;a body not historically or
theologically Evangelical&#8212;belongs the credit of having
first awoke, and tried to rouse others, to a sense of the
horrors and iniquities involved in the slave-trade; but the
adhesion of William Wilberforce and his friends at
Clapham identified the movement for emancipation with
the Evangelical party. Never were the enthusiasm, the
activity, the uncompromising devotion to principle which
marked the Evangelicals turned to better account. Their
very narrowness gave intensity and concentration to their
work, and their victory, though deferred, was complete.
It has been truly said that when the English nation had
been thoroughly convinced that slavery was a curse which
must be got rid of at any cost, we cheerfully paid down
as the price of its abolition twenty millions in cash, and
threw the prosperity of our West Indian colonies into the
bargain. Yet we only spent on it one-tenth of what it
cost us to lose America, and one-fiftieth of what we spent
in avenging the execution of Louis XVI.</p>
<p>In spite of all these conspicuous and beneficent advances
in the direction of humanity, a great deal of severity, and
what appears to us brutality, remained embedded in our
social system. I have spoken in previous chapters of the
methods of discipline enforced in the services, in jails, in
poorhouses, and in schools.<a name="FNanchor_10"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> A very similar spirit pre<a
 name="Page_94"></a>vailed
even in the home. Children were shut up in dark
closets, starved, and flogged. Lord Shaftesbury's father
used to knock him down, and recommended his tutor at
Harrow to do the same. Archdeacon Denison describes
in his autobiography how he and his brothers were
thrashed by their tutor when they were youths of sixteen
and had left Eton. <i>The Fairchild Family</i>&#8212;that quaint
picture of Evangelical life and manners&#8212;depicts a religious
father as punishing his quarrelsome children by taking
them to see a murderer hanging in chains, and as chastising
every peccadillo of infancy with a severity which makes
one long to flog Mr. Fairchild.</p>
<p>But still, in spite of all these checks and drawbacks and
evil survivals, the tide of humanitarianism flowed on, and
gradually altered the aspect of English life. The bloody
Penal Code was mitigated. Prisons and poorhouses were
reformed. The discipline of school and of home was
tempered by the infusion of mercy and reason into the
iron regimen of terror. And this general diminution of
brutality was not the only form of social amelioration. It
was accompanied by a gradual but perceptible increase
in decency, refinement, and material prosperity. Splendour
diminished, and luxury remained the monopoly of the
rich; but comfort&#8212;that peculiarly English treasure&#8212;was
more generally diffused. In that diffusion the Evangelicals
had their full share. Thackeray's admirable description
of Mrs. Newcome's villa is drawn from the life: "In
Egypt itself there were not more savoury fleshpots than
those at Clapham. Her mansion was long the resort of
the most favoured among the religious world. The most
eloquent expounders, the most gifted missionaries, the
most interesting converts from foreign islands were to be
found at her sumptuous table, spread with the produce of
her magnificent gardens... a great, shining, mahogany
table, covered with grapes, pineapples, plum-cake, port
<a name="Page_95"></a>wine, and Madeira, and surrounded by stout men in
black, with baggy white neckcloths, who took little Tommy
on their knees and questioned him as to his right understanding
of the place whither naughty boys were bound."</p>
<p>Again, in his paper on <i>Dinners</i> the same great master of
a fascinating subject speaks the words of truth and soberness
when he says: "I don't know when I have been
better entertained, as far as creature comforts go, than by
men of very Low Church principles; and one of the very
best repasts that ever I saw in my life was at Darlington,
given by a Quaker." This admirable tradition of material
comfort allied with Evangelical opinion extended into my
own time. The characteristic weakness of Mr. Stiggins has
no place in my recollection; but Mr. Chadband I have
frequently met in Evangelical circles, both inside and outside
the Establishment. Debarred by the strictness of
their principles from such amusements as dancing, cards,
and theatres, the Evangelicals took their pleasure in eating
and drinking. They abounded in hospitality; and when
they were not entertaining or being entertained, occupied
their evenings with systematic reading, which gave their
religious compositions a sound basis of general culture.
Austerity, gloom, and Pharisaism had no place among the
better class of Evangelicals. Wilberforce, pronounced by
Madame de Sta&euml;l to be the most agreeable man in England,
was of "a most gay and genial disposition;" "lived in
perpetual sunshine, and shed its radiance all around him."
Legh Richmond was "exceedingly good company."
Robinson of Leicester was "a capital conversationalist,
very lively and bright." Alexander Knox found that Mrs.
Hannah More "far exceeded his expectations in pleasant
manners and interesting conversation."</p>
<p>The increasing taste for solid comfort and easy living
which accompanied the development of humanitarianism,
and in which, as we have just seen, the Evangelicals had
<a name="Page_96"></a>their full share, was evidenced to the eye by the
changes
in domestic architecture. There was less pretension in
exteriors and elevations, but more regard to convenience
and propriety within. The space was not all sacrificed to
reception-rooms. Bedrooms were multiplied and enlarged;
and fireplaces were introduced into every room,
transforming the arctic "powdering-closet" into a habitable
dressing-room. The diminution of the Window-Tax made
light and ventilation possible. Personal cleanliness became
fashionable, and the means of attaining it were cultivated.
The whole art or science of domestic sanitation&#8212;rudimentary
enough in its beginnings&#8212;belongs to the nineteenth
century. The system which went before it was too primitively
abominable to bear description. Sir Robert Rawlinson,
the sanitary expert, who was called in to inspect
Windsor Castle after the Prince Consort's death, reported
that, within the Queen's reign, "cesspools full of putrid
refuse and drains of the worst description existed beneath
the basements.... Twenty of these cesspools were removed
from the upper ward, and twenty-eight from the
middle and lower wards.... Means of ventilation by
windows in Windsor Castle were very defective. Even in
the royal apartments the upper portions of the windows
were fixed. Lower casements alone could be opened, so
that by far the largest amount of air-spaces in the rooms
contained vitiated air, comparatively stagnant." When
this was the condition of royal abodes, no wonder that the
typhoid-germ, like Solomon's spider, "took hold with her
hands, and was in kings' palaces." And well might Sir
George Trevelyan, in his ardent youth, exclaim:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"We much revere our sires; they were a famous race of men.</p>
<p>For every glass of port we drink, they nothing thought of ten.</p>

<h2>POLITICS.</h2>
<br>
<p>I now approach the political condition at the turn of the
century, and that was to a great extent the product of
the French Revolution. Some historians, indeed, when
dealing with that inexhaustible theme, have wrought cause
and effect into a circular chain, and have reckoned among
the circumstances which prepared the way for the French
Revolution the fact that Voltaire in his youth spent three
years in England, and mastered the philosophy of Bacon,
Newton, and Locke, the Deism of the English Freethinkers,
and the English theory of political liberty. That
these doctrines, recommended by Voltaire's mordant genius
and matchless style, and circulating in a community prepared
by tyranny to receive them, acted as a powerful
solvent on the intellectual basis of French society, is indeed
likely enough. But to pursue the theme would carry us
too far back into the eighteenth century. In dealing with
the recollections of persons whom one's self has known we
must dismiss from view the causes of the French Revolution.
Our business is with its effect on political thought
and action in England.</p>
<p>About half way through the nineteenth century it became
the fashion to make out that the effect of the Revolution
on England had been exaggerated. Satirists made fun of
our traditional Gallophobia. In that admirable skit on
philosophical history, the introduction to the <i>Book of Snobs</i>,
<a name="Page_99"></a>Thackeray first illustrates his theme by a
reference to the
French Revolution, and then adds (in sarcastic
brackets)&#8212;"Which
the reader will be pleased to have introduced so
early." Lord Beaconsfield, quizzing John Wilson Croker in
<i>Coningsby</i>, says: "He bored his audience with too much
history, especially the French Revolution, which he fancied
was his forte, so that the people at last, whenever he made
any allusion to the subject, were almost as much terrified
as if they had seen the guillotine." In spite of these gibes,
historians have of late years returned to the earlier and
truer view, and have deliberately reaffirmed the tremendous
effect of the Revolution on English politics. The philosophical
Mr. Lecky says that it influenced English history in
the later years of the eighteenth century more powerfully
than any other event; that it gave a completely new direction
to the statesmanship of Pitt; that it instantaneously
shattered, and rendered ineffectual for a whole generation,
one of the two great parties in the State; and that it
determined for a like period the character and complexion
of our foreign policy.</p>
<p>All contemporary Europe&#8212;all subsequent time&#8212;quivered
with the shock and sickened at the carnage; but I have
gathered that it was not till the capture of the Bastille that
the events which were taking place in France attracted any
general or lively interest in England. The strifes of rival
politicians, the illness of George III., and the consequent
questions as to the Regency, engrossed the public mind,
and what little interest was felt in foreign affairs was directed
much more to the possible designs of Russia than to the
actual condition of France. The capture of the Bastille,
however, was an event so startling and so dramatic that it
instantly arrested the public attention of England, and the
events which immediately followed in rapid and striking
succession raised interest into excitement, and excitement
into passion. Men who had been accustomed from their
<a name="Page_100"></a>childhood to regard the Monarchy of France as
the type of
a splendid, powerful, and enduring polity now saw a National
Army constituted in complete independence of the Crown;
a Representative Body assuming absolute power and denying
the King's right to dissolve; the summary abrogation
of the whole feudal system, which a year before had seemed
endowed with perpetual vigour; an insurrection of the
peasantry against their territorial tyrants, accompanied by
every horror of pillage, arson, and bloodshed; the beautiful
and stately Queen flying, half naked, for her life, amid the
slaughter of her sentinels and courtiers; and the King himself
virtually a prisoner in the very Court which, up to that
moment, had seemed the ark and sanctuary of absolute
government. All over England these events produced their
immediate and natural effect. Enemies of religious establishments
took courage from the downfall of ecclesiastical
institutions. Enemies of monarchy rejoiced in the formal
and public degradation of a monarch. Those who had long
been conscientiously working for Parliamentary reform saw
with glee their principles expressed in the most uncompromising
terms in the French Declaration of Rights, and
practically applied in the constitution of the Sovereign Body
of France.</p>
<p>These convinced and constitutional reformers found new
and strange allies. Serious advocates of Republican institutions,
mere lovers of change and excitement, secret sympathizers
with lawlessness and violence, sedentary theorists,
reckless adventurers, and local busybodies associated themselves
in the endeavour to popularize the French Revolution
in England and to imbue the English mind with congenial
sentiments. The movement had leaders of greater mark.
The Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Richmond, Lord
Lansdowne and Lord Stanhope, held language about the
Sovereignty of the People such as filled the reverent and
orderly mind of Burke with indignant astonishment. In
<a name="Page_101"></a>Dr. Priestley the revolutionary party had an
eminent man
of science and a polemical writer of rare power. Dr. Price
was a rhetorician whom any cause would have gladly enlisted
as its champion. The Revolution Society, founded
to commemorate the capture of the Bastille, corresponded
with the leaders of the Revolution, and promised its alliance
in a revolutionary compact. And, to add a touch of comedy
to these more serious demonstrations, the young Duke of
Bedford and other leaders of fashion discarded hair-powder,
and wore their hair cut short in what was understood to be
the Republican mode of Paris.</p>
<p>Amidst all this hurly-burly Pitt maintained a stately and
cautious reserve. Probably he foresaw his opportunity in
the inevitable disruption of his opponents; and if so, his
foresight was soon realized by events. On the capture of
the Bastille, Fox exclaimed: "How much the greatest event
it is that ever happened in the world! and how much the
best!" At the same time Burke was writing to an intimate
friend: "The old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a
shocking manner. It is true that this may be no more than
a sudden explosion. If so, no indication can be taken
from it; but if it should be character rather than accident,
then that people are not fit for liberty, and must have a
strong hand like that of their former masters to coerce them."
This contrast between the judgments of the 10 great
Whigs was continuously and rapidly heightened. Fox
threw himself into the revolutionary cause with all the ardour
which he had displayed on behalf of American independence.
Burke opposed with characteristic vehemence the
French attempt to build up a theoretical Constitution on
the ruins of religion, history, and authority; and any fresh
act of cruelty or oppression which accompanied the process
stirred in him that tremendous indignation against violence
and injustice of which Warren Hastings had learned by
stern experience the intensity and the volume. The <i>Re<a
 name="Page_102"></a>flections
on the French Revolution</i> and the <i>Appeal from the
New to the Old Whigs</i> expressed in the most splendid
English which was ever written the dire apprehensions that
darkened their author's receptive and impassioned mind.
"A voice like the Apocalypse sounded over England, and
even echoed in all the Courts of Europe. Burke poured
the vials of his hoarded vengeance into the agitated heart
of Christendom, and stimulated the panic of a world by the
wild pictures of his inspired imagination."</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Whig party was rent in twain. The Duke
of Portland, Lord Fitzwilliam, the Duke of Devonshire,
Lord John Cavendish, and Sir George Elliot adhered to
Burke. Fox as stoutly opposed him, and was reinforced
by Sheridan, Francis, Erskine, and Grey. The pathetic
issue of the dispute, in Burke's formal repudiation of Fox's
friendship, has taken its place among those historic
Partings of Friends which have modified the course of
human society. As far as can now be judged, the bulk
of the country was with Burke, and the execution of Louis
XVI. was followed by an astonishing outbreak of popular
feeling. The theatres were closed. The whole population
wore mourning. The streets rang with the cry "War with
France!" The very pulpits re-echoed the summons. Fox
himself was constrained to declare to the electors of Westminster
that there was no one outside France who did not
consider this sad catastrophe "as a most revolting act of
cruelty and injustice."</p>
<p>But it was too late. The horror and indignation of
England were not to be allayed by soothing words of
decorous sympathy from men who had applauded the earlier
stages of the tragedy, though they wept at its culmination.
The warlike spirit of the race was aroused, and it spoke in
the cry, "No peace with the regicides!" Pitt clearly discerned
the feeling of the country, and promptly gave effect
to it. He dismissed Chauvelin, who informally represented
<a name="Page_103"></a>the Revolutionary Government in London, and he
demanded
from Parliament an immediate augmentation of
the forces.</p>
<p>On the 20th of January, 1793, France declared war
against England. The great struggle had begun, and that
declaration was a new starting-point in the political history
of England. English parties entered into new combinations.
English politics assumed a new complexion. Pitt's imperial
mind maintained its ascendency, but the drift of his policy
was entirely changed. All the schemes of Parliamentary,
financial, and commercial reform in which he had been
immersed yielded place to the stern expedients of a
Minister fighting for his life against revolution abroad and
sedition at home. For though, as I said just now, popular
sentiment was stirred by the King's execution into vehement
hostility to France, still the progress of the war was attended
by domestic consequences which considerably modified this
sentiment. Hostility gave way to passive acquiescence,
and acquiescence to active sympathy.</p>
<p>Among the causes which produced this change were
the immense increase of national burdens; the sudden
agglomeration of a lawless population in the manufacturing
towns which the war called into being; the growing difficulties
in Ireland, where revolutionary theories found ready
learners; the absolute abandonment of all attempts at social
and political improvement; the dogged determination of
those in authority to remedy no grievance however patent,
and to correct no abuse however indefensible.</p>
<p>The wise and temperate reforms for which the times
were ripe, and which the civil genius of Pitt pre-eminently
qualified him to effect, were not only suspended but finally
abandoned under the influence of an insane reaction. The
besotted resistance to all change stimulated the desire for
it. Physical distress co-operated with political discontent
to produce a state of popular disaffection such as the whole
<a name="Page_104"></a>preceding century had never seen. The severest
measures
of coercion and repression only, and scarcely, restrained
the populace from open and desperate insurrection, and
thirty years of this experience brought England to the
verge of a civil catastrophe.</p>
<p>Patriotism was lost in partisanship. Political faction
ran to an incredible excess. The whole community was
divided into two hostile camps. Broadly speaking, the
cause of France was espoused, with different degrees of
fervour, by all lovers of civil and religious freedom. To
the Whigs the humiliation of Pitt was a more cherished
object than the defeat of Napoleon. Fox wrote to a friend:
"The triumph of the French Government over the English
does, in fact, afford me a degree of pleasure which it is very
difficult to disguise;" and I have gathered that this was the
prevalent temper of Whiggery during the long and desperate
struggle with Republican and Imperial France. What
Byron called "The crowning carnage, Waterloo," brought
no abatement of political rancour. The question of France,
indeed, was eliminated from the contest, but its elimination
enabled English Liberals to concentrate their hostility on
the Tory Government without incurring the reproach of
unpatriotic sympathy with the enemies of England.</p>
<p>In the great fight between Tory and Whig, Government
and Opposition, Authority and Freedom, there was no
quarter. Neither age nor sex was spared. No department
of national life was untouched by the fury of the contest.
The Royal Family was divided. The Duke of Cumberland
was one of the most dogged and unscrupulous leaders of
the Tory party; the Duke of Sussex toasted the memory
of Charles James Fox, and at a public dinner joined in
singing "The Trumpet of Liberty," of which the chorus
ran&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Fall, tyrants, fall!</p>
<p>These are the days of liberty;</p>
<p>Fall, tyrants, fall!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_105"></a>The Established Church was on the side of
authority;
the Dissenters stood for freedom. "Our opponents," said
Lord John Russell, in one of his earliest speeches&#8212;"our
opponents deafen us with their cry of 'Church and King.'
Shall I tell you what they mean by it? They mean a
Church without the Gospel and a King above the law."
An old Radical electioneer, describing the activity of the
country clergy on the Tory side, said: "In every village
we had the Black Recruiting-Sergeant against us." Even
within sacred walls the echoes of the fight were heard.
The State Holy-days&#8212;Gunpowder Treason, Charles the
Martyr, the Restoration and the Accession&#8212;gave suitable
occasion for sermons of the most polemical vehemence.
Even the two Collects for the King at the beginning of
the Communion Service were regarded as respectively Tory
and Whig. The first, with its bold assertion of the Divine
Right of Sovereignty, was that which commended itself to
every loyal clergyman on his promotion; and unfavourable
conclusions were drawn with regard to the civil sentiments
of the man who preferred the colourless alternative. As in
the Church, so in our educational system. Oxford, with its
Caroline and Jacobite traditions, was the Tory University;
Cambridge, the nursing mother of Whigs; Eton was supposed
to cherish a sentiment of romantic affection for the
Stuarts; Harrow was profoundly Hanoverian. Even the
drama was involved in political antipathies, and the most
enthusiastic adherents of Kean and Kemble were found
respectively among the leaders of Whig and Tory Society.</p>
<p>The vigour, heartiness, and sincerity of this political
hatred put to shame the more tepid convictions of our
degenerate days. The first Earl of Leicester, better known
as "Coke of Norfolk," told my father that when he was a
child his grandfather took him on his knee and said, "Now,
remember, Tom, as long as you live, never trust a Tory;"
and he used to say, "I never have, and, by George, I never
<a name="Page_106"></a>will." A little girl of Whig descent, accustomed
from her
cradle to hear language of this sort, asked her mother,
"Mamma, are Tories born wicked, or do they grow wicked
afterwards?" and her mother judiciously replied, "They
are born wicked, and grow worse." I well remember in
my youth an eccentric maiden lady&#8212;Miss Harriet Fanny
Cuyler&#8212;who had spent a long and interesting life in the
innermost circles of aristocratic Whiggery; and she always
refused to enter a four-wheel cab until she had extorted
from the driver his personal assurance that he never had
cases of infectious disease in his cab, that he was not a
Puseyite, and was a Whig.</p>
<p>I am bound to say that this vehement prejudice was not
unnatural in a generation that remembered, either personally
or by immediate tradition, the iron coercion which Pitt
exercised in his later days, and which his successors continued.
The barbarous executions for high treason remain
a blot on the fair fame of the nineteenth century. Scarcely
less horrible were the trials for sedition, which sent an
English clergyman to transportation for life because he had
signed a petition in favour of Parliamentary reform.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The good old Code, like Argus, had a hundred watchful eyes,</p>
<p>And each old English peasant had his good old English spies,</p>
<p>To tempt his starving discontent with good old English lies,</p>
<p>Then call the British yeomanry to stop his peevish cries."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At Woburn, a market town forty miles from London, under
the very shadow of a great Whig house, no political meeting
could be held for fear of Pitt's spies, who dropped down
from London by the night coach and returned to lay information
against popular speakers; and when the politicians
of the place desired to express their sentiments, they had
to repair secretly to an adjacent village off the coach road,
where they were harangued under cover of night by the
young sons of the Duke of Bedford.</p>
<p>The ferocity, the venality, the profligate expenditure, the
<a name="Page_107"></a>delirious excitement of contested elections have
made an
indelible mark on our political history. In 1780 King
George III. personally canvassed the Borough of Windsor
against the Whig candidate, Admiral Keppel, and propitiated
a silk-mercer by calling at his shop and saying,
"The Queen wants a gown&#8212;wants a gown. No Keppel.
No Keppel." It is pleasant to reflect that the friends of
freedom were not an inch behind the upholders of tyranny
in the vigour and adroitness of their electioneering methods.
The contest for the City of Westminster in 1788 is thus described
in the manuscript diary of Lord Robert Seymour:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The Riotts of the Westr. Election are carried such
lengths the Military obliged to be called into the assistance
of Ld. Hood's party. Several Persons have been
killed by Ld. J. Townsend's Butchers who cleave them
to the Ground with their Cleavers&#8212;Mr. Fox very narrowly
escaped being killed by a Bayonet wch. w'd certainly have
been fatal had not a poor Black saved him fm. the blow.
Mr. Macnamara's Life is despaired of&#8212;&amp; several others
have died in the difft. Hospitals. Next Thursday decides
the business.</p>
  <p>"July 25.&#8212;Lord John Townsend likely to get the
Election&#8212;what has chiefly contributed to Ld. Hood's
losing it is that Mr. Pulteney is his Friend&#8212;Mr. P. can
command 1,500 Votes&#8212;&amp; as he is universally disliked by
his Tenants they are unanimous in voting against him&#8212;
wch. for Ld. H. proves a very unfortunate circumstance.
The Duke of Bedford sent &pound;10,000 towards the Expenses
of the Opposition.</p>
  <p>"It is thought that Lord Hood will not attempt a
Scrutiny. One of Ld. Hood's votes was discovered to be
a carrot-scraper in St. James's Market who sleeps in a little
Kennel about the Size of a Hen Coup.</p>
  <p>"Augt. 5th&#8212;The Election decided in favour of Ld. J.T.,
who was chaired&#8212;and attend'd by a Procession of a mile <a
 name="Page_108"></a>in length. On his Head was a crown of Laurel.
C.
Fox
follow'd him in a Landau &amp; 6 Horses cover'd in Favors
&amp; Lawrels. The appearance this Procession made was
equal in splendor to the public Entry of an Ambassador."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A by-election was impending in Yorkshire, and Pitt,
paying a social visit to the famous Mrs. B.&#8212;one of the
Whig Queens of the West Riding&#8212;said, banteringly,
"Well, the election is all right for us. Ten thousand
guineas for the use of our side go down to Yorkshire
to-night by a sure hand." "The devil they do!" responded
Mrs. B., and that night the bearer of the precious burden
was stopped by a highwayman on the Great North Road,
and the ten thousand guineas were used to procure the
return of the Whig candidate. The electioneering methods,
less adventurous but not more scrupulous, of a rather later
day have been depicted in <i>Pickwick</i>, and <i>Coningsby</i>, and
<i>My Novel</i>, and <i>Middlemarch</i>, with all the suggestive fun
of a painting by Hogarth.</p>
<p>And so, with startling incidents and culpable expedients
and varying fortunes, the great struggle for political freedom
was conducted through the first thirty years of the nineteenth
century, and it has been my interesting fortune to know
some of the toughest of the combatants both among the
leaders and in the rank-and-file. And from all of them
alike&#8212;and not only from them, but from all who remembered
the time&#8212;I have gathered the impression that all through
their earlier life the hidden fires of revolution were
smouldering under English society, and that again and
again an actual outbreak was only averted by some happy
stroke of fortune. At the Election of 1868 an old labourer
in the agricultural Borough of Woodstock told a Liberal
canvasser from Oxford that in his youth arms had been
stored in his father's cottage so as to be in readiness for
the outbreak which was to take place if Lord Grey's
Reform Bill was finally defeated. A Whig nobleman,
<a name="Page_109"></a>of great experience and calm judgment, told me
that if
Princess Victoria had died before William IV., and thereby
Ernest Duke of Cumberland had succeeded to the Throne,
no earthly power could have averted a revolution. "I
have no hesitation in saying," I heard Mr. Gladstone say,
"that if the repeal of the Corn Laws had been defeated, or
even retarded, we should have had a revolution." Charles
Kingsley and his fellow-workers for Social Reform expected
a revolution in April 1848.</p>
<p>But, after all, these testimonies belong to the region of
conjecture. Let me close this chapter by a narrative of
fact, derived from the late Lord de Ros, who was an
eye-witness of the events which he narrated. Arthur
Thistlewood (whose execution for the "Cato Street Conspiracy"
I have described in a previous chapter) was a
young Englishman who had been in Paris in the time of
Robespierre's ascendency, and had there imbibed revolutionary
sentiments. He served for a short time as an
officer in the English Army, and after quitting the service
he made himself notorious by trying to organize a political
riot in London, for which he was tried and acquitted. He
subsequently collected round him a secret society of disaffected
citizens, and proceeded to arrange a plan by which
he hoped to paralyze Government and establish a Reign of
Terror in London.</p>
<p>One evening, in the winter of 1819-20, a full-dress ball
was given by the Spanish Ambassador in Portland Place,
and was attended by the Prince Regent, the Royal Dukes,
the Duke of Wellington, the Ministers of State, and the
leaders of fashion and society. "About one o'clock, just
before supper, a sort of order was circulated among the
junior officers to draw towards the head of the stairs,
though no one knew for what reason, except that an
unusual crowd had assembled in the street. The appearance
of Lavender and one or two well-known Bow Street
<a name="Page_110"></a>officers in the entrance-hall also gave rise to
surmises of
some impending riot. While the officers were whispering
to one another as to what was expected to happen, a great
noise was heard in the street, the crowd dispersed with loud
cries in all directions, and a squadron of the 2nd Life
Guards arrived with drawn swords at a gallop from their
barracks (then situate in King Street), and rapidly formed
in front of the Ambassador's house. Lavender and the Bow
Street officers now withdrew; the officers who had gathered
about the stairhead were desired to return to the ballroom.</p>
<p>"The alarm, whatever it might have been, appeared to
be over, and before the company broke up the Life Guards
had been withdrawn to their barracks. Inside the Ambassador's
house all had remained so quiet that very few of the
ladies present were aware till next day that anything unusual
had happened, but it became known after a short
time that the Duke of Wellington had received information
of an intended attack upon the house, which the precautions
taken had probably prevented; and upon the trial
of Thistlewood and his gang (for the Cato Street Conspiracy)
it came out, among other evidence of the various wild
schemes they had formed, that Thistlewood had certainly
entertained the project, at the time of this ball, to attack
the Spanish Ambassador's house, and destroy the Regent
and other Royal personages, as well as the Ministers, who
were sure to be, most of them, present on the occasion."</p>
<p>For details of the Cato Street Conspiracy the curious
reader is referred to the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1820, and it is
strange to reflect that these explosions of revolutionary rage
occurred well within the recollection of people now<a name="FNanchor_11"></a><a

<h2><a name="Page_111"></a>XI.</h2>
<h2>PARLIAMENTARY ORATORY.</h2>
<p>Closely connected with the subject of Politics, of
which we were speaking in the last chapter, is that of
Parliamentary Oratory, and for a right estimate of oratory
personal impressions (such as those on which I have relied)
are peculiarly valuable. They serve both to correct and to
confirm. It is impossible to form from the perusal of a
printed speech anything but the vaguest and often the
most erroneous notion of the effect which it produced upon
its hearers. But from the testimony of contemporaries one
can often gain the clue to what is otherwise unintelligible.
One learns what were the special attributes of bearing,
voice, or gesture, the circumstances of delivery, or even the
antecedent conditions of character and reputation, which
perhaps doomed some magnificent peroration to ludicrous
failure, or, on the contrary, "ordained strength" out of
stammering lips and disjointed sentences. Testimony of
this kind the circumstances of my life have given me in
great abundance. My chain of tradition links me to the
days of the giants.</p>
<p>Almost all the old people whose opinions and experience
I have recorded were connected, either personally or
through their nearest relations, with one or other of the
Houses of Parliament. Not a few of them were conspicuous
actors on the stage of political life. Lord Robert
Seymour, from whose diary I have quoted, died in 1831,
<a name="Page_112"></a>after a long life spent in the House of Commons,
which he
entered in 1771, and of which for twenty-three years he was
a fellow-member with Edmund Burke. Let me linger for a
moment on that illustrious name.</p>
<p>In originality, erudition, and accomplishments Burke
had no rival among Parliamentary speakers. His prose is,
as we read it now, the most fascinating, the most musical,
in the English language. It bears on every page the divine
lineaments of genius. Yet an orator requires something
more than mere force of words. He must feel, while he
speaks, the pulse of his audience, and instinctively regulate
every sentence by reference to their feelings. All contemporary
evidence shows that in this kind of oratorical tact Burke
was eminently deficient. His nickname, "The Dinner-bell
of the House of Commons," speaks for his
effect on the mind of the average M.P. "In vain," said:
Moore, "did Burke's genius put forth its superb plumage,
glittering all over with the hundred eyes of fancy. The gait
of the bird was heavy and awkward, and its voice seemed
rather to scare than attract."</p>
<p>Macaulay has done full justice to the extraordinary blaze
of brilliancy which on supreme occasions threw these minor
defects into the shade. Even now the old oak rafters of
Westminster Hall seem to echo that superlative peroration
which taught Mrs. Siddons a higher flight of tragedy than
her own, and made the accused proconsul feel himself for
the moment the guiltiest of men. Mr. Gladstone declared
that Burke was directly responsible for the war with France,
for "Pitt could not have resisted him." For the more
refined, the more cultivated, the more speculative intellects
he had&#8212;and has&#8212;an almost supernatural charm. His
style is without any exception the richest, the most picturesque,
the most inspired and inspiring in the language. In
its glories and its terrors it resembles the Apocalypse.
Mr. Morley, in the most striking of all his critical essays,
<a name="Page_113"></a>has truly said that the natural ardour which
impelled Burke
to clothe his judgments in glowing and exaggerated phrases
is one secret of his power over us, because it kindles in
those who are capable of that generous infection a respondent
interest and sympathy. "He has the sacred gift of
inspiring men to care for high things, and to make their
lives at once rich and austere. Such a gift is rare indeed.
We feel no emotion of revolt when Mackintosh speaks of
Shakespeare and Burke in the same breath as being, both
of them, above mere talent. We do not dissent when
Macaulay, after reading Burke's works over again, exclaims:
'How admirable! The greatest man since
Milton!'"</p>
<p>No sane critic would dream of comparing the genius of
Pitt with that of Burke. Yet where Burke failed Pitt
succeeded. Burke's speeches, indeed, are a part of our
national literature; Pitt was, in spite of grave and undeniable
faults, the greatest Minister that ever governed
England. Foremost among the gifts by which he acquired
his supreme ascendency must be placed his power of parliamentary
speaking. He was not, as his father was, an
orator in that highest sense of oratory which implies something
of inspiration, of genius, of passionate and poetic
rapture; but he was a public speaker of extraordinary merit.
He had while still a youth what Coleridge aptly termed "a
premature and unnatural dexterity in the combination of
words," and this developed into "a power of pouring forth
with endless facility perfectly modulated sentences of perfectly
chosen language, which as far surpassed the reach of
a normal intellect as the feats of an acrobat exceed the
capacities of a normal body." It was eloquence particularly
well calculated to sway a popular assembly which yet had
none of the characteristics of a mob. A sonorous voice; a
figure and bearing which, though stiff and ungainly, were
singularly dignified; an inexhaustible copiousness of gran<a
 name="Page_114"></a>diloquent
phrase; a peculiar vein of sarcasm which froze
like ice and cut like steel&#8212;these were some of the characteristics
of the oratory which from 1782 to 1806 at once
awed and fascinated the House of Commons.</p>
<p>"I never want a word, but Mr. Pitt always has at command
the right word." This was the generous tribute of
Pitt's most eminent rival, Charles James Fox. Never were
great opponents in public life more exactly designed by
Nature to be contrasts to one another. While every tone
of Pitt's voice and every muscle of his countenance expressed
with unmistakable distinctness the cold and stately
composure of his character, every particle of Fox's mental
and physical formation bore witness to his fiery and passionate
enthusiasm. "What is that fat gentleman in such
a passion about?" was the artless query of the late Lord
Eversley, who, as Mr. Speaker Shaw-Lefevre, so long presided
over the House of Commons, and who as a child had been
taken to the gallery to hear Mr. Fox. While Pitt was the
embodied representative of Order, his rival was the Apostle
and Evangelist of Liberty. If the master passion of Pitt's
mind was enthusiasm for his country, Fox was swayed by
the still nobler enthusiasm of Humanity. His style of
oratory was the exact reflex of his mind. He was unequalled
in passionate argument, in impromptu reply, in
ready and spontaneous declamation. His style was unstudied
to a fault. Though he was so intimately acquainted
with the great models of classical antiquity, his oratory
owed little to the contact, and nothing to the formal arts
of rhetoric; everything to inborn genius and the greatness
of the cause which he espoused. It would be difficult to
point to a single public question of his time on which his
voice did not sound with rousing effect, and whenever that
voice was heard it was on behalf of freedom, humanity, and
the sacred brotherhood of nations.</p>
<p>I pass on to the orator of whose masterpiece Fox said
<a name="Page_115"></a>that "eloquent indeed it was; so much so that
all he had
ever heard, all he had ever read, dwindled into nothing, and
vanished like vapour before the sun." In sparkling brilliancy
and pointed wit, in all the livelier graces of declamation
and delivery, Sheridan surpassed all his contemporaries.
When he concluded his speech on the charge against Warren
Hastings of plundering the Begums of Oude, the peers and
strangers joined with the House in a tumult of applause,
and could not be restrained from clapping their hands in
ecstasy. The House adjourned in order to recover its self-possession.
Pitt declared that this speech surpassed all the
eloquence of ancient and modern times, and possessed
everything that genius or art could furnish to agitate or
control the human mind. And yet, while Sheridan's
supreme efforts met with this startling success, his deficiencies
in statesmanship and character prevented him from
commanding that position in the House and in the Government
which his oratorical gift, if not thus handicapped,
must have secured for its possessor.</p>
<p>As a speaker in his own sphere Lord Erskine was not
inferior to the greatest of his contemporaries. He excelled
in fire, force, and passion. Lord Brougham finely described
"that noble figure every look of whose countenance is
expressive, every motion of whose form graceful; an eye
that sparkles and pierces and almost assures victory, while
it 'speaks audience ere the tongue.'" Yet, as is so often the
case, the unequalled advocate found himself in the House
of Commons less conspicuously successful than he had been
at the Bar. The forensic manner of speech, in which he
was a head and shoulders higher than any of his legal contemporaries,
is, after all, distinct from parliamentary eloquence.</p>
<p>The same disqualification attached to the oratory of Lord
Brougham, whose speech at the bar of the House of Lords
in defence of Queen Caroline had made so deep an
<a name="Page_116"></a>impression. His extraordinary fierceness and
even violence
of nature pervaded his whole physical as well as intellectual
being. When he spoke he was on springs and quicksilver,
and poured forth sarcasm, invective, argument, and declamation
in a promiscuous and headlong flood. Yet all
contemporary evidence shows that his grandest efforts were
dogged by the inevitable fate of the man who, not content
with excellence in one or two departments, aims at the
highest point in all. In reading his speeches, while one
admires the versatility, one is haunted by that fatal sense of
superficiality which gave rise to the saying that "if the
Lord Chancellor only knew a little law he would know
something about everything."</p>
<p>Pitt died in 1806, but he lived long enough to hear the
splendid eloquence of Grattan, rich in imagination, metaphor,
and epigram; and to open the doors of the official hierarchy
to George Canning. Trained by Pitt, and in many gifts
and graces his superior, Canning first displayed his full
greatness after the death of his illustrious master. For
twenty years he was the most accomplished debater in the
House of Commons, and yet he never succeeded in winning
the full confidence of the nation, nor, except in foreign
affairs, in leaving his mark upon our national policy. "The
English are afraid of genius," and when genius is displayed
in the person of a social adventurer, however brilliant and
delightful, it is doubly alarming.</p>
<p>We can judge of Canning's speeches more exactly than
of those of his predecessors, for by the time that he had
become famous the art of parliamentary reporting had
attained almost to its present perfection; and there are
none which more amply repay critical study. Second only
to Burke in the grandeur and richness of his imagery, he
greatly excelled him in readiness, in tact, and in those
adventitious advantages which go so far to make an orator.
Mr. Gladstone remembered the "light and music" of the
<a name="Page_117"></a>eloquence with which he had fascinated Liverpool
seventy
years before. Scarcely any one contributed so many beautiful
thoughts and happy phrases to the common stock of
public speech. All contemporary observers testify to the
effect produced by the proud strength of his declaration on
foreign policy: "I called the New World into existence, to
redress the balance of the Old." And the language does
not contain a more magnificent or perfect image than that
in which he likens a strong nation at peace to a great man-of-war
lying calm and motionless till the moment for action
comes, when "it puts forth all its beauty and its bravely
collects its scattered elements of strength, and awakens its
dormant thunder."</p>
<p>Lord John Russell entered the House of Commons in
1813, and left it in 1861. He used to say that in his early
days there were a dozen men there who could make a finer
speech than any one now living; "but," he used to add,
"there were not another dozen who could understand what
they were talking about." I asked him who was, on the
whole, the best speaker he ever heard. He answered,
"Lord Plunket," and subsequently gave as his reason this
&#8212;that while Plunket had his national Irish gifts of fluency,
brilliant imagination, and ready wit very highly developed,
they were all adjuncts to his strong, cool, inflexible argument.
This, it will be readily observed, is a very rare and a
very striking combination, and goes far to account for the
transcendent success which Plunket attained at the Bar and
in the House, and alike in the Irish and the English
Parliament. Lord Brougham said of him that his eloquence
was a continuous flow of "clear statement, close reasoning,
felicitous illustration, all confined strictly to the subject in
hand; every portion, without any exception, furthering the
process of conviction;" and I do not know a more impressive
passage of sombre passion than the peroration of
his first speech against the Act of Union: "For my own
<a name="Page_118"></a>part, I will resist it to the last gasp of my
existence, and
with the last drop of my blood; and when I feel the hour
of my dissolution approaching, I will, like the father of
Hannibal, take my children to the altar and swear them
to eternal hostility against the invaders of their country's
freedom."</p>
<p>Before the death of Pitt another great man had risen to
eminence, though the main achievement of his life associates
him with 1832. Lord Grey was distinguished by a stately
and massive eloquence which exactly suited his high
purpose and earnest gravity of nature, while its effect was
enormously enhanced by his handsome presence and kingly
bearing. Though the leader of the popular cause, he was
an aristocrat in nature, and pre-eminently qualified for the
great part which, during twenty years, he played in that
essentially aristocratic assembly&#8212;the unreformed House of
Commons. In a subsequent chapter I hope to say a little
about parliamentary orators of a rather more recent date;
and here it may not be uninteresting to compare the House
of Commons as we have seen it and known it, modified by
successive extensions of the suffrage, with what it was before
Grey and Russell destroyed for ever its exclusive character.</p>
<p>The following description is taken from Lord Beaconsfield,
who is drawing a character derived in part from Sir
Francis Burdett (1770-1840), and in part from George
Byng, who was M.P. for Middlesex for fifty-six years, and
died in 1847:&#8212;"He was the Father of the House, though
it was difficult to believe that from his appearance. He
was tall, and kept his distinguished figure; a handsome
man with a musical voice, and a countenance now benignant,
though very bright and Once haughty. He still retained
the same fashion of costume in which he had ridden up to
Westminster more than half a century ago to support his
dear friend Charles Fox&#8212;real topboots and a blue coat
and buff waistcoat. He had a large estate, and had refused
<a name="Page_119"></a>an earldom. Knowing E., he came and sate by him
one
Jay in the House, and asked him, good-naturedly, how he
liked his new life. It is very different from what it as
when I was your age. Up to Easter we rarely had a regular
debate, never a party division; very few people came up
indeed. But there was a good deal of speaking on all
subjects before dinner. We had the privilege then of
speaking on the presentation of petitions at any length, and
we seldom spoke on any other occasion. After Easter
there was always at least one great party fight. This was a
mighty affair, talked of for weeks before it came off, and
then rarely an adjourned debate. We were gentlemen,
used to sit up late, and should have been sitting up somewhere
else had we not been in the House of Commons.
After this party fight the House for the rest of the session
was a mere club.... The House of Commons was very
much like what the House of Lords is now. You went
home to dine, and then came back for an important
division.... Twenty years ago no man would think of
coming down to the House except in evening dress. I remember
so late as Mr. Canning the Minister always came
down in silk stockings and pantaloons or knee-breeches.
All these things change, and quoting Virgil will be the next
thing to disappear. In the last&#8212;Parliament we often had
Latin quotations, but never from a member with a new
constituency. I have heard Greek quoted here, but that
was long ago, and a great mistake. The House was quite
alarmed. Charles Fox used to say as to quotation, 'No
Greek; as much Latin as you like; and never French
under any circumstances. No English poet unless he has
completed his century.' These were, like some other
good rules, the unwritten orders of the House of Commons."</p>

<h2><a name="Page_120"></a>XII.</h2>
<h2>PARLIAMENTARY ORATORY&#8212;<i>continued</i>.</h2>
<p>I concluded my last chapter with a quotation from
Lord Beaconsfield, describing parliamentary speaking as
it was when he entered the House of Commons in 1837.
Of that particular form of speaking perhaps the greatest
master was Sir Robert Peel. He was deficient in those
gifts of imagination and romance which are essential to
the highest oratory. He utterly lacked&#8212;possibly he would
have despised&#8212;that almost prophetic rapture which we
recognize in Burke and Chatham and Erskine. His manner
was frigid and pompous, and his rhetorical devices were
mechanical. Every parliamentary sketch of the time
satirizes his habit of turning round towards his supporters
at given periods to ask for their applause; his trick of
emphasizing his points by perpetually striking the box
before him; and his inveterate propensity to indulge in
hackneyed quotation. But when we have said this we have
said all that can be urged in his disparagement. As a
parliamentary speaker of the second and perhaps most
useful class he has never been excelled. Firmly though
dispassionately persuaded of certain political and economic
doctrines, he brought to the task of promoting them unfailing
tact, prompt courage, intimate acquaintance with the
foibles of his hearers, unconquerable patience and perseverance,
and an inexhaustible supply of sonorous phrases and
rounded periods. Nor was his success confined to the
<a name="Page_121"></a>House of Commons. As a speaker on public
platforms, in
the heyday of the ten-pound householder and the middle-class
franchise, he was peculiarly in his element. He had
beyond most men the art of "making a platitude endurable
by making it pompous." He excelled in demonstrating the
material advantages of a moderate and cautious conservatism,
and he could draw at will and with effect upon a prodigious
fund of constitutional commonplaces. If we measure the
merit of a parliamentary speaker by his practical influence,
we must allow that Peel was pre-eminently great.</p>
<p>In the foremost rank of orators a place must certainly be
assigned to O'Connell. He was not at his best in the
House of Commons. His coarseness, violence, and
cunning were seen to the worst advantage in what was still
an assemblage of gentlemen. His powers of ridicule,
sarcasm, and invective, his dramatic and sensational predilections,
required another scene for their effective display.
But few men have ever been so richly endowed by Nature
with the original, the incommunicable, the inspired qualifications
which go to make an orator. He was magnificently
built, and blessed with a voice which, by all contemporary
testimony, was one of the most thrilling, flexible, and
melodious that ever vibrated through a popular assembly.
"From grave to gay, from lively to severe" he flew without
delay or difficulty. His wit gave point to the most irrelevant
personalities, and cogency to the most illogical syllogisms.
The most daring perversions of truth and justice were
driven home by appeals to the emotions which the coldest
natures could scarcely withstand; "the passions of his
audience were playthings in his hand." Lord Lytton thus
described him:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Once to my sight the giant thus was given:</p>
<p>Walled by wide air, and roofed by boundless heaven,</p>
<p>Beneath his feet the human ocean lay,</p>
<p>And wave on wave flowed into space away.</p>
<a name="Page_122"></a>
<p>Methought no clarion could have sent its sound</p>
<p>Even to the centre of the hosts around;</p>
<p>But, as I thought, rose the sonorous swell</p>
<p>As from some church tower swings the silvery bell.</p>
<p>Aloft and clear, from airy tide to tide</p>
<p>It glided, easy as a bird may glide;</p>
<p>To the last verge of that vast audience sent,</p>
<p>It played with each wild passion as it went;</p>
<p>Now stirred the uproar, now the murmur stilled,</p>
<p>And sobs or laughter answered as it willed.</p>
<p>Then did I know what spells of infinite choice,</p>
<p>To rouse or lull, hath the sweet human voice;</p>
<p>Then did I seem to seize the sudden clue</p>
<p>To that grand troublous Life Antique&#8212;to view,</p>
<p>Under the rockstand of Demosthenes,</p>
<p>Mutable Athens heave her noisy seas."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A remarkable contrast, as far as outward characteristics
went, was offered by the other great orator of the same time.
Sheil was very small, and of mean presence; with a singularly
fidgety manner, a shrill voice, and a delivery unintelligibly
rapid. But in sheer beauty of elaborated diction
not O'Connell nor any one else could surpass him. There
are few finer speeches in the language than that in which
he took Lord Lyndhurst to task for applying the term
"aliens" to the Irish in a speech on municipal reform:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Aliens! Good God! was Arthur Duke of Wellington in
the House of Lords, and did he not start up and exclaim,
'Hold! I have seen the aliens do their duty'?... I
appeal to the gallant soldier before me, from whose opinions
I differ, but who bears, I know, a generous heart in an
intrepid bosom&#8212;tell me, for you needs must remember,
on that day when the destinies of mankind were trembling
in the balance, while death fell in showers&#8212;tell me if for
an instant, when to hesitate for an instant was to be lost,
the 'aliens' blenched.... On the field of Waterloo the
blood of England, of Scotland, and of Ireland flowed in the
same stream and drenched the same field. When the chill
morning dawned their dead lay cold and stark together; in <a
 name="Page_123"></a>the same deep pit their bodies were deposited;
the green
corn of spring is now breaking from their commingled
dust; the dew falls from heaven upon this union in the
grave. Partakers in every peril, in the glory shall we not
be permitted to participate? And shall we be told as a
requital that we are 'aliens' from the noble country for
whose salvation our life-blood was poured out?"</blockquote>
<p>By the time which we are now considering there had
risen to eminence a man who, if he could not be ranked
with the great orators of the beginning of the century, yet
inherited their best traditions and came very near to rivalling
their fame. I refer to the great Lord Derby. His
eloquence was of the most impetuous kind, corresponding
to the sensitive fierceness of the man, and had gained for
him the nickname of "The Rupert of Debate." Lord
Beaconsfield, speaking in the last year of his life to Mr.
Matthew Arnold, said that the task of carrying Mr. Forster's
Coercion Bill of 1881 through the House of Commons
"needed such a man as Lord Derby was in his youth&#8212;a
man full of nerve, dash, fire, and resource, who carried the
House irresistibly along with him"&#8212;no mean tribute from
a consummate judge. Among Lord Derby's ancillary qualifications
were his musical voice, his fine English style, and
his facility in apt and novel quotation, as when he applied
Meg Merrilies's threnody over the ruins of Derncleugh to
the destruction of the Irish Church Establishment. I turn
to Lord Lytton again for a description:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"One after one, the Lords of Time advance;</p>
<p>Here Stanley meets&#8212;how Stanley scorns!--the glance.</p>
<p>The brilliant chief, irregularly great,</p>
<p>Frank, haughty, rash, the Rupert of Debate;</p>
<p>Nor gout nor toil his freshness can destroy,</p>
<p>And time still leaves all Eton in the boy.</p>
<p>First in the class, and keenest in the ring,</p>
<p>He saps like Gladstone, and he fights like Spring!</p>
<p>Yet who not listens, with delighted smile,</p>
<p>To the pure Saxon of that silver style;</p>
<a name="Page_124"></a>
<p>In the clear style a heart as clear is seen,</p>
<p>Prompt to the rash, revolting from the mean."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I turn now to Lord Derby's most eminent rival&#8212;Lord
Russell. Writing in 1844, Lord Beaconsfield thus described
him:&#8212;"He is not a natural orator, and labours under
physical deficiencies which even a Demosthenic impulse
could scarcely overcome. But he is experienced in debate,
quick in reply, fertile in resource, takes large views, and
frequently compensates for a dry and hesitating manner by
the expression of those noble truths that flash across the
fancy and rise spontaneously to the lip of men of poetic
temperament when addressing popular assemblies." Twenty
years earlier Moore had described Lord John Russell's public
speaking in a peculiarly happy image:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"An eloquence, not like those rills from a height</p>
<p class="i1">Which sparkle and foam and in vapour are o'er;</p>
<p>But a current that works out its way into light</p>
<p class="i1">Through the filtering recesses of thought and of lore."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Cobden, when they were opposed to one another in the
earlier days of the struggle for Free Trade, described him
as "a cunning little fox," and avowed that he dreaded his
dexterity in parliamentary debate more than that of any
other opponent.</p>
<p>In 1834 Lord John made his memorable declaration in
favour of a liberal policy with reference to the Irish Church
Establishment, and, in his own words, "The speech made
a great impression; the cheering was loud and general;
and Stanley expressed his sense of it in a well-known note
to Sir James Graham: 'Johnny has upset the coach.'"
The phrase was perpetuated by Lord Lytton, to whom I
must go once again for a perfectly apt description of the
Whig leader, both in his defects of manner and in his
essential greatness:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_125"></a>
<p>"Next cool, and all unconscious of reproach,</p>
<p>Comes the calm Johnny who "upset the coach"&#8212;</p>
<p>How formed to lead, if not too proud to please!</p>
<p>His fame would fire you, but his manners freeze;</p>
<p>Like or dislike, he does not care a jot;</p>
<p>He wants your vote, but your affections not.</p>
<p>Yet human hearts need sun as well as oats;</p>
<p>So cold a climate plays the deuce with votes.</p>
<p>But see our hero when the steam is on,</p>
<p>And languid Johnny glows to Glorious John;</p>
<p>When Hampden's thought, by Falkland's muses drest,</p>
<p>Lights the pale cheek and swells the generous breast;</p>
<p>When the pent heat expands the quickening soul,</p>
<p>And foremost in the race the wheels of genius roll."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As the general idea of these chapters has been a concatenation
of Links with the Past, I must say a word about
Lord Palmerston, who was born in 1784, entered Parliament
in 1807, and was still leading the House of Commons when
I first attended its debates. A man who, when turned
seventy, could speak from the "dusk of a summer evening
to the dawn of a summer morning" in defence of his
foreign policy, and carry the vindication of it by a majority
of 46, was certainly no common performer on the parliamentary
stage; and yet Lord Palmerston had very slender
claims to the title of an orator. His style was not only
devoid of ornament and rhetorical device, but it was slipshod
and untidy in the last degree. He eked out his
sentences with "hum" and "hah;" he cleared his throat,
and flourished his pocket-handkerchief, and sucked his
orange; he rounded his periods with "you know what I
mean" and "all that kind of thing," and seemed actually
to revel in an anti-climax&#8212;"I think the hon. member's
proposal an outrageous violation of constitutional propriety,
a daring departure from traditional policy, and, in short, a
great mistake." It taxed all the skill of the reporters'
gallery to trim his speeches into decent form; and yet no
one was listened to with keener interest, no one was so
much dreaded as an opponent, and no one ever approached
<a name="Page_126"></a>him in the art of putting a plausible face upon
a doubtful
policy and making the worse appear the better cause.
Palmerston's parliamentary success perfectly illustrates the
judgment of Demosthenes, that "it is not the orator's
language that matters, nor the tone of his voice; but what
matters is that he should have the same predilections as the
majority, and should entertain the same likes and dislikes
as his country." If those are the requisites of public
speaking, Palmerston was supreme.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous of all Links with the Past in the
matter of Parliamentary Oratory is obviously Mr. Gladstone.
Like the younger Pitt, he had a "premature and unnatural
dexterity in the combination of words." He was trained
under the immediate influence of Canning, who was his
father's friend. When he was sixteen his style was already
formed. I quote from the records of the Eton Debating
Society for 1826:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Thus much, sir, I have said, as conceiving myself bound
in fairness not to regard the names under which men have
hidden their designs so much as the designs themselves. I
am well aware that my prejudices and my predilections have
long been enlisted on the side of Toryism&#8212;(cheers)&#8212;and
that in a cause like this I am not likely to be influenced
unfairly against men bearing that name and professing to
act on the principles which I have always been accustomed
to revere. But the good of my country must stand on a
higher ground than distinctions like these. In common
fairness and in common candour, I feel myself compelled
to give my decisive verdict against the conduct of men
whose measures I firmly believe to have been hostile to
British interests, destructive of British glory, and subversive
of the splendid and, I trust, lasting fabric of the British
Constitution."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gladstone entered Parliament when he was not quite
twenty-three, at the General Election of 1832, and it is
<a name="Page_127"></a>evident from a perusal of his early speeches in
the House
of Commons, imperfectly reported in the third person, and
from contemporary evidence, that, when due allowance is
made for growth and development, his manner of oratory
was the same as it was in after-life. He was only too fluent.
His style was copious, redundant, and involved, and his
speeches were garnished, after the manner of his time, with
Horatian and Virgilian tags. His voice was always clear,
flexible, and musical, though his utterance was marked by
a Lancastrian "burr." His gesture was varied and animated,
though not violent. He turned his face and body from side
to side, and often wheeled right round to face his own party
as he appealed for their cheers.</p>
<p>"Did you ever feel nervous in public speaking?" asked the
late Lord Coleridge.</p>
<p>"In opening a subject, often," answered Mr. Gladstone;
"in reply, never."</p>
<p>It was a characteristic saying, for, in truth, he was a born
debater, never so happy as when coping on the spur of the
moment with the arguments and appeals which an opponent
had spent perhaps days in elaborating beforehand. Again,
in the art of elucidating figures he was unequalled. He
was the first Chancellor of the Exchequer who ever made
the Budget interesting. "He talked shop," it was said,
"like a tenth muse." He could apply all the resources of
a glowing rhetoric to the most prosaic questions of cost and
profit; could make beer romantic and sugar serious. He
could sweep the widest horizon of the financial future, and
yet stoop to bestow the minutest attention on the microcosm
of penny stamps and the monetary merits of half-farthings.
And yet, extraordinary as were these feats of intellectual
athletics, Mr. Gladstone's unapproached supremacy as an
orator was not really seen until he touched the moral
elements involved in some great political issue. Then,
indeed, he spoke like a prophet and a man inspired. His
<a name="Page_128"></a>whole physical formation seemed to become
"fusile" with
the fire of his ethical passion, and his eloquence flowed
like a stream of molten lava, carrying all before it in its
irresistible rush, glorious as well as terrible, and fertilizing
while it subdued. Mr. Gladstone's departure from the House
of Commons closed a splendid tradition, and Parliamentary
Oratory as our fathers understood it may now be reckoned
among the lost arts.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;">
<a name="XIII"></a>
<h2><a name="Page_129"></a>XIII.</h2>
<h2>CONVERSATION.</h2>
<p>We have agreed that Parliamentary Oratory, as our
fathers understood that phrase, is a lost art. Must
Conversation be included in the same category? To
answer with positiveness is difficult; but this much may
be readily conceded&#8212;that a belief in the decadence of
conversation is natural to those who have specially cultivated
Links with the Past; who grew up in the traditions of
Luttrell and Mackintosh, and Lord Alvanley and Samuel
Rogers; who have felt Sydney Smith's irresistible fun, and
known the overwhelming fullness of Lord Macaulay. It is
not unreasonable even in that later generation which can still
recall the frank but high-bred gaiety of the great Lord
Derby, the rollicking good-humour and animal spirits of
Bishop Wilberforce, the saturnine epigrams of Lord Beaconsfield,
the versatility and choice diction of Lord Houghton,
the many-sided yet concentrated malice which supplied the
stock in trade of Abraham Hayward. More recent losses
have been heavier still. Just ten years ago<a name="FNanchor_15"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> died Mr.
Matthew Arnold, who combined in singular harmony the
various elements which go to make good conversation&#8212;urbanity,
liveliness, quick sympathy, keen interest in the
world's works and ways, the happiest choice of words, and
a natural and never-failing humour, as genial as it was
<a name="Page_130"></a>pungent. It was his characteristic glory that he
knew how
to be a man of the world without being frivolous, and a
man of letters without being pedantic.</p>
<p>Eight years ago<a name="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
I was asked to discuss the Art of Conversation
in one of the monthly reviews, and I could then
illustrate it by such living instances as Lord Granville, Sir
Robert Peel, Lord Coleridge, Lord Bowen, Mr. Browning,
and Mr. Lowell. Each of those distinguished men had a
conversational gift which was peculiarly his own. Each
talked like himself, and like no one else; each made his
distinct and individual contribution to the social agreeableness
of London. If in now endeavouring to recall their
characteristic gifts I use words which I have used before,
my excuse must be that the contemporary record of a
personal impression cannot with advantage be retouched
after the lapse of years.</p>
<p>Lord Granville's most notable quality was a humorous
urbanity. As a story-teller he was unsurpassed. He had
been everywhere and had known every one. He was quick
to seize a point, and extraordinarily apt in anecdote and
illustration. His fine taste appreciated whatever was best
in life, in conversation, in literature, even when (as in his
selection of the preface to the Sanctus as his favourite piece
of English prose) it was gathered from fields in which he
had not habitually roamed. A man whose career had been
so full of vivid and varied interests must often have felt
acutely bored by the trivial round of social conversation.
But if he could not rise&#8212;who can?&#8212;to the apostolic virtue
of suffering bores gladly, at any rate he endured their
onslaughts as unflinchingly as he stood the gout. A smiling
countenance and an unfailing courtesy concealed the
torment which was none the less keen because it was unexpressed.
He could always feel, or at least could show,
a gracious interest in what interested his company, and he
<a name="Page_131"></a>possessed in supreme perfection the happy knack
of putting
those to whom he spoke in good conceit with themselves.</p>
<p>The late Sir Robert Peel was, both mentally and
physically, one of the most picturesque figures in society.
Alike in his character and in his aspect the Creole blood
which he had inherited from his maternal descent triumphed
over the robust and serviceable commonplace which was
the characteristic quality of the Peels. Lord Beaconsfield
described "a still gallant figure, scrupulously attired; a
blue frock coat, with a ribboned button-hole; a well-turned
boot; hat a little too hidalgoish, but quite new. There
was something respectable and substantial about him, notwithstanding
his moustaches and a carriage too debonair
for his years." The description, for whomsoever intended,
is a lifelike portrait of Sir Robert Peel. His most salient
feature as a talker was his lovely voice&#8212;deep, flexible,
melodious. Mr. Gladstone&#8212;no mean judge of such matters&#8212;pronounced
it the finest organ he ever heard in
Parliament; but with all due submission to so high an
authority, I should have said that it was a voice better
adapted to the drawing-room than to the House of Commons.
In a large space a higher note and a clearer tone tell better,
but in the close quarters of social intercourse one appreciates
the sympathetic qualities of a rich baritone. And Sir
Robert's voice, admirable in itself, was the vehicle of conversation
quite worthy of it. He could talk of art and
sport, and politics and books; he had a great memory,
varied information, lively interest in the world and its
doings, and a full-bodied humour which recalled the social
tone of the Eighteenth century.</p>
<p>His vein of personal raillery was rather robust than
refined. Nothing has been heard in our time quite like
his criticism of Sir Edgar Boehm in the House of Commons,
or his joke about Mr. Justice Chitty at the election for
Oxford in 1880. But his humour (to quote his own words)
"<a name="Page_132"></a>had an English ring," and much must be pardoned
to a
man who, in this portentous age of reticence and pose, was
wholly free from solemnity, and when he heard or saw
what was ludicrous was not afraid to laugh at it. Sir
Robert Peel was an excellent hand at what our fathers
called banter and we call chaff. A prig or a pedant was
his favourite butt, and the performance was rendered all
the more effective by his elaborate assumption of the
<i>grand seigneur's</i> manner. The victim was dimly conscious
that he was being laughed at, but comically uncertain about
the best means of reprisal. Sydney Smith described Sir
James Mackintosh as "abating and dissolving pompous
gentlemen with the most successful ridicule." Whoever
performs that process is a social benefactor, and the
greatest master of it whom I have ever known was Sir
Robert Peel.</p>
<p>The Judges live so entirely in their own narrow and
rather technical circle that their social abilities are lost to
the world. It is a pity, for several of them are men well
fitted by their talents and accomplishments to take a
leading part in society. The late Lord Coleridge was pre-eminently
a case in point. Personally, I had an almost
fanatical admiration for his genius, and in many of the
qualities which make an agreeable talker he was unsurpassed.
Every one who ever heard him at the Bar or on the Bench
must recall that silvery voice and that perfect elocution
which prompted a competent judge of such matters to say:
"I should enjoy listening to Coleridge even if he only read
out a page of <i>Bradshaw</i>." To these gifts were added an
immense store of varied knowledge, a genuine enthusiasm
for whatever is beautiful in literature or art, an inexhaustible
copiousness of anecdote, and a happy knack of exact yet
not offensive mimicry. It is always pleasant to see a man
in great station, who, in the intercourse of society, is
perfectly untrammelled by pomp and form, can make a
<a name="Page_133"></a>joke and enjoy it, and is not too cautious to
garnish his
conversation with personalities or to season it with sarcasm.
Perhaps Lord Coleridge's gibes were a little out of place
on "The Royal Bench of British Themis," but at a dinner-table
they were delightful, and they derived a double zest
from the exquisite precision and finish of the English in
which they were conveyed.</p>
<p>Another judge who excelled in conversation was the late
Lord Bowen. Those who knew him intimately would say
that he was the best talker in London. In spite of the
burden of learning which he carried and his marvellous
rapidity and grasp of mind, his social demeanour was quiet
and unobtrusive almost to the point of affectation. His
manner was singularly suave and winning, and his smile
resembled that of the much-quoted Chinaman who played
but did not understand the game of euchre. This singular
gentleness of speech gave a special piquancy to his keen
and delicate satire, his readiness in repartee, and his subtle
irony. No one ever met Lord Bowen without wishing to
meet him again; no one ever made his acquaintance without
desiring his friendship. Sir Henry Cunningham's
memoir of him only illustrated afresh the impossibility of
transplanting to the printed page the rarefied humour of
so delicate a spirit. Let me make just one attempt. Of
a brother judge he said: "To go to the Court of Appeal
with a judgment of--- 's in your favour, is like going to
sea on a Friday. It is not necessarily fatal; but <i>one would
rather it had not happened</i>." Had Bowen been more
widely known, the traditions of his table-talk would probably
have taken their place with the best recollections of English
conversation. His admirers can only regret that gifts so
rich and so rare should have been buried in judicial dining-rooms
or squandered on the dismal orgies of the Cosmopolitan
Club, where dull men sit round a meagre fire, in a
large, draughty, and half-lit room, drinking lemon-squash
<a name="Page_134"></a>and talking for talking's sake&#8212;the most
melancholy of
occupations.</p>
<p>The society of London between 1870 and 1890 contained
no more striking or interesting figure than that of Robert
Browning. No one meeting him for the first time and
unfurnished with a clue would have guessed his vocation.
He might have been a diplomatist, a statesman, a discoverer,
or a man of science. But whatever was his calling, one felt
sure that it must be something essentially practical. Of
the disordered appearance, the unconventional demeanour,
the rapt and mystic air which we assume to be characteristic
of the poet he had absolutely none. And his conversation
corresponded to his appearance. It abounded in vigour,
in fire, in vivacity. It was genuinely interesting, and often
strikingly eloquent, yet all the time it was entirely free
from mystery, vagueness, and jargon. It was the crisp,
emphatic, and powerful discourse of a man of the world
who was incomparably better informed than the mass of
his congeners. Mr. Browning was the readiest, the blithest,
and the most forcible of talkers, and when he dealt in
criticism the edge of his sword was mercilessly whetted
against pretension and vanity. The inflection of his voice,
the flash of his eye, the pose of his head, the action of his
hand, all lent their special emphasis to the condemnation.
"I like religion to be treated seriously," he exclaimed with
reference to a theological novel of great renown, "and I
don't want to know what this curate or that curate thought
about it. <i>No, I don't.</i>" Surely the secret thoughts of
many hearts found utterance in that emphatic cry.</p>
<p>Here I must venture to insert a personal reminiscence.
Mr. Browning had honoured me with his company at dinner,
and an unduly fervent admirer had button-holed him
throughout a long evening, plying him with questions about
what he meant by this line, and whom he intended by that
character. It was more than flesh and blood could stand,
<a name="Page_135"></a>and at last the master extricated himself from
the grasp of
the disciple, exclaiming with the most airy grace, "But,
my dear fellow, this is too bad. <i>I</i> am monopolizing <i>you</i>."
Now and then, at rather rare intervals, when time and place,
and company and surroundings, were altogether suitable,
Mr. Browning would consent to appear in his true character
and to delight his hearers by speaking of his art. Then
the higher and rarer qualities of his genius came into play.
He kindled with responsive fire at a beautiful thought, and
burned with contagious enthusiasm over a phrase which
struck his fancy. Yet all the while the poetic rapture was
underlain by a groundwork of robust sense. Rant, and
gush, and affectation were abhorrent to his nature, and
even in his grandest flights of fancy he was always intelligible.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Lowell must certainly be reckoned among
the famous talkers of his time. During the years that he
represented the United States in London his trim sentences,
his airy omniscience, his minute and circumstantial way of
laying down literary law, were the inevitable ornaments of
serious dinners and cultured tea-tables. My first encounter
with Mr. Lowell took place many years before he entered
on his diplomatic career. It was in 1872, when I chanced
to meet him in a company of tourists at Durham Castle.
Though I was a devotee of the <i>Biglow Papers</i>, I did not
know their distinguished author even by sight; and I was
intensely amused by the air of easy mastery, the calm and
almost fatherly patronage, with which this cultivated
American overrode the indignant showwoman; pointed
out, for the general benefit of the admiring tourists, the
gaps and lapses in her artistic, architectural, and archaeological
knowledge; and made mullion and portcullis, and
armour and tapestry the pegs for a series of neat discourses
on mediaeval history, domestic decoration, and the science
of fortification.</p>
<p><a name="Page_136"></a>Which things are an allegory. We, as a
nation, take
this calm assurance of foreigners at its own valuation. We
consent to be told that we do not know our own poets,
cannot pronounce our own language, and have no well-educated
women. But after a time this process palls.
We question the divine right of the superiority thus imposed
on us. We ask on what foundation these high
claims rest, and we discover all at once that we have paid
a great deal of deference where very little was deserved.
By processes such as these I came to find, in years long
subsequent to the encounter at Durham, that Mr. Lowell,
though an accomplished politician, a brilliant writer, and
an admirable after-dinner speaker, was, conversationally
considered, an inaccurate man with an accurate manner.
But, after all, inaccuracy is by no means the worst of
conversational faults, and when he was in the vein Mr.
Lowell could be exceedingly good company. He liked
talking, and talked not only much but very well. He had
a genuine vein of wit and great dexterity in phrase-making;
and on due occasion would produce from the rich stores
of his own experience some of the most vivid and striking
incidents, both civil and military, of that tremendous
struggle for human freedom with which his name and
fame must be always and most honourably associated.<br>

<h2>CONVERSATION&#8212;<i>continued</i>.</h2>
<p>Brave men have lived since as well as before
Agamemnon, and those who know the present society
of London may not unreasonably ask whether, even granting
the heavy losses which I enumerated in my last
chapter, the Art of Conversation is really extinct. Are
the talkers of to-day in truth so immeasurably inferior to
the great men who preceded them? Before we can answer
these questions, even tentatively, we must try to define
our idea of good conversation, and this can best be done
by rigidly ruling out what is bad. To begin with, all
affectation, unreality, and straining aftereffect are intolerable;
scarcely less so are rhetoric, declamation, and whatever
tends towards speech-making. Mimicry is a very
dangerous trick, rare in perfection, and contemptible when
imperfect. An apt story well told is delicious, but there
was sound philosophy in Mr. Pinto's view that "when a
man fell into his anecdotage it was a sign for him to retire
from the world." One touch of ill-nature makes the whole
world kin, and a spice of malice tickles the intellectual
palate; but a conversation which is mainly malicious is
entirely dull. Constant joking is a weariness to the flesh;
but, on the other hand, a sustained seriousness of discourse
is fatally apt to recall the conversation between the Hon.
Elijah Pogram and the Three Literary Ladies&#8212;"How
Pogram got out of his depth instantly, and how the Three
<a name="Page_138"></a>L.L.'s were never in theirs, is a piece of
history not worth
recording. Suffice it that, being all four out of their depths
and all unable to swim, they splashed up words in all
directions, and floundered about famously. On the whole,
it was considered to have been the severest mental exercise
ever heard in the National Hotel, and the whole company
observed that their heads ached with the effort&#8212;as well
they might."</p>
<p>A talker who monopolizes the conversation is by common
consent insufferable, and a man who regulates his choice
of topics by reference to what interests not his hearers but
himself has yet to learn the alphabet of the art. Conversation
is like lawn-tennis, and requires alacrity in return at
least as much as vigour in service. A happy phrase, an
unexpected collocation of words, a habitual precision in
the choice of terms, are rare and shining ornaments of
conversation, but they do not for an instant supply the
place of lively and interesting matter, and an excessive
care for them is apt to tell unfavourably on the substance
of discourse.</p>
<p>"I might as well attempt to gather up the foam of the
sea as to convey an idea of the extraordinary language in
which he clothed his description. There were at least
five words in every sentence that must have been very
much astonished at the use they were put to, and yet no
others apparently could so well have expressed his idea.
He talked like a racehorse approaching the winning-post&#8212;every
muscle in action, and the utmost energy of expression
flung out into every burst." This is a contemporary
description of Lord Beaconsfield's conversation in those
distant days when, as a young man about town, he was
talking and dressing his way into social fame. Though
written in admiration, it seems to me to describe the most
intolerable performance that could ever have afflicted
society. <i>He talked like a racehorse approaching the winning-<a
 name="Page_139"></a>post</i>.
Could the wit of man devise a more appalling
image?</p>
<p>Mr. Matthew Arnold once said to me: "People think
that I can teach them style. What stuff it all is! Have
something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That
is the only secret of style." This dictum applies, I think,
at least as well to conversation as to literature. The one
thing needful is to have something to say. The way of
saying it may best be left to take care of itself. A young
man about town once remarked to me, in the tone of one
who utters an accepted truism: "It is so much more
interesting to talk about people than things." The sentiment
was highly characteristic of the mental calibre and
associations of the speaker; and certainly the habitual
talk&#8212;for it is not conversation&#8212;of that section of society
which calls itself "smart" seems to touch the lowest depth
of spiteful and sordid dullness. But still, when the
mischiefs of habitual personality have been admitted to
the uttermost, there remains something to be said on the
other side. We are not inhabitants of Jupiter or Saturn,
but human beings to whom nothing that is human is
wholly alien. And if in the pursuit of high abstractions
and improving themes we imitate too closely Wordsworth's
avoidance of Personal Talk, our dinner-table will run much
risk of becoming as dull as that poet's own fireside.</p>
<p>Granting, then, that to have something to say which is
worth hearing is the substance of good conversation, we
must reckon among its accidents and ornaments a manner
which knows how to be easy and free without being free-and-easy;
a habitual deference to the tastes and even the
prejudices of other people; a hearty desire to be, or at least
to seem, interested in their concerns; and a constant
recollection that even the most patient hearers may sometimes
wish to be speakers. Above all else, the agreeable
talker cultivates gentleness and delicacy of speech, avoids
<a name="Page_140"></a>aggressive and overwhelming displays, and
remembers the
tortured cry of the neurotic bard:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Vociferated logic kills me quite;</p>
<p>A noisy man is always in the right&#8212;</p>
<p>I twirl my thumbs, fall back into my chair,</p>
<p>Fix on the wainscot a distressful stare;</p>
<p>And when I hope his blunders all are out,</p>
<p>Reply discreetly, 'To be sure&#8212;no doubt!'"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If these, or something like these, are the attributes of
good conversation, in whom do we find them best exemplified?
Who best understands the Art of Conversation?
Who, in a word, are our best talkers? I hope that I shall
not be considered ungallant if I say nothing about the part
borne in conversation by ladies. Really it is a sacred awe
that makes me mute. London is happy in possessing not
a few hostesses, excellently accomplished, and not more
accomplished than gracious, of whom it is no flattery to say
that to know them is a liberal education. But, as Lord
Beaconsfield observes in a more than usually grotesque
passage of <i>Lothair</i>, "We must not profane the mysteries
of Bona Dea." We will not "peep and botanize" on
sacred soil, nor submit our most refined delights to the
impertinences of critical analysis.</p>
<p>In considering the Art of Conversation I obey a natural
instinct when I think first of Mr. Charles Villiers, M.P.
His venerable age alone would entitle him to this pre-eminence,
for he was born in 1802, and was for seventy
years one of the best talkers in London. Born of a family
which combined high rank with intellectual distinction, his
parentage was a passport to all that was best in social and
political life. It argues no political bias to maintain that in
the first quarter of the nineteenth century Toryism afforded
its neophytes no educational opportunities equal to those
which a young Whig enjoyed at Bowood and Panshanger
and Holland House. There the best traditions of the
<a name="Page_141"></a>previous century were constantly reinforced by
accessions of
fresh intellect. The charmed circle was indeed essentially,
but it was not exclusively, aristocratic; genius held the key,
and there was a <i>carri&egrave;re ouverte aux talents</i>.</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass that the society of Lord Lansdowne
and Lord Holland and Lord Melbourne was also the society
of Brougham and Mackintosh, and Macaulay and Sydney
Smith. It presented every variety of accomplishment and
experience and social charm, and offered to a man beginning
life the best conceivable education in the art of making
oneself agreeable. For that art Mr. Villiers had a natural
genius, and his lifelong association with the Whigs superadded
a technical training in it. But this, though much,
was by no means all. I hold it to be an axiom that a man
who is only a member of society can never be so agreeable
as one who is something else as well. And Mr. Villiers,
though "a man about town," a story-teller, and a diner-out
of high renown, has had seventy years' experience of practical
business and Parliamentary life. Thus the resources of his
knowledge have been perpetually enlarged, and, learning
much, he has forgotten nothing. The stores of his memory
are full of treasures new and old. He has taken part in the
making of history, and can estimate the great men of
the present day by a comparison with the political
immortals.</p>
<p>That this comparison is not always favourable to some
exalted reputations of the present hour is indeed sufficiently
notorious to all who have the pleasure of Mr. Villiers's
acquaintance; and nowhere is his mastery of the art of
conversation more conspicuous than in his knack of implying
dislike and insinuating contempt without crude abuse
or noisy denunciation. He has a delicate sense of fun,
a keen eye for incongruities and absurdities, and that
genuine cynicism which springs, not from the poor desire
to be thought worldly-wise, but from a lifelong acquaintance
<a name="Page_142"></a>with the foibles of political men. To these
gifts must be
added a voice which age has not robbed of its sympathetic
qualities, a style of diction and a habit of pronunciation
which belong to the eighteenth century, and that formal yet
facile courtesy which no one less than eighty years old
seems capable of even imitating.</p>
<p>I have instanced Mr. Villiers as an eminent talker. I
now turn to an eminent man who talks&#8212;Mr. Gladstone.<a name="FNanchor_17"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> An absurd story has long been
current among credulous
people with rampant prejudices that Mr. Gladstone was
habitually uncivil to the Queen. Now, it happens that
Mr. Gladstone is the most courteous of mankind. His
courtesy is one of his most engaging gifts, and accounts in
no small degree for his power of attracting the regard of
young men and undistinguished people generally. To
all such he is polite to the point of deference, yet never
condescending. His manners to all alike&#8212;young and old,
rich and poor&#8212;are the ceremonious manners of the old
school, and his demeanour towards ladies is a model of
chivalrous propriety. It would therefore have been to the
last degree improbable that he should make a departure
from his usual habits in the case of a lady who was also his
Sovereign. And, as a matter of fact, the story is so
ridiculously wide of the mark that it deserves mention only
because, in itself false, it is founded on a truth. "I," said
the Duke of Wellington on a memorable occasion, "have
no small talk, and Peel has no manners." Mr. Gladstone
has manners but no small talk. He is so consumed by
zeal for great subjects that he leaves out of account the
possibility that they may not interest other people. He
pays to every one, and not least to ladies, the compliment
of assuming that they are on his own intellectual level,
<a name="Page_143"></a>engrossed in the subjects which engross him, and
furnished
with at least as much information as will enable them to
follow and to understand him. Hence the genesis of that
absurd story about his demeanour to the Queen.</p>
<p>"He speaks to Me as if I was a public meeting," is a
complaint which is said to have proceeded from illustrious
lips. That most successful of all courtiers, the astute Lord
Beaconsfield, used to engage her Majesty in conversation
about water-colour drawing and the third-cousinships of
German princes. Mr. Gladstone harangues her about the
polity of the Hittites, or the harmony between the Athanasian
Creed and Homer. The Queen, perplexed and uncomfortable,
tries to make a digression&#8212;addresses a remark to a
daughter or proffers biscuit to a begging terrier. Mr.
Gladstone restrains himself with an effort till the Princess
has answered or the dog has sat down, and then promptly
resumes: "I was about to say&#8212;" Meanwhile the flood
has gathered force by delay, and when it bursts forth again
it carries all before it.</p>
<p>No image except that of a flood can convey the notion
of Mr. Gladstone's table-talk on a subject which interests
him keenly&#8212;its rapidity, its volume, its splash and dash, its
frequent beauty, its striking effects, the amount of varied
matter which it brings with it, the hopelessness of trying to
withstand it, the unexpectedness of its onrush, the subdued
but fertilized condition of the subjected area over which it
has passed. The bare mention of a topic which interests
Mr. Gladstone opens the floodgates and submerges a province.
But the torrent does not wait for the invitation.
If not invited it comes of its own accord; headlong, overwhelming,
sweeping all before it, and gathering fresh force
from every obstacle which it encounters on its course.
Such is Mr. Gladstone's table-talk. For conversation, strictly
so called, he has no turn. He asks questions when he
wants information, and answers them copiously when asked
<a name="Page_144"></a>by others. But of give-and-take, of meeting you
half-way,
of paying you back in your own conversational coin, he has
little notion. He discourses, he lectures, he harangues.
But if a subject is started which does not interest him it
falls flat. He makes no attempt to return the ball. Although,
when he is amused, his amusement is intense and
long sustained, his sense of humour is highly capricious.
It is impossible for even his most intimate friends to guess
beforehand what will amuse him and what will not; and he
has a most disconcerting habit of taking a comic story in
grim earnest, and arguing some farcical fantasy as if it was
a serious proposition of law or logic. Nothing funnier can
be imagined than the discomfiture of a story-teller who has
fondly thought to tickle the great man's fancy by an anecdote
which depends for its point upon some trait of baseness,
cynicism, or sharp practice. He finds his tale received in
dead silence, looks up wonderingly for an explanation, and
finds that what was intended to amuse has only disgusted.
Mr. Browning once told Mr. Gladstone a highly characteristic
story of Disraelitish duplicity, and for all reply heard a
voice choked with indignation:&#8212;"Do you call that amusing,
Browning? <i>I call it devilish</i>."<a name="FNanchor_18"></a><a

<h2>CONVERSATION&#8212;<i>continued</i>.</h2>
<p>More than thirty years have passed since the festive
evening described by Sir George Trevelyan in <i>The
Ladies in Parliament</i>:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When, over the port of the innermost bin,</p>

<p>The sole survivor of that brilliant group now<a name="FNanchor_19"></a><a

Opposition; but at the time when the lines were written
he had not yet entered the House of Commons. As a
youth of twenty-five he had astonished the political world
by his anonymous letters on <i>The Morality of Public Men</i>,
in which he denounced, in the style of Junius, the Protectionist
revival of 1852. He had fought a plucky but
unsuccessful fight at Kirkcaldy; was making his five
thousand a year at the Parliamentary Bar; had taught
the world international law over the signature of "Historicus,"
and was already, what he is still, one of the most
conspicuous and interesting figures in the society of
London. Of Sir William Harcourt's political alliances this
is not the place nor am I the person to treat:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian:</p>
<p>We are but mortals, and must sing of Man."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_146"></a>My theme is not Sir William Harcourt the
politician, but
Sir William Harcourt the man, the member of society&#8212;above
all, the talker. And, although I have thus deliberately
put politics on one side, it is strictly relevant to my purpose
to observe that Sir William is essentially and typically a
Whig. For Whiggery, rightly understood, is not a political
creed but a social caste. The Whig, like the poet, is born,
not made. It is as difficult to become a Whig as to become
a Jew. Macaulay was probably the only man who, being
born outside the privileged enclosure, ever penetrated to its
heart and assimilated its spirit. The Whigs, indeed, as a
body have held certain opinions and pursued certain
tactics which have been analyzed in chapters XIX. and XXI.
of the unexpurgated <i>Book of Snobs</i>. But those opinions
and those tactics have been mere accidents, though perhaps
inseparable accidents, of Whiggery. Its substance has
been relationship.</p>
<p>When Lord John Russell formed his first Administration
his opponents alleged that it was mainly composed of his
cousins, and one of his younger brothers was charged with
the impossible task of rebutting the accusation in a public
speech. Mr. Beresford-Hope, in one of his novels, made
excellent fun of what he called "the sacred circle of the
Great-Grandmotherhood." He showed&#8212;what, indeed, the
Whigs themselves knew uncommonly well&#8212;that from a
certain Earl Gower, who flourished in the eighteenth
century, and was great-great-great-grandfather of the present
Duke of Sutherland, are descended all the Levesons,<a name="FNanchor_20"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Gowers, Howards, Cavendishes,
Grosvenors, Russells, and
Harcourts, who walk on the face of the earth. Truly a
noble and a highly favoured progeny. "They <i>are</i> our
superiors," said Thackeray; "and that's the fact. I am
not a Whig myself (perhaps it is as unnecessary to say so as
to say I'm not King Pippin in a golden coach, or King
<a name="Page_147"></a>Hudson, or Miss Burdett-Coutts). I'm not a Whig;
but
oh, how I should like to be one!"</p>
<p>From this illustrious stock Sir William Harcourt is
descended through his grandmother, Lady Anne Harcourt
&#8212;born Leveson-Gower, and wife of the last Prince-Archbishop
of York (whom, by the way, Sir William strikingly
resembles both in figure and in feature). When one meets
Sir William Harcourt for the first time in society, perhaps
one is first struck by the fact that he is in aspect and
bearing a great gentleman of the old school, and then that
he is an admirable talker. He is a true Whig in culture as
well as in blood. Though his conversation is never pedantic,
it rests on a wide and strong basis of generous learning.
Even those who most cordially admire his political ability
do not always remember that he is an excellent scholar, and
graduated as eighth in the First Class of the Classical
Tripos in the year when Bishop Lightfoot was Senior
Classic. He has the <i>Corpus Poetarum</i> and Shakespeare
and Pope at his finger-ends, and his intimate acquaintance
with the political history of England elicited a characteristic
compliment from Lord Beaconsfield. It is his favourite
boast that in all his tastes, sentiments, and mental habits
he belongs to the eighteenth century, which he glorifies as
the golden age of reason, patriotism, and liberal learning.
This self-estimate strikes me as perfectly sound, and it
requires a very slight effort of the imagination to conceive
this well-born young Templar wielding his doughty pen in
the Bangorian Controversy, or declaiming on the hustings
for Wilkes and Liberty; bandying witticisms with Sheridan,
and capping Latin verses with Charles Fox; or helping to
rule England as a member of that "Venetian Oligarchy"
on which Lord Beaconsfield lavished all the vials of his
sarcasm. In truth, it is not fanciful to say that whatever
was best in the eighteenth century&#8212;its robust common
sense, its racy humour, its thorough and unaffected learning,
<a name="Page_148"></a>its ceremonious courtesy for great occasions,
its jolly self-abandonment
in social intercourse&#8212;is exhibited in the
demeanour and conversation of Sir William Harcourt. He
is an admirable host, and, to borrow a phrase from Sydney
Smith, "receives his friends with that honest joy which
warms more than dinner or wine." As a guest, he is a
splendid acquisition, always ready to amuse and to be
amused, delighting in the rapid cut-and-thrust of personal
banter, and bringing out of his treasure things new and
old for the amusement and the benefit of a later and less
instructed generation.</p>
<p>Extracts from the private conversation of living people, as
a rule, I forbear; but some of Sir William's quotations are
so extraordinarily apt that they deserve a permanent place
in the annals of table-talk. That fine old country gentleman,
the late Lord Knightley (who was the living double of
Dickens's Sir Leicester Dedlock), had been expatiating
after dinner on the undoubted glories of his famous pedigree.
The company was getting a little restive under the recitation,
when Sir William was heard to say, in an appreciative
aside, "This reminds me of Addison's evening hymn&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'And Knightley to the listening earth</p>
<p>Repeats the story of his birth.'"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Surely the force of apt citation can no further go. When
Lord Tennyson chanced to say in Sir William Harcourt's
hearing that his pipe after breakfast was the most enjoyable
of the day, Sir William softly murmured the Tennysonian
line&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some historians say that he substituted "bards" for
"birds," and the reception accorded by the poet to the
parody was not as cordial as its excellence deserved.</p>
<p>Another capital talker is Sir George Trevelyan. He has
<a name="Page_149"></a>been, from the necessities of his position, a
man of the
world and a politician, and he is as ready as Mr. Bertie-Tremaine's
guests in <i>Endymion</i> to talk of "that heinous
subject on which enormous fibs are ever told&#8212;the
Registration." But, after all, the man of the world and the
politician are only respectable parts which he had been
bound to assume, and he has played them&#8212;with assiduity
and success: but the true man in Sir George Trevelyan is
the man of letters. Whenever he touches a historical or
literary theme his whole being seems to undergo a transformation.
The real nature flashes out through his twinkling
eyes. While he muses the fire burns, and, like the Psalmist,
he speaks with his tongue. Dates and details, facts and
traditions, cantos and poetry, reams of prose, English and
Latin and Greek and French, come tumbling out in headlong
but not disorderly array. He jumps at an opening,
seizes an illusion, replies with lightning quickness
to a conversational challenge, and is ready at a moment's
notice to decide any literary or historical controversy in a
measured tone of deliberate emphasis which is not wholly
free from exaggeration. Like his uncle Lord Macaulay, Sir
George Trevelyan has "his own heightened and telling way
of putting things," and those who know him well make
allowance for this habit. For the rest, he is delightful
company, light-hearted as a boy, full of autobiographical
chit-chat about Harrow and Trinity, and India and Holly
Lodge, eagerly interested in his friends' concerns, brimming
over with enthusiasm, never bored, never flat, never stale.
A well-concerted party is a kind of unconscious conspiracy
to promote cheerfulness and enjoyment, and in such an
undertaking there can be no more serviceable ally than Sir
George Trevelyan.</p>
<p>Mr. John Morley's agreeableness in conversation is of a
different kind. His leading characteristic is a dignified
austerity of demeanour which repels familiarity and tends
<a name="Page_150"></a>to keep conversation on a high level; but each
time one
meets him there is less formality and less restraint, and the
grave courtesy which never fails is soon touched with
friendliness and frank good-humour in a singularly attractive
fashion. He talks, not much, but remarkably well. His
sentences are deliberate, clear-cut, often eloquent. He
excels in phrase-making. His quotations are apt and
novel. His fine taste and varied reading enable him to
hold his own in many fields where the merely professional
politician is apt to be terribly astray. His kindness to
social and literary beginners is one of his most engaging
traits. He invariably finds something pleasant to say about
the most immature and unpromising efforts, and he has the
knack of so handling his own early experience as to make
it an encouragement and a stimulus, and not (as the
manner of some is) a burden and a bogey. Mr. Morley
never obtrudes his own opinions, never introduces debatable
matter, never dogmatizes. But he is always ready to pick
up the gauntlet, especially if a Tory flings it down; is
merciless towards ill-formed assertion, and is the alert and
unsparing enemy of what Mr. Ruskin calls "the obscene
empires of Mammon and Belial."</p>
<p>Lord Salisbury goes so little into general society that his
qualities as a talker are not familiarly known. He is painfully
shy, and at a club or in a large party undergoes the
torments of the lost. Yet no one can listen, even casually,
to his conversation without appreciating the fine manner,
full both of dignity and of courtesy; the utter freedom
from pomposity, formality, and self-assertion, and the
agreeable dash of genuine cynicism, which modifies,
though it does not mask, the flavour of his fun. After a
visit to Hatfield in 1868, Bishop Wilberforce wrote in his
diary: "Gladstone how struck with Salisbury: 'Never saw
a more perfect host.'" And again&#8212;"He remarked to me
on the great power of charming and pleasant hosting
<a name="Page_151"></a>possessed by Salisbury." And it is the universal
testimony
of Lord Salisbury's guests, whether at Hatfield or in Arlington
Street, that he is seen at his very best in his own house.
The combination of such genuine amiability in private life
with such calculated brutality in public utterance constitutes
a psychological problem which might profitably be made
the subject of a Romanes Lecture.</p>
<p>Barring the shyness, from which Mr. Balfour is conspicuously
free, there is something of Lord Salisbury's social
manner about his accomplished nephew. He has the same
courtesy, the same sense of humour, the same freedom
from official solemnity. But the characteristics of the elder
man are exaggerated in the younger. The cynicism which
is natural in Lord Salisbury is affected in Mr. Balfour. He
cultivates the art of indifference, and gives himself the airs
of a jaded Epicurean who craves only for a new sensation.
There is what an Irish Member, in a moment of inspiration,
called a "toploftiness" about his social demeanour which
is not a little irritating. He is too anxious to show that he
is not as other men are. Among politicians he is a
philosopher; among philosophers, a politician. Before
that hard-bitten crew whom Burke ridiculed&#8212;the "calculators
and economists"&#8212;he will talk airily of golf and
ladies' fashions; and ladies he will seek to impress by the
Praise of Vivisection or the Defence of Philosophic Doubt.
His social agreeableness has, indeed, been marred by the
fatuous idolatry of a fashionable clique, stimulating the
self-consciousness
which was his natural foible; but when he
can for a moment forget himself he still is excellent company,
for he is genuinely amiable and thoroughly well
informed.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_152"></a>XVI.</h2>
<h2>CONVERSATION&#8212;<i>continued</i>.</h2>
<p>The writer of these chapters has always felt some inward
affinity to the character of Lord St. Jerome in <i>Lothair</i>,
of whom it is recorded that he loved conversation, though
he never conversed. "There must be an audience," he
would say, "and I am the audience." In my capacity of
audience I assign a high place to the agreeableness of Lord
Rosebery's conversation. To begin with, he has a delightful
voice. It is low, but perfectly distinct, rich and sympathetic
in quality, and singularly refined in accent. It is
exactly the sort of voice which bespeaks the goodwill of the
hearer and recommends what it utters. In a former chapter
we agreed that the chief requisite of good conversation is to
have something to say which is worth saying, and here Lord
Rosebery is excellently equipped. Last week the newspapers
announced with a flourish of rhetorical trumpets that he had
just celebrated his fiftieth birthday.<a name="FNanchor_21"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Some of the trumpeters,
with a laudable intention to be civil, cried, "Is it possible
that he can be so old?" Others, with subtler art, professed
themselves unable to believe that he was so young. Each
compliment contained its element of truth. In appearance,
air, and tastes Lord Rosebery is still young. In experience,
knowledge, and conduct he is already old. He has had a
vivid and a varied experience. He is equally at home on
<a name="Page_153"></a>Epsom Downs and in the House of Lords. His life
has
been full of action, incident, and interest. He has not only
collected books, but has read them; and has found time,
even amid the engrossing demands of the London County
Council, the Turf, and the Foreign Office, not only for study,
but&#8212;what is much more remarkable&#8212;for thought.</p>
<p>So far, then, as substance goes, his conversation is (to use
Mr. Gladstone's quaint phrase) "as full of infinitely varied
matter as an egg is full of meat;" and in its accidents and
ornaments it complies exactly with the conditions laid down
in a former chapter&#8212;a manner which knows how to be easy
and free without being free-and-easy; habitual deference to
the tastes and prejudices of other people; a courteous desire
to be, or at least to seem, interested in their concerns; and
a recollection that even the most patient hearers (among
whom the present writer reckons himself) may sometimes
wish to be speakers. To these gifts he adds a keen sense of
humour, a habit of close observation, and a sub-acid vein of
sarcasm which resembles the dash of Tarragon in a successful
salad. In a word, Lord Rosebery is one of the most
agreeable talkers of the day; and even if it is true that
<i>il s'&eacute;coute quand il parle</i>, his friends may reply that it
would
be strange indeed if one could help listening to what is always
so agreeable and often so brilliant.</p>
<p>A genial journalist recently said that Mr. Goschen was
now chiefly remembered by the fact that he had once had Sir
Alfred Milner for his Private Secretary. But whatever may
be thought of the First Lord of the Admiralty as a politician
and an administrator, I claim for him a high place among
agreeable talkers. There are some men who habitually use
the same style of speech in public and in private life.
Happily for his friends, this is not the case with Mr. Goschen.
Nothing can be less agreeable than his public style, whether
on the platform or in the House of Commons. Its tawdry
staginess, its "Sadler's Wells sarcasm," its constant striving
<a name="Page_154"></a>after strong effects, are distressing to good
taste. But in
private life he is another and a much more agreeable man.
He is courteous, genial, perfectly free from affectation, and
enters into the discussion of social banalities as eagerly and
as brightly as if he had never converted the Three per Cents,
or established the ratio between dead millionaires and new
ironclads. His easiness in conversation is perhaps a little
marred by a Teutonic tendency to excessive analysis which
will not suffer him to rest until he has resolved every subject
and almost every phrase into its primary elements. But this
philosophic temperament has its counterbalancing advantages
in a genuine openness of mind, willingness to weigh and
measure opposing views, and inaccessibility to intellectual
passion. It is true that on the platform the exigencies of
his position compel him to indulge in mock-heroics and cut
rhetorical capers for which Nature never designed him; but
these are for public consumption only, and when he is not
playing to the gallery he can discuss his political opponents
and their sayings and doings as dispassionately as a microscopist
examines a black-beetle. Himself a good talker, Mr.
Goschen encourages good talk in other people; and in old
days, when the Art of Conversation was still seriously cultivated,
he used to gather round his table in Portland Place a
group of intimate friends who drank '34 port and conversed
accordingly. Among these were Lord Sherbrooke, whose
aptness in quotation and dexterity in repartee have never, in
my experience, been surpassed; and Lord Chief Justice
Cockburn, whose "sunny face and voice of music, which
lent melody to scorn and sometimes reached the depth of
pathos," were gracefully commemorated by Lord Beaconsfield
in his sketch of Hortensius. But this belongs to
ancient history, and my business is with the conversation of
to-day.</p>
<p>Very distinctly of to-day is the conversation of Mr.
Labouchere. Even our country cousins are aware that the
<a name="Page_155"></a>Member for Northampton is less an ornament of
general
society than the oracle of an initiated circle. The smoking-room
of the House of Commons is his shrine, and there,
poised in an American rocking-chair and delicately toying
with a cigarette, he unlocks the varied treasures of his well-stored
memory, and throws over the changing scenes of life
the mild light of his genial philosophy. It is a chequered
experience that has made him what he is. He has known
men and cities; has probed in turn the mysteries of the
caucus, the green-room, and the Stock Exchange; has been
a diplomatist, a financier, a journalist, and a politician.
Under these circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that
his faith&#8212;no doubt originally robust&#8212;in the purity of human
nature and the uprightness of human motive should have
undergone some process of degeneration. Still it may be
questioned whether, after all that he has seen and done, he
is the absolute and all-round cynic that he would seem to be.
The palpable endeavour to make out the worst of every one&#8212;including
himself&#8212;gives a certain flavour of unreality to
his conversation; but, in spite of this peculiarity, he is an
engaging talker. His language is racy and incisive, and he
talks as neatly as he writes. His voice is pleasant, and his
utterance deliberate and effective. He has a keen eye for
absurdities and incongruities, a shrewd insight into affectation
and bombast, and an admirable impatience of all the moral
and intellectual qualities which constitute the Bore. He is
by no means inclined to bow his knee too slavishly to an
exalted reputation, and analyzes with agreeable frankness the
personal and political qualities of great and good men, even
if they sit on the front Opposition bench. As a contributor
to enjoyment, as a promoter of fun, as an unmasker of political
and social humbug, he is unsurpassed. His performances
in debate are no concern of mine, for I am speaking
of conversation only; but most Members of Parliament will
agree that he is the best companion that can be found for
<a name="Page_156"></a>the last weary half-hour before the
division-bell rings, when
some eminent nonentity is declaiming his foregone conclusions
to an audience whose whole mind is fixed on the
chance of finding a disengaged cab in Palace Yard.</p>
<p>Like Mr. Labouchere, Lord Acton has touched life at
many points&#8212;but not the same. He is a theologian, a
professor, a man of letters, a member of society; and his
conversation derives a distinct tinge from each of these
environments. When, at intervals all too long, he quits his
retirement at Cannes or Cambridge, and flits mysteriously
across the social scene, his appearance is hailed with devout
rejoicing by every one who appreciates manifold learning,
a courtly manner, and a delicately sarcastic vein of humour.
The distinguishing feature of Lord Acton's conversation is
an air of sphinx-like mystery, which suggests that he knows
a great deal more than he is willing to impart. Partly by
what he says, and even more by what he leaves unsaid, his
hearers are made to feel that, if he has not acted conspicuous
parts, he has been behind the scenes of many and very
different theatres.</p>
<p>He has had relations, neither few nor unimportant, with
the Pope and the Old Catholics, with Oxford and Lambeth,
with the cultivated Whiggery of the great English families,
with the philosophic radicalism of Germany, and with those
Nationalist complications which, in these later days, have
drawn official Liberalism into their folds. He has long
lived on terms of the closest intimacy with Mr. Gladstone,
and may perhaps be bracketed with Canon MacColl and
Sir Algernon West as the most absolute and profound
Gladstonian outside the family circle of Hawarden. But he
is thoroughly eclectic in his friendships, and when he is
in London he flits from Lady Hayter's tea-table to Mr.
Goschen's bureau, analyzes at the Athenaeum the gossip
which he has acquired at Brooks's, and by dinner-time
is able, if only he is willing, to tell you what Spain intends
<a name="Page_157"></a>and what America; the present relations between
the Curia
and the Secret Societies; how long Lord Salisbury will
combine the Premiership with the Foreign Office; and the
latest theory about the side of Whitehall on which Charles I.
was beheaded.</p>
<p>The ranks of our good talkers&#8212;none too numerous a
body at the best, and sadly thinned by the losses which I
described in a former chapter&#8212;have been opportunely reinforced
by the discovery of Mr. Augustine Birrell. For
forty-eight years he has walked this earth, but it is only
during the last nine&#8212;in short, since he entered Parliament&#8212;that
the admirable qualities of his conversation have been
generally recognized. Before that time his delightful <i>Obiter
Dicta</i> had secured for him a wide circle of friends who had
never seen his face, and by these admirers his first appearance
on the social scene was awaited with lively interest.
What would he be like? Should we be disillusioned?
Would he talk as pleasantly as he wrote? Well, in due
course he appeared, and the questions were soon answered
in a sense as laudatory as his friends or even himself could
have desired. It was unanimously voted that his conversation
was as agreeable as his writing; but, oddly enough,
its agreeableness was of an entirely different kind. His
literary knack of chatty criticism had required a new word
to convey its precise effect. To "birrell" is now a verb as
firmly established as to "boycott," and it signifies a style
light, easy, playful, pretty, rather discursive, perhaps a little
superficial. Its characteristic note is grace. But when the
eponymous hero of the new verb entered the conversational
lists it was seen that his predominant quality was strength.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic admirer who sketched him in a novel
nicknamed him "The Harmonious Blacksmith," and the
collocation of words happily hits off the special quality of
his conversation. There is burly strength in his positive
opinions, his cogent statement, his remorseless logic, his
<a name="Page_158"></a>thorough knowledge of the persons and things
that he discusses.
In his sledge-hammer blows against humbug and
wickedness, intellectual affectation, and moral baseness, he
is the Blacksmith all over. In his geniality, his sociability,
his genuine love of fun, his frank readiness to amuse or be
amused, the epithet "harmonious" is abundantly justified.
He cultivates to some extent the airs and tone of the
eighteenth century, in which his studies have chiefly lain.
He says what he means, and calls a spade a spade, and
glories in an old-fashioned prejudice. He is the jolliest of
companions and the steadiest of friends, and perhaps the
most genuine book-lover in London, where, as a rule, people
are too "cultured" to read books, though willing enough to
chatter about them.<br>

<h2>CLERGYMEN.</h2>
<p><i> Clerus Anglicanus stupor mundi</i>. I believe that
this complimentary proverb originally referred to
the learning of the English clergy, but it would apply
with equal truth to their social agreeableness. When
I was writing about the Art of Conversation and the men
who excelled in it, I was surprised to find how many of the
best sayings that recurred spontaneously to my memory had
a clerical origin; and it struck me that a not uninteresting
chapter might be written about the social agreeableness of
clergymen. A mere layman may well feel a natural and
becoming diffidence in venturing to handle so high a
theme.</p>
<p>In a former chapter I said something of the secular
magnificence which surrounded great prelates in the good
old days, when the Archbishop of Canterbury could only be
approached on gilt-edged paper, and even the Bishop of
impecunious Oxford never appeared in his Cathedral city
without four horses and two powdered footmen. In a
certain sense, no doubt, these splendid products of established
religion conduced to social agreeableness. Like the
excellent prelate described in <i>Friendship's Garland</i>, they
"had thoroughly learnt the divine lesson that charity begins
at home." They maintained an abundant hospitality; they
celebrated domestic events by balls at the episcopal palace;
<a name="Page_160"></a>they did not disdain (as we gather from the Life
of the Hon.
and Rev. George Spencer) the relaxation of a rubber of
whist, even on the night before an Ordination, with a
candidate for a partner. They dined out, like that well-drawn
bishop in <i>Little Dorrit</i>, who "was crisp, fresh, cheerful,
affable, bland, but so surprisingly innocent;" or like
the prelate on whom Thackeray moralized: "My Lord, I
was pleased to see good thing after good thing disappear
before you; and think that no man ever better became that
rounded episcopal apron. How amiable he was! how
kind! He put water into his wine. Let us respect the
moderation of the Establishment."</p>
<p>But the agreeableness which I had in my mind when I
took upon myself to discourse of agreeable clergymen was
not an official but a personal agreeableness. We have been
told on high authority that the Merriment of Parsons is
mighty offensive; but the truth of this dictum depends
entirely on the topic of the merriment. A clergyman who
made light of the religion which he professes to teach, or
even joked about the incidents and accompaniments of
his sacred calling, would by common consent be intolerable.
Decency exacts from priests at least a semblance of piety;
but I entirely deny that there is anything offensive in the
"merriment of parsons" when it plays round subjects outside
the scope of their professional duties.</p>
<p>Of Sydney Smith Lord Houghton recorded that "he
never, except once, knew him to make a jest on any religious
subject, and then he immediately withdrew his words, and
seemed ashamed that he had uttered them;" and I regard
the admirable Sydney as not only the supreme head of all
ecclesiastical jesters, but as, on the whole, the greatest
humorist whose jokes have come down to us in an authentic
and unmutilated form. Almost alone among professional
jokers, he made his merriment&#8212;rich, natural, fantastic,
unbridled as it was&#8212;subserve the serious purposes of his
<a name="Page_161"></a>life and writing. Each joke was a link in an
argument; each
sarcasm was a moral lesson.</p>
<p><i>Peter Plymley's Letters</i>, and those addressed to Archdeacon
Singleton, the Essays on <i>America</i> and <i>Persecuting
Bishops</i>, will probably be read as long as the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>
or Macaulay's review of Montgomery's Poems; while of
detached and isolated jokes&#8212;pure freaks of fun clad
in literary garb&#8212;an incredible number of those which
are current in daily converse deduce their birth from this
incomparable Canon.</p>
<p>When one is talking of facetious clergymen, it is inevitable
to think of Bishop Wilberforce; but his humour was of an
entirely different quality from that of Sydney Smith. To
begin with, it is unquotable. It must, I think, have struck
every reader of the Bishop's Life, whether in the three huge
volumes of the authorized Biography or in the briefer but
more characteristic monograph of Dean Burgon, that,
though the biographers had themselves tasted and enjoyed
to the full the peculiar flavour of his fun, they utterly failed
in the attempt to convey it to the reader. Puerile puns,
personal banter of a rather homely type, and good stories
collected from other people are all that the books disclose.
Animal spirits did the rest; and yet, by the concurrent
testimony of nearly all who knew him, Bishop Wilberforce
was not only one of the most agreeable but one of the most
amusing men of his time. We know from one of his own
letters that he peculiarly disliked the description which Lord
Beaconsfield gave of him in <i>Lothair</i>, and on the principle
of <i>Ce n'est que la v&eacute;rit&eacute; qui blesse</i>, it may be
worth while
to recall it: "The Bishop was particularly playful on
the morrow at breakfast. Though his face beamed with
Christian kindness, there was a twinkle in his eye which
seemed not entirely superior to mundane self-complacency,
even to a sense of earthly merriment. His seraphic raillery
elicited sympathetic applause from the ladies, especially
<a name="Page_162"></a>from the daughters of the house, who laughed
occasionally
even before his angelic jokes were well launched."</p>
<p>Mr. Bright once said, with characteristic downrightness,
"If I was paid what a bishop is paid for doing what a
bishop does, I should find abundant cause for merriment in
the credulity of my countrymen;" and, waiving the theological
animus which the saying implies, it is not uncharitable
to surmise that a general sense of prosperity and a strong
faculty of enjoying life in all its aspects and phases had
much to do with Bishop Wilberforce's exuberant and
infectious jollity. "A truly emotional spirit," wrote
Matthew Arnold, after meeting him in a country house,
"he undoubtedly has beneath his outside of society-haunting
and men-pleasing, and each of the two lives he
leads gives him the more zest for the other."</p>
<p>A scarcely less prominent figure in society than Bishop
Wilberforce, and to many people a much more attractive
one, was Dean Stanley. A clergyman to whom the Queen
signed herself "Ever yours affectionately" must certainly be
regarded as the social head of his profession, and every
circumstance of Stanley's nature and antecedents exactly
fitted him for the part. He was in truth a spoiled child
of fortune, in a sense more refined and spiritual than the
phrase generally conveys. He was born of famous ancestry,
in a bright and unworldly home; early filled with the moral
and intellectual enthusiasms of Rugby in its best days;
steeped in the characteristic culture of Oxford, and advanced
by easy stages of well-deserved promotion to the most delightful
of all offices in the Church of England. His inward
nature accorded well with this happy environment. It was
in a singular degree pure, simple, refined, ingenuous. All
the grosser and harsher elements of human character seemed
to have been omitted from his composition. He was
naturally good, naturally graceful, naturally amiable. A
sense of humour was, I think, almost the only intellectual
<a name="Page_163"></a>gift with which he was not endowed. Lord
Beaconsfield
spoke of his "picturesque sensibility," and the phrase was
happily chosen. He had the keenest sympathy with whatever
was graceful in literature; a style full of flexibility and
colour; a rare faculty of graphic description; and all glorified
by something of the poet's imagination. His conversation
was incessant, teeming with information, and illustrated by
familiar acquaintance with all the best that has been thought
and said in the world.</p>
<p>Never was a brighter intellect or a more gallant heart
housed in a more fragile form. His figure, features, bearing,
and accent were the very type of refinement; and as the
spare figure, so short yet so full of dignity, marked out by the
decanal dress and the red ribbon of the Order of the Bath,
threaded its way through the crowded saloons of London
society, one felt that the Church, as a civilizing institution,
could not be more appropriately represented.</p>
<p>A lady of Presbyterian antecedents who had conformed
to Anglicanism once said to the present writer, "I dislike the
<i>Episcopal</i> Church as much as ever, but I love the <i>Decanal</i>
Church." Her warmest admiration was reserved for that
particular Dean, supreme alike in station and in charm,
whom I have just now been describing; but there were, at
the time of speaking, several other members of the same
order who were conspicuous ornaments of the society in
which they moved. There was Dr. Elliot, Dean of Bristol,
a yearly visitor to London; dignified, clever, agreeable,
highly connected; an administrator, a politician, an admirable
talker; and so little trammelled by any ecclesiastical
prejudices or habitudes that he might have been the
original of Dr. Stanhope in <i>Barchester Towers</i>. There was
Dr. Liddell, Dean of Christ Church, whose periodical
appearances at Court and in society displayed to the
admiring gaze of the world the very handsomest and stateliest
specimen of the old English gentleman that our time
<a name="Page_164"></a>has produced. There was Dr. Church, Dean of St.
Paul's,
by many competent judges pronounced to be our most
accomplished man of letters, yet so modest and so retiring
that the world was never suffered to come in contact with
him except through his books. And there was Dr. Vaughan,
Dean of Llandaff, who concealed under the blandest of
manners a remorseless sarcasm and a mordant wit, and who,
returning from the comparative publicity of the Athenaeum
to the domestic shades of the Temple, would often leave
behind him some pungent sentence which travelled from
mouth to mouth, and spared neither age nor sex nor friendship
nor affinity.</p>
<p>The very highest dignitaries of the Church in London
have never, in my experience, contributed very largely to its
social life. The garden-parties of Fulham and Lambeth are
indeed recognized incidents of the London season; but
they present to the critical eye less the aspect of a social
gathering than that of a Church Congress combined with
a Mothers' Meeting. The overwhelming disparity between
the position of host and guests is painfully apparent, and
that "drop-down-dead-ativeness" of manner which Sydney
Smith quizzed still characterizes the demeanour of the unbeneficed
clergy. Archbishop Tait, whose natural stateliness
of aspect and manner was one of the most conspicuous
qualifications for his great office, was a dignified and hospitable
host; and Archbishop Thomson, reinforced by a
beautiful and charming wife, was sometimes spoken of as
the Archbishop of Society. Archbishop Benson looked the
part to perfection, but did not take much share in general
conversation, though I remember one terse saying of his
in which the <i>odium theologicum</i> supplied the place of wit.
A portrait of Cardinal Manning was exhibited at the Royal
Academy, and I remarked to the Archbishop on the extraordinary
picturesqueness of the Cardinal's appearance
"The dress is very effective," replied the Archbishop dryly,
"<a name="Page_165"></a>but I don't think there is much besides." "Oh,
surely
it is a fine head?" "No, not a fine head; only <i>no face</i>."</p>
<p>Passing down through the ranks of the hierarchy, I shall
presently have something to say about two or three metropolitan
Canons who are notable figures in society; but
before I come to them I must offer a word of affectionate
tribute to the memory of Dr. Liddon. Probably there never
was a man whose social habit and manner were less like
what a mere outsider would have inferred from his physical
aspect and public demeanour. Nature had given him the
outward semblance of a foreigner and an ascetic; a life-long
study of ecclesiastical rhetoric had stamped him with a
mannerism which belongs peculiarly to the pulpit. But
the true inwardness of the man was that of the typical John
Bull&#8212;hearty, natural, full of humour, utterly free from
self-consciousness.
He had a healthy appetite, and was not
ashamed to gratify it; liked a good glass of wine; was
peculiarly fond of sociable company, whether as host or
guest; and told an amusing story with incomparable zest
and point. His verbal felicity was a marked feature of
his conversation. His description of Archbishop Benson
(revived, with strange taste, by the <i>Saturday Review</i> on the
occasion of the Archbishop's death) was a masterpiece
of sarcastic character-drawing. The judicious Bishop
Davidson and the accomplished Canon Mason were the
subjects of similar pleasantries; and there was substantial
truth as well as genuine fun in his letter to a friend written
one dark Christmas from Amen Court: "London is just now
buried under a dense fog. This is commonly attributed
to Dr. Westcott having opened his study-window at
Westminster."</p>

<h2>CLERGYMEN&#8212;<i>continued</i>.</h2>
<p>OF the "Merriment of Parsons" one of the most conspicuous
instances was to be found in the Rev.
W.H. Brookfield, the "little Frank Whitestock" of
Thackeray's <i>Curate's Walk</i>, and the subject of Lord Tennyson's
characteristic elegy:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>"Brooks, for they called you so that knew you best&#8212;</p>
<p>Old Brooks, who loved so well to mouth my rhymes,</p>
<p>How oft we two have heard St. Mary's chimes!</p>
<p>How oft the Cantab supper host, and guest,</p>
<p>Would echo helpless laughter to your jest!</p>
<hr style="width: 25%; margin-left: 40px;">
<div class="stanza">
<p>You man of humorous-melancholy mark</p>
<p>Dead of some inward agony&#8212;is it so?</p>
<p>Our kindlier, trustier Jaques, past away!</p>
<p>I cannot laud this life, it looks so dark:</p>
<p>&#931;&#954;&#953;&#945;&#962; &#959;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#8212;dream of a shadow, go,&#8212;</p>
<p>God bless you. I shall join you in a day."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This tribute is as true in substance as it is striking in
phrase. I have noticed the same peculiarity about Mr.
Brookfield's humour as about Jenny Lind's singing. Those
who had once heard it were always eager to talk about it.
Ask some elderly man about the early triumphs of the
Swedish Nightingale, and notice how he kindles. "Ah!
Jenny Lind! Yes; there was never anything like that!"
And he begins about the <i>Figlia</i>, and how she came along
the bridge in the <i>Sonnambula</i>; and you feel the tenderness
in his tone, as of a positive love for her whose voice seems
<a name="Page_167"></a>still ringing through him as he talks. I have
noticed
exactly the same phenomenon when people who knew
Mr. Brookfield hear his name mentioned in casual conversation.
"Ah! Brookfield! Yes; there never was any
one quite like him!" And off they go, with visible
pleasure and genuine emotion, to describe the inimitable
charm, the touch of genius which brought humorous delight
out of the commonest incidents, the tinge of brooding
melancholy which threw the flashing fun into such high
relief.</p>
<p>Not soon will fade from the memory of any who ever
heard it the history of the examination at the ladies' school,
where Brookfield, who had thought that he was only expected
to examine in languages and literature, found himself required
to set a paper in physical science. "What was I to do? I
know nothing about hydrogen or oxygen or any other 'gen.'
So I set them a paper in common sense, or what I called
'Applied Science.' One of my questions was, 'What
would you do to cure a cold in the head?' One young
lady answered, 'I should put <i>my</i> feet in hot mustard and
water till <i>you</i> were in a profuse perspiration.' Another
said, 'I should put him to bed, give him a soothing drink,
and sit by him till he was better.' But, on reconsideration,
she ran her pen through all the 'him's' and 'he's,' and
substituted 'her' and 'she.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Brookfield was during the greater part of his life
a hard-working servant of the public, and his friends could
only obtain his delightful company in the rare and scanty
intervals of school-inspecting&#8212;a profession of which not
even the leisure is leisurely. The type of the French abb&eacute;,
whose sacerdotal avocations lay completely in the background
and who could give the best hours of the day and
night to the pleasures or duties of society, was best represented
in our day by the Rev. William Harness and the
Rev. Henry White. Mr. Harness was a diner-out of the
<a name="Page_168"></a>first water; an author and a critic; perhaps the
best Shakespearean
scholar of his time; and a recognized and even
dreaded authority on all matters connected with the art and
literature of the drama. Mr. White, burdened only with
the sinecure chaplaincies of the Savoy and the House of
Commons, took the Theatre as his parish, mediated with
the happiest tact between the Church and the Stage, and
pronounced a genial benediction over the famous suppers
in Stratton Street at which an enthusiastic patroness used to
entertain Sir Henry Irving when the public labours of the
Lyceum were ended for the night.</p>
<p>Canon Malcolm MacColl is an abb&eacute; with a difference.
No one eats his dinner more sociably or tells a story more
aptly; no one enjoys good society more keenly or is more
appreciated in it; but he does not make society a profession.
He is conscientiously devoted to the duties of his canonry;
he is an accomplished theologian; and he is perhaps the
most expert and vigorous pamphleteer in England. The
Franco-German War, the Athanasian Creed, the Ritualistic
prosecutions, the case for Home Rule, and the misdeeds of
the Sultan have in turn produced from his pen pamphlets
which have rushed into huge circulations and swollen to the
dimensions of solid treatises. Canon MacColl is genuinely
and <i>ex animo</i> an ecclesiastic; but he is a politician as well.
His inflexible integrity and fine sense of honour have enabled
him to play, with credit to himself and advantage to the
public, the rather risky part of the Priest in Politics. He has
been trusted alike by Lord Salisbury and by Mr. Gladstone;
has conducted negotiations of great pith and moment; and
has been behind the scenes of some historic performances.
Yet he has never made an enemy, nor betrayed a secret,
nor lowered the honour of his sacred calling.</p>
<p>Miss Mabel Collins, in her vivid story of <i>The Star
Sapphire</i>, has drawn under a very thin pseudonym a striking
portrait of a clergyman who, with his environment, plays a
<a name="Page_169"></a>considerable part in the social agreeableness of
London at
the present moment. Is social agreeableness a hereditary
gift? Nowadays, when everything, good or bad, is referred
to heredity, one is inclined to say that it must be; and,
though no training could supply the gift where Nature had
withheld it, yet a judicious education can develop a social
faculty which ancestry has transmitted. It is recorded, I
think, of Madame de Stael, that, after her first conversation
with William Wilberforce, she said: "I have always heard
that Mr. Wilberforce was the most religious man in England,
but I did not know that he was also the wittiest." The
agreeableness of the great philanthropist's son&#8212;Samuel
Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford and of Winchester&#8212;I discussed
in my last chapter. We may put aside the fulsome
dithyrambics of grateful archdeacons and promoted chaplains,
and be content to rest the Bishop's reputation for agreeableness
on testimony so little interested as that of Matthew
Arnold and Archbishop Tait. The Archbishop wrote, after
the Bishop's death, of his "social and irresistibly fascinating
side, as displayed in his dealings with society;" and in 1864
Mr. Arnold, after listening with only very moderate admiration
to one of the Bishop's celebrated sermons, wrote:
"Where he was excellent was in his speeches at luncheon
afterwards&#8212;gay, easy, cordial, and wonderfully happy."</p>
<p>I think that one gathers from all dispassionate observers
of the Bishop that what struck them most in him was the
blending of boisterous fun and animal spirits with a deep
and abiding sense of the seriousness of religion. In the
philanthropist-father the religious seriousness rather preponderated
over the fun; in the bishop-son (by a curious
inversion of parts) the fun sometimes concealed the religiousness.
To those who speculate in matters of race and pedigree
it is interesting to watch the two elements contending
in the character of Canon Basil Wilberforce, the Bishop's
youngest and best-beloved son. When you see his graceful
<a name="Page_170"></a>figure and clean-shaven ecclesiastical face in
the pulpit of
his strangely old-fashioned church, or catch the vibrating
notes of his beautifully modulated voice in</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The hush of our dread high altar,</p>
<p>Where The Abbey makes us <i>We</i>,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>you feel yourself in the presence of a born ecclesiastic, called
from his cradle by an irresistible vocation to a separate and
sanctified career. When you see him on the platform of
some great public meeting, pouring forth argument, appeal,
sarcasm, anecdote, fun, and pathos in a never-ceasing flood
of vivid English, you feel that you are under the spell of a
born orator. And yet again, when you see the priest of
Sunday, the orator of Monday, presiding on Tuesday with
easy yet finished courtesy at the hospitable table of the
most beautiful dining-room in London, or welcomed with
equal warmth for his racy humour and his unfailing sympathy
in the homes of his countless friends, you feel that here
is a man naturally framed for society, in whom his father
and grandfather live again. Truly a combination of hereditary
gifts is displayed in Canon Wilberforce; and the
social agreeableness of London received a notable addition
when Mr. Gladstone transferred him from Southampton to
Dean's Yard.</p>
<p>Of agreeable Canons there is no end, and the Chapter of
Westminster is peculiarly rich in them. Mr. Gore's ascetic
saintliness of life conceals from the general world, but not
from the privileged circle of his intimate friends, the high
breeding of a great Whig family and the philosophy of
Balliol. Archdeacon Furse has the refined scholarship and
delicate literary sense which characterized Eton in its days
of glory. Dr. Duckworth's handsome presence has long
been welcomed in the very highest of all social circles.
Mr. Eyton's massive bulk and warm heart, and rugged
humour and sturdy common sense, produce the effect of a
<a name="Page_171"></a>clerical Dr. Johnson. But perhaps we must turn
our back
on the Abbey and pursue our walk along the Thames Embankment
as far as St. Paul's if we want to discover the very
finest flower of canonical culture and charm, for it blushes
unseen in the shady recesses of Amen Court. Henry Scott
Holland, Canon of St. Paul's, is beyond all question one of
the most agreeable men of his time. In fun and geniality
and warm-hearted hospitality he is a worthy successor of
Sydney Smith, whose official house he inhabits; and to
those elements of agreeableness he adds certain others which
his admirable predecessor could scarcely have claimed. He
has all the sensitiveness of genius, with its sympathy, its
versatility, its unexpected turns, its rapid transitions from
grave to gay, its vivid appreciation of all that is beautiful
in art and nature, literature and life. His temperament
is essentially musical, and, indeed, it was from him that I
borrowed, in a former paragraph, my description of Jenny
Lind and her effect on her hearers. No man in London,
I should think, has so many and such devoted friends in
every class and stratum; and those friends acknowledge in
him not only the most vivacious and exhilarating of social
companions, but one of the moral forces which have done
most to quicken their consciences and lift their lives.</p>
<p>Before I have done with the agreeableness of clergymen I
must say a word about two academical personages, of whom
it was not always easy to remember that they were clergymen,
and whose agreeableness struck one in different lights,
according as one happened to be the victim or the witness
of their jocosity. If any one wishes to know what the late
Master of Balliol was really like in his social aspect, I should
refer him, not to the two volumes of his Biography, nor even
to the amusing chit-chat of Mr. Lionel Tollemache's Recollections,
but to the cleverest work of a very clever Balliol
man&#8212;Mr. W.H. Mallock's <i>New Republic</i>. The description
of Mr. Jowett's appearance, conversation, and social bearing
<a name="Page_172"></a>is photographic, and the sermon which Mr.
Mallock puts
into his mouth is not a parody, but an absolutely faultless
reproduction both of substance and of style. That it excessively
irritated the subject of the sketch is the best proof of
its accuracy. For my own part, I must freely admit that I
do not write as an admirer of Mr. Jowett; but one saying
of his, which I had the advantage of hearing, does much to
atone, in my judgment, for the snappish impertinences on
which his reputation for wit has been generally based. The
scene was the Master's own dining-room, and the moment
that the ladies had left the room one of the guests began a
most outrageous conversation. Every one sat flabbergasted.
The Master winced with annoyance; and then, bending down
the table towards the offender, said in his shrillest tone&#8212;"Shall
we continue this conversation in the drawing-room?"
and rose from his chair. It was really a stroke of genius
thus both to terminate and to rebuke the impropriety without
violating the decorum due from host to guest.</p>
<p>Of the late Master of Trinity&#8212;Dr. Thompson&#8212;it was
said: "He casteth forth his ice like morsels. Who is able
to abide his frost?" The stories of his mordant wit are
endless, but an Oxford man can scarcely hope to narrate
them with proper accuracy. He was nothing if not critical.
At Seeley's Inaugural Lecture as Professor of History his
only remark was&#8212;"Well, well. I did not think we could
so soon have had occasion to regret poor Kingsley." To a
gushing admirer who said that a popular preacher had so
much taste&#8212;"Oh yes; so very much, and all so very bad."
Of a certain Dr. Woods, who wrote elementary mathematical
books for schoolboys, and whose statue occupies the most
conspicuous position in the ante-chapel of St. John's College&#8212;"The
Johnian Newton." His hit at the present Chief
Secretary for Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
when
he was a junior Fellow of
Trinity, is classical&#8212;"We are none of us infallible&#8212;not
<a name="Page_173"></a>even the youngest of us." But it requires an
eye-witness of
the scene to do justice to the exordium of the Master's
sermon on the Parable of the Talents, addressed in Trinity
Chapel to what considers itself, and not without justice, the
cleverest congregation in the world. "It would be obviously
superfluous in a congregation such as that which I now
address to expatiate on the responsibilities of those who have
five, or even two, talents. I shall therefore confine my
observations to the more ordinary case of those of us who
have <i>one talent</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="Page_174"></a>XIX.</h2>
<h2>REPARTEE.</h2>
<p>Lord Beaconsfield, describing Monsignore
Berwick in <i>Lothair</i>, says that he "could always,
when necessary, sparkle with anecdote or blaze with
repartee." The former performance is considerably easier
than the latter. Indeed, when a man has a varied experience,
a retentive memory, and a sufficient copiousness of
speech, the facility of story-telling may attain the character
of a disease. The "sparkle" evaporates while the "anecdote"
is left. But, though what Mr. Pinto called "Anecdotage"
is deplorable, a repartee is always delightful: and,
while by no means inclined to admit the general inferiority
of contemporary conversation to that of the last generation,
I am disposed to think that in the art of repartee our predecessors
excelled us.</p>
<p>If this is true, it may be partly due to the greater freedom
of an age when well-bred men and refined women spoke their
minds with an uncompromising plainness which would now
be voted intolerable. I have said that the old Royal Dukes
were distinguished by the racy vigour of their conversation;
and the Duke of Cumberland, afterwards King Ernest of
Hanover, was held to excel all his brothers in this respect.
I was told by the late Sir Charles Wyke that he was once
walking with the Duke of Cumberland along Piccadilly when
the Duke of Gloucester (first cousin to Cumberland, and
familiarly known as "Silly Billy") came out of Gloucester
<a name="Page_175"></a>House. "Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Gloucester,
stop
a minute. I want to speak to you," roared the Duke of
Cumberland. Poor Silly Billy, whom nobody ever noticed,
was delighted to find himself thus accosted, and ambled up
smiling. "Who's your tailor?" shouted Cumberland.
"Stultz," replied Gloucester. "Thank you. I only wanted
to know, because, whoever he is, he ought to be avoided
like a pestilence." Exit Silly Billy.</p>
<p>Of this inoffensive but not brilliant prince (who, by the
way, was Chancellor of the University of Cambridge) it is
related that once at a lev&eacute;e he noticed a naval friend with a
much-tanned face. "How do, Admiral? Glad to see you
again. It's a long time since you have been at a lev&eacute;e."
"Yes, sir. Since I last saw your Royal Highness I have
been nearly to the North Pole." "By G---, you look more
as if you had been to the South Pole." It is but bare justice
to this depreciated memory to observe that the Duke of
Gloucester scored a point against his kingly cousin when, on
hearing that William IV. had consented to the Reform Bill,
he ejaculated, "Who's Silly Billy now?" But this is a
digression.</p>
<p>Early in the nineteenth century a famous lady, whose
name, for obvious reasons, I forbear to indicate even by an
initial, had inherited great wealth under a will which, to put
it mildly, occasioned much surprise. She shared an opera-box
with a certain Lady D---, who loved the flowing wine-cup
not wisely, but too well. One night Lady D--- was
visibly intoxicated at the opera, and her friend told her that
the partnership in the box must cease, as she could not
appear again in company so disgraceful. "As you please,"
said Lady D---. "I may have had a glass of wine too
much; but at any rate I never forged my father's signature,
and then murdered the butler to prevent his telling."</p>
<p>Beau Brummell, the Prince of Dandies and the most
insolent of men, was once asked by a lady if be would
"<a name="Page_176"></a>take a cup of tea." "Thank you, ma'am," he
replied,
"I never <i>take</i> anything but physic." "I beg your pardon,"
replied the hostess, "you also take liberties."</p>
<p>The Duchess of Somerset, born Sheridan, and famous as
the Queen of Beauty at the Eglinton Tournament of 1839,
was pre-eminent in this agreeable art of swift response. One
day she called at a shop for some article which she had
purchased the day before, and which had not been sent
home. The order could not be traced. The proprietor
of the establishment inquired, with great concern, "May
I ask who took your Grace's order? Was it a young
gentleman with fair hair?" "No; it was an elderly nobleman
with a bald head."</p>
<p>The celebrated Lady Clanricarde, daughter of George
Canning, was talking during the Franco-German War of
1870 to the French Ambassador, who complained bitterly
that England had not intervened on behalf of France.
"But, after all," he said, "it was only what we might have
expected. We always believed that you were a nation of
shopkeepers, and now we know you are." "And we,"
replied Lady Clanricarde, "always believed that you were
a nation of soldiers, and now we know you are not"&#8212;a
repartee worthy to rank with Queen Mary's reply to Lady
Lochleven about the sacramental character of marriage, in
the third volume of <i>The Abbot</i>.</p>
<p>A young lady, who had just been appointed a Maid of
Honour, was telling some friends with whom she was dining
that one of the conditions of the office was that she should
not keep a diary of what went on at Court. A cynical man
of the world who was present said, "What a tiresome rule!
I think I should keep my diary all the same." "Then,"
replied the young lady, "I am afraid you would not be a
maid of <i>Honour</i>."</p>
<p>In the famous society of old Holland House a conspicuous
and interesting figure was Henry Luttrell. It was
<a name="Page_177"></a>known that he must be getting on in life, for he
had sat in
the Irish Parliament, but his precise age no one knew. At
length Lady Holland, whose curiosity was restrained by no
considerations of courtesy, asked him point-blank&#8212;"Now,
Luttrell, we're all dying to know how old you are. Just tell
me." Eyeing his questioner gravely, Luttrell made answer,
"It is an odd question; but as you, Lady Holland, ask it,
I don't mind telling you. If I live till next year, I shall be&#8212;devilish
old."</p>
<p>For the mutual amenities of Melbourne and Alvanley and
Rogers and Allen, for Lord Holland's genial humour, and
for Lady Holland's indiscriminate insolence, we can refer to
Lord Macaulay's Life and Charles Greville's Journals, and
the enormous mass of contemporary memoirs. Most of
these verbal encounters were fought with all imaginable
good-humour, over some social or literary topic; but now
and then, when political passion was really roused, they took
a fiercely personal tone.</p>
<p>Let one instance of elaborate invective suffice. Sir James
Mackintosh, who, as the writer of the <i>Vindiciae Gallicae</i>, had
been the foremost apologist for the French Revolution, fell
later under the influence of Burke, and proclaimed the most
unmeasured hostility to the Revolution and its authors,
their works and ways. Having thus become a vehement
champion of law and order, he exclaimed one day that
O'Coighley, the priest who negotiated between the Revolutionary
parties in Ireland and France, was the basest of
mankind. "No, Mackintosh," replied that sound though
pedantic old Whig, Dr. Parr; "he might have been much
worse. He was an Irishman; he might have been a Scotsman.
He was a priest; he might have been a lawyer. He
was a rebel; he might have been a renegade."</p>
<p>These severe forms of elaborated sarcasm belong, I think,
to a past age. Lord Beaconsfield was the last man who
indulged in them. When the Greville Memoirs&#8212;that mine
<a name="Page_178"></a>of social information in which I have so often
quarried&#8212;came
out, some one asked Mr. Disraeli, as he then was,
if he had read them. He replied, "No. I do not feel
attracted to them. I remember the author, and he was the
most conceited person with whom I have ever been brought
in contact, although I have read Cicero and known Bulwer
Lytton." This three-edged compliment has seldom been
excelled. In a lighter style, and more accordant with
feminine grace, was Lady Morley's comment on the decaying
charms of her famous rival, Lady Jersey&#8212;the Zenobia
of <i>Endymion</i>&#8212;of whom some gushing admirer had said
that she looked so splendid going to court in her mourning
array of black and diamonds&#8212;"it was like night." "Yes,
my dear; <i>minuit pass&eacute;</i>." A masculine analogue to this
amiable compliment may be cited from the table-talk
of Lord Granville&#8212;certainly not an unkindly man&#8212;to
whom the late Mr. Delane had been complaining of the
difficulty of finding a suitable wedding-present for a young
lady of the house of Rothschild. "It would be absurd to
give a Rothschild a costly gift. I should like to find
something not intrinsically valuable, but interesting because
it is rare." "Nothing easier, my dear fellow; send her a
lock of your hair."</p>
<p>When a remote cousin of Lord Henniker was elected to
the Head Mastership of Rossall, a disappointed competitor
said that it was a case of &#949;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#965;; but a Greek joke
is scarcely fair play.</p>
<p>When the <i>New Review</i> was started, its accomplished
Editor designed it to be an inexpensive copy of the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i>. It was to cost only sixpence, and was to be
written by bearers of famous names&#8212;those of the British
aristocracy for choice. He was complaining in society of
the difficulty of finding a suitable title, when a vivacious
lady said, "We have got <i>Cornhill</i>, and <i>Ludgate</i>, and <i>Strand</i>&#8212;why
not call yours <i>Cheapside</i>?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_179"></a>Oxford has always been a nursing-mother of
polished
satirists. Of a small sprig of aristocracy, who was an
undergraduate in my time, it was said by a friend that he
was like Euclid's definition of a point: he had no parts and
no magnitude, but had position. In previous chapters I
have quoted the late Master of Balliol and Lord Sherbrooke.
Professor Thorold Rogers excelled in a Shandean vein.
Lord Bowen is immortalized by his emendation to the
Judge's address to the Queen, which had contained the
Heep-like sentence&#8212;"Conscious as we are of our own
unworthiness for the great office to which we have been
called." "Wouldn't it be better to say, 'Conscious as we
are of one another's unworthiness'?" Henry Smith,
Professor of Geometry, the wittiest, most learned, and most
genial of Irishmen, said of a well-known man of science&#8212;"His
only fault is that he sometimes forgets that he is the
Editor, not the Author, of Nature." A great lawyer who is
now a great judge, and has, with good reason, the very
highest opinion of himself, stood as a Liberal at the General
Election of 1880. His Tory opponents set on foot a
rumour that he was an Atheist, and when Henry Smith
heard it he said, "Now, that's really too bad, for--- is
a man who reluctantly acknowledges the existence of a
<i>Superior Being</i>."</p>
<p>At dinner at Balliol the Master's guests were discussing the
careers of two Balliol men, the one of whom had just been
made a judge and the other a bishop. "Oh," said Henry
Smith, "I think the bishop is the greater man. A judge,
at the most, can only say, 'You be hanged,' but a bishop
can say, 'You be d---d.'" "Yes," twittered the Master;
"but if the judge says, 'You be hanged,' you <i>are</i> hanged."</p>
<p>Henry Smith, though a delightful companion, was a very
unsatisfactory politician&#8212;nominally, indeed, a Liberal, but
full of qualifications and exceptions. When Mr. Gathorne
Hardy was raised to the peerage at the crisis of the Eastern
<a name="Page_180"></a>Question in 1878, and thereby vacated his seat
for the
University of Oxford, Henry Smith came forward as a
candidate in the Liberal interest; but his language about
the great controversy of the moment was so lukewarm that
Professor Freeman said that, instead of sitting for Oxford in
the House of Commons, he ought to represent Laodicea
in the Parliament of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Of Dr. Haig-Brown it is reported that, when Head Master
of Charterhouse, he was toasted by the Mayor of Godalming
as a man who knew how to combine the <i>fortiter in re</i> with
the <i>suav&#299;ter in modo</i>. In replying to the toast he said, "I
am really overwhelmed not only by the quality, but by the
<i>quantity</i> of his Worship's eulogium."</p>
<p>It has been a matter of frequent remark that, considering
what an immense proportion of parliamentary time has been
engrossed during the last seventeen years by Irish speeches,
we have heard so little Irish humour, whether conscious
or unconscious&#8212;whether jokes or "bulls." An admirably
vigorous simile was used by the late Mr. O'Sullivan, when
he complained that the whisky supplied at the bar was like
"a torchlight procession marching down your throat;" but
of Irish bulls in Parliament I have only heard one&#8212;proceeding,
if my memory serves me, from Mr. T. Healy:
"As long as the voice of Irish suffering is dumb, the ear
of English compassion is deaf to it." One I read in the
columns of the <i>Irish Times</i>: "The key of the Irish difficulty
is to be found in the <i>empty</i> pocket of the landlord." An
excellent confusion of metaphors was uttered by one of the
members for the Principality in the debate on the Welsh
Church Bill, in indignant protest against the allegation that
the majority of Welshmen now belonged to the Established
Church. He said, "It is a lie, sir; and it is high time
that we nailed this lie to the mast." But a confusion of
metaphors is not a bull.</p>
<p>Among tellers of Irish stories, Lord Morris is supreme;
<a name="Page_181"></a>one of his best depicts two Irish officials of
the good old
times discussing, in all the confidence of their after-dinner
claret, the principles on which they bestowed their patronage
Said the first, "Well, I don't mind admitting that, <i>caeteris
paribus</i>, I prefer my own relations." "My dear boy," replied
his boon companion, "<i>caeteris paribus</i> be d----d." The
cleverest thing that I have lately heard was from a young
lady, who is an Irishwoman, and I hope that its excellence
will excuse the personality. It must be premised that Lord
Erne is a gentleman who abounds in anecdote, and that
Lady Erne is an extremely handsome woman. Their irreverent
compatriot has nicknamed them</p>
<p>"The storied Erne and animated bust."</p>
<p>Frances Countess Waldegrave, who had previously been
married three times, took as her fourth husband an Irishman,
Mr. Chichester Fortescue, who was shortly afterwards made
Chief Secretary. The first night that Lady Waldegrave and
Mr. Fortescue appeared at the theatre in Dublin, a wag in
the gallery called out, "Which of the four do you like best,
my lady?" Instantaneously from the Chief Secretary's box
came the adroit reply: "Why, the Irishman, of course '"</p>
<p>The late Lord Coleridge was once speaking in the House
of Commons in support of Women's Rights. One of his
main arguments as that there was no essential difference
between the masculine and the feminine intellect. For
example, he said, some of the most valuable qualities of
what is called the judicial genius&#8212;sensibility, quickness,
delicacy&#8212;are peculiarly feminine. In reply, Serjeant Dowse
said: "The argument of the hon. and learned Member,
compendiously stated, amounts to this&#8212;because some judges
are old women, therefore all old women are fit to be judges."</p>
<p>To my friend Mr. Julian Sturgis, himself one of the
happiest of phrase-makers, I am indebted for the following
gems from America.</p>
<p><a name="Page_182"></a>Mr. Evarts, formerly Secretary of State,
showed an English
friend the place where Washington was said to have thrown
a dollar across the Potomac. The English friend expressed
surprise; "but," said Mr. Evarts, "you must remember
that a dollar went further in those days." A Senator met
Mr. Evarts next day, and said that he had been amused by
his jest. "But," said Mr. Evarts, "I met a mere journalist
just afterwards who said, 'Oh, Mr. Evarts, you should have
said that it was a small matter to throw a dollar across the
Potomac for a man who had chucked a sovereign across
the Atlantic.'" Mr. Evarts, weary of making many jokes,
would invent a journalist or other man and tell a story
as his. It was he who, on a kindly busybody expressing
surprise at his daring to drink so many different wines at
dinner, said that it was only the indifferent wines of which
he was afraid.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Motley who said in Boston&#8212;"Give me the
luxuries of life, and I care not who has the necessaries."</p>
<p>Mr. Tom Appleton, famous for many witty sayings (among
them the well-known "Good Americans, when they die, go
to Paris"), heard some grave city fathers debating what
could be done to mitigate the cruel east wind at an exposed
corner of a certain street in Boston. He suggested that
they should tether a shorn lamb there.</p>
<p>A witty Bostonian going to dine with a lady was met by
her with a face of apology. "I could not get another man,"
she said; "and we are four women, and you will have to
take us all in to dinner." "Fore-warned is four-armed,"
said he with a bow.</p>
<p>This gentleman was in a hotel in Boston when the law
forbidding the sale of liquor was in force. "What would
you say," said an angry Bostonian, "if a man from St. Louis,
where they have freedom, were to come in and ask you
where he could get a drink?" Now it was known that
spirits could be clandestinely bought in a room under the
<a name="Page_183"></a>roof, and the wit pointing upwards replied, "I
should say,
'Fils de St. Louis, montez au ciel.'"</p>
<p>Madame Apponyi was in London during the debates on
the Reform Bill of 1867, and, like all foreigners and not a few
Englishmen, was much perplexed by the "Compound Householder,"
who figured so largely in the discussion. Hayward
explained that he was the Masculine of the Femme Incomprise.</p>
<p>One of the best repartees ever made, because the briefest
and the justest, was made by "the gorgeous Lady Blessington"
to Napoleon III. When Prince Louis Napoleon was
living in impecunious exile in London he had been a
constant guest at Lady Blessington's hospitable and brilliant
but Bohemian house. And she, when visiting Paris after
the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> naturally expected to receive at the
Tuileries
some return for the unbounded hospitalities of Gore House.
Weeks passed, no invitation arrived, and the Imperial Court
took no notice of Lady Blessington's presence. At length
she encountered the Emperor at a great reception. As he
passed through the bowing and curtsying crowd, the Emperor
caught sight of his former hostess. "Ah, Miladi
Blessington! Restez-vous longtemps &agrave; Paris?" "Et vous,
Sire?" History does not record the usurper's reply.</p>
<p>Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter from 1830 to 1869,
lived at a beautiful villa near Torquay, and an enthusiastic
lady who visited him there burst into dithyrambics and
cried, "What a lovely spot this is, Bishop! It is so Swiss."
"Yes, ma'am," blandly replied old Harry of Exeter, "it is
very Swiss; only there is no sea in Switzerland, and there
are no mountains here." To one of his clergy desiring to
renew a lease of some episcopal property, the Bishop named
a preposterous sum as the fine on renewal. The poor parson,
consenting with reluctance, said, "Well, I suppose it is better
than endangering the lease, but certainly your lordship has
got the lion's share." "But, my dear sir, I am sure you
would not wish me to have that of the other creature."</p>
<p><a name="Page_184"></a>Still, after all, for a bishop to score off a
clergyman is an
inglorious victory; it is like the triumph of a magistrate over
a prisoner or of a don over an undergraduate. Bishop
Wilberforce, whose powers of repartee were among his
most conspicuous gifts, was always ready to use them where
retaliation was possible&#8212;not in the safe enclosure of the
episcopal study, but on the open battlefield of the platform
and the House of Lords. At the great meeting in St. James's
Hall in the summer of 1868 to protest against the Disestablishment
of the Irish Church, some Orange enthusiast, in the
hope of disturbing the Bishop, kept interrupting his honeyed
eloquence with inopportune shouts of "Speak up, my lord."
"I am already speaking up," replied the Bishop in his most
dulcet tone; "I always speak up; and I decline to speak
down to the level of the ill-mannered person in the gallery."
Every one whose memory runs back thirty years will recall
the Homeric encounters between the Bishop and Lord
Chancellor Westbury in the House of Lords, and will
remember the melancholy circumstances under which
Lord Westbury had to resign his office. When he was
leaving the Royal Closet after surrendering the Great Seal
into the Queen's hands, Lord Westbury met the Bishop, who
was going in to the Queen. It was a painful encounter, and
in reminding the Bishop of the occurrence when next they
met, Westbury said, "I felt inclined to say, 'Hast thou
found me, O mine enemy?'" The Bishop in relating this
used to say, "I never in my life was so tempted as to finish
the quotation, and say, 'Yea, I have found thee, because
thou hast sold thyself to work iniquity.' But by a great
effort I kept it down, and said, 'Does your lordship remember
the end of the quotation?'" The Bishop, who
enjoyed a laugh against himself, used to say that he had
once been effectually scored off by one of his clergy whom
he had rebuked for his addiction to fox-hunting. The
Bishop urged that it had a worldly appearance. The clergy<a
 name="Page_185"></a>man
replied that it was not a bit more worldly than a ball at
Blenheim Palace at which the Bishop had been present.
The Bishop explained that he was staying in the house, but
was never within three rooms of the dancing. "Oh, if it
comes to that," replied the clergyman, "I never am within
three fields of the hounds."</p>
<p>One of the best replies&#8212;it is scarcely a repartee&#8212;traditionally
reported at Oxford was made by the great Saint of
the Tractarian Movement, the Rev. Charles Marriott. A
brother-Fellow of Oriel had behaved rather outrageously at
dinner overnight, and coming out of chapel next morning,
essayed to apologize to Marriott: "My friend, I'm afraid I
made rather a fool of myself last night." "My dear fellow,
I assure you I observed nothing unusual."</p>
<p>In a former chapter about the Art of Conversation I
referred to the singular readiness which characterized Lord
Sherbrooke's talk. A good instance of it was his reply to
the strenuous advocate of modern studies, who, presuming
on Sherbrooke's sympathy, said, "I have the greatest contempt
for Aristotle." "But not that contempt which familiarity
breeds, I should imagine," was Sherbrooke's mild
rejoinder. "I have got a box at the Lyceum to-night," I
once heard a lady say, "and a place to spare. Lord Sherbrooke,
will you come? If you are engaged, I must take
the Bishop of Gibraltar." "Oh, that's no good. Gibraltar
can never be taken."</p>
<p>In 1872, when University College, Oxford, celebrated
the thousandth anniversary of its foundation, Lord Sherbrooke,
as an old Member of the College, made the speech
of the evening. His theme was a complaint of the iconoclastic
tendency of New Historians. Nothing was safe
from their sacrilegious research. Every tradition, however
venerable, however precious, was resolved into a myth or a
fable. "For example," he said, "we have always believed
that certain lands which this college owns in Berkshire were
<a name="Page_186"></a>given to us by King Alfred. Now the New
Historians
come and tell us that this could not have been the case,
because they can prove that the lands in question never
belonged to the King. It seems to me that the New Historians
prove too much&#8212;indeed, they prove the very point
which they contest. If the lands had belonged to the King,
he would probably have kept them to himself; but as they
belonged to some one else, he made a handsome present of
them to the College."</p>
<p>Lord Beaconsfield's excellence in conversation lay rather
in studied epigrams than in impromptu repartees. But in his
old electioneering contests he used sometimes to make very
happy hits. When he came forward, a young, penniless,
unknown coxcomb, to contest High Wycombe against the
dominating Whiggery of the Greys and the Carringtons,
some one in the crowd shouted, "We know all about Colonel
Grey; but pray what do you stand on?" "I stand on my
head," was the prompt reply, to which Mr. Gladstone always
rendered unstinted admiration. At Aylesbury the Radical
leader had been a man of notoriously profligate life, and
when Mr. Disraeli came to seek re-election as Tory Chancellor
of the Exchequer this tribune of the people produced
at the hustings the Radical manifesto which Mr. Disraeli
had issued twenty years before. "What do you say to that,
sir?" "I say that we all sow our wild oats, and no one knows
the meaning of that phrase better than you, Mr.----."</p>
<p>A member of the diplomatic service at Rome in the old
days of the Temporal Power had the honour of an interview
with Pio Nono. The Pope graciously offered him a cigar&#8212;"I
am told you will find this very fine." The Englishman
made that stupidest of all answers, "Thank your Holiness,
but I have no vices." "This isn't a vice; if it was you
would have it." Another repartee from the Vatican reached
me a few years ago, when the German Emperor paid his
visit to Leo XIII. Count Herbert Bismarck was in attend<a
 name="Page_187"></a>ance
on his Imperial master, and when they reached the
door of the Pope's audience-chamber the Emperor passed
in, and the Count tried to follow. A gentleman of the
Papal Court motioned him to stand back, as there must be
no third person at the interview between the Pope and the
Emperor. "I am Count Herbert Bismarck," shouted the
German, as he struggled to follow his master. "That,"
replied the Roman, with calm dignity, "may account for,
but it does not excuse, your conduct."</p>
<p>But, after all these "fash'nable fax and polite annygoats,"
as Thackeray would have called them, after all these engaging
courtesies of kings and prelates and great ladies, I think
that the honours in the way of repartee rest with the little
Harrow boy who was shouting himself hoarse in the jubilation
of victory after an Eton and Harrow match at Lord's in
which Harrow had it hollow. To him an Eton boy, of corresponding
years, severely observed, "Well, you Harrow
fellows needn't be so beastly cocky. When you wanted a
Head Master you had to come to Eton to get one." The
small Harrovian was dumfounded for a moment, and then,
pulling himself together for a final effort of deadly sarcasm,
exclaimed, "Well, at any rate, no one can say that we ever
produced a Mr. Gladstone."</p>

<h2>TITLES.</h2>
<p>The List of Honours, usually published on Her Majesty's
Birthday, is this year<a name="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
reserved till the Jubilee Day,
and to sanguine aspirants I would say, in Mrs. Gamp's
immortal words, "Seek not to proticipate." Such a list
always contains food for the reflective mind, and some of
the thoughts which it suggests may even lie too deep for
tears. Why is my namesake picked out for knighthood,
while I remain hidden in my native obscurity? Why is my
rival made a C.B., while I "go forth Companionless" to meet
the chances and the vexations of another year? But there
is balm in Gilead. If I have fared badly, my friends have
done little better. Like Mr. Squeers, when Bolder's father was
two pound ten short, they have had their disappointments to
contend against. A., who was so confident of a peerage, is
fobbed off with a baronetcy; and B., whose labours for the
Primrose League entitled him to expect the Bath, finds
himself grouped with the Queen's footmen in the Royal
Victorian Order. As, when Sir Robert Peel declined to
form a Government in 1839, "twenty gentlemen who had
not been appointed Under Secretaries for State moaned over
the martyrdom of young ambition," so during the first fortnight
of 1897 at least that number of middle-aged self-seekers
came to the regretful conclusion that Lord Salisbury
<a name="Page_189"></a>was not sufficiently a man of the world for his
present position,
and inwardly asked why a judge or a surgeon should be
preferred before a company-promoter or a party hack. And,
while feeling is thus fermenting at the base of the social
edifice, things are not really tranquil at the summit.</p>
<p>It is not long since the chief of the princely House of
Duff was raised to the first order of the peerage, and one
or two opulent earls, encouraged by his example, are understood
to be looking upward. Every constitutional Briton,
whatever his political creed, has in his heart of hearts a
wholesome reverence for a dukedom. Lord Beaconsfield,
who understood these little traits of our national character
even more perfectly than Thackeray, says of his favourite
St. Aldegonde (who was heir to the richest dukedom in the
kingdom) that "he held extreme opinions, especially on
political affairs, being a Republican of the reddest dye.
He was opposed to all privilege, and indeed to all orders
of men except dukes, who were a necessity." That is
a delicious touch. St. Aldegonde, whatever his political
aberrations, "voiced" the universal sentiment of his less
fortunate fellow-citizens; nor can the most soaring ambition
of the British Matron desire a nobler epitaph than that of
the lady immortalized by Thomas Ingoldsby:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"She drank prussic acid without any water,</p>
<p>And died like a Duke-and-a-Duchess's daughter."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As, according to Dr. Johnson, all claret would be port
if it could, so, presumably, every marquis would like to be
a duke; and yet, as a matter of fact, that Elysian translation
is not often made. A marquis, properly regarded, is not
so much a nascent duke as a magnified earl. A shrewd
observer of the world once said to me: "When an earl
gets a marquisate, it is worth a hundred thousand pounds
in hard money to his family." The explanation of this
cryptic utterance is that, whereas an earl's younger sons are
"<a name="Page_190"></a>misters," a marquis's younger sons are "lords."
Each
"my lord" can make a "my lady," and therefore commands
a distinctly higher price in the marriage-market of a
wholesomely-minded community. Miss Higgs, with her fifty
thousand pounds, might scorn the notion of becoming the
Honourable Mrs. Percy Popjoy; but as Lady Magnus
Charters she would feel a laudable ambition gratified.</p>
<p>An earldom is, in its combination of euphony, antiquity,
and association, perhaps the most impressive of all the titles
in the peerage. Most rightly did the fourteenth Earl of
Derby decline to be degraded into a brand-new duke. An
earldom has always been the right of a Prime Minister
who wishes to leave the Commons. In 1880 a member of
the House of Russell (in which there are certain Whiggish
traditions of jobbery) was fighting a hotly contested election,
and his ardent supporters brought out a sarcastic placard&#8212;
"Benjamin, Earl of Beaconsfield! He made himself an
earl and the people poor"; to which a rejoinder was
instantly forthcoming&#8212;"John, Earl Russell! He made
himself an earl and his relations rich." The amount of
truth in the two statements was about equal. In 1885
this order of the peerage missed the greatest distinction
which fate is likely ever to offer it, when Mr. Gladstone
declined the earldom proffered by her Majesty on his
retirement from office. Had he accepted, it was understood
that the representatives of the last Earl of Liverpool
would have waived their claims to the extinct title, and the
greatest of the Queen's Prime Ministers would have borne
the name of the city which gave him birth.</p>
<p>But, magnificent and euphonious as an earldom is, the
children of an earl are the half-castes of the peerage. The
eldest son is "my lord," and his sisters are "my lady;"
and ever since the days of Mr. Foker, Senior, it has been
<i>de rigueur</i> for an opulent brewer to marry an earl's daughter;
but the younger sons are not distinguishable from the igno<a
 name="Page_191"></a>minious
progeny of viscounts and barons. Two little boys,
respectively the eldest and the second son of an earl, were
playing on the front staircase of their home, when the
eldest fell over into the hall below. The younger called
to the footman who picked his brother up, "Is he hurt?"
"Killed, <i>my lord</i>," was the instantanteous reply of a servant
who knew the devolution of a courtesy title.</p>
<p>As the marquises people the debatable land between the
dukes and the earls, so do the viscounts between the earls
and the barons. A child whom Matthew Arnold was
examining in grammar once wrote of certain words which
he found it hard to classify under their proper parts of
speech that they were "thrown into the common sink,
which is adverbs." I hope I shall not be considered guilty
of any disrespect if I say that ex-Speakers, ex-Secretaries
of State, successful generals, and ambitious barons who
are not quite good enough for earldoms, are "thrown into
the common sink, which is viscounts." Not only heralds
and genealogists, but every one who has the historic sense,
must have felt an emotion of regret when the splendid title
of twenty-third Baron Dacre was merged by Mr. Speaker
Brand in the pinchbeck dignity of first Viscount Hampden.</p>
<p>After viscounts, barons. The baronage of England is
headed by the bishops; but, as we have already discoursed
of those right reverend peers, we, Dante-like, will not reason
of them, but pass on&#8212;only remarking, as we pass, that
it is held on good authority that no human being ever
experiences a rapture so intense as an American bishop
from a Western State when he first hears himself called
"My lord" at a London dinner-party. After the spiritual
barons come the secular barons&#8212;the "common or garden"
peers of the United Kingdom. Of these there are considerably
more than three hundred; and of all, except some
thirty or forty at the most, it may be said without offence
that they are products of the opulent Middle Class. Pitt
<a name="Page_192"></a>destroyed deliberately and for ever the
exclusive character
of the British peerage when, as Lord Beaconsfield said, he
"created a plebeian aristocracy and blended it with the
patrician oligarchy." And in order to gain admission to
this "plebeian aristocracy" men otherwise reasonable and
honest will spend incredible sums, undergo prodigious
exertions, associate themselves with the basest intrigues,
and perform the most unblushing tergiversations. Lord
Houghton told me that he said to a well-known politician
who boasted that he had refused a peerage: "Then you
made a great mistake. A peerage would have secured you
three things that you are much in need of&#8212;social consideration,
longer credit with your tradesmen, and better
marriages for your younger children."</p>
<p>It is unlucky that a comparatively recent change has put
it out of the power of a Prime Minister to create fresh Irish
peers, for an Irish peerage was a cheap and convenient
method of rewarding political service.<a name="FNanchor_24"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Lord Palmerston
held that, combining social rank with eligibility to the House
of Commons, it was the most desirable distinction for a
politician. Pitt, when his banker Mr. Smith (who lived in
Whitehall) desired the privilege of driving through the Horse
Guards, said: "No, I can't give you that; but I will make
you an Irish peer;" and the banker became the first Lord
Carrington.</p>
<p>What is a Baronet? ask some. Sir Wilfrid Lawson (who
ought to know) replies that he is a man "who has ceased to
be a gentleman and has not become a nobleman." But this
is too severe a judgment. It breathes a spirit of contempt
bred of familiarity, which may, without irreverence, be
assumed by a member of an exalted Order, but which a
humble outsider would do well to avoid. As Major
Pendennis said of a similar manifestation, "It sits prettily
<a name="Page_193"></a>enough on a young patrician in early life,
though, nothing is
so loathsome among persons of our rank." I turn, therefore,
for an answer to Sir Bernard Burke, who says: "The
hereditary Order of Baronets was created by patent in
England by King James I. in 1611. At the institution
many of the chief estated gentlemen of the kingdom were
selected for the dignity. The first batch of Baronets comprised
some of the principal landed proprietors among the
best-descended gentlemen of the kingdom, and the list was
headed by a name illustrious more than any other for the
intellectual pre-eminence with which it is associated&#8212;the
name of Bacon. The Order of Baronets is scarcely estimated
at its proper value."</p>
<p>I cannot help feeling that this account of the baronetage,
though admirable in tone and spirit, and actually pathetic in
its closing touch of regretful melancholy, is a little wanting
in what the French would call "actuality." It leaves out of
sight the most endearing, because the most human, trait of
the baronetage&#8212;its pecuniary origin. On this point let us
hear the historian Hume&#8212;"The title of Baronet was sold
and two hundred patents of that species of knighthood were
disposed of for so many thousand pounds." This was truly
epoch-making. It was one of those "actions of the just"
which "smell sweet and blossom in the dust." King James's
baronets were the models and precursors of all who to the
end of time should traffic in the purchase of honours. Their
example has justified posterity, and the precedent which they
set is to-day the principal method by which the war-chests
of our political parties are replenished.</p>
<p>Another authority, handling the same high theme, tells
us that the rebellion in Ulster gave rise to this Order, and
"it was required of each baronet on his creation to pay into
the Exchequer as much as would maintain thirty soldiers
three years at eight-pence a day in the province of Ulster,"
and, as a historical memorial of their original service, the
<a name="Page_194"></a>baronets bear as an augmentation to their
coats-of-arms the
royal badge of Ulster&#8212;a Bloody Hand on a white field. It
was in apt reference to this that a famous Whip, on learning
that a baronet of his party was extremely anxious to be promoted
to the peerage, said, "You can tell Sir Peter Proudflesh,
with my compliments, that we don't do these things
for nothing. If he wants a peerage, he will have to put his
Bloody Hand into his pocket."</p>
<p>For the female mind the baronetage has a peculiar fascination.
As there was once a female Freemason, so there was
once a female baronet&#8212;Dame Maria Bolles, of Osberton, in
the County of Nottingham. The rank of a baronet's wife is
not unfrequently conferred on the widow of a man to whom
a baronetcy had been promised and who died too soon to
receive it. "Call me a vulgar woman!" screamed a lady
once prominent in society when a good-natured friend repeated
a critical comment. "Call me a vulgar woman! me,
who was Miss Blank, of Blank Hall, and if I had been a boy
should have been a baronet!"</p>
<p>The baronets of fiction are, like their congeners in real life,
a numerous and a motley band. Lord Beaconsfield described,
with a brilliancy of touch which was all his own, the labours
and the sacrifices of Sir Vavasour Firebrace on behalf of the
Order of Baronets and the privileges wrongfully withheld
from them. "They are evidently the body destined to save
this country; blending all sympathies&#8212;the Crown, of which
they are the peculiar champions: the nobles, of whom they
are the popular branch; the people, who recognize in them
their natural leaders.... Had the poor King lived, we
should at least have had the Badge," added Sir Vavasour
mournfully.</p>
<p>"The Badge?"</p>
<p>"It would have satisfied Sir Grosvenor le Draughte; he
was for compromise. But, confound him, his father was
only an accoucheur."</p>
<p><a name="Page_195"></a>A great merit of the baronets, from the
novelist's point of
view, is that they and their belongings are so uncommonly
easy to draw. He is Sir Grosvenor, his wife is Lady le
Draughte, his sons, elder and younger, are Mr. le Draughte,
and his daughters Miss le Draughte. The wayfaring men,
though fools, cannot err where the rule is so simple, and
accordingly the baronets enjoy a deserved popularity with
those novelists who look up to the titled classes of society
as men look at the stars, but are a little puzzled about their
proper designations. Miss Braddon alone has drawn more
baronets, virtuous and vicious, handsome and hideous, than
would have colonized Ulster ten times over and left a residue
for Nova Scotia. Sir Pitt Crawley and Sir Barnes Newcome
will live as long as English novels are read, and I hope that
dull forgetfulness will never seize as its prey Sir Alfred
Mogyns Smyth de Mogyns, who was born Alfred Smith
Muggins, but traced a descent from Hogyn Mogyn of the
Hundred Beeves, and took for his motto "Ung Roy ung
Mogyns." His pedigree is drawn in the seventh chapter of
the <i>Book of Snobs</i>, and is imitated with great fidelity on more
than one page of Burke's Peerage.</p>
<p>An eye closely intent upon the lesser beauties of the
natural world will find a very engaging specimen of the
genus Baronet in Sir Barnet Skettles, who was so kind
to Paul Dombey and so angry with poor Mr. Baps. Sir
Leicester Dedlock is on a larger scale&#8212;in fact, almost too
"fine and large" for life. But I recall a fleeting vision of
perfect loveliness among Miss Monflathers's pupils&#8212;"a
baronet's daughter who by some extraordinary reversal of
the laws of Nature was not only plain in feature but dull in
intellect."</p>
<p>So far we have spoken only of hereditary honours; but
our review would be singularly incomplete if it excluded
those which are purely personal. Of these, of course, incomparably
the highest is the Order of the Garter, and its
<a name="Page_196"></a>most characteristic glory is that, in Lord
Melbourne's phrase,
"there is no d----d nonsense of merit about it." The Emperor
of Lilliput rewarded his courtiers with three fine silken
threads, one of which was blue, one green, and one red.
The Emperor held a stick horizontally, and the candidates
crept under it, backwards and forwards, several times. Whoever
showed the most agility in creeping was rewarded with
the blue thread.</p>
<p>Let us hope that the methods of chivalry have undergone
some modification since the days of Queen Anne, and that
the Blue Ribbon of the Garter, which ranks with the Golden
Fleece and makes its wearer a comrade of all the crowned
heads of Europe, is attained by arts more dignified than
those which awoke the picturesque satire of Dean Swift.
But I do not feel sure about it.</p>
<p>Great is the charm of a personal decoration. Byron
wrote:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ye stars, that are the poetry of heaven."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"A stupid line," says Mr. St. Barbe in <i>Endymion</i>; "he
should have written, 'Ye stars, that are the poetry of
dress.'" North of the Tweed the green thread of Swift's
imagination&#8212;"the most ancient and most noble Order of
the Thistle"&#8212;is scarcely less coveted than the supreme
honour of the Garter; but wild horses should not drag from
me the name of the Scottish peer of whom his political
leader said, "If I gave ---- the Thistle, he would eat it."
The Bath tries to make up by the lurid splendour of its
ribbon and the brilliancy of its star for its comparatively
humble and homely associations. It is the peculiar prize of
Generals and Home Secretaries, and is displayed with manly
openness on the bosom of the statesman once characteristically
described by Lord Beaconsfield as "Mr. Secretary
Cross, whom I can never remember to call Sir Richard."</p>
<p>But, after all said and done, the institution of knighthood
is older than any particular order of knights; and lovers of
<a name="Page_197"></a>the old world must observe with regret the
discredit into
which it has fallen since it became the guerdon of the successful
grocer. When Lord Beaconsfield left office in 1880
he conferred a knighthood&#8212;the first of a long series similarly
bestowed&#8212;on an eminent journalist. The friends of the
new knight were inclined to banter him, and proposed his
health at a dinner in facetious terms. Lord Beaconsfield,
who was of the company, looked preternaturally grave, and,
filling his glass, gazed steadily at the flattered editor and said
in his deepest tone: "Yes, Sir A.B., I drink to your good
health, and I congratulate you on having attained a rank
which was deemed sufficient honour for Sir Philip Sidney
and Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Christopher
Wren."</p>
<p>But a truce to this idle jesting on exalted themes&#8212;too
palpably the utterance of social envy and mortified ambition.
"They <i>are</i> our superiors, and that's the fact," as Thackeray
exclaims in his chapter on the Whigs. "I am not a Whig
myself; but, oh, how I should like to be one!" In a
similar spirit of compunctious self-abasement, the present
writer may exclaim, "I have not myself been included in
the list of Birthday Honours,&#8212;but, oh, how I should like to
be there!"<br>

<h2>THE QUEEN'S ACCESSION.</h2>
<p>The writer of these chapters would not willingly fall
behind his countrymen in the loyal sentiments and
picturesque memories proper to the "high mid-summer
pomps" which begin to-morrow.<a name="FNanchor_25"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> But there is an
almost insuperable difficulty in finding anything to write
which shall be at once new and true; and this chapter must
therefore consist mainly of extracts. As the sun of August
brings out wasps, so the genial influence of the Jubilee has
produced an incredible abundance of fibs, myths, and fables.
They have for their subject the early days of our Gracious
Sovereign, and round that central theme they play with every
variety of picturesque inventiveness. Nor has invention
alone been at work. Research has been equally busy.
Miss Wynn's description, admirable in its simplicity, of the
manner in which the girl queen received the news of her
accession was given to the world by Abraham Hayward in
<i>Diaries of a Lady of Quality</i> a generation ago. Within the
last month it must have done duty a hundred times.</p>
<p>Scarcely less familiar is the more elaborate but still impressive
passage from <i>Sybil</i>, in which Lord Beaconsfield
described the same event. And yet, as far as my observation
has gone, the citations from this fine description have always
stopped short just at the opening of the most appropriate
<a name="Page_199"></a>passage; my readers, at any rate, shall see it
and judge it
for themselves. If there is one feature in the national life
of the last sixty years on which Englishmen may justly pride
themselves it is the amelioration of the social condition of
the workers. Putting aside all ecclesiastical revivals, all
purely political changes, and all appeals, however successful,
to the horrible arbitrament of the sword, it is Social Reform
which has made the Queen's reign memorable and glorious.
The first incident of that reign was described in <i>Sybil</i> not
only with vivid observation of the present, but with something
of prophetic insight into the future.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In a sweet and thrilling voice, and with a composed
mien which indicates rather the absorbing sense of august
duty than an absence of emotion, THE QUEEN announces
her accession to the throne of her ancestors, and her humble
hope that Divine Providence will guard over the fulfilment
of her lofty trust. The prelates and captains and chief men
of her realm then advance to the throne, and, kneeling
before her, pledge their troth and take the sacred oaths of
allegiance and supremacy&#8212;allegiance to one who rules over
the land that the great Macedonian could not conquer, and
over a continent of which Columbus never dreamed: to the
Queen of every sea, and of nations in every zone.</p>
  <p>"It is not of these that I would speak, but of a nation
nearer her footstool, and which at this moment looks to her
with anxiety, with affection, perhaps with hope. Fair and
serene, she has the blood and beauty of the Saxon. Will
it be her proud destiny at length to bear relief to suffering
millions, and with that soft hand which might inspire troubadours
and guerdon knights, break the last links in the chain
of Saxon thraldom?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To-day, with pride and thankfulness, chastened though
it be by our sense of national shortcomings, we can answer
<i>Yes</i> to this wistful question of genius and humanity. We
have seen the regulation of dangerous labour, the protection
<a name="Page_200"></a>of women and children from excessive toil, the
removal of
the tax on bread, the establishment of a system of national
education; and in Macaulay's phrase, a point which yesterday
was invisible is our goal to-day, and will be our starting-post
to-morrow.</p>
<p>Her Majesty ascended the throne on the 20th of June
1837, and on the 29th the <i>Times</i> published a delightfully
characteristic article against the Whig Ministers, "into whose
hands the all but infant and helpless Queen has been compelled
by her unhappy condition to deliver up herself and
her indignant people." Bating one word, this might be an
extract from an article on the formation of Mr. Gladstone's
Home Rule Government. Surely the consistency of the
<i>Times</i> in evil-speaking is one of the most precious of our
national possessions: On the 30th of June the Royal
Assent was given by commission to forty Bills&#8212;the first
Bills which became law in the Queen's reign; and, the
clerks in the House of Lords having been accustomed ever
since the days of Queen Anne to say "his Majesty" and
"Le Roy le veult," there was hopeless bungling over the
feminine appellations, now after 130 years revived. However,
the Bills scrambled through somehow, and among them
was the Act which abolished the pillory&#8212;an auspicious
commencement of a humane and reforming reign. On the
8th of July came the rather belated burial of William IV. at
Windsor, and on the 11th the newly completed Buckingham
Palace was occupied for the first time, the Queen and the
Duchess of Kent moving thither from Kensington.</p>
<p>On the 17th of July, Parliament was prorogued by the
Queen in person. Her Majesty's first Speech from the
Throne referred to friendly relations with Foreign Powers,
the diminution of capital punishment, and "discreet improvements
in ecclesiastical institutions." It was read in a clear
and musical voice, with a fascinating grace of accent and
elocution which never faded from the memory of those who
<a name="Page_201"></a>heard it. As long as her Majesty continued to
open and
prorogue Parliament in person the same perfection of delivery
was always noticed. An old M.P., by no means inclined to
be a courtier, told me that when her Majesty approached
the part of her speech relating to the estimates, her way of
uttering the words "Gentlemen of the House of Commons"
was the most winning address he had ever heard: it gave
to an official demand the character of a personal request.
After the Prince Consort's death, the Queen did not again
appear at Westminster till the opening of the new Parliament
in 1866. On that occasion the speech was read by the Lord
Chancellor, and the same usage has prevailed whenever her
Majesty has opened Parliament since that time. But on
several occasions of late years she has read her reply to
addresses presented by public bodies, and I well recollect
that at the opening of the Imperial Institute in 1893,
though the <i>timbre</i> of her voice was deeper than in early
years, the same admirable elocution made every syllable
audible.</p>
<p>In June 1837 the most lively emotion in the masses of
the people was the joy of a great escape. I have said before
that grave men, not the least given to exaggeration, told me
their profound conviction that, had Ernest Duke of Cumberland succeeded
to the throne on the death of William IV.,
no earthly power could have averted a revolution. The
plots of which the Duke was the centre have been described
with a due commixture of history and romance in Mr. Allen
Upward's fascinating story, <i>God save the Queen</i>. Into the
causes of his intense unpopularity, this is not the occasion
to enter; but let me just describe a curious print of the
year 1837 which lies before me as I write. It is headed
"The Contrast," and is divided into two panels. On your
left hand is a young girl, simply dressed in mourning, with
a pearl necklace and a gauzy shawl, and her hair coiled in
plaits, something after the fashion of a crown. Under this
<a name="Page_202"></a>portrait is "<i>Victoria</i>." On the other side
of the picture is a
hideous old man, with shaggy eyebrows and scowling gaze,
wrapped in a military cloak with fur collar and black stock.
Under this portrait is "<i>Ernest</i>" and running the whole
length of the picture is the legend:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Look here upon <i>this</i> picture&#8212;and&#8212;on this,</p>
<p>The counterfeit presentment of two sov'reigns."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This print was given to me by a veteran Reformer, who
told me that it expressed in visible form the universal sentiment
of England. That sentiment was daily and hourly
confirmed by all that was heard and seen of the girl-queen.
We read of her walking with a gallant suite upon the terrace
at Windsor; dressed in scarlet uniform and mounted on her
roan charger, to receive with uplifted hand the salute of her
troops; or seated on the throne of the Plantagenets at the
opening of her Parliament, and invoking the Divine benediction
on the labours which should conduce to "the welfare and
contentment of My people." We see her yielding her bright
intelligence to the constitutional guidance, wise though
worldly, of her first Prime Minister, the sagacious Melbourne.
And then, when the exigencies of parliamentary
government forced her to exchange her Whig advisers for
the Tories, we see her carrying out with exact propriety the
lessons taught by "the friend of her youth," and extending
to each premier in turn, whether personally agreeable to her
or not, the same absolute confidence and loyalty.</p>
<p>As regards domestic life, we have been told by Mr.
Gladstone that "even among happy marriages her marriage
was exceptional, so nearly did the union of thought, heart,
and action both fulfil the ideal and bring duality near to the
borders of identity."</p>
<p>And so twenty years went on, full of an ever-growing
popularity, and a purifying influence on the tone of
society never fully realized till the personal presence was
<a name="Page_203"></a>withdrawn. And then came the blow which crushed
her
life&#8212;"the sun going down at noon"&#8212;and total disappearance
from all festivity and parade and social splendour, but
never from political duty. In later years we have seen the
gradual resumption of more public offices; the occasional
reappearances, so earnestly anticipated by her subjects, and
hedged with something of a divinity more than regal; the
incomparable majesty of personal bearing which has taught
so many an onlooker that dignity has nothing to do with
height, or beauty or splendour of raiment; and, mingled
with that majesty and unspeakably enhancing it, the human
sympathy with suffering and sorrow, which has made Queen
Victoria, as none of her predecessors ever was or could be,
the Mother of her People.</p>
<p>And the response of the English people to that sympathy&#8212;the
recognition of that motherhood&#8212;is written, not only
in the printed records of the reign, but on the "fleshly
tables" of English hearts. Let one homely citation suffice
as an illustration. It is taken from a letter of condolence
addressed to the Queen in 1892, on the death of Prince
"Eddie," Duke of Clarence:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: center;">"<i>To our beloved Queen, Victoria</i>.</p>
  <p>"Dear Lady,&#8212;We, the surviving widows and mothers of
some of the men and boys who lost their lives by the explosion
which occurred in the Oaks Colliery, near Barnsley,
in December 1866, desire to tell your Majesty how stunned
we all feel by the cruel and unexpected blow which has
taken 'Prince Eddie' from his dear Grandmother, his
loving parents, his beloved intended, and an admiring nation.
The sad news affected us deeply, we all believing that his
youthful strength would carry him through the danger. Dear
Lady, we feel more than we can express. To tell you that
we sincerely condole with your Majesty and the Prince and
Princess of Wales in your and their sad bereavement and great <a
 name="Page_204"></a>distress is not to tell you all we feel; but
the
widow of Albert
the Good and the parents of Prince Eddie will understand
what we feel when we say that we feel all that widows and
mothers feel who have lost those who were dear as life to
them. Dear Lady, we remember with gratitude all that you
did for us Oaks widows in the time of our great trouble, and
we cannot forget you in yours. We have not forgotten that
it was you, dear Queen, who set the example, so promptly
followed by all feeling people, of forming a fund for the
relief of our distress&#8212;a fund which kept us out of the
workhouse at the time and has kept us out ever since....
We wish it were in our power, dear Lady, to dry up your
tears and comfort you, but that we cannot do. But what
we can do, and will do, is to pray God, in His mercy and
goodness, to comfort and strengthen you in this your time
of great trouble.&#8212;Wishing your Majesty, the Prince and
Princess of Wales, and the Princess May all the strength,
consolation, and comfort which God alone can give, and
which He never fails to give to all who seek Him in truth
and sincerity, we remain, beloved Queen, your loving and
grateful though sorrowing subjects,</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">"THE OAKS WIDOWS."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The historic associations, half gay, half sad, of the week
on which we are just entering tempt me to linger on this
fascinating theme, and I cannot illustrate it better than by
quoting the concluding paragraphs from a sermon, which
now has something of the dignity of fulfilled prophecy, and
which was preached by Sydney Smith in St. Paul's Cathedral
on the Sunday after the Queen's accession.</p>
<p>The sermon is throughout a noble composition, grandly
conceived and admirably expressed. It begins with some
grave reflections on the "folly and nothingness of all things
human" as exemplified by the death of a king. It goes on
to enforce on the young Queen the paramount duties of
<a name="Page_205"></a>educating her people, avoiding war, and
cultivating personal
religion. It concludes with the following passage, which in
its letter, or at least in its spirit, might well find a place in
some of to-morrow's sermons:&#8212;"The Patriot Queen, whom
I am painting, reverences the National Church, frequents its
worship, and regulates her faith by its precepts; but she
withstands the encroachments and keeps down the ambition
natural to Establishments, and, by rendering the privileges
of the Church compatible with the civil freedom of all
sects, confers strength upon and adds duration to that
wise and magnificent institution. And then this youthful
Monarch, profoundly but wisely religious, disdaining hypocrisy,
and far above the childish follies of false piety, casts
herself upon God, and seeks from the Gospel of His blessed
Son a path for her steps and a comfort for her soul. Here
is a picture which warms every English heart, and would
bring all this congregation upon their bended knees to pray
it may be realized. What limits to the glory and happiness
of the native land if the Creator should in His mercy have
placed in the heart of this royal woman the rudiments of
wisdom and mercy? And if, giving them time to expand,
and to bless our children's children with her goodness, He
should grant to her a long sojourning upon earth, and leave
her to reign over us till she is well stricken in years, what
glory! what happiness! what joy! what bounty of God! I of
course can only expect to see the beginning of such a splendid
period; but when I do see it I shall exclaim with the pious
Simeon&#8212;'Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.'"</p>
<p>As respects the avoidance of war, the event has hardly
accorded with the aspiration. It is melancholy to recall
the idealist enthusiasms which preceded the Exhibition of
1851, and to contrast them with the realities of the present
hour. Then the arts of industry and the competitions of
peace were to supplant for ever the science of bloodshed.
<a name="Page_206"></a>Nations were to beat their swords into
ploughshares and
their spears into pruning-hooks, and men were not to learn
war any more. And this was on the eve of the Crimea&#8212;the
most ruinous, the most cruel, and the least justifiable of
all campaigns. In one corner of the world or another, the
war-drum has throbbed almost without intermission from
that day to this.</p>
<p>But when we turn to other aspirations the retrospect is
more cheerful. Slavery has been entirely abolished, and,
with all due respect to Mr. George Curzon, is not going to
be re-established under the British flag. The punishment
of death, rendered infinitely more impressive, and therefore
more deterrent, by its withdrawal from the public gaze, is
reserved for offences which even Romilly would not have
condoned. The diminution of crime is an acknowledged
fact. Better laws and improved institutions&#8212;judicial, political,
social, sanitary&#8212;we flatter ourselves that we may claim.
National Education dates from 1870, and its operation during
a quarter of a century has changed the face of the industrial
world. Queen Victoria in her later years reigns over an
educated people.</p>
<p>Of the most important theme of all&#8212;our national advance
in religion, morality, and the principles of humane living&#8212;I
have spoken in previous chapters, and this is not the occasion
for anything but the briefest recapitulation. "Where is
boasting? It is excluded." There is much to be thankful
for, much to encourage: something to cause anxiety, and
nothing to justify bombast. No one believes more profoundly
than I do in the providential mission of the English
race, and the very intensity of my faith in that mission
makes me even painfully anxious that we should interpret it
aright. Men who were undergraduates at Oxford in the
'seventies learned the interpretation, in words of unsurpassable
beauty, from John Ruskin:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There is a destiny now possible to us&#8212;the highest ever <a
 name="Page_207"></a>set before a nation, to be accepted or
refused.
We are still
undegenerate in race; a race mingled of the best northern
blood. We are not yet dissolute in temper, but still have
the firmness to govern and the grace to obey. We have
been taught a religion of pure mercy, which we must either
now finally betray or learn to defend by fulfilling. And we
are rich in an inheritance of honour, bequeathed to us
through a thousand years of noble history, which it should
be our daily thirst to increase with splendid avarice, so that
Englishmen, if it be a sin to covet honour, should be the
most offending souls alive.</p>
  <p>"Within the last few years we have had the laws of natural
science opened to us with a rapidity which has been blinded
by its brightness, and means of transit and communication
given to us which have made but one kingdom of the habitable
globe. One kingdom&#8212;but who is to be its King?
Is there to be no King in it, think you, and every man to
do that which is right in his own eyes? Or only kings of
terror, and the obscene Empires of Mammon and Belial?
Or will you, youths of England, make your country again a
royal throne of Kings, a sceptred isle, for all the world a
source of light, a centre of peace; mistress of learning and
of the arts; faithful guardian of great memories in the midst
of irreverent and ephemeral visions; faithful servant of
time-tried principles, under temptation from fond experiments
and licentious desires; and amidst the cruel and clamorous
jealousies of the nations, worshipped in her strange valour
of good will towards men?"<br>

<h2>"PRINCEDOMS, VIRTUES, POWERS."</h2>
<br>
<p>The celebrations of the past week<a name="FNanchor_26"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> have set us all upon
a royal tack. Diary-keepers have turned back to
their earliest volumes for stories of the girl-queen; there
has been an unprecedented run on the <i>Annual Register</i>
for 1837; and every rusty print of Princess Victoria in the
costume of Kate Nickleby has been paraded as a pearl of
price. As I always pride myself on following what Mr.
Matthew Arnold used to call "the great mundane movement,"
I have been careful to obey the impulse of the hour.
I have cudgelled my memory for Collections and Recollections
suitable to this season of retrospective enthusiasm.
Last week I endeavoured to touch some of the more serious
aspects of the Jubilee, but now that the great day has come
and gone&#8212;"Bedtime, Hal, and all well"&#8212;a lighter handling
of the majestic theme may not be esteemed unpardonable.</p>
<p>Those of my fellow-chroniclers who have blacked themselves
all over for the part have acted on the principle that
no human life can be properly understood without an exhaustive
knowledge of its grandfathers and grandmothers.
They have resuscitated George III. and called Queen Charlotte
from her long home. With a less heroic insistence on
the historic method, I leave grandparents out of sight, and
begin my gossip with the Queen's uncles. Of George IV.
<a name="Page_209"></a>it is less necessary that I should speak, for
has not his character
been drawn by Thackeray in his <i>Lectures on the Four
Georges?</i></p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The dandy of sixty, who bows with a grace,</p>
<p>And has taste in wigs, collars, cuirasses, and lace;</p>
<p>Who to tricksters and fools leaves the State and its treasure,</p>
<p>And, while Britain's in tears, sails about at his pleasure,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>was styled, as we all know, "the First Gentleman in Europe."
I forget if I have previously narrated the following instance
of gentlemanlike conduct. If I have, it will bear repetition.
The late Lord Charles Russell (1807-1894), when a youth
of eighteen, had just received a commission in the Blues,
and was commanded, with the rest of his regiment, to a full-dress
ball at Carlton House, where the King then held his
Court. Unluckily for his peace of mind, the young subaltern
dressed at his father's house, and, not being used to the
splendid paraphernalia of the Blues' uniform, he omitted to
put on his aiguillette. Arrived at Carlton House the company,
before they could enter the ball-room, had to advance
in single file along a corridor in which the old King, bewigged
and bestarred, was seated on a sofa. When the
hapless youth who lacked the aiguillette approached the
presence, he heard a very high voice exclaim, "Who is this
d&#8212;d fellow?" Retreat was impossible, and there was nothing
for it but to shuffle on and try to pass the King without
further rebuke. Not a bit of it. As he neared the sofa
the King exclaimed, "Good evening, sir. I suppose you
are the regimental doctor?" and the imperfectly-accoutred
youth, covered with confusion as with a cloak, fled blushing
into the ball-room, and hid himself from further observation.
And yet the narrator of this painful story always declared
that George IV. could be very gracious when the fancy took
him; that he was uniformly kind to children; and that on
public occasions his manner was the perfection of kingly
courtesy. His gorgeous habits and profuse expenditure
<a name="Page_210"></a>made him strangely popular. The people, though
they
detested his conduct, thought him "every inch a King."
Lord Shaftesbury, noting in his diary for the 19th of May
1849 the attempt of Hamilton upon the Queen's life,
writes:&#8212;"The profligate George IV. passed through a life
of selfishness and sin without a single proved attempt to
take it. This mild and virtuous young woman has four
times already been exposed to imminent peril."</p>
<p>The careers of the King's younger brothers and sisters
would fill a volume of "queer stories." Of the Duke of
York Mr. Goldwin Smith genially remarks that "the only
meritorious action of his life was that he once risked it in a
duel." The Duke of Clarence&#8212;Burns's "Young royal Tarry
Breeks"&#8212;lived in disreputable seclusion till he ascended
the throne, and then was so excited by his elevation that
people thought he was going mad. The Duke of Cumberland
was the object of a popular detestation of which the
grounds can be discovered in the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1810.
The Duke of Sussex made two marriages in defiance of
the Royal Marriage Act, and took a political part as active
on the Liberal side as that of the Duke of Cumberland
among the Tories. The Duke of Cambridge is chiefly
remembered by his grotesque habit (recorded, by the way,
in <i>Happy Thoughts</i>) of making loud responses of his own
invention to the service in church. "Let us pray," said
the clergyman: "By all means," said the Duke. The
clergyman begins the prayer for rain: the Duke exclaims,
"No good as long as the wind is in the east."</p>
<p><i>Clergyman</i>: "'Zacchaeus stood forth and said, Behold,
Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor.'"</p>
<p><i>Duke</i>: "Too much, too much; don't mind tithes, but
can't stand that." To two of the Commandments, which
I decline to discriminate, the Duke's responses were&#8212;"Quite
right, quite right, but very difficult sometimes;'"
and "No, no! It was my brother Ernest did that."</p>
<p><a name="Page_211"></a>Those who care to pursue these curious byways
of not
very ancient history are referred to the unfailing Greville;
to Lady Anne Hamilton's <i>Secret History of the Court of
England;</i> and to the <i>Recollections of a Lady of Quality</i>,
commonly ascribed to Lady Charlotte Bury. The closer
our acquaintance with the manners and habits of the last
age, even in what are called "the highest circles," the more
wonderful will appear the social transformation which dates
from her Majesty's accession. Thackeray spoke the words
of truth and soberness when, after describing the virtues and
the limitations of George III., he said: "I think we acknowledge
in the inheritrix of his sceptre a wiser rule and a life
as honourable and pure; and I am sure that the future
painter of our manners will pay a willing allegiance to that
good life, and be loyal to the memory of that unsullied
virtue."</p>
<p>For the earlier years of the Queen's reign Greville continues
to be a fairly safe guide, though his footing at the
palace was by no means so intimate as it had been in the
roistering days of George IV. and William IV. Of course,
her Majesty's own volumes and Sir Theodore Martin's <i>Life
of the Prince Consort</i> are of primary authority. Interesting
glimpses are to be caught in the first volume of Bishop Wilberforce's
Life, ere yet his tergiversation in the matter of
Bishop Hampden had forfeited the Royal favour; and the
historian of the future will probably make great use of the
Letters of Sarah Lady Lyttelton&#8212;Governess, to the Queen's
children&#8212;which, being printed for private circulation, are
unluckily withheld from the present generation.</p>
<p>A pleasing instance of the ultra-German etiquette fomented
by Prince Albert was told me by an eye-witness of the scene.
The Prime Minister and his wife were dining at Buckingham
Palace very shortly after they had received an addition to
their family. When the ladies retired to the drawing-room
after dinner, the Queen said most kindly to the Premier's
<a name="Page_212"></a>wife, "I know you are not very strong yet,
Lady ----; so
I beg you will sit down. And, when the Prince comes in,
Lady D---- shall stand in front of you." This device of
screening a breach of etiquette by hiding it behind the portly
figure of a British Matron always struck me as extremely
droll.</p>
<p>Courtly etiquette, with the conditions out of which it
springs and its effect upon the character of those who are
subjected to it, has, of course, been a favourite theme of
satirists time out of mind, and there can scarcely be a more
fruitful one. There are no heights to which it does not rise,
nor depths to which it does not sink. In the service for the
Queen's Accession the Christological psalms are boldly transferred
to the Sovereign by the calm substitution of "her" for
"Him." A few years back&#8212;I do not know if it is so now&#8212;
I noticed that in the prayer-books in St. George's Chapel at
Windsor all the pronouns which referred to the Holy Trinity
were spelt with small letters, and those which referred to the
Queen with capitals. So much for the heights of etiquette,
and for its depths we will go to Thackeray's account of an
incident stated to have occurred on the birth of the Duke of
Connaught:</p>

<p>Such was the etiquette of the Royal nursery in 1850; but
little Princes, even though ushered into the world under such
<a name="Page_213"></a>very impressive circumstances, grow up into
something not
very unlike other little boys when once they go to school. Of
course, in former days young Princes were educated at home
by private tutors. This was the education of the Queen's
uncles and of her sons. A very different experience has been
permitted to her grandsons. The Prince of Wales's boys, as
we all remember, were middies; Princess Christian's sons
were at Wellington; Prince Arthur of Connaught is at Eton.
There he is to be joined next year by the little Duke of
Albany, who is now at a private school in the New Forest.
He has among his schoolfellows his cousin Prince Alexander
of Battenberg, of whom a delightful story is current just now.<a
 name="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Like
many other little boys, he ran short of pocket money,
and wrote an ingenious letter to his august Grandmother
asking for some slight pecuniary assistance. He received in
return a just rebuke, telling him that little boys should keep
within their limits, and that he must wait till his allowance
next became due. Shortly afterwards the undefeated little
Prince resumed the correspondence in something like the
following form: "My dear Grandmamma,&#8212;I am sure you
will be glad to know that I need not trouble you for any
money just now, for I sold your last letter to another boy
here for 30s."</p>
<p>As Royalty emerges from infancy and boyhood into the
vulgar and artificial atmosphere of the grown-up world, it is
daily and hourly exposed to such sycophancy that Royal
persons acquire, quite unconsciously, a habit of regarding
every subject in heaven and earth in its relation to themselves.
An amusing instance of this occurred a few years
ago on an occasion when one of our most popular Princesses
expressed a gracious wish to present a very smart young
gentleman to the Queen. This young man had a remarkably
good opinion of himself; was the eldest son of a peer, and a
Member of Parliament; and it happened that he was also
<a name="Page_214"></a>related to a lady who belonged to one of the
Royal Households.
So the Princess led the young exquisite to the august
presence, and then sweetly said, "I present Mr.----, who
is"&#8212;not Lord Blank's eldest son or Member for Loamshire,
but&#8212;"nephew to dear Aunt Cambridge's lady." My young
friend told me that he had never till that moment realized
how completely he lacked a position of his own in the universe
of created being.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_215"></a>XXIII.</h2>
<h2>LORD BEACONSFIELD.</h2>
<p>Archbishop Tait wrote on the 11th of February
1877: "Attended this week the opening of Parliament,
the Queen being present, and wearing for the first time,
some one says, her crown as Empress of India. Lord
Beaconsfield was on her left side, holding aloft the Sword
of State. At five the House again was crammed to see
him take his seat; and Slingsby Bethell, equal to the
occasion, read aloud the writ in very distinct tones. All
seemed to be founded on the model, 'What shall be done
to the man whom the king delighteth to honour?'"</p>
<p><i>Je ne suis pas la rose, mais j'ai v&eacute;cu pr&egrave;s d'elle</i>.
For the
last month<a name="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
our thoughts have been fixed upon the Queen
to the exclusion of all else; but now the regal splendours
of the Jubilee have faded. The majestic theme is, in fact,
exhausted; and we turn, by a natural transition, from the
Royal Rose to its subservient primrose; from the wisest of
Sovereigns to the wiliest of Premiers; from the character,
habits, and life of the Queen to the personality of that
extraordinary child of Israel who, though he was not the
Rose, lived uncommonly near it; and who, more than any
other Minister before or since his day, contrived to identify
himself in the public view with the Crown itself. There is
nothing invidious in this use of a racial term. It was one
<a name="Page_216"></a>of Lord Beaconsfield's finest qualities that he
laboured all
through his life to make his race glorious and admired. To
a Jewish boy&#8212;a friend of my own&#8212;who was presented to
him in his old age he said: "You and I belong to a race
which knows how to do everything but fail."</p>
<p>Is Lord Beaconsfield's biography ever to be given to
the world? Not in our time, at any rate, if we may judge
by the signs. Perhaps Lord Rowton finds it more convenient
to live on the vague but splendid anticipations of
future success than on the admitted and definite failure
of a too cautious book. Perhaps he finds his personal dignity
enhanced by those mysterious flittings to Windsor and
Osborne, where he is understood to be comparing manuscripts
and revising proofs with an Illustrious Personage.
But there is the less occasion to lament Lord Rowton's
tardiness, because we already possess Mr. Froude's admirable
monograph on Lord Beaconsfield in the series of <i>The
Queen's Prime Ministers</i>, and an extremely clear-sighted
account of his relations with the Crown in Mr. Reginald
Brett's <i>Yoke of Empire</i>.</p>
<p>My present purpose is not controversial. I do not intend
to estimate the soundness of Lord Beaconsfield's opinions
or the permanent value of his political work. It is enough
to recall what the last German Ambassador&#8212;Count M&uuml;nster&#8212;told
me, and what, in a curtailed form, has been so often
quoted. Prince Bismarck said, "I think nothing of their
Lord Salisbury. He is only a lath painted to look like
iron. But that old Jew means business." This is merely
a parenthesis. I am at present concerned only with Lord
Beaconsfield's personal traits. When I first encountered
him he was already an old man. He had left far behind
those wonderful days of the black velvet dress-coat lined
with white satin, the "gorgeous gold flowers on a splendidly
embroidered waistcoat," the jewelled rings worn outside the
white gloves, the evening cane of ivory inlaid with gold and
<a name="Page_217"></a>adorned with a tassel of black silk. "We were
none of us
fools," said one of his most brilliant contemporaries, "and
each man talked his best; but we all agreed that the
cleverest fellow in the party was the young Jew in the
green velvet trousers." Considerably in the background,
too, were the grotesque performances of his rural life, when,
making up for the character of a country gentleman, he
"rode an Arabian mare for thirty miles across country without
stopping," attended Quarter Sessions in drab breeches
and gaiters, and wandered about the lanes round Hughenden
pecking up primroses with a spud.</p>
<p>When I first saw Mr. Disraeli, as he then was, all these
follies were matters of ancient history. They had played
their part, and were discarded. He was dressed much like
other gentlemen of the 'Sixties&#8212;in a black frock coat, gray
or drab trousers, a waistcoat cut rather low, and a black
cravat which went once round the neck and was tied in
a loose bow. In the country his costume was a little more
adventurous. A black velveteen jacket, a white waistcoat,
a Tyrolese hat, lent picturesque incident and variety to his
appearance. But the brilliant colours were reserved for
public occasions. I never saw him look better than in his
peer's robes of scarlet and ermine when he took his seat
in the House of Lords, or more amazing than when, tightly
buttoned up in the Privy Councillor's uniform of blue and
gold, he stood in the "general circle" at the Drawing-room
or Lev&eacute;e. In his second Administration he looked extraordinarily
old. His form was shrunk, and his face of a
death-like pallor. Ever since an illness in early manhood
he had always dyed his hair, and the contrast between the
artificial blackness and the natural paleness was extremely
startling. The one sign of vitality which his appearance
presented was the brilliancy of his dark eyes, which still
flashed with penetrating lustre.</p>
<p>The immense powers of conversation of which we read
<a name="Page_218"></a>so much in his early days, when he "talked like
a racehorse
approaching the winning post," and held the whole company
spellbound by his tropical eloquence, had utterly vanished.
He seemed, as he was, habitually oppressed by illness or
discomfort. He sat for hours together in moody silence.
When he opened his lips it was to pay an elaborate (and
sometimes misplaced) compliment to a lady, or to utter
an epigrammatic judgment on men or books, which recalled
the conversational triumphs of his prime. Skill in phrase-making
was perhaps the literary gift which he most admired.
In a conversation with Mr. Matthew Arnold shortly before
his death he said, with a touch of pathos, "You are
a fortunate man. The young men read you; they no
longer read me. And you have invented phrases which
every one quotes&#8212;such as 'Philistinism' and 'Sweetness
and Light.'" It was a characteristic compliment, for he
dearly loved a good phrase. From the necessities of his
position as a fighting politician, his own best performances
in that line were sarcasms; and indeed sarcasm was the
gift in which from first to last, in public and in private,
in writing and in speaking, he peculiarly excelled. To recall
the instances would be to rewrite his political novels and
to transcribe those attacks on Sir Robert Peel which made
his fame and fortune.</p>
<p>It was my good fortune when quite a boy to be present at
the debates in the House of Commons on the Tory Reform
Bill of 1867. Never were Mr. Disraeli's gifts of sarcasm,
satire, and ridicule so richly displayed, and never did they
find so responsive a subject as Mr. Gladstone. As schoolboys
say, "he rose freely." The Bill was read a second time
without a division, but in Committee the fun waxed fast and
furious, and was marked by the liveliest encounters between
the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition.
At the conclusion of one of these passages of arms Mr.
Disraeli gravely congratulated himself on having such a
<a name="Page_219"></a>substantial piece of furniture as the table of
the House
between himself and his energetic opponent. In May 1867
Lord Houghton writes thus: "I met Gladstone at breakfast.
He seems quite awed with the diabolical cleverness of Dizzy,
who, he says, is gradually driving all ideas of political honour
out of the House, and accustoming it to the most revolting
cynicism." Was it cynicism, or some related but more
agreeable quality, which suggested Mr. Disraeli's reply to
the wealthy manufacturer, newly arrived in the House of
Commons, who complimented him on his novels? "I can't
say I've read them myself. Novels are not in my line. But
my daughters tell me they are uncommonly good." "Ah,"
said the Leader of the House, in his deepest note, "this,
indeed, is fame." The mention of novels reminds me of a
story which I heard twenty years ago; when Mr. Mallock produced
his first book&#8212;the admirable <i>New Republic</i>. A lady
who was his constant friend and benefactress begged Lord
Beaconsfield to read the book and say something civil about
it. The Prime Minister replied with a groan, "Ask me anything,
dear lady, except this. I am an old man. Do not
make me read your young friend's romances." "Oh, but
he would be a great accession to the Tory party, and a civil
word from you would secure him for ever." "Oh&#8212;well,
then, give me a pen and a sheet of paper," and sitting down
in the lady's drawing-room, he wrote: "Dear Mrs.----,&#8212;I
am sorry that I cannot dine with you, but I am going down
to Hughenden for a week. Would that my solitude could
be peopled by the bright creations of Mr. Mallock's fancy!"
"Will that do for your young friend?" Surely, as an
appreciation of a book which one has not read, this is
absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>When Lord Beaconsfield was driven from office by the
General Election of 1880, one of his supporters in the House
of Commons begged a great favour&#8212;"May I bring my boy
to see you, and will you give him some word of counsel which
<a name="Page_220"></a>he may treasure all his life as the utterance of
the greatest
Englishman who ever lived?" Lord Beaconsfield groaned,
but consented. On the appointed day the proud father
presented himself with his young hopeful in Lord Beaconsfield's
presence. "My dear young friend," said the statesman,
"your good papa has asked me to give you a word of
counsel which may serve you all your life. Never ask who
wrote the Letters of Junius, or on which side of Whitehall
Charles I. was beheaded; for if you do you will be considered
a bore&#8212;and that is something too dreadful for you at your
tender age to understand." For these last two stories I by
no means vouch. They belong to the flotsam and jetsam
of ephemeral gossip. But the following, which I regard
as eminently characteristic, I had from Lord Randolph
Churchill.</p>
<p>Towards the end of Lord Beaconsfield's second Premiership
a younger politician asked the Premier to dinner. It
was a domestic event of the first importance, and no pains
were spared to make the entertainment a success. When the
ladies retired, the host came and sat where the hostess had
been, next to his distinguished guest. "Will you have some
more claret, Lord Beaconsfield?" "No, thank you, my dear
fellow. It is admirable wine&#8212;true Falernian&#8212;but I have
already exceeded my prescribed quantity, and the gout holds
me in its horrid clutch." When the party had broken up,
the host and hostess were talking it over. "I think the chief
enjoyed himself," said the host, "and I know he liked his
claret." "Claret!" exclaimed the hostess; "why, he drank
brandy-and-water all dinner-time."</p>
<p>I said in an earlier paragraph that Lord Beaconsfield's
flattery was sometimes misplaced. An instance recurs to my
recollection. He was staying in a country house where the
whole party was Conservative with the exception of one
rather plain, elderly lady, who belonged to a great Whig
family. The Tory leader was holding forth on politics to an
<a name="Page_221"></a>admiring circle when the Whig lady came into the
room.
Pausing in his conversation, Lord Beaconsfield exclaimed,
in his most histrionic manner, "But hush! We must not
continue these Tory heresies until those pretty little ears have
been covered up with those pretty little hands"&#8212;a strange
remark under any circumstances, and stranger still if, as his
friends believed, it was honestly intended as an acceptable
compliment.</p>
<p>Mr. Brett, who shows a curious sympathy with the personal
character of Lord Beaconsfield, acquits him of the charge of
flattery, and quotes his own description of his method: "I
never contradict; I never deny; but I sometimes forget."
On the other hand, it has always been asserted by those who
had the best opportunities of personal observation that Lord
Beaconsfield succeeded in converting the dislike with which
he had once been regarded in the highest quarters into
admiration and even affection, by his elaborate and studied
acquiescence in every claim, social or political, of Royalty,
and by his unflagging perseverance in the art of flattery.
He was a courtier, not by descent or breeding, but by genius.
What could be more skilful than the inclusion of <i>Leaves from
the Journal of our Life in the Highlands</i> with <i>Coningsby</i> and
<i>Sybil</i> in the phrase "We authors"?&#8212;than his grave declaration,
"Your Majesty is the head of the literary profession"?
&#8212;than his announcement at the dinner-table at Windsor,
with reference to some disputed point of regal genealogy,
"We are in the presence of probably the only Person in
Europe who could tell us"? In the last year of his life he
said to Mr. Matthew Arnold, in a strange burst of confidence
which showed how completely he realized that his fall from
power was final, "You have heard me accused of being a
flatterer. It is true. I am a flatterer. I have found it useful.
Every one likes flattery: and when you come to Royalty
you should lay it on with a trowel." In this business Lord
Beaconsfield excelled. Once, sitting at dinner by the Princess
<a name="Page_222"></a>of Wales, he was trying to cut a hard
dinner-roll. The knife
slipped and cut his finger, which the Princess, with her
natural grace, instantly wrapped up in her handkerchief.
The old gentleman gave a dramatic groan, and exclaimed,
"When I asked for bread they gave me a stone; but I had
a Princess to bind my wounds."</p>
<p>The atmosphere of a Court naturally suited him, and he
had a quaint trick of transferring the grandiose nomenclature
of palaces to his own very modest domain of Hughenden.
He called his simple drawing-room the Saloon; he
styled his pond the Lake; he expatiated on the beauties of
the terrace walks, and the "Golden Gate," and the "German
Forest." His style of entertaining was more showy than
comfortable. Nothing could excel the grandeur of his
state coach and powdered footmen; but when the ice at
dessert came up melting, one of his friends exclaimed, "At
last, my dear Dizzy, we have got something hot;" and in
the days when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer some
critical guest remarked of the soup that it was apparently
made with Deferred Stock. When Lady Beaconsfield died
he sent for his agent and said, "I desire that her Ladyship's
remains should be borne to the grave by the tenants
of the estate." Presently the agent came back with a
troubled countenance and said, "I regret to say there are
not tenants enough to carry a coffin."</p>
<p>Lord Beaconsfield's last years were tormented by a bronchial
asthma of gouty origin, against which he fought with
tenacious and uncomplaining courage. The last six weeks
of his life, described all too graphically by Dr. Kidd in an
article in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, were a hand-to-hand
struggle with death. Every day the end was expected, and
his compatriot, companion, and so-called friend, Bernal
Osborne, found it in his heart to remark, "Ah, overdoing
it&#8212;as he always overdid everything."</p>
<p>For my own part, I never was numbered among Lord
<a name="Page_223"></a>Beaconsfield's friends, and I regarded the
Imperialistic and
pro-Turkish policy of his latter days with an equal measure
of indignation and contempt. But I place his political
novels among the masterpieces of Victorian literature, and
I have a sneaking affection for the man who wrote the
following passage: "We live in an age when to be young
and to be indifferent can be no longer synonymous. We
must prepare for the coming hour. The claims of the
Future are represented by suffering millions, and the Youth
of a Nation are the Trustees of Posterity."</p>

<h2><a name="Page_224"></a>XXIV.</h2>
<h2>FLATTERERS AND BORES.</h2>
<p>Can a flatterer be flattered? Does he instinctively
recognize the commodity in which he deals? And
if he does so recognize it, does he enjoy or dislike the
application of it to his own case? These questions are
suggested to my mind by the ungrudging tributes paid in my
last chapter to Lord Beaconsfield's pre-eminence in the art
of flattery.</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>"Supreme of heroes, bravest, noblest, best!"</p>
</div>
<p>No one else ever flattered so long and so much, so boldly
and so persistently, so skilfully and with such success.
And it so happened that at the very crisis of his romantic
career he became the subject of an act of flattery quite as daring
as any of his own performances in the same line, and
one which was attended with diplomatic consequences of
great pith and moment.</p>
<p>It fell out on this wise. When the Congress of the Powers
assembled at Berlin in the summer of 1878, our Ambassador
in that city of stucco palaces was the loved and lamented
Lord Odo Russell, afterwards Lord Ampthill, a born diplomatist
if ever there was one, with a suavity and affectionateness
of manner and a charm of voice which would have enabled him, in homely
phrase, to whistle the bird off the bough. On the evening before the
formal opening of the Congress Lord Beaconsfield arrived in all his
plenipotentiary
<a name="Page_225"></a>glory, and was received with high honours at the
British
Embassy. In the course of the evening one of his private
secretaries came to Lord Odo Russell and said, "Lord Odo,
we are in a frightful mess, and we can only turn to you to
help us out of it. The old chief has determined to open
the proceedings of the Congress in French. He has written
out the devil's own long speech in French and learnt it by
heart, and is going to fire it off at the Congress to-morrow.
We shall be the laughing-stock of Europe. He pronounces
<i>&eacute;picier</i> as if it rhymed with <i>overseer</i>, and all
his pronunciation is to match. It is as much as our places are worth to
tell him so. Can you help us?" Lord Odo listened with
amused good humour to this tale of woe, and then replied:
"It is a very delicate mission that you ask me to undertake,
but then I am fond of delicate missions. I will see what I
can do." And so he repaired to the state bedroom, where
our venerable Plenipotentiary was beginning those elaborate
processes of the toilet with which he prepared for the
couch. "My dear Lord," began Lord Odo, "a dreadful
rumour has reached us." "Indeed! Pray what is it?"
"We have heard that you intend to open the proceedings
to-morrow in French." "Well, Lord Odo, what of that?"
"Why, of course, we all know that there is no one in
Europe more competent to do so than yourself. But then,
after all, to make a French speech is a commonplace accomplishment.
There will be at least half a dozen men at the
Congress who could do it almost, if not quite, as well as
yourself. But, on the other hand, who but you can make
an English speech? All these Plenipotentiaries have come
from the various Courts of Europe expecting the greatest
intellectual treat of their lives in hearing English spoken by
its greatest living master. The question for you, my dear
Lord, is&#8212;Will you disappoint them?" Lord Beaconsfield
put his glass in his eye, fixed his gaze on Lord Odo, and
then said, "There is much force in what you say. I will
<a name="Page_226"></a>consider the point." And next day he opened the
proceedings
in English. Now the psychological conundrum is this
&#8212;Did he swallow the flattery, and honestly believe that the
object of Lord Odo's appeal was to secure the pleasure of
hearing him speak English? Or did he see through the
manoeuvre, and recognize a polite intimation that a French
speech from him would throw an air of comedy over all the
proceedings of the Congress, and perhaps kill it with ridicule?
The problem is well fitted to be made the subject of
a Prize Essay; but personally I incline to believe that he
saw through the manoeuvre and acted on the hint. If this
be the true reading of the case, the answer to my opening
question is that the flatterer cannot be flattered.</p>
<p>We saw in my last chapter how careful Lord Beaconsfield
was, in the great days of his political struggles, to flatter
every one who came within his reach. To the same effect
is the story that when he was accosted by any one who
claimed acquaintance but whose face he had forgotten he
always used to inquire, in a tone of affectionate solicitude,
"And how is the old complaint?" But when he grew older,
and had attained the highest objects of his political ambition,
these little arts, having served their purpose, were discarded,
like the green velvet trousers and tasselled canes of his
aspiring youth. There was no more use for them, and they
were dropped. He manifested less and less of the apostolic
virtue of suffering bores gladly, and though always delightful
to his intimate friends, he was less and less inclined to
curry favour with mere acquaintances. A characteristic
instance of this latter manner has been given to the world
in a book of chit-chat by a prosy gentleman whose name
it would be unkind to recall.</p>
<p>This worthy soul narrates with artless candour that
towards the end of Lord Beaconsfield's second Administration
he had the honour of dining with the great man, whose
political follower he was, at the Premier's official residence
<a name="Page_227"></a>in Downing Street. When he arrived he found his
host
looking ghastly ill, and apparently incapable of speech. He
made some commonplace remark about the weather or the
House, and the only reply was a dismal groan. A second
remark was similarly received, and the visitor then abandoned
the attempt in despair. "I felt he would not survive the
night. Within a quarter of an hour, all being seated at
dinner, I observed him talking to the Austrian Ambassador
with extreme vivacity. During the whole of dinner their
conversation was kept up; I saw no sign of flagging. <i>This
is difficult to account for.</i>" And the worthy man goes on to
theorize about the cause, and suggests that Lord Beaconsfield
was in the habit of taking doses of opium which were so
timed that their effect passed off at a certain moment!</p>
<p>This freedom from self-knowledge which bores enjoy is
one of their most striking characteristics. One of the
principal clubs in London has the misfortune to be frequented
by a gentleman who is by common consent the
greatest bore and buttonholer in London. He always
reminds me of the philosopher described by Sir George
Trevelyan, who used to wander about asking, "Why are
we created? Whither do we tend? Have we an inner consciousness?"
till all his friends, when they saw him from
afar, used to exclaim, "Why was Tompkins created? Is he
tending this way? Has he an inner consciousness that he
is a bore?"</p>
<p>Well, a few years ago this good man, on his return from
his autumn holiday, was telling all his acquaintances at the
club that he had been occupying a house at the Lakes not
far from Mr. Ruskin, who, he added, was in a very melancholy
state, "I am truly sorry for that," said one of his
hearers. "What is the matter with him?" "Well," replied
the buttonholer, "I was walking one day in the lane which
separated Ruskin's house from mine, and I saw him coming
down the lane towards me. The moment he caught sight
<a name="Page_228"></a>of me he darted into a wood which was close by,
and hid
behind a tree till I had passed. Oh, very sad indeed." But
the truly pathetic part of it was one's consciousness that
what Mr. Ruskin did we should all have done, and that not
all the trees in Birnam Wood and the Forest of Arden combined
would have hidden the multitude of brother-clubmen
who sought to avoid the narrator.</p>
<p>The faculty of boring belongs, unhappily, to no one
period of life. Age cannot wither it, nor custom stale its
infinite variety. Middle life is its heyday. Perhaps infancy
is free from it, but I strongly suspect that it is a form
of original sin, and shows itself very early. Boys are
notoriously rich in it; with them it takes two forms&#8212;the
loquacious and the awkward; and in some exceptionally
favoured cases the two forms are combined. I once was
talking with an eminent educationist about the characteristic
qualities produced by various Public Schools, and
when I asked him what Harrow produced he replied, "A
certain shy bumptiousness." It was a judgment which
wrung my Harrovian withers, but of which I could not
dispute the truth.</p>
<p>One of the forms which shyness takes in boyhood is an
inability to get up and go. When Dr. Vaughan was Head
Master of Harrow, and had to entertain his boys at breakfast,
this inability was frequently manifested, and was met
by the Doctor in a most characteristic fashion. When the
muffins and sausages had been devoured, the perfunctory
inquiries about the health of "your people" made and
answered, and all permissible school topics discussed, there
used to ensue a horrid silence, while "Dr. Blimber's young
friends" sat tightly glued to their chairs. Then the Doctor
would approach with Agag-like delicacy, and, extending his
hand to the shyest and most loutish boy, would say, "Must
you go? Can't you stay?" and the party broke up with
magical celerity. Such, at least, was our Harrovian tradition.</p>
<p><a name="Page_229"></a>Nothing is so refreshing to a jaded sense of
humour as
to be the recipient of one of your own stories retold with
appreciative fervour but with all the point left out. This
was my experience not long ago with reference to the story
of Dr. Vaughan and his boy-bores which I have just related.
A Dissenting minister was telling me, with extreme satisfaction,
that he had a son at Trinity College, Cambridge. He
went on to praise the Master, Dr. Butler, whom he extolled
to the skies, winding up his eulogy with, "He has such wonderful
tact in dealing with shy undergraduates." I began
to scent my old story from afar, but held my peace and
awaited results. "You know," he continued, "that young
men are sometimes a little awkward about making a move
and going away when a party is over. Well, when Dr. Butler
has undergraduates to breakfast, if they linger inconveniently
long when he wants to be busy, he has such a happy knack of
getting rid of them. It is so tactful, so like him. He goes
up to one of them and says, '<i>Can't you go? Must you
stay?</i>' and they are off immediately." So, as Macaulay
says of Montgomery's literary thefts, may such ill-got gains
ever prosper.</p>
<p>My Dissenting minister had a congener in the late Lord
P----, who was a rollicking man about town thirty years
ago, and was famous, among other accomplishments, for this
peculiar art of so telling a story as to destroy the point.
When the large house at Albert Gate, which fronts the
French Embassy and is now the abode of Mr. Arthur Sassoon,
was built, its size and cost were regarded as prohibitive, and
some social wag christened it "Gibraltar, because it can
never be taken." Lord P---- thought that this must be an
excellent joke, because every one laughed at it; and so he
ran round the town saying to each man he met&#8212;"I say, do
you know what they call that big house at Albert Gate?
They call it Gibraltar, because it can never be let. Isn't
that awfully good?" We all remember an innocent riddle
<a name="Page_230"></a>of our childhood&#8212;"Why was the elephant the last
animal
to get into the Ark?"&#8212;to which the answer was, "Because
he had to pack his trunk." Lord P---- asked the riddle,
and gave as the answer, "Because he had to pack his portmanteau,"
and was beyond measure astonished when his
hearers did not join in his uproarious laughter. Poor Lord
P----! he was a fellow of infinite jest, though not always
exactly in the sense that he intended. If he had only known
of it, he might with advantage have resorted to the conversational
device of old Samuel Rogers, who, when he told a
story which failed to produce a laugh, used to observe in a
reflective tone, "The curious part of that story is that stupid
people never see the point of it," and then loud, though
belated, guffaws resounded round the table.</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENTS.</h2>
<p>Lately, when hunting for some notes which I had
mislaid, I came upon a collection of Advertisements.
No branch of literature is more suggestive of philosophical
reflections. I take my specimens quite at random, just
as they turn up in my diary, and the first which meets
my eye is printed on the sad sea-green of the <i>Westminster
Gazette:</i>&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"GUARDIAN, whose late ward merits the highest encomiums,
seeks for him the POSITION of SECRETARY to a
Nobleman or Lady of Position: one with literary tastes
preferred: the young gentleman is highly connected,
distinguished-looking,
a lover of books, remarkably steady, and
exceptionally well read, clever and ambitious: has travelled
much: good linguist, photographer, musician: a moderate
fortune, but debarred by timidity from competitive
examination."</blockquote>
<p>I have always longed to know the fate of this lucky youth.
Few of us can boast of even "a moderate fortune," and
fewer still of such an additional combination of gifts, graces,
and accomplishments. On the other hand, most of us, at
one time or another in our career, have felt "debarred
by timidity from competitive examination." But, unluckily,
we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and
college dons who forced us to face the agonies of the Schools,
instead of an amiable guardian who bestowed on us "the
<a name="Page_232"></a>highest encomiums," and sought to plant us on
Ladies of
Position, "with literary tastes preferred."</p>
<p>Another case, presenting some points of resemblance to
the last, but far less favoured by fortune, was notified to the
compassionate world by the <i>Morning Post</i> in 1889:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Will any rich person TAKE a gentleman and BOARD him?
Of good family: age 27: good musician: thoroughly conversant
with all office-work: <i>no objection to turn Jew</i>: lost
his money through dishonest trustee: excellent writer."</blockquote>
<p>I earnestly hope that this poor victim of fraud has long
since found his desired haven in some comfortable Hebrew
home, where he can exercise his skill in writing and office-work
during the day and display his musical accomplishments
after the family supper. I have known not a few
young Gentiles who would be glad to be adopted on similar
terms.</p>
<p>The next is extracted from the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of
1894:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"A Child of God, seeking employment, would like to
take charge of property and collect rents; has a slight knowledge
of architecture and sanitary; can give unexceptionable
references; age 31; married."</blockquote>
<p>What offers? Very few, I should fear, in a community
so shrewdly commercial as Manchester, where, I understand,
religious profession is seldom taken as a substitute for
technical training. The mention of that famous city reminds
me that not long ago I was describing Chetham
College to an ignorant outsider, who, not realizing how the
name was spelt, observed that it sounded as if Mr. Squeers
had been caught by the Oxford Movement and the Gothic
Revival, and had sought to give an ecclesiastical air to his
famous seminary of Dotheboys Hall by transforming it into
"Cheat'em College."</p>
<p>That immortal pedagogue owed much of his deserved
success to his skill in the art of drawing an advertisement:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"<a name="Page_233"></a>At Mr. Wackford Squeers's Academy,
Dotheboys
Hall,
at the delightful village of Dotheboys, near Greta Bridge, in
Yorkshire, Youth are boarded, clothed, booked, furnished
with pocket-money, provided with all necessaries, instructed
in all languages, living and dead, mathematics, orthography,
geometry, astronomy, trigonometry, the use of the globes,
algebra, singlestick (if required), writing, arithmetic, fortification,
and every other branch of classical literature. Terms,
twenty guineas per annum. No extras, no vacations, and
diet unparalleled."</blockquote>
<p>Now, mark what follows. Wackford Squeers the younger
was, as we all know, destined by his parents to follow the
schoolmaster's profession, to assist his father as long as
assistance was required, and then to take the management
of the Hall and its pupils into his own hands. "Am I to
take care of the school when I grow up a man, father?" said
Wackford junior. "You are, my son," replied Mr. Squeers in a
sentimental voice. "Oh, my eye, won't I give it to the boys!"
exclaimed the interesting child, grasping his father's cane&#8212;"won't
I make 'em squeak again!" But we know also that,
owing to the pressure of pecuniary and legal difficulties, and
the ill-timed interference of Mr. John Browdie, the school at
Dotheboys Hall was at any rate temporarily broken up. So
far we have authentic records to rely on; the remainder is
pure conjecture. But I am persuaded that Wackford Squeers
the younger, with all the dogged perseverance of a true
Yorkshireman, struggled manfully against misfortune; resolved
to make a home for his parents and sister; and, as
soon as he could raise the needful capital, opened a private
school in the South of England, as far as possible from the
scene of earlier misfortune. Making due allowance for
change of time and circumstances, I trace a close similarity
of substance and style between the advertisement which I
quoted above and that which I give below, and I feel persuaded
that young Wackford inherited from his more famous
<a name="Page_234"></a>father this peculiar power of attracting
parental confidence
by means of picturesque statement. We have read the
earlier manifesto; let us now compare the later:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Vacancies now occur in the establishment of a gentleman
who undertakes the care and education of a few backward
boys, who are beguiled and trained to study by kind discipline,
without the least severity (which too often frustrates
the end desired). Situation extremely healthy. Sea and
country air; deep gravelly soil. Christian gentility assiduously
cultivated on sound Church principles. Diet unsurpassed.
Wardrobes carefully preserved. The course of
instruction comprises English, classics, mathematics, and
science. Inclusive terms, 30 guineas per annum, quarterly
in advance. Music, drawing, and modern languages are
extras, but moderate. Address--------, Chichester."
Was it Vivian Grey or Pelham who was educated at a
private school where "the only extras were pure milk and
the guitar"?</blockquote>
<p>I believe that there is no charitable institution which more
thoroughly deserves support than the Metropolitan Association
for Befriending Young Servants, affectionately contracted
by its supporters into the "MABYS." Here is one of its
advertisements, from which, I am bound to say, the alluring
skill displayed by Mr. Squeers is curiously absent:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Will any one undertake as SERVANT a bright, clean, neat
girl, who is deceitful, lazy, and inclined to be dishonest?
Address, Hon. Secretary, M.A.B.Y.S., 21 Charlotte Street,
S.E."</blockquote>
<p>I remember some years ago an advertisement which
sought a kind master and a pleasant home for a large,
savage dog; and I remember how admirably <i>Punch</i> described
the kind of life which the "large, savage dog" would
lead the "kind master" when he got him. But really the
vision of a bright maid-servant who is "deceitful, lazy, and
inclined to be dishonest," and the havoc which she might
<a name="Page_235"></a>work in a well-ordered household, is scarcely
less appalling.
A much more deserving case is this which I append:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Under-Housekeeper, under-Matron, desired by a Young
Woman, age 22. Energetic, domesticated. Great misfortune
in losing right arm, but good artificial one. Happy
home, with small remuneration."</blockquote>
<p>It is not, I fear, in my power to make a contribution of
permanent value to the "Great Servant Question." But,
having given instances of insufficient qualification in people
seeking to be employed, I now turn to the opposite side of
the account, and, after perusing what follows, would respectfully
ask, Who is sufficient for these things?</p>
<blockquote>"Can any lady or gentleman recommend a MAN and WIFE
(Church of England)? Man useful indoors and out. Principal
duties large flower-garden, small conservatory, draw
bath-chair, must wait at table, understand lamps, non-smoker,
wear dress suit except in garden. Clothes and
beer not found. Family, lady and child, lady-help. House-parlourmaid
kept. Must not object to small bedroom.
Wife plain cook (good), to undertake kitchen offices, dining-room,
and hall (wash clothes). Joint wages &pound;50, all
found."</blockquote>
<p>Now there is really a study in exacting eccentricity which
Thackeray might have made the subject of a "Roundabout
Paper." In the first place, the two servants must be man
and wife&#8212;unmarried people need not apply&#8212;and yet they
must be contented with a small bedroom. The family consists
of a lady (apparently an invalid), a child, a lady-help,
and a house-parlourmaid. For these the wife must cook,
and cook well, besides cleaning the dining-room, hall and
offices, and washing the clothes. Her husband, yet more
accommodating, must attend to a large flower-garden and a
small conservatory, must draw a bath-chair, wait at table and
clean lamps. After all these varied and arduous labours, he
is denied the refreshment of a pipe; but, as a kind of com<a
 name="Page_236"></a>pensation,
he is not obliged to wear his dress suit when he
is gardening! The joint wages are &pound;50, with all found except
clothes and beer; and the lucky recipients of this overpowering
guerdon must be members of the Church of
England.</p>
<p>This last requirement reminds me of a letter from a girl-emigrant
written to Lady Laura Ridding, wife of the Bishop
of Southwell, who had befriended her at home. "Dear
Madam,&#8212;I hope this finds you as well as it leaves me.
The ship is in the middle of the Red Sea, and it is fearfully
hot. I am in a terrible state of melting all day long. But,
honoured Madam, I know you will be pleased to hear
that I am still a member of the Church of England." I
hope the good plain cook and her non-smoking, bath-chair
drawing, large-gardening husband may be able to comfort
themselves with the same reflection when the varied toils of
the day are ended and they seek their well-earned repose in
the "small bedroom."</p>
<p>From these lowly mysteries of domestic life I pass to the
Debatable Land between servitude and gentility. "MAN
AND WIFE, superior and active, seek, in gentleman's family,
PLACE OF TRUST; country, houseboat, &amp;c. Wife needlewoman
or Plain Cook, linen, &amp;c.: man ride and drive,
waiting, or useful. <i>Can teach or play violin in musical
family;</i> sight-reader in classical works. Both tall, and refined
appearance."</p>
<p>From the Debatable Land I pass on to the exalted
regions of courtly life.</p>
<blockquote>"The Great-niece of a Lord Chamberlain to King George
III. REQUIRES a SITUATION as COMPANION to a lady, or
Cicerone to young ladies. Her mind is highly cultivated. <i>English
habits and Parisian accent.</i>"</blockquote>
<p>"Vieille &eacute;cole bonne &eacute;cole, begad!" cried Major
Pendennis,
and here would have been a companion for Mrs.
Pendennis or a cicerone for Laura after his own heart. The
<a name="Page_237"></a>austere traditions of the Court of George III.
and Queen
Charlotte might be expected to survive in the great-niece of
their Lord Chamberlain; and what a tactful concession to
the prejudices of Mrs. Grundy in the statement that, though
the accent may be Parisian, the habits are English! This
excellent lady&#8212;evidently a near relation to Mrs. General in
<i>Little Dorrit</i>&#8212;reintroduces us to the genteel society in which
we are most at home; and here I may remark that the love
of aristocracy which is so marked and so amiable a feature of
our national character finds its expression not only in the
advertisement columns, but in the daily notices of deaths
and marriages. For example: "On the 22nd inst., at
Lisbon, William Thorold Wood, cousin to the Bishop of
Rochester, to Sir John Thorold of Syston Park, and
brother to the Rector of Widmerpool. He was a man of
great mental endowments and exemplary conduct." I dare
say he was, but I fear they would have gone unrecorded had
it not been for the more impressive fact that he was kinsman
to a Bishop and a Baronet.</p>
<p>While we are on the subject of Advertisements a word
must be said about the Medical branch of this fine art;
and knowing the enormous fortunes which have often been
made out of a casual prescription for <i>acne</i> or <i>alopecia</i>,
I freely place at the disposal of any aspiring young chemist
who reads this paper the following tale of enterprise and
success. A few years ago, according to the information
before me, a London doctor had a lady patient who complained
of an incessant neuralgia in her face and jaw. The
doctor could detect nothing amiss, but exhausted his skill,
his patience, and his remedies in trying to comfort the complainant,
who, however, refused to be comforted. At length,
being convinced that the case was one of pure hypochondria,
he wrote to the afflicted lady, saying that he did not feel
justified in any longer taking her money for a case which
was evidently beyond his powers, but recommended her to
<a name="Page_238"></a>try change of air, live in the country, and
trust to that <i>edax
rerum</i> which sooner or later cures all human ills.</p>
<p>The lady departed in sorrow, but in faith; obeyed her
doctor's instructions to the letter, and established herself not
a hundred miles from the good city of Newcastle. Once
established there, her first care was to seek the local chemist
and to place her doctor's letter in his hands. A smart young
assistant was presiding at the counter; he read the doctor's
letter, and promptly made up a bottle which he labelled
"<i>Edax Rerum</i>. To be taken twice a day before meals,"
and for which he demanded 7s. 6d. The lady rejoicingly
paid, and requested that a similar bottle might be sent to
her every week till further notice. She continued to use
and to pay for this specific for a year and a half, and then,
finding her neuralgia considerably abated, she came up to
London for a week's amusement. Full of gratitude, she
called on her former doctor, and said that, though she had
felt a little hurt at the abrupt manner in which he had dismissed
so old a patient, still she could not forbear to tell
him that his last prescription had done her far more good
than any of its predecessors, and that, indeed, she now regarded
herself as practically cured. Explanations followed;
inquiries were set on foot; the chemist's assistant sailed for
South Africa; and "<i>Edax Rerum</i>" is now largely in demand
among the unlettered heroes who bear the banner of
the Chartered Company.</p>
<p>That combination of pietism with money-making, which
critics of our national character tell us is so peculiarly British,
was well illustrated in the <i>Christian Million</i> of September
22, 1898:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"BETHESDA, Hest Bank. Beautiful country home, near
the sea. Christian fellowship, 3s. per day. Sickly persons
desiring to trust the Lord will be considered financially.
Apply Miss----. Stamped Envelope."</blockquote>
<p>When poetry is forced into the service of advertisements,
<a name="Page_239"></a>the result is peculiarly gratifying. This is an
appeal for
funds to repair the church in which Nelson's father officiated:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The man who first taught Englishmen their duty,</p>
<p class="i1">And fenced with wooden walls his native isle,</p>
<p>Now asks ONE SHILLING to preserve in beauty</p>
<p class="i1">The Church that brooded o'er his infant smile."<a
 name="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An electioneering address is, in its essence, an advertisement; and
in this peculiar branch of literature it would be
difficult to excel the following manifesto recently issued by
a clergyman when candidate for a benefice to which the
appointment is by popular election:&#8212;</p>
<p>"I appeal with the utmost confidence for the full support
of the IRISH AND ROMAN CATHOLICS, because I am a Son
of the Emerald Isle; to FOREIGNERS, because they love
Ireland; to HIGH CHURCH, LOW CHURCH, and BROAD
CHURCH, because I am tolerant to all parties; to NONCONFORMISTS,
because I have stated in my pamphlet on Reunion
that they are "the salt of the earth and the light of the
world;" to JEWS, because my love for the Children of
Promise is well known; to ATHEISTS, because they have
often heard me in Hyde Park telling them of the Author of
Nature in its endless beauties;&#8212;to one and all I appeal with
the utmost confidence, and feel sure that the whole electorate
will vote for me and do themselves honour, when they consider
who I am, and when a person of my social and
ecclesiastical standing allowed my name at all to be mentioned
for a popular election."</p>
<p>I am thankful to say that this "Son of the Emerald Isle"
was left at the bottom of the poll.<br>

<h2><a name="Page_240"></a>XXVI.</h2>
<h2>PARODIES IN PROSE.</h2>
<p>"Parody," wrote Mr. Matthew Arnold in 1882, "is a
vile art, but I must say I read <i>Poor Matthias</i> in the
<i>World</i> with an amused pleasure." It was a generous appreciation,
for the original <i>Poor Matthias</i>&#8212;an elegy on a canary&#8212;
is an exquisite poem, and the <i>World's</i> parody of it is a rather
dull imitation. On the whole, I agree with Mr. Arnold that
parody is a vile art; but the dictum is a little too sweeping.
A parody of anything really good, whether in prose or verse,
is as odious as a burlesque of <i>Hamlet</i>; but, on the other
hand, parody is the appropriate punishment for certain kinds
of literary affectation. There are, and always have been,
some styles of poetry and of prose which no one endowed
with an ear for rhythm and a sense of humour could forbear
to parody. Such, to a generation brought up on Milton
and Pope, were the styles of the various poetasters satirized
in <i>Rejected Addresses</i>; but excellent as are the metrical
parodies in that famous book, the prose is even better.
Modern parodists, of whom I will speak more particularly
in a future chapter, have, I think, surpassed such poems as
<i>The Baby's D&eacute;but</i> and <i>A Tale of Drury Lane</i>, but in
the
far more difficult art of imitating a prose style none that
I know of has even approached the author of the <i>Hampshire
Farmer's Address</i> and <i>Johnson's Ghost</i>. Does any one
<a name="Page_241"></a>read William Cobbett nowadays? If so, let him
compare
what follows with the recorded specimens of Cobbett's public
speaking:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Most thinking People,&#8212;When persons address an audience
from the stage, it is usual, either in words or gesture,
to say, 'Ladies and gentlemen, your servant.' If I were
base enough, mean enough, paltry enough, and brute beast
enough to follow that fashion, I should tell two lies in a
breath. In the first place, you are not ladies and gentlemen,
but, I hope, something better&#8212;that is to say, honest men
and women; and, in the next place, if you were ever so
much ladies, and ever so much gentlemen, I am not, nor
ever will be, your humble servant."</blockquote>
<p>With Dr. Johnson's style&#8212;supposing we had ever forgotten
its masculine force and its balanced antitheses&#8212;we
have been made again familiar by the erudite labours of Dr.
Birkbeck Hill and Mr. Augustine Birrell. But even those
learned critics might, I think, have mistaken a copy for an
original if in some collection of old speeches they had lighted
on the ensuing address:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"That which was organized by the moral ability of one
has been executed by the physical efforts of many, and
DRURY LANE THEATRE is now complete. Of that part
behind the curtain, which has not yet been destined to glow
beneath the brush of the varnisher or vibrate to the hammer
of the carpenter, little is thought by the public, and little
need be said by the Committee. Truth, however, is not to
be sacrificed to the accommodation of either, and he who
should pronounce that our edifice has received its final
embellishment would be disseminating falsehood without
incurring favour, and risking the disgrace of detection without
participating the advantage of success."</blockquote>
<p>An excellent morsel of Johnsonese prose belongs to a
more recent date. It became current about the time when
the scheme of Dr. Murray's Dictionary of the English
<a name="Page_242"></a>Language was first made public. It took the form
of a
dialogue between Dr. Johnson and Boswell:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<i>Boswell</i>. Pray, sir, what would you say if you were told
that the next dictionary of the English language would be
written by a Scotsman and a Presbyterian domiciled at
Oxford?</p>
  <p>"<i>Dr. J</i>. Sir, in order to be facetious it is not necessary
to be indecent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Bulwer-Lytton brought out his play <i>Not so Bad as
we Seem</i>, his friends pleasantly altered its title to <i>Not so
Good
as we Expected</i>. And when a lady's newspaper advertised a
work called "How to Dress on Fifteen Pounds a Year, as a
Lady. By a Lady," <i>Punch</i> was ready with the characteristic
parody: "How to Dress on Nothing a Year, as a Kaffir.
By a Kaffir."</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone's authority compels me to submit the
ensuing imitation of Macaulay&#8212;the most easily parodied of
all prose writers&#8212;to the judgment of my readers. It was
written by the late Abraham Hayward. Macaulay is contrasting,
in his customary vein of overwrought and over-coloured
detail, the evils of arbitrary government with those
of a debased currency:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The misgovernment of Charles and James, gross as it
had been, had not prevented the common business of life
from going steadily and prosperously on.</p>
  <p>"While the honour and independence of the State were
sold to a foreign Power, while chartered rights were invaded,
while fundamental laws were violated, hundreds of thousands
of quiet, honest, and industrious families laboured and traded,
ate their meals, and lay down to rest in comfort and security.
Whether Whig or Tories, Protestants or Jesuits were uppermost,
the grazier drove his beasts to market; the grocer
weighed out his currants; the draper measured out his
broadcloth; the hum of buyers and sellers was as loud as
ever in the towns; the harvest-home was celebrated as <a
 name="Page_243"></a>joyously as ever in the hamlets; the cream
overflowed the
pails of Cheshire; the apple juice foamed in the presses of
Herefordshire: the piles of crockery glowed in the furnaces
of the Trent; and the barrows of coal rolled fast along the
timber railways of the Tyne."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reads like a parody, but it is a literal transcript of the
original; and Hayward justly observes that there is no reason
why this rigmarole should ever stop, as long as there is a
trade, calling, or occupation to be particularized. The pith
of the proposition (which needed no proof) is contained in
the first sentence. Why not continue thus?&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"The apothecary vended his drugs as usual; the poulterer
crammed his turkeys; the fishmonger skinned his eels; the
wine merchant adulterated his port; as many hot-cross buns
as ever were eaten on Good Friday, as many pancakes on
Shrove Tuesday, as many Christmas pies on Christmas Day;
on area steps the domestic drudge took in her daily pennyworth
of the chalky mixture which Londoners call milk;
through area bars the feline tribe, vigilant as ever, watched
the arrival of the cat's-meat man; the courtesan flaunted in
the Haymarket; the cab rattled through the Strand; and,
from the suburban regions of Fulham and Putney, the cart
of the market gardener wended its slow and midnight way
along Piccadilly to deposit its load of cabbages and turnips
in Covent Garden."</blockquote>
<p>Twice has Mr. Gladstone publicly called attention to the
merits of this "effective morsel of parody," as he styles it;
and he judiciously adds that what follows (by the late Dean
Hook) is "a like attempt, but less happy." Most people
remember the attack on the constitution of the Court of
Chancery in the preface to <i>Bleak House</i>. Dean Hook, in a
laudable attempt to soothe the ruffled feelings of his old
friend Vice-Chancellor Page Wood, of whom Dickens in
that preface had made fun, thus endeavours to translate the
accusation into Macaulayese:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">"<a name="Page_244"></a>REIGN
OF VICTORIA&#8212;1856.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">"THE COURTS OF JUSTICE.</p>
  <p>"The Court of Chancery was corrupt. The guardian of
lunatics was the cause of insanity to the suitors in his court.
An attempt at reform was made when Wood was Solicitor-General.
It consisted chiefly in increasing the number of
judges in the Equity Court. Government was pleased by an
increase of patronage; the lawyers approved of the new professional
prizes. The Government papers applauded. Wood
became Vice-Chancellor. At the close of 1855 the Equity
Courts were without business. People had become weary of
seeking justice where justice was not to be found. The state
of the Bench was unsatisfactory. Cranworth was feeble;
Knight Bruce, though powerful, sacrificed justice to a joke;
Turner was heavy; Romilly was scientific; Kindersley was
slow; Stuart was pompous; Wood was at Bealings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I were to indulge in quotations from well-known parodies
of prose, this chapter would soon overflow all proper limits.
I forbear, therefore, to do more than remind my readers of
Thackeray's <i>Novels by Eminent Hands</i> and Bret Harte's
<i>Sensation Novels</i>, only remarking, with reference to the latter
book, that "Miss Mix" is in places really indistinguishable
from <i>Jane Eyre</i>. The sermon by Mr. Jowett in Mr. Mallock's
<i>New Republic</i> is so perfect an imitation, both in substance
and in style, that it suggested to some readers the idea that
it had been reproduced from notes of an actual discourse.
On spoken as distinguished from written eloquence there
are some capital skits in the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>, where (under the
name of Macfungus) excellent fun is made of the too mellifluous
eloquence of Sir James Mackintosh.</p>
<p>The differentiating absurdities of after-dinner oratory are
photographed in Thackeray's <i>Dinner in the City</i>, where the
speech of the American Minister seems to have formed a model
<a name="Page_245"></a>for a long series of similar performances.
Dickens's experience
as a reporter in the gallery of the House of Commons had
given him a perfect command of that peculiar style of speaking
which is called Parliamentary, and he used it with great
effect in his accounts of the inaugural meeting of the "United
Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and
Punctual Delivery Company" in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> (where
he introduces a capital sketch of Tom Duncombe, Radical
Member for Finsbury); and in the interview between Mr.
Gregsbury, M.P., and his constituents in a later chapter of
the same immortal book.</p>
<p>The parliamentary eloquence of a later day was admirably
reproduced in Mr. Edward Jenkins's prophetic squib (published
in 1872) <i>Barney Geoghegan, M.P., and Home Rule at
St. Stephen's</i>. As this clever little book has, I fear, lapsed
into complete oblivion, I venture to cite a passage. It will
vividly recall to the memory of middle-aged politicians the
style and tone of the verbal duels which, towards the end of
Mr. Gladstone's first Administration, took place so frequently
between the Leader of the House and the Leader of the
Opposition. Mr. Geoghegan has been returned, a very
early Home Ruler, for the Borough of Rashkillen, and for
some violent breaches of order is committed to the custody
of the Sergeant-at-Arms. On this the leader of the House
rises and addresses the Speaker:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Sir,&#8212;The House cannot but sympathize with you in the
eloquent and indignant denunciation you have uttered against
the painful invasion of the decorum of the House which we
have just witnessed. There can be no doubt in any mind,
even in the minds of those with whom the hon. member now
at the bar usually acts, that of all methods of argument which
could be employed in this House, he has selected the least
politic. Sir, may I be permitted, with great deference, to say
a word upon a remark that fell from the Chair, and which
might be misunderstood? Solitary and anomalous instances <a
 name="Page_246"></a>of this kind could never be legitimately used
as
arguments
against general systems of representation or the course of a
recent policy. I do not, at this moment, venture to pronounce
an opinion upon the degree of criminality that attaches
to the hon. member now unhappily in the custody of
the Officer of the House. It is possible&#8212;I do not say it is
probable, I do not now say whether I shall be prepared to
commit myself to that hypothesis or not&#8212;but it is not impossible
that the hon. member or some of his friends may be
able to urge some extenuating circumstances&#8212;(Oh! oh!)&#8212;
I mean circumstances that, when duly weighed, may have a
tendency in a greater or less degree to modify the judgment
of the House upon the extraordinary event that has occurred.
Sir, it becomes a great people and a great assembly like this
to be patient, dignified, and generous. The honourable
member, whom we regret to see in his present position, no
doubt represents a phase of Irish opinion unfamiliar to this
House. (Cheers and laughter.) ... The House is naturally
in a rather excited state after an event so unusual, and
I venture to urge that it should not hastily proceed to action.
We must be careful of the feelings of the Irish people. (Oh!
oh!) If we are to govern Ireland according to Irish ideas,
we must make allowance for personal, local, and transitory
ebullitions of Irish feeling, having no general or universal
consequence or bearing.... The course, therefore, which
I propose to take is this&#8212;to move that the hon. member
shall remain in the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms, that a
Committee be appointed to take evidence, and that their
report be discussed this day month."</blockquote>
<p>To this replies the Leader of the Opposition:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"The right hon. gentleman is to be congratulated on the
results of his Irish policy. (Cheers and laughter.) ... Sir,
this, I presume, is one of the right hon. gentleman's contented
and pacified people! I deeply sympathize with the
right hon. gentleman. His policy produces strange and por<a
 name="Page_247"></a>tentous
results. A policy of concession, of confiscation, of
truckling to ecclesiastical arrogance, to popular passions and
ignorant prejudices, of lenity to Fenian revolutionists, has at
length brought us to this, that the outrages of Galway and
Tipperary, no longer restricted to those charming counties,
no longer restrained to even Her Majesty's judges, are to
reach the interior of this House and the august person of its
Speaker. (Cheers.) Sir, I wash my hands of all responsibility
for this absurd and anomalous state of things. Whenever
it has fallen to the Tory party to conduct the affairs of
Ireland, they have consistently pursued a policy of mingled
firmness and conciliation with the most distinguished success.
All the great measures of reform in Ireland may be said to
have had their root in the action of the Tory party, though,
as usual, the praise has been appropriated by the right hon.
gentleman and his allies. We have preferred, instead of
truckling to prejudice or passion, to appeal, and we still
appeal, to the sublime instincts of an ancient people!"</blockquote>
<p>I hope that an unknown author, whose skill in reproducing
an archaic style I heartily admire, will forgive me for quoting
the following narrative of certain doings decreed by the
General Post Office on the occasion of the Jubilee of the
Penny Post. Like all that is truly good in literature, it will
be seen that this narrative was not for its own time alone,
but for the future, and has its relevancy to events of the
present day:<a name="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. Now it came to pass in the month June of the Post-office
Jubilee, that Raikes, the Postmaster-General, said to
himself, Lo! an opening whereby I may find grace in the
sight of the Queen!</p>
  <p>"2. And Raikes appointed an Executive Committee;
and Baines, the Inspector-General of Mails, made he
Chairman.</p>
  <p>"3. He called also Cardin, the Receiver and Accountant-<a
 name="Page_248"></a>General;
Preece, Lord of Lightning; Thompson, the Secretarial
Officer; and Tombs; the Controller.</p>
  <p>"4. Then did these four send to the Heads of Departments,
the Postmasters and Sub-Postmasters, the Letter-Receivers,
the Clerks-in-Charge, the Postal Officers, the
Telegraphists, She Sorters, the Postmen; yea from the lowest
even unto the highest sent they out.</p>
  <p>"5. And the word of Baines and of them that were with
him went forth that the Jubilee should be kept by a conversazione
at the South Kensington Museum on Wednesday
the second day of the month July in the year 1890.</p>
  <p>"6. And Victoria the Queen became a patron of the
Jubilee Celebration; and her heart was stirred within her;
for she said, For three whole years have I not had a
Jubilee.</p>
  <p>"7. And the word of Baines and of them that were with
him went forth again to the Heads of Departments; the
Postmasters and Sub-Postmasters, the Letter-Receivers, the
Clerks-in-Charge, the Postal Officers and Telegraphists, the
Sorters and the Postmen.</p>
  <p>"8. Saying unto them, Lo! the Queen is become Patron
of the Rowland Hill Memorial and Benevolent Fund, and of
the conversazione in the museum; and we the Executive
Committee bid you, from the lowest even to the highest, to
join with us at the tenth hour of the conversazione in a
great shouting to praise the name of the Queen our patron.</p>
  <p>"9. Each man in his Post Office at the tenth hour shall
shout upon her name; and a record thereof shall be sent to
us that we may cause its memory to endure for ever.</p>
  <p>"10. Then a great fear came upon the Postmasters,
the Sub-Postmasters, and the Letter-Receivers, which were
bidden to make the record.</p>
  <p>"11. For they said, If those over whom we are set in
authority shout not at the tenth hour, and we send an evil
report, we shall surely perish.</p>
  <p>"<a name="Page_249"></a>12. And they besought their men to shout,
aloud at the
tenth hour, lest a worse thing should befall.</p>
  <p>"13. And they that were of the tribes of Nob and of
Snob rejoiced with an exceeding great joy, and did
shout with their whole might; so that their voices
became as the voices of them that sell tidings in the street
at nightfall.</p>
  <p>"14. But the Telegraphists and the Sorters and the
Postmen, and them that were of the tribes of Rag and of
Tag, hardened their hearts, and were silent at the tenth
hour; for they said among themselves, 'Shall the poor man
shout in his poverty, and the hungry celebrate his lack of
bread?'</p>
  <p>"15. Now Preece, Lord of Lightning, had wrought with
a cord of metal that they who were at the conversazione
might hear the shouting from the Post Offices.</p>
  <p>"16. And the tenth hour came; and lo! there was no
great shout; and the tribes of Nob and Snob were as the
voice of men calling in the wilderness.</p>
  <p>"17. Then was the wrath of Baines kindled against
the tribes of Rag and Tag for that they had not shouted
according to his word; and he commanded that their chief
men and counsellors should be cast out of the Queen's Post
Office.</p>
  <p>"18. And Raikes, the Postmaster-General; told the
Queen all the travail of Baines, the Inspector-General, and
of them that were with him, and how they had wrought all
for the greater glory of the Queen's name.</p>
  <p>"19. And the Queen hearkened to the word of Raikes,
and lifted up Baines to be a Centurion of the Bath; also
she placed honours upon Cardin, the Receiver-General and
Accountant-General; upon Preece, Lord of Lightning; upon
Thompson, the Secretarial Officer; and upon Tombs, the
Controller, so that they dazzled the eyes of the tribe of Snob,
and were favourably entreated of the sons of Nob.</p>
  <p>"<a name="Page_250"></a>20. And they lived long in the land; and
all
men said
pleasant things unto them.</p>
  <p>"21. But they of Tag and of Rag that had been cast out
were utterly forgotten; so that they were fain to cry aloud,
saying, 'How long, O ye honest and upright in heart, shall
Snobs and Nobs be rulers over us, seeing that they are but
men like unto us, though they imagine us in their hearts to
be otherwise?'</p>
  <p>"22. And the answer is not yet."</p>

<h2><a name="Page_251"></a>XXVII.</h2>
<h2>PARODIES IN VERSE.</h2>
<p>Here I embark on the shoreless sea of metrical parody,
and I begin my cruise by reaffirming that in this
department <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, though distinctly good for
their time, have been left far behind by modern achievements.
The sense of style seems to have grown acuter,
and the art of reproducing it has been brought to absolute
perfection. The theory of development is instructively illustrated
in the history of metrical parody.</p>
<p>Of the same date as <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, and of about
equal merit, is the <i>Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</i>, which our
grandfathers, if they combined literary taste with Conservative
opinions, were never tired of repeating. The extraordinary
brilliancy of the group of men who contributed to
it guaranteed the general character of the book. Its merely
satiric verse is a little beside my present mark; but as a
parody the ballad of <i>Duke Smithson of Northumberland</i>,
founded on <i>Chevy Chase</i>, ranks high, and the inscription for
the cell in Newgate where Mrs. Brownrigg, who murdered her
apprentices, was imprisoned, is even better. Southey, in his
Radical youth, had written some lines on the cell in Chepstow
Castle where Henry Marten the Regicide was confined:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For thirty years secluded from mankind</p>
<p>Here Marten lingered ...</p>
<p class="i17">Dost thou ask his crime?</p>
<p>He had rebell'd against the King, and sate</p>
<p>In judgment on him."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_252"></a>Here is Canning's parody:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For one long term, or e'er her trial came,</p>
<p>Here Brownrigg lingered ...</p>
<p class="i17">Dost thou ask her crime?</p>
<p>She whipped two female 'prentices to death,</p>
<p>And hid them in a coal-hole."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The time of <i>Rejected Addresses</i> and the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>
was
also the heyday of parliamentary quotation, and old parliamentary
hands used to cite a happy instance of instantaneous
parody by Daniel O'Connell, who, having noticed that the
speaker to whom he was replying had his speech written out
in his hat, immediately likened him to Goldsmith's village
schoolmaster, saying,&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew</p>
<p>That one small <i>hat</i> could carry all he knew."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another instance of the same kind was O'Connell's extemporized
description of three ultra-Protestant members,
Colonel Verner, Colonel Vandeleur, and Colonel Sibthorp,
the third of whom was conspicuous in a closely shaven age
for his profusion of facial hair.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Three Colonels, in three different counties born,</p>
<p>Armagh and Clare and Lincoln did adorn.</p>
<p>The first in direst bigotry surpassed:</p>
<p>The next in impudence: in both the last.</p>
<p>The force of Nature could no further go&#8212;</p>
<p>To beard the third, she shaved the former two."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A similarly happy turn to an old quotation was given by
Baron Parke, afterwards Lord Wensleydale. His old friend
and comrade at the Bar, Sir David Dundas, had just been
appointed Solicitor-General, and, in reply to Baron Parke's
invitation to dinner, he wrote that he could not accept it, as
he had been already invited by seven peers for the same
evening. He promptly received the following couplets:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>"Seven thriving cities fight for Homer dead</p>
<p>Through which the living Homer begged his bread."</p>
<hr style="width: 10%; margin-left: 25%;">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Seven noble Lords ask Davie to break bread</p>
<p>Who wouldn't care a d---- were Davie dead."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_253"></a>The <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>&#8212;long since, I
believe, deposed
from their position in public favour&#8212;were published in
1840. Their principal merits are a vein of humour, rollicking
and often coarse, but genuine and infectious; great command
over unusual metres; and an unequalled ingenuity in
making double and treble rhymes: for example&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The poor little Page, too, himself got no quarter, but</p>
<p>Was served the same way, And was found the next day,</p>
<p>With his heels in the air, and his head in the water-butt."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is a general flavour of parody about most of the
ballads. It does not as a rule amount to more than a rather
clumsy mockery of mediaevalism, but the verses prefixed to
the <i>Lay of St. Gengulphus</i> are really rather like a fragment
of a black-letter ballad. The book contains only one absolute
parody, borrowed from Samuel Lover's <i>Lyrics of Ireland</i>,
and then the result is truly offensive, for the poem chosen
for the experiment is one of the most beautiful in the
language&#8212;the <i>Burial of Sir John Moore</i>, which is transmuted
into a stupid story of vulgar debauch. Of much the
same date as the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i> was the <i>Old Curiosity
Shop</i>, and no one who has a really scholarly acquaintance
with Dickens will forget the delightful scraps of Tom Moore's
amatory ditties with which, slightly adapted to current circumstances,
Dick Swiveller used to console himself when
Destiny seemed too strong for him. And it will be remembered
that Mr. Slum composed some very telling parodies
of the same popular author as advertisements for Mrs.
Jarley's Waxworks; but I forbear to quote here what is so
easily accessible.</p>
<p>By way of tracing the development of the Art of Parody,
I am taking my samples in chronological order. In 1845
the Newdigate Prize for an English poem at Oxford was won
by J.W. Burgon, afterwards Dean of Chichester. The subject
was Petra. The successful poem was, on the whole,
not much better and not much worse than the general run
<a name="Page_254"></a>of such compositions; but it contained one
couplet which
Dean Stanley regarded as an absolute gem&#8212;a volume of
description condensed into two lines:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Match me such marvel, save in Eastern clime&#8212;</p>
<p>A rose-red city, half as old as time."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The couplet was universally praised and quoted, and, as a
natural consequence, parodied. There resided then (and
long after) at Trinity College, Oxford, an extraordinarily old
don called Short.<a name="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
When I was an undergraduate he was still tottering about, and we looked
at him with interest because he had been Newman's tutor. To his case
the parodist of the period, in a moment of inspiration, adapted
Burgon's beautiful couplet, saying or singing:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Match me such marvel, save in college port,</p>
<p>That rose-red liquor, half as old as Short."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Rev. E.T. Turner, till recently Registrar of the
University, has been known to say: "I was present when
that egg was laid." It is satisfactory to know that the undergraduate
who laid it&#8212;William Basil Tickell Jones&#8212;attained
deserved eminence in after-life, and died Bishop of St.
David's.</p>
<p>When Burgon was writing his prize-poem about Petra,
Lord John Manners (afterwards seventh Duke of Rutland),
in his capacity as Poet Laureate of Young England, was
writing chivalrous ditties about castles and banners, and
merry peasants, and Holy Church. This kind of mediaeval
romanticism, though glorified by Lord Beaconsfield in <i>Coningsby</i>,
seemed purely laughable to Thackeray, and he made
rather bitter fun of it in <i>Lines upon my Sister's Portrait, by
the Lord Southdown.</i></p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Dash down, dash down yon mandolin, beloved sister mine!</p>
<p>Those blushing lips may never sing the glories of our line:</p>
<p>Our ancient castles echo to the clumsy feet of churls.</p>
<p>The spinning-jenny houses in the mansion of our Earls.</p>
<a name="Page_255"></a>
<p>Sing not, sing not, my Angelina! in days so base and vile,</p>
<p>'Twere sinful to be happy, 'twere sacrilege to smile.</p>
<p>I'll hie me to my lonely hall, and by its cheerless hob</p>
<p>I'll muse on other days, and wish&#8212;and wish I were&#8212;A SNOB."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But, though the spirit of this mournful song is the spirit of
<i>England's Trust</i>, the verbal imitation is not close enough to
deserve the title of Parody.</p>
<p>The <i>Ballads of Bon Gaultier</i>, published anonymously in
1855, had a success which would only have been possible at
a time when really artistic parodies were unknown. Bon
Gaultier's verses are not as a rule much more than rough-and-ready
imitations; and, like so much of the humour of
their day, and of Scotch humour in particular, they generally
depend for their point upon drinking and drunkenness.
Some of the different forms of the Puff Poetical are amusing,
especially the advertisement of Doudney Brothers' Waistcoats,
and the Puff Direct in which Parr's Life-pills are
glorified after the manner of a German ballad. <i>The Laureate</i>
is a fair hit at some of Tennyson's earlier mannerisms:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Who would not be</p>
<p>The Laureate bold,</p>
<p>With his butt of sherry</p>
<p>To keep him merry,</p>
<p>And nothing to do but pocket his gold?"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But <i>The Lay of the Lovelorn</i> is a clumsy and rather vulgar
skit on <i>Locksley Hall</i>&#8212;a poem on which two such writers as
Sir Theodore Martin and Professor Aytoun would have done
well not to lay their sacrilegious hands.</p>
<p>We have now passed through the middle stage of the development
which I am trying to trace; we are leaving clumsiness
and vulgarity behind us, and are approaching the age of
perfection. Sir George Trevelyan's parodies are transitional.
He was born in 1838, three times won the prize poem at
Harrow, and brought out his Cambridge squibs in and soon
after the year 1858. <i>Horace at the University of Athens</i>,
originally written for acting at the famous "A.D.C.," still
<a name="Page_256"></a>holds its own as one of the wittiest of
extravaganzas. It
contains a really pretty imitation of the 10th Eclogue, and it
is studded with adaptations, of which the only possible fault
is that, for the general reader, they are too topical. Here is
a sample:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;" class="i14">"<i>Donec
gratus eram tibi</i>."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hor</i>. While still you loved your Horace best</p>
<p class="i2">Of all my peers who round you pressed</p>
<p class="i2">(Though not in expurgated versions),</p>
<p class="i2">More proud I lived than King of Persians.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Lyd</i>. And while as yet no other dame</p>
<p class="i2">Had kindled in your breast a flame,</p>
<p class="i2">(Though Niebuhr her existence doubt),</p>
<p class="i2">I cut historic Ilia out.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hor</i>. Dark Chloe now my homage owns,</p>
<p class="i2">Skilled on the banjo and the bones;</p>
<p class="i2">For whom I would not fear to die,</p>
<p class="i2">If death would pass my charmer by.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Lyd</i>. I now am lodging at the <i>rus-</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>In-urbe</i> of young Decius Mus.</p>
<p class="i2">Twice over would I gladly die</p>
<p class="i2">To see him hit in either eye.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hor</i>. But should the old love come again,</p>
<p class="i2">And Lydia her sway retain,</p>
<p class="i2">If to my heart once more I take her,</p>
<p class="i2">And bid black Chloe wed the baker?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Lyd</i>. Though you be treacherous as audit</p>
<p class="i2">When at the fire you've lately thawed it,</p>
<p class="i2">For Decius Mus no more I'd care</p>
<p class="i2">Than for their plate the Dons of Clare.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Really this is a much better rendering of the famous
ode than nine-tenths of its more pompous competitors; and
the allusions to the perfidious qualities of Trinity Audit
Ale and the mercenary conduct of the Fellows of Clare
need no explanation for Cambridge readers, and little for
others. But it may be fairly objected that this is not,
in strictness, a parody. That is true, and indeed as a
<a name="Page_257"></a>parodist Sir George Trevelyan belongs to the
metrical
miocene. His Horace, when serving as a volunteer in the
Republican Army, bursts into a pretty snatch of song which
has a flavour of Moore:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The minstrel boy from the wars is gone,</p>
<p class="i1">All out of breath you'll find him;</p>
<p>He has run some five miles, off and on,</p>
<p class="i1">And his shield has flung behind him."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And the Bedmaker's Song in one of the Cambridge scenes
is sweetly reminiscent of a delightful and forgotten bard:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I make the butler fly, all in an hour;</p>
<p class="i1">I put aside the preserves and cold meats,</p>
<p>Telling my master the cream has turned sour,</p>
<p class="i1">Hiding the pickles, purloining the sweets."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I never languish for husband or dower;</p>
<p class="i1">I never sigh to see 'gyps' at my feet;</p>
<p>I make the butter fly, all in an hour,</p>
<p class="i1">Taking it home for my Saturday treat."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This, unless I greatly err, is a very good parody of
Thomas Haynes Bayly, author of some of the most popular
songs of a sentimental cast which were chanted in our youth
and before it. But this is ground on which I must not
trench, for Mr. Andrew Lang has made it his own. The
most delightful essay in one of his books of Reprints deals
with this amazing bard, and contains some parodies so
perfect that Mr. Haynes Bayly would have rejoicingly claimed
them as his own.</p>
<p>Charles Stuart Calverley is by common consent the king
of metrical parodists. All who went before merely adumbrated
him and led up to him; all who have come since
are descended from him and reflect him. Of course he
was infinitely more than a mere imitator of rhymes and
rhythms. He was a true poet; he was one of the most
graceful scholars that Cambridge ever produced; and all
his exuberant fun was based on a broad and strong founda<a
 name="Page_258"></a>tion
of Greek, Latin, and English literature. <i>Verses and
Translations, by C.S.C.</i>, which appeared in 1862, was a
young man's book, although its author had already established
his reputation as a humorist by the inimitable
Examination Paper on <i>Pickwick</i>; and, being a young man's
book, it was a book of unequal merit. The translations
I leave on one side, as lying outside my present purview,
only remarking as I pass that if there is a finer rendering
than that of Ajax&#8212;645-692&#8212;I do not know where it is
to be found. My business is with the parodies. It was
not till ten years later that in <i>Fly Leaves</i> Calverley asserted
his supremacy in the art, but even in <i>Verses and Translations</i>
he gave good promise of what was to be.</p>
<p>Of all poems in the world, I suppose <i>Horatius</i> has been
most frequently and most justly parodied. Every Public
School magazine contains at least one parody of it every
year. In my Oxford days there was current an admirable
version of it (attributed to the Rev. W.W. Merry, now
Rector of Lincoln College), which began,&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Adolphus Smalls, of Boniface,</p>
<p class="i1">By all the powers he swore</p>
<p>That, though he had been ploughed three times,</p>
<p class="i1">He would be ploughed no more,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and traced with curious fidelity the successive steps in the
process of preparation till the dreadful day of examination
arrived:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"They said he made strange quantities,</p>
<p class="i1">Which none might make but he;</p>
<p>And that strange things were in his Prose</p>
<p class="i1">Canine to a degree:</p>
<p>But they called his <i>Viva Voce</i> fair,</p>
<p class="i1">They said his 'Books' would do;</p>
<p>And native cheek, where facts were weak,</p>
<p class="i1">Brought him triumphant through.</p>
<p>And in each Oxford college</p>
<p class="i1">In the dim November days,</p>
<p>When undergraduates fresh from hall</p>
<p class="i1">Are gathering round the blaze;</p>
<a name="Page_259"></a>
<p>When the 'crusted port' is opened,</p>
<p class="i1">And the Moderator's lit,</p>
<p>And the weed glows in the Freshman's mouth,</p>
<p class="i1">And makes him turn to spit;</p>
<p>With laughing and with chaffing</p>
<p class="i1">The story they renew,</p>
<p>How Smalls of Boniface went in,</p>
<p class="i1">And actually got through."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So much for the Oxford rendering of Macaulay's famous
lay. "C.S.C." thus adapted it to Cambridge, and to a
different aspect of undergraduate life:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"On pinnacled St. Mary's</p>
<p class="i1">Lingers the setting sun;</p>
<p>Into the street the blackguards</p>

<p>Butcher and Boots and Bargeman</p>

<p>And with wild shout come tumbling out</p>

<p><i>Enoch Arden</i> was published in 1864, and was not
enthusiastically
received by true lovers of Tennyson, though people
who had never read him before thought it wonderfully fine.
A kinsman of mine always contended that the story ended
wrongly, and that the really human, and therefore dramatic,
conclusion would have been as follows:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For Philip's dwelling fronted on the street,</p>
<p>And Enoch, coming, saw the house a blaze</p>
<p>Of light, and Annie drinking from a mug&#8212;</p>
<p>A funny mug, all blue with strange device</p>
<p>Of birds and waters and a little man.</p>
<p>And Philip held a bottle; and a smell</p>
<p>Of strong tobacco, with a fainter smell&#8212;</p>
<p>But still a smell, and quite distinct&#8212;of gin</p>
<p>Was there. He raised the latch, and stealing by</p>
<p>The cupboard, where a row of teacups stood,</p>
<p>Hard by the genial hearth, he paused behind</p>
<p>The luckless pair, then drawing back his foot&#8212;</p>
<p>His manly foot, all clad in sailors' hose&#8212;</p>
<p>He swung it forth with such a grievous kick</p>
<p>That Philip in a moment was propelled</p>
<p>Against his wife, though not his wife; and she</p>
<p>Fell forwards, smashing saucers, cups, and jug</p>
<p>Fell in a heap. All shapeless on the floor</p>
<p>Philip and Annie and the crockery lay.</p>
<p>Then Enoch's voice accompanied his foot,</p>
<p>For both were raised, with horrid oath and kick,</p>
<p>Till constables came in with Miriam Lane</p>
<p>And bare them all to prison, railing loud.</p>
<p>Then Philip was discharged and ran away,</p>
<p>And Enoch paid a fine for the assault;</p>
<p>And Annie went to Philip, telling him</p>
<p>That she would see old Enoch further first</p>
<p>Before she would acknowledge him to be</p>
<p>Himself, if Philip only would return.</p>
<p>But Philip said that he would rather not.</p>
<p>Then Annie plucked such handfuls of his hair</p>
<p>Out of his head that he was nearly bald.</p>
<p>But Enoch laughed, and said, 'Well done, my girl.'</p>
<p>And so the two shook hands and made it up."</p>

<p><a name="Page_261"></a>In 1869 Lewis Carroll published a little book
of rhymes
called <i>Phantasmagoria</i>. It related chiefly to Oxford. Partly
because it was anonymous, partly because it was mainly
topical, the book had no success. But it contained two or
three parodies which deserve to rank with the best in the
language. One is an imitation of a ballad in black-letter called</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>Then, again, there is excellent metaphysical fooling in <i>The
Three Voices</i>. But far the best parody in the book&#8212;and
the most richly deserved by the absurdity of its original&#8212;
is <i>Hiawatha's Photographing</i>. It has the double merit of
absolute similarity in cadence and life-like realism. Unluckily
the limits of space forbid complete citation:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"From his shoulder Hiawatha</p>
<p>Took the camera of rosewood,</p>
<p>Made of sliding, folding rosewood;</p>
<p>Neatly put it all together.</p>
<p>In its case it lay compactly,</p>
<p>Folded into nearly nothing.</p>
<p>But he opened out the hinges,</p>
<p>Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,</p>
<p>Till it looked all squares and oblongs,</p>
<p>Like a complicated figure</p>
<p>In the Second Book of Euclid.</p>
<p>This he perched upon a tripod,</p>
<p>And the family in order</p>
<p>Sate before him for their portraits.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Each in turn, as he was taken,</p>
<p>Volunteered his own suggestions,</p>
<p>His ingenious suggestions.</p>
<p>First the Governor, the Father:</p>
<p>He suggested velvet curtains,</p>
<p>And the corner of a table,</p>
<p>Of a rosewood dining-table.</p>
<a name="Page_262"></a>
<p>He would hold a scroll of something,</p>
<p>Hold it firmly in his left hand;</p>
<p>He would keep his right hand buried</p>
<p>(Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;</p>
<p>He would contemplate the distance</p>
<p>With a look of pensive meaning,</p>
<p>As of ducks that die in tempests.</p>
<p>Grand, heroic was the notion,</p>
<p>Yet the picture failed entirely,</p>
<p>Failed, because he moved a little;</p>
<p>Moved, because he couldn't help it."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Who does not know that Father in the flesh? and who
has not seen him&#8212;velvet curtains, dining-table, scroll, and
all&#8212;on the most conspicuous wall of the Royal Academy?
The Father being disposed of,</p>

<p>Curves pervading all his figure,</p>

<p>Centered in the golden breastpin.</p>
<p>He had learnt it all from Ruskin,</p>
<p>Author of the <i>Stones of Venice</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>But, in spite of such culture, the portrait was a failure,
and the elder sister fared no better. Then the younger

</div>
<p>Undaunted by these repeated failures, Hiawatha, by a great
final effort, "tumbled all the tribe together" in the manner
of a family group, and&#8212;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>"Did at last obtain a picture</p>

<p>How true to life is this final touch of indignation at the
unflattering truth! But time and space forbid me further
to pursue the photographic song of Hiawatha.</p>
<p><i>Phantasmagoria</i> filled an aching void during the ten years
which elapsed between the appearance of <i>Verses and Translations</i>
and that of <i>Fly Leaves</i>. The latter book is small,
only 124 pages in all, including the <i>Pickwick</i> Examination
Paper, but what marvels of mirth and poetry and satire it
contains! How secure its place in the affections of all who
love the gentle art of parody! My rule is not to quote
extensively from books which are widely known; but I must
give myself the pleasure of repeating just six lines which
even appreciative critics generally overlook. They relate to
the conversation of the travelling tinker.</p>

<h2>PARODIES IN VERSE&#8212;<i>continued</i>.</h2>
<p>When I embarked upon the subject of metrical parody
I said that it was a shoreless sea. For my own part, I
enjoy sailing over these rippling waters, and cannot be
induced to hurry. Let us put in for a moment at Belfast.
There in 1874 the British Association held its annual meeting;
and Professor Tyndall delivered an inaugural address
in which he revived and glorified the Atomic Theory of the
Universe. His glowing peroration ran as follows: "Here
I must quit a theme too great for me to handle, but which
will be handled by the loftiest minds ages after you and I,
like streaks of morning cloud, shall have melted into the
infinite azure of the past." Shortly afterwards <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i>, always famous for its humorous and satiric verse,
published a rhymed abstract of Tyndall's address, of which
I quote (from memory) the concluding lines:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Let us greatly honour the Atom, so lively, so wise, and so small;</p>
<p>The Atomists, too, let us honour&#8212;Epicurus, Lucretius, and all.</p>
<p>Let us damn with faint praise Bishop Butler, in whom many atoms
combined</p>
<p>To form that remarkable structure which it pleased him to call his
mind.</p>
<p>Next praise we the noble body to which, for the time, we belong</p>
<p>(Ere yet the swift course of the Atom hath hurried us breathless
along)&#8212;</p>
<p>The BRITISH ASSOCIATION&#8212;like Leviathan worshipped by Hobbes,</p>
<p>The incarnation of wisdom built up of our witless nobs;</p>
<p>Which will carry on endless discussion till I, and probably you,</p>
<p>Have <i>melted in infinite azure</i>&#8212;and, in short, till all is
blue."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_265"></a>Surely this translation of the Professor's
misplaced dithyrambics
into the homeliest of colloquialisms is both good
parody and just criticism.</p>
<p>In 1876 there appeared a clever little book (attributed to
Sir Frederick Pollock) which was styled <i>Leading Cases done
into English, by an Apprentice of Lincoln's Inn</i>. It appealed
only to a limited public, for it is actually a collection of
sixteen important law-cases set forth, with explanatory notes,
in excellent verse imitated from poets great and small.
Chaucer, Browning, Tennyson, Swinburne, Clough, Rossetti,
and James Rhoades supply the models, and I have been
credibly informed that the law is as good as the versification.
Mr. Swinburne was in those days the favourite butt of young
parodists, and the gem of the book is the dedication to
"J.S." or "John Stiles," a mythical person, nearly related
to John Doe and Richard Roe, with whom all budding
jurists had in old days to make acquaintance. The disappearance
of the venerated initials from modern law-books
inspired the following:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p class="i1">Of storms, or with sunlight made whole,</p>

</div>
<p>Some five-and-twenty years ago there appeared the first
number of a magazine called <i>The Dark Blue</i>. It was
published in London, but was understood to represent in
some occult way the thought and life of Young Oxford, and
its contributors were mainly Oxford men. The first number
contained an amazing ditty called "The Sun of my Songs."
It was dark, and mystic, and transcendental, and unintelligible.
It dealt extensively in strange words and cryptic
phrases. One verse I must transcribe:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Yet all your song</p>
<p class="i1">Is&#8212;'Ding dong,</p>
<p class="i1">Summer is dead,</p>
<p class="i1">Spring is dead&#8212;</p>
<p>O my heart, and O my head</p>
<p>Go a-singing a silly song</p>
<p class="i1">All wrong,</p>
<p class="i1">For all is dead.</p>
<p class="i2">Ding dong,</p>
<p class="i1">And I am dead!</p>
<p class="i2">Dong!'"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I quote thus fully because Cambridge, never backward
in poking fun at her more romantic sister, shortly afterwards
produced an excellent little magazine named sarcastically
<i>The Light Green</i>, and devoted to the ridicule of its cerulean
rival. The poem from which I have just quoted was thus
burlesqued, if, indeed, burlesque of such a composition were
possible:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_267"></a>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ding dong, ding dong,</p>
<p>There goes the gong;</p>
<p>Dick, come along,</p>
<p class="i1">It is time for dinner</p>
<p>Wash your face,</p>
<p>Take your place.</p>
<p>Where's your grace,</p>
<p class="i1">You little sinner?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Baby cry,</p>
<p class="i1">Wipe his eye.</p>
<p class="i1">Baby good,</p>
<p class="i1">Give him food.</p>
<p class="i1">Baby sleepy,</p>
<p class="i1">Go to bed.</p>
<p class="i1">Baby naughty,</p>
<p class="i1">Smack his head!"</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>The Light Green</i>, which had only an ephemeral life, was,
I have always heard, entirely, or almost entirely, the work
of one undergraduate, who died young&#8212;Arthur Clement
Hilton, of, St. John's.<a name="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
He certainly had the knack of
catching and reproducing style. In the "May Exam.," a
really good imitation of the "May Queen," the departing
undergraduate thus addresses his "gyp":&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When the men come up again, Filcher, and the Term is at its height,</p>
<p>You'll never see me more in these long gay rooms at night;</p>
<p>When the "old dry wines" are circling, and the claret-cup flows cool,</p>
<p>And the loo is fast and furious, with a fiver in the pool."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1872 "Lewis Carroll" brought out <i>Through the
Looking-glass</i>, and every one who has ever read that pretty
work of poetic fancy will remember the ballad of the
Walrus and the Carpenter. It was parodied in <i>The Light
Green</i> under the title of "The Vulture and the Husbandman."
This poem described the agonies of a <i>viva-voce</i>
examination, and it derived its title from two facts of evil
omen&#8212;that the Vulture plucks its victim, and that the
Husbandman makes his living by ploughing:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_268"></a>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Two undergraduates came up,</p>
<p class="i1">And slowly took a seat,</p>
<p>They knit their brows, and bit their thumbs,</p>
<p class="i1">As if they found them sweet;</p>
<p>And this was odd, because, you know,</p>
<p class="i1">Thumbs are not good to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'The time has come,' the Vulture said,</p>
<p class="i1">'To talk of many things&#8212;</p>
<p>Of Accidence and Adjectives,</p>
<p class="i1">And names of Jewish Kings;</p>
<p>How many notes a Sackbut has,</p>
<p class="i1">And whether Shawms have strings.'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Please sir,' the Undergraduates said,</p>
<p class="i1">Turning a little blue,</p>
<p>'We did not know that was the sort</p>
<p class="i1">Of thing we had to do.'</p>
<p>'We thank you much,' the Vulture said;</p>
<p class="i1">'Send up another two.'"</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The base expedients to which an examination reduces its
victims are hit off with much dexterity in "The Heathen
Pass-ee," a parody of an American poem which is too
familiar to justify quotation:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Tom Crib was his name,</p>
<p class="i1">And I shall not deny,</p>
<p>In regard to the same,</p>
<p class="i1">What that name might imply;</p>
<p>But his face it was trustful and childlike,</p>
<p class="i1">And he had the most innocent eye.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<hr style="width: 15%; margin-left: 10%;"></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"On the cuffs of his shirt</p>
<p class="i1">He had managed to get</p>
<p>What we hoped had been dirt,</p>
<p class="i1">But which proved, I regret,</p>
<p>To be notes on the Rise of the Drama</p>
<p class="i1">A question invariably set.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"In the crown of his cap</p>
<p class="i1">Were the Furies and Fates,</p>
<p>And a delicate map</p>
<p class="i1">Of the Dorian States;</p>
<p>And we found in his palms, which were hollow,</p>
<p class="i1">What are frequent in palms&#8212;that is, dates."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Deservedly dear to the heart of English youth are the
<a name="Page_269"></a>Nonsense Rhymes of Edward Lear. It will be
recollected
that the form of the verse as originally constructed reproduced
the final word of the first line at the end of the fifth,
thus:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"There was an old person of Basing</p>
<p>Whose presence of mind was amazing;</p>
<p class="i1">He purchased a steed</p>
<p class="i1">Which he rode at full speed,</p>
<p>And escaped from the people of Basing."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But in the process of development it became usual to find
a new word for the end of the fifth line, thus at once securing
a threefold rhyme and introducing the element of unexpectedness,
instead of inevitableness, into the conclusion. Thus
<i>The Light Green</i> sang of the Colleges in which it circulated&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"There was an old Fellow of Trinity,</p>
<p>A Doctor well versed in divinity;</p>
<p class="i1">But he took to free-thinking,</p>
<p class="i1">And then to deep drinking,</p>
<p>And so had to leave the vicinity."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"There was a young genius of Queen's</p>
<p>Who was fond of explosive machines;</p>
<p class="i1">He blew open a door,</p>
<p class="i1">But he'll do so no more&#8212;</p>
<p>For it chanced that that door was the Dean's."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"There was a young gourmand of John's</p>
<p>Who'd a notion of dining off swans;</p>
<p class="i1">To the "Backs" he took big nets</p>
<p class="i1">To capture the cygnets,</p>
<p>But was told they were kept for the Dons."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So far <i>The Light Green</i>.</p>
<p>Not at all dissimilar in feeling to these ebullitions of
youthful fancy were the parodies of nursery rhymes which the
lamented Corney Grain invented for one of his most popular
entertainments, and used to accompany on the piano in his
own inimitable style. I well remember the opening verse of
one, in which an incident in the social career of a Liberal
millionaire was understood to be immortalized:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_270"></a>
<p>"Old Mr. Parvenu gave a great ball,</p>
<p>And of all his smart guests he knew no one at all;</p>
<p>Old Mr. Parvenu went up to bed,</p>
<p>And his guests said good-night to the butler instead."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Twenty years ago we were in the crisis of the great Jingo
fever, and Lord Beaconsfield's antics in the East were
frightening all sober citizens out of their senses. It was
at that period that the music-halls rang with the "Great
MacDermott's" Tyrtaean strain&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"We don't want to fight; but, by Jingo, if we do,</p>
<p>We've got the ships, we've got the men, we've got the money too;"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and the word "Jingo" took its place in the language as
the recognized symbol of a warlike policy. At Easter 1878
it was announced that the Government were bringing black
troops from India to Malta, to aid our English forces in
whatever enterprises lay before them. The refrain of the
music-hall was instantly adapted with great effect, even the
grave <i>Spectator</i> giving currency to the parody&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"We don't want to fight; but, by Jingo, if we do,</p>
<p>We won't go to the front ourselves, but we'll send the mild Hindoo."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two years passed. Lord Beaconsfield was deposed. The
tide of popular feeling turned in favour of Liberalism, and
"Jingo" became a term of reproach. Mr. Tennyson, as he
then was, endeavoured to revive the patriotic spirit of his
countrymen by publishing <i>Hands all Round</i>&#8212;a poem which
had the supreme honour of being quoted in the House of
Commons by Sir Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett. Forthwith an

<p>The Jingo fever having abated, another malady appeared
in the body politic. Trouble broke out in Ireland, and in
January 1881 Parliament was summoned to pass Mr. Forster's
Coercion Act. My diary for that date supplies me with the

rushing with ardent sympathy into the Irish struggle.</p>

<p>By the time that these lines were written the late
Mr. J.K. Stephen&#8212;affectionately known by his friends as
"Jem Stephen"&#8212;was beginning to be recognized as an
extraordinarily good writer of humorous verse. His performances
in this line were not collected till ten years later
(<i>Lapsus Calami</i>, 1891), and his brilliant career was cut short,
by the results of an accident, in 1892. I reproduce the
following sonnet, not only because I think it an excellent
criticism aptly expressed, but because I desire to pay my
tribute of admiration to one of whom all men spoke golden

<div class="poem">

<p>And one is of an old, half-witted sheep</p>

<p>The chiefs of the Permanent Civil Service are not usually,
as Swift said, "blasted with poetic fire," but this delightful
ditty is from the pen of Mr. Henry Graham, the Clerk of the
Parliaments.</p>
<p>Of the metrical parodists of the present hour two are
extremely good. Mr. Owen Seaman is, beyond and before
all his rivals, "up to date," and pokes his lyrical fun at such
songsters as Mr. Alfred Austin, Mr. William Watson, Mr.
Rudyard Kipling, and Mr. Richard Le Gallienne. But
"Q." is content to try his hand on poets of more ancient
standing; and he is not only of the school but of the lineage
of "C.S.C." I have said before that I forbear, as a rule, to
quote from books as easily accessible as <i>Green Bays;</i> but
is there a branch of the famous "Omar Khayy&aacute;m Club" in
Manchester? If there be, to it I offer this delicious morsel,
only apologizing to the uninitiated reader for the pregnant

<p>No versifier of the present day lends himself so readily to
parody as Mr. Kipling. His "Story of Ung" is an excellent
satire on certain methods of contemporary literature:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Once on a glittering icefield, ages and ages ago,</p>
<p>Ung, a maker of pictures, fashioned an image of snow.</p>
<p>Fashioned the form of a tribesman; gaily he whistled and sung,</p>
<p>Working the snow with his fingers, '<i>Read ye the story of Ung!</i>'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<hr style="width: 15%; margin-left: 20%;"></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And the father of Ung gave answer, that was old and wise in the
craft,</p>
<p>Maker of pictures aforetime, he leaned on his lance and laughed:</p>
<p>'If they could see as thou seest they would do as thou hast done,</p>
<p>And each man would make him a picture, and&#8212;what would
become of my son?'"</p>
</div>

<p>So far Mr. Kipling. A parodist writing in <i>Truth</i> applies the
same "criticism of life" to commercial production:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><a name="Page_276"></a>
<p class="i17">THE STORY OF BUNG.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Once, ere the glittering icefields paid us a tribute of gold,</p>
<p>Bung, the son of a brewer, heir to a fortune untold&#8212;</p>
<p>Vast was his knowledge of brewing&#8212;gaily began his career.</p>
<p>Whispered the voice of ambition, "Perhaps they will make thee a
peer."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>People who sampled his liquor wunk an incredulous wink,</p>
<p>Smelt it, then drank it, and grunted, "Verily <i>this</i> is a
drink!"</p>
<p>Even the Clubman admitted, wetting the tip of his tongue,</p>
<p>"Lo! it is excellent beer! Glory and honour to Bung!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Straightway the doubters assembled, a prying, unsatisfied horde:</p>
<p>"It is <i>said</i> the materials used are approved by the Revenue
Board;</p>
<p>It is claimed that no adjuncts are used, the advertisements say it
is pure;</p>
<p>True, the beer is good&#8212;and it may be&#8212;but can the consumer be sure?"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Wroth was that brewer of liquor, knowing the doubters were right,</p>
<p>User of chemical adjuncts, and methods that bear not the light;</p>
<p>Little he recked of disclosures, much of the profits he cleared,</p>
<p>So in the ear of his father whispered the thing that he feared.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And the father of Bung gave answer, that was old and wise in the
craft,</p>
<p>"If they cast suspicion upon thee, it is nought but a random shaft;</p>
<p>If others could know what thou knowest, they would do what thou hast
done,</p>
<p>And men would drink of their brewing, and&#8212;what would become of my</p>
<p>son?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"So long as thy beer is best, so long shall thy brewing win</p>
<p>The praise no money can buy, and the money that praise brings in.</p>
<p>And if the majority's pleased, the majority does not mind</p>
<p>The <i>how</i>, and the <i>what</i>, and the <i>whence</i>.
Rejoice that the public is blind."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And Bung took his father's counsel, and fell to his brewing of beer,</p>
<p>And he gave the Government cheques, and the Government made him</p>
<p>a peer,</p>
<p>And the doubters ceased from their doubting, loudly his praises they
sung,</p>
<p>Cursing their previous blindness. <i>Heed ye the story of Bung!</i></p>

<h2><a name="Page_278"></a>XXIX.</h2>
<h2>VERBAL INFELICITIES.</h2>
<p>"<i>Se non &egrave; vero</i>," said a very great Lord Mayor, "<i>&egrave;
ben
traviata</i>." His lordship's linguistic slip served him
right. Latin is fair play, though some of us are in the
condition of the auctioneer in <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, who
had brought away with him from the Great Mudport Free
School "a sense of understanding Latin generally, though
his comprehension of any particular Latin was not ready."
But to quote from any other language is to commit an outrage
on your guests. The late Sir Robert Fowler was, I
believe, the only Lord Mayor who ever ventured to quote
Greek, but I have heard him do it, and have seen the turtle-fed
company smile with alien lips in the painful attempt to
look as if they understood it, and in abject terror lest their
neighbour should ask them to translate. Mr. James Payn
used to tell a pleasing tale of a learned clergyman who
quoted Greek at dinner. The lady who was sitting by Mr.
Payn inquired in a whisper what one of these quotations
meant. He gave her to understand, with a well-assumed
blush, that it was scarcely fit for a lady's ear. "Good
heavens!" she exclaimed; "you don't mean to say ----"
"Please don't ask any more," said Payn pleadingly; "I
really could not tell you." Which was true to the ear, if
not to the sense.</p>
<p>Municipal eloquence has been time out of mind a storehouse
of delight. It was, according to tradition, a provin<a name="Page_279"></a>cial
mayor who, blessed with a numerous progeny, publicly
expressed the pious hope that his sons might grow up to be
better citizens than their father, and his daughters more
virtuous women than their mother. There was a worthy
alderman at Oxford in my time who was entertained at a
public dinner on his retirement from civic office. In replying
to the toast of his health, he said it had always been his
anxious endeavour to administer justice without swerving
to "partiality on the one hand or impartiality on the other."
Surely he must have been near akin to the moralist who
always tried to tread "the narrow path which lay between
right and wrong;" or, perchance, to the newly-elected mayor
who, in returning thanks for his elevation, said that during
his year of office he should lay aside all his political prepossessions
and be, "like Caesar's wife, all things to all men."
A well-known dignitary, rebuking his housemaid for using
his bath during his absence from the Deanery, said, "I am
grieved to think that you should do behind my back what
you wouldn't do before my face;" and it was related of
my old friend Dean Burgon that once, in a sermon on the
transcendent merits of the Anglican school of theology, he
exclaimed, with a fervour which was all his own, "May I
live the life of a Taylor, and die the death of a Bull!" The
late Lord Coleridge, eulogizing Oxford, said in his most
dulcet tone, "I speak not of this college or of that, but of
the University as a whole; and, gentlemen, what a <i>whole</i>
Oxford is!"</p>
<p>The admirable Mr. Brooke, when he purposed to contest
the Borough of Middlemarch, found Will Ladislaw extremely
useful, because he "remembered what the right quotations
are&#8212;<i>Omne tulit punctum</i>, and that sort of thing." And
certainly an apt quotation is one of the most effective decorations
of a public speech; but the dangers of inappositeness
are correspondingly formidable. I have always heard
that the most infelicitous quotation on record was made by
<a name="Page_280"></a>the fourth Lord Fitzwilliam at a county meeting
held at York
to raise a fund for the repair of the Minster after the fire
which so nearly destroyed it in 1829. Previous speakers
had, naturally, appealed to the pious munificence of Churchmen.
Lord Fitzwilliam, as the leading Whig of the county,
thought that it would be an excellent move to enlist the
sympathies of the rich Nonconformists, and that he was the
man to do it. So he perorated somewhat after the following
fashion:&#8212;"And, if the liberality of Yorkshire Churchmen
proves insufficient to restore the chief glory of our native
county, then, with all confidence, I turn to our excellent
Dissenting brethren, and I exclaim, with the Latin poet,</p>

<p>Mr. Anstey Guthrie has some pleasant instances of texts
misapplied. He was staying once in a Scotch country-house
where, over his bed, hung an illuminated scroll with the inscription,
"Occupy till I come," which, as Mr. Guthrie justly
observes, is an unusually extended invitation, even for
Scottish notions of hospitality. According to the same
authority, the leading citizen of a seaside town erected
some iron benches on the sea front, and, with the view of
at once commemorating his own munificence and giving a
profitable turn to the thoughts of the sitters, inscribed on
the backs&#8212;<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;"><br>

<p>Nothing is more deeply rooted in the mind of the average
man than that certain well-known aphorisms of piety are to
be found in the Bible&#8212;possibly in that lost book the Second
Epistle to the Ephesians, which Dickens must have had in
his mind when he wrote in <i>Dombey and Son</i> of the First
<a name="Page_281"></a>Epistle to that Church. "In the midst of life we
are in
death" is a favourite quotation from this imaginary Scripture.
"His end was peace" holds its place on many a
tomb in virtue of a similar belief. "He tempers the wind
to the shorn lamb" is, I believe, commonly attributed to
Solomon; and a charming song which was popular in my
youth declared that, though the loss of friends was sad, it
would have been much sadder,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Had we ne'er heard that Scripture word,</p>
<p class="i1">'Not lost, but gone before.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gamp, with some hazy recollections of the New
Testament floating in her mind, invented the admirable
aphorism that "Rich folks may ride on camels, but it ain't
so easy for 'em to see out of a needle's eye." And a lady of
my acquaintance, soliloquizing on the afflictions of life and
the serenity of her own temper, exclaimed, "How true it is
what Solomon says, 'A contented spirit is like a perpetual
dropping on a rainy day'!"</p>
<p>A Dissenting minister, winding up a week's mission, is
reported to have said, "And if any spark of grace has been
kindled by these exercises, oh, we pray Thee, water that
spark." A watered spark is good, but what of a harnessed
volcano? When that eminent Civil servant, Sir Hugh Owen,
retired from the Local Government Board, a gentleman wrote
to the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> in favour of "harnessing this by no
means extinct volcano to the great task" of codifying the
Poor Law. An old peasant-woman in Buckinghamshire,
extolling the merits of her favourite curate, said to the rector,
"I do say that Mr. Woods is quite an angel in sheep's
clothing;" and Dr. Liddon told me of a Presbyterian
minister who was called on at short notice to officiate at the
parish church of Crathie in the presence of the Queen, and,
transported by this tremendous experience, burst forth in
rhetorical supplication&#8212;"Grant that as she grows to be an
<a name="Page_282"></a>old woman she may be made a new man; and that in
all
righteous causes she may go forth before her people like a

before each examination is spent in the hasty acquisition of
much ill-assorted and indigestible knowledge, are not seldom
the victims of similar confusions. At Oxford&#8212;and, for all
I know, at Cambridge too&#8212;a hideous custom prevails of
placing before the examinee a list of isolated texts, and requiring
him to supply the name of the speaker, the occasion,
and the context.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>.&#8212;"'My punishment is greater than I can bear.'
Who said this? Under what circumstances?"</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>.&#8212;"Agag, when he was hewn in pieces."</p>
<p>One wonders at what stage of the process he began to
think it was going a little too far.</p>
<p>"What is faith?" inquired an examiner in "Pass-Divinity."
"Faith is the faculty by which we are enabled
to believe that which we know is not true," replied the
undergraduate, who had learned his definition by heart, but
imperfectly, from a popular cram-book. A superficial knowledge
of literature may sometimes be a snare. "Can you
give me any particulars of Oliver Cromwell's death?" asked
an Examiner in History in 1874. "Oh yes, sir," eagerly
replied the victim: "he exclaimed, 'Had I but served my
God as I have served my King, He would not in mine age
have left me naked to mine enemies.'"</p>
<p>"Things one would rather have expressed differently" are,
I believe, a discovery of Mr. Punch's. Of course he did not
create them. They must be as old as human nature itself.
The history of their discovery is not unlike that of another
epoch-making achievement of the same great genius, as set
forth in the preface to the <i>Book of Snobs</i>. First, the world
was made; then, as a matter of course, snobs; they existed
for years and years, and were no more known than America.
<a name="Page_283"></a>But presently&#8212;<i>ingens patebat tellus</i>&#8212;people
became darkly
aware that there was such a race. Then in time a name
arose to designate that race. That name has spread over
England like railroads. Snobs are known and recognised
throughout an Empire on which the sun never sets. <i>Punch</i>
appeared at the ripe season to chronicle their history, and
the individual came forth to write that history in <i>Punch</i>.
We may apply this historical method to the origin and
discovery of "Things one would rather have expressed
differently." They must have existed as long as language;
they must have flourished wherever men and women encountered
one another in social intercourse. But the glory
of having discovered them, recognized them, classified them,
and established them among the permanent sources of human
enjoyment belongs to Mr. Punch alone.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"He was the first that ever burst</p>
<p class="i1">Into that silent sea."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let us humbly follow in his wake.</p>
<p>We shall see later on that no department of human speech
is altogether free from "Things one would rather have expressed
differently;" but, naturally, the great bulk of them
belong to social conversation; and, just as the essential
quality of a "bull" is that it expresses substantial sense
in the guise of verbal nonsense, so the social "Thing one
would rather have expressed differently" must, to be really
precious, show a polite intention struggling with verbal infelicity.
Mr. Corney Grain, narrating his early experiences
as a social entertainer, used to describe an evening party
given by the Dowager Duchess of S---- at which he was
engaged to play and sing. Late in the evening the young
Duke of S---- came in, and Mr. Grain heard his mother
prompting him in an anxious undertone: "Pray go and
say something civil to Mr. Grain. You know he's quite a
gentleman&#8212;not a common professional person." Thus in<a name="Page_284"></a>structed,
the young Duke strolled up to the piano and said,
"Good-evening, Mr. Grain. I'm sorry I am so late, and
have missed your performance. But I was at Lady ---- 's.
<i>We had a dancing-dog there.</i>"</p>
<p>The married daughter of one of the most brilliant men
of Queen Victoria's reign has an only child. An amiable
matron of her acquaintance, anxious to be thoroughly kind,
said, "O Mrs. W----, I hear that you have such a
clever little boy." Mrs. W., beaming with a mother's pride,
replied, "Well, yes, I think Roger is rather a sharp little
fellow." "Yes," replied her friend. "How often one sees
that&#8212;the talent skipping a generation!" A stately old
rector in Buckinghamshire&#8212;a younger son of a great
family&#8212;whom I knew well in my youth, had, and was justly
proud of, a remarkably pretty and well-appointed rectory.
To him an acquaintance, coming for the first time to call,
genially exclaimed, "What a delightful rectory! Really a
stranger arriving in the village, and not knowing who lived
here, would take it for a gentleman's house." One of our
best-known novelists, the most sensitively courteous of men,
arriving very late at a dinner-party, was overcome with
confusion&#8212;"I am truly sorry to be so shockingly late."
The genial hostess, only meaning to assure him that he
was not the last, emphatically replied "O, Mr.----, you
can't come too late." A member of the present<a name="FNanchor_33"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> Cabinet
was engaged with his wife and daughter to dine at a friend's
house in the height of the season. The daughter fell ill
at the last moment, and her parents first telegraphed her
excuses for dislocating the party, and then repeated them
earnestly on arriving. The hostess, receiving them with the
most cordial sympathy, exclaimed, "Oh, it doesn't matter
in the least to us; we are only so sorry for your daughter."
An eminent authoress, who lives not a hundred miles from
Richmond Hill, was asked, in my hearing, if she had been
<a name="Page_285"></a>to "write her name" at White Lodge, in Richmond
Park
(then occupied by the Duchess of Took), on the occasion
of an important event in the Duchess's family. She replied
that she had not, because she did not know the Duchess,
and saw no use in adding another stranger's signature to
the enormous list. "Oh, that's a pity," was the rejoinder;
"the Royal Family think more of the quantity of names
than the quality."</p>
<p>In all these cases the courtesy of the intention was
manifest; but sometimes it is less easy to discover. Not
long ago Sir Henry Trying most kindly went down to one
of our great Public Schools to give some Shakespearean
recitations. Talking over the arrangements with the Head
Master, who was not a man of felicities and facilities, he
said, "Each piece will take about an hour; and there
must be fifteen minutes' interval between the two." "Oh!
certainly," replied the Head Master; "you couldn't expect
the boys to stand two hours of it without a break." The
newly appointed rector of one of the chief parishes in
London was entertained at dinner by a prominent member
of the congregation. Conversation turned on the use of
stimulants as an aid to intellectual and physical effort, and
Mr. Gladstone's historic egg-flip was cited. "Well, for my
own part," said the divine, "I am quite independent of that
kind of help. The only occasion in my life when I used
anything of the sort was when I was in for my tripos
at Cambridge, and then, by the doctor's order, I took a
strong dose of strychnine, in order to clear the brain." The
hostess, in a tone of the deepest interest, inquired, "How
soon did the effect pass off?" and the rector, a man of
academical distinction, who had done his level best in his
inaugural sermons on the previous Sunday, didn't half like
the question.</p>
<p>Not long ago I was dining with one of the City Companies.
On my right was another guest&#8212;a member of the
<a name="Page_286"></a>Worshipful Company of Butchers. We had a long
and
genial conversation on topics relevant to Smithfield, when,
in the midst of it, I was suddenly called on to return thanks
for the visitors. The chairman, in proposing the toast, was
good enough to speak of my belongings and myself in
flattering terms, to which I hope that I suitably responded.
When I resumed my seat my butcher friend exclaimed,
with the most obvious sincerity, "I declare, sir, I'm quite
ashamed of myself. To think that I have been sitting
alongside of a gentleman all the evening, and never found
it out!"</p>
<p>The doorkeepers and attendants at the House of Commons
are all old servants, who generally have lived in great families,
and have obtained their places through influential recommendations.
One of these fine old men encountered, on
the opening day of a new Parliament, a young sprig of a
great family who had just been for the first time elected
to the House of Commons, and thus accosted him, with
tears in his eyes: "I am glad indeed, sir, to see you here;
and when I think that I helped to put your noble grandfather
and grandmother both into their coffins, it makes me
feel quite at home with you." Never, surely, was a political
career more impressively auspicated.</p>
<p>These Verbal Infelicities are by no means confined to
social intercourse. Lord Cross, when the House laughed
at his memorable speech in favour of Spiritual Peers, exclaimed
in solemn remonstrance, "I hear a smile." When
the Bishop of Southwell, preaching in the London Mission
of 1885, began his sermon by saying, "I feel a feeling which
I feel you all feel," it is only fair to assume that he said
something which he would rather have expressed differently.
Quite lately I heard an Irish rhetorician exclaim, "If the
Liberal Party is to maintain its position, it must move
forward." A clerical orator, fresh from a signal triumph
at a Diocesan Conference, informed me, together with some
<a name="Page_287"></a>hundreds of other hearers, that when his
resolution was put
"quite a shower of hands went up;" and at a missionary
meeting I once heard that impressive personage, "the
Deputation from the Parent Society," involve himself very
delightfully in extemporaneous imagery. He had been explaining
that here in England we hear so much of the rival
systems and operations of the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel and the Church Missionary Society that we
are often led to regard them as hostile institutions; whereas
if, as he himself had done, his hearers would go out to the
mission-field and observe the working of the societies at
close quarters, they would find them to be in essential unison.
"Even so," he exclaimed; "as I walked in the beautiful
park which adjoins your town to-day, I noticed what appeared
at a distance to be one gigantic tree. It was only
when I got close to it and sat down under its branches
that I perceived that what I had thought was one tree was
really two trees&#8212;as completely distinct in origin, growth,
and nature as if they had stood a hundred miles apart."
No one in the audience (besides myself) noticed the infelicity
of the illustration; nor do I think that the worthy
"Deputation," if he had perceived it, would have had the
presence of mind to act as a famous preacher did in like
circumstances, and, throwing up his hands, exclaim, "Oh,
blessed contrast!"</p>
<p>But it does not always require verbal infelicity to produce
a "Thing one would rather have expressed differently."
The mere misplacement of a comma will do it. A distinguished
graduate of Oxford determined to enter the
Nonconformist ministry, and, quite unnecessarily, published
a manifesto setting forth his reasons and his intentions. In
his enumeration of the various methods by which he was
going to mark his aloofness from the sacerdotalism of the
Established Church, he wrote; "I shall wear no clothes,
to distinguish me from my fellow-Christians." Need I say
<a name="Page_288"></a>that all the picture-shops of the University
promptly displayed
a fancy portrait of the newly fledged minister clad
in what Artemus Ward called "the scandalous style of the
Greek slave," and bearing the unkind inscription&#8212;"The
Rev. X.Y.Z. distinguishing himself from his fellow-Christians"?
If a comma too much brought ruin into Mr. Z.'s
allocution, a comma too little was the undoing of a well-remembered
advertisement. "A PIANO for sale by a lady
about to leave England in an oak case with carved legs."</p>
<p>An imperfect sympathy with the prepossessions of one's
environment may often lead the unwary talker to give a
totally erroneous impression of his meaning. Thus the
Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford once brought an Indian
army chaplain to dine at the high table of Oriel, and in the
common room after dinner the Fellows courteously turned
the conversation to the subject of life and work in India, on
which the chaplain held forth with fluency and zest. When
he had made an end of speaking, the Professor of Anglo-Saxon,
who was not only a very learned scholar but also a
very devout clergyman, leaned forward and said, "I am a
little hard of hearing, sir, but from what I could gather I
rejoice to infer that you consider the position of an army
chaplain in India a hopeful field." "Hopeful field indeed,"
replied the chaplain; "I should rather think so! You
begin at &pound;400 a year."</p>
<p>A too transparent honesty which reveals each transient
emotion through the medium of suddenly chosen words is
not without its perils. None that heard it could ever forget
Norman Macleod's story of the Presbyterian minister
who, when he noticed champagne-glasses on the dinner-table,
began his grace, "Bountiful Jehovah!" but, when he
saw only claret-glasses, subsided into, "We are not worthy
of the least of Thy mercies." I deny the right of Bishop
Wilberforce in narrating this story in his diary to stigmatize
this good man as "gluttonous." He was simply honest,
<a name="Page_289"></a>and his honesty led him into one of those
"Things one would
rather have expressed differently." But, however expressed,
the meaning would have been the same, and equally sound.</p>
<p>Absence of mind, of course, conversationally slays its
thousands, though perhaps more by the way of "Things
one would rather have left unsaid" than by "Things one
would rather have expressed differently." The late Archbishop
Trench, a man of singularly vague and dreamy habits,
resigned the See of Dublin on account of advancing years,
and settled in London. He once went back to pay a visit
to his successor, Lord Plunket. Finding himself back again
in his old palace, sitting at his old dinner-table, and gazing
across it at his old wife, he lapsed in memory to the days
when he was master of the house, and gently remarked to
Mrs. Trench, "I am afraid, my love, that we must put this
cook down among our failures." Delight of Lord and Lady
Plunket!</p>
<p>Medical men are sometimes led by carelessness of phrase
into giving their patients shocks. The country doctor who,
combining in his morning's round a visit to the Squire and
another to the Vicar, said that he was trying to kill two
birds with one stone, would probably have expressed himself
differently if he had premeditated his remark; and a London
physician who found his patient busy composing a book of
Recollections, and asked, "Why have you put it off so
long?" uttered a "Thing one would rather have left unsaid."
The "donniest" of Oxford dons in an unexampled
fit of good nature once undertook to discharge the duties
of the chaplain of Oxford Jail during the Long Vacation.
Unluckily it so fell out that he had to perform the terrible
office of preparing a criminal for execution, and it was felt
that he said a "Thing one would rather have expressed
differently," when, at the close of his final interview, he left
the condemned cell, observing, "Well, at eight o'clock to-morrow
morning, then."</p>
<p><a name="Page_290"></a>The path of those who inhabit Courts is
thickly beset
with pitfalls. There are so many things that must be left
unsaid, and so many more that must be expressed differently.
Who does not know the "Copper Horse" at
Windsor&#8212;that equestrian statue at the end of the Long
Walk to which (and back again) the local flyman always
offers to drive the tourist? Queen Victoria was entertaining
a great man, who, in the afternoon, walked from the
Castle to Cumberland Lodge. At dinner her Majesty, full,
as always, of gracious solicitude for the comfort of her guests,
said, "I hope you were not tired by your long walk?"
"Oh, not at all, thank you, ma'am. I got a lift back as far
as the Copper Horse." "As far as what?" inquired her
Majesty, in palpable astonishment. "Oh, the Copper
Horse, at the end of the Long Walk!" "That's not a
copper horse. That's my grandfather!"</p>
<p>A little learning is proverbially dangerous, and often lures
vague people into unsuspected perils. One of the most
charming ladies of my acquaintance, remonstrating with her
mother for letting the fire go out on a rather chilly day,
exclaimed, "O dear mamma, how could you be so careless?
If you had been a Vestal Virgin you would have been
bricked up." When the London County Council first came
into existence, it used to assemble in the Guildhall, and the
following dialogue took place between a highly cultured
councillor and one of his commercial colleagues.</p>
<p><i>Cultured Councillor</i>. "The acoustics of this place seem
very bad."</p>
<p><i>Commercial Councillor (sniffing)</i>. "Indeed, sir? I haven't
perceived anything unpleasant."</p>
<p>A well-known lady had lived for some years in a house in
Harley Street which contained some fine ornamentation by
Angelica Kauffmann, and, on moving to another quarter of
the town, she loudly lamented the loss of her former drawing-room,
"for it was so beautifully painted by Fra Angelico."</p>
<p><a name="Page_291"></a>Mistakes of idiom are the prolific parents of
error, or, as
Mrs. Lirriper said, with an admirable confusion of metaphors,
breed fruitful hot water for all parties concerned. "The
wines of this hotel leave one nothing to hope for," was the
alluring advertisement of a Swiss innkeeper who thought
that his vintages left nothing to be desired. Lady Dufferin,
in her Reminiscences of Viceregal Life, has some excellent
instances of the same sort. "Your Enormity" is a delightful
variant on "Your Excellency;" and there is something
really pathetic in the Baboo's benediction, "You have been
very good to us, and may Almighty God give you tit for
tat." But to deride these errors of idiom scarcely lies in
the mouth of an Englishman. A friend of mine, wishing to
express his opinion that a Frenchman was an idiot, told
him that he was a "cretonne." Lord R----, preaching at
the French Exhibition, implored his hearers to come and
drink of the "eau de vie;" and a good-natured Cockney,
complaining of the incivility of French drivers, said, "It is
so uncalled for, because I always try to make things pleasant
by beginning with 'Bon jour, Cochon.'" Even in our own
tongue Englishmen sometimes come to grief over an idiomatic
proverb. In a debate in Convocation at Oxford, Dr.
Liddon, referring to a concession made by the opposite side,
said, "It is proverbially ungracious to look a gift horse <i>in the
face.</i>" And, though the undergraduates in the gallery roared
"Mouth, sir; mouth!" till they were hoarse, the Angelic
Doctor never perceived the unmeaningness of his proverb.</p>
<p>Some years ago a complaint of inefficiency was preferred
against a workhouse-chaplain, and, when the Board of
Guardians came to consider the case, one of the Guardians,
defending the chaplain, observed that "Mr. P---- was only
fifty-two, and had a mother running about." Commenting
on this line of defence, a newspaper, which took the view
hostile to the chaplain, caustically remarked:&#8212;"On this
principle, the more athletic or restless were a clergyman's
<a name="Page_292"></a>relatives, the more valuable an acquisition
would he himself
be to the Church. Supposing that some Embertide a bishop
were fortunate enough to secure among his candidates for
ordination a man who, in addition to 'a mother running
about,' had a brother who gained prizes at Lillie Bridge,
and a cousin who pulled in the 'Varsity Eight, and a nephew
who was in the School Eleven, to say nothing of a grandmother
who had St. Vitus's Dance, and an aunt in the
country whose mind wandered, then surely Dr. Liddon himself
would have to look out for his laurels."</p>
<p>The "Things one would rather have expressed differently"
for which reporters are responsible are of course legion.
I forbear to enlarge on such familiar instances as "the
shattered libertine of debate," applied to Mr. Bernal
Osborne, and "the roaring loom of the <i>Times</i>" when Mr.
Lowell had spoken of the "roaring loom of time." I content
myself with two which occurred in my own immediate
circle. A clerical uncle of mine took the Pledge in his old
age, and at a public meeting stated that his reason for so
doing was that for thirty years he had been trying to cure
drunkards by making them drink in moderation, but had
never once succeeded. He was thus reported:&#8212;"The rev.
gentleman stated that his reason for taking the Pledge was
that for thirty years he had been trying to drink in moderation,
but had never once succeeded." Another near
relation of mine, protesting on a public platform against
some misrepresentation by opponents, said:&#8212;"The worst
enemy that any cause can have to fight is a double lie in the
shape of half a truth." The newspaper which reported the
proceedings gave the sentiment thus:&#8212;"The worst enemy
that any cause can have to fight is a double eye in the shape
of half a tooth." And, when an indignant remonstrance
was addressed to the editor, he blandly said that he certainly
had not understood the phrase, but imagined it must
be "a quotation from an old writer."</p>
<p><a name="Page_293"></a>But if journalistic reporting, on which some
care and
thought are bestowed, sometimes proves misleading, common
rumour is far more prolific of things which would have been
better expressed differently. It is now (thank goodness!)
a good many years since "spelling-bees" were a favourite
amusement in London drawing-rooms. The late Lady
Combermere, an octogenarian dame who retained a sempiternal
taste for <i>les petits jeux innocents</i> kindly invited a young
curate whom she had been asked to befriend to take part in
a "spelling-bee." He got on splendidly for a while, and then
broke down among the repeated "n's" in "drunkenness."
Returning crestfallen to his suburban parish, he was soon
gratified by hearing the rumour that he had been turned out
of a lady's house at the West End for drunkenness.</p>
<p>Shy people are constantly getting into conversational
scrapes, their tongues carrying them whither they know not,
like the shy young man who was arguing with a charming
and intellectual young lady.</p>
<p><i>Charming Young Lady.</i> "The worst of me is that I am
so apt to be run away with by an inference."</p>
<p><i>Shy Young Man.</i> "Oh, how I wish I was an inference!"</p>
<p>When the late Dr. Woodford became Bishop of Ely, a
rumour went before him in the diocese that he was a
misogynist. He was staying, on his first round of Confirmations,
at a country house, attended by an astonishingly
mild young chaplain, very like the hero of <i>The Private
Secretary</i>. In the evening the lady of the house said archly
to this youthful Levite, "I hope you can contradict the story
which we have heard about our new bishop, that he hates
ladies." The chaplain, in much confusion, hastily replied,
"Oh, that is quite an exaggeration; but I do think his
Lordship feels safer with the married ladies."</p>
<p>Let me conclude with a personal reminiscence of a
"Thing one would rather have left unsaid." A remarkably
pompous clergyman who was an Inspector of Schools
<a name="Page_294"></a>showed me a theme on a Scriptural subject,
written by a
girl who was trying to pass from being a pupil-teacher to a
schoolmistress. The theme was full of absurd mistakes,
over which the inspector snorted stertorously. "Well, what
do you think of that?" he inquired, when I handed back
the paper. "Oh," said I, in perfectly good faith, "the
mistakes are bad enough, but the writing is far worse. It
really is a disgrace." "Oh, <i>my</i> writing!" said the inspector;
"I copied the theme out." Even after the lapse of twenty
years I turn hot all over when I recall the sensations of that
moment.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_295"></a>XXX.</h2>
<h2>THE ART OF PUTTING THINGS.</h2>
<p>It was "A.K.H.B.," if I recollect aright, who wrote
a popular essay on "The Art of Putting Things." As
I know nothing of the essay beyond its title, and am not
quite certain about that, I shall not be guilty of intentional
plagiarism if I attempt to discuss the same subject. It is
not identical with the theme which I have just handled, for
"Things one would rather have expressed differently" are
essentially things which one might have expressed better.
If one is not conscious of this at the moment, a good-natured
friend is always at hand to point it out, and the poignancy
of one's regret creates the zest of the situation. For example,
when a German financier, contesting an English borough,
drove over an old woman on the polling-day, and affectionately
pressed five shillings into her hand, saying, "Never
mind, my tear, here's something to get drunk with," his
agent instantly pointed out that she wore the Blue Ribbon,
and that her husband was an influential class-leader among
the Wesleyans.</p>
<p>But "The Art of Putting Things" includes also the things
which one might have expressed worse, and covers the cases
where a dexterous choice of words seems, at any rate to the
speaker, to have extricated him from a conversational quandary.
As an instance of this perilous art carried to high
perfection, may be cited Abraham Lincoln's judgment on an
unreadably sentimental book&#8212;"People who like this sort of
<a name="Page_296"></a>thing will find this the sort of thing they
like"&#8212;humbly
imitated by two eminent men on this side of the Atlantic,
one of whom is in the habit of writing to struggling
authors&#8212;"Thank you for sending me your book, which I shall lose
no time in reading;" while the other prefers the less truthful
but perhaps more flattering formula&#8212;"I have read your blank
verse, <i>and much like it</i>"</p>
<p>The late Mr. Walter Pater was once invited to admire a
hideous wedding-present, compact of ormolu and malachite.
Closing his eyes, the founder of modern aesthetics leaned
back in his chair, and waving away the offending object,
murmured in his softest tone, "Oh, very rich, very handsome,
very expensive, I am sure. But they mustn't make
any more of them."</p>
<p>Dexterities of phrase sometimes recoil with dire effect
upon their author. A very popular clergyman of my acquaintance
prides himself on never forgetting an inhabitant
of his parish. He was stopped one day in the street by an
aggrieved parishioner whom, to use a homely phrase, he did
not know from Adam. Ready in resource, he produced his
pocket-book, and, hastily jotting down a memorandum of
the parishioner's grievance, he said, with an insinuating
smile, "It is so stupid of me, but I always forget how to
spell your name." "J&#8212;O&#8212;N&#8212;E&#8212;S," was the gruff response;
and the shepherd and the sheep went their several
ways in mutual disgust. Perhaps the worst recorded attempt
at an escape from a conversational difficulty was made by an
East-end curate who specially cultivated the friendship of
the artisans. One day a carpenter arrived in his room, and,
producing a photograph, said, "I've brought you my boy's
likeness, as you said you'd like to have it."</p>
<p><i>Curate</i> (rapturously). "How awfully good of you to remember!
What a capital likeness! Where is he?"</p>
<p><i>Carpenter</i>. "Why, sir, don't you remember? He's
dead."</p>
<p><a name="Page_297"></a><i>Curate.</i> "Oh yes, of course, I know
that. I mean,
where's the man that took the photograph?"</p>
<p>The art of disguising an unpleasant truth with a graceful
phrase was well illustrated in the case of a friend of mine,
not remarkable for physical courage, of whom a tactful
phrenologist pronounced that he was "full of precaution
against real or imaginary danger." It is not every one who
can tell a man he is an arrant coward without offending him.
The same art, as applied by a man to his own shortcomings,
is exemplified in the story of the ecclesiastical dignitary who
gloried in his Presence of Mind. According to Dean Stanley,
who knew him well, he used to narrate the incident in the
following terms:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"A friend invited me to go out with him on the water.
The sky was threatening, and I declined. At length he
succeeded in persuading me, and we embarked. A squall
came on, the boat lurched, and my friend fell overboard.
Twice he sank; and twice he rose to the surface. He placed
his hands on the prow and endeavoured to climb in.
There was great apprehension lest he should upset the boat.
Providentially, I had brought my umbrella with me, I had
the <i>presence of mind</i> to strike him two or three hard blows
over the knuckles. He let go his hold and sank. The boat
righted itself, and we were saved."</blockquote>
<p>The art of avoiding conversational unpleasantness by a
graceful way of putting things belongs, I suppose, in its
highest perfection, to the East. When Lord Dufferin was
Viceroy of India, he had a "shikarry," or sporting servant,
whose special duty was to attend the visitors at the Viceregal
Court on their shooting excursions. Returning one
day from one of these expeditions, the shikarry encountered
the Viceroy, who, full of courteous solicitude for his guests'
enjoyment, asked: "Well, what sort of sport has Lord ----
had?" "Oh," replied the scrupulously polite Indian, "the
young Sahib shot divinely, but God was very merciful to the
<a name="Page_298"></a>birds." Compare this honeyed speech with the
terms in
which an English gamekeeper would convey his opinion of a
bad shot, and we are forced to admit the social superiority
of Lord Salisbury's "black man."</p>
<p>If we turn from the Orient to the Occident, and from our
dependencies to the United Kingdom, the Art of Putting
Things is found to flourish better on Irish than on Scotch
or English soil. We all remember that Archbishop Whately
is said to have thanked God on his deathbed that he had
never given a penny in indiscriminate charity. Perhaps
one might find more suitable subjects of moribund self-congratulation;
and I have always rejoiced in the mental
picture of the Archbishop, in all the frigid pomp of Political
Economy, waving off the Dublin beggar with "Go away,
go away; I never give to any one in the street," and receiving
the instantaneous rejoinder, "Then where would your
reverence have me wait on you?" A lady of my acquaintance,
who is a proprietress in County Galway, is in the habit
of receiving her own rents. One day, when a tenant-farmer
had pleaded long and unsuccessfully for an abatement, he
exclaimed as he handed over his money, "Well, my lady, all
I can say is that if I had my time over again it's not a
tenant-farmer I'd be. I'd follow one of the learn'd professions."
The proprietress gently replied that even in the
learned professions there were losses as well as gains, and
perhaps he would have found professional life as precarious
as farming. "Ah, my lady, how can that be then?"
replied the son of St. Patrick. "If you're a lawyer&#8212;win
or lose, you're paid. If you're a doctor&#8212;kill or cure,
you're paid. If you're a priest&#8212;heaven or hell, you're
paid." Who can imagine an English farmer pleading the
case for an abatement with this happy mixture of fun and
satire?</p>
<p>"Urbane" is a word which etymologically bears witness
that the ancient world believed the arts of courtesy to be the
<a name="Page_299"></a>products of the town rather than of the country.
Something
of the same distinction may occasionally be traced even in
the civilization of modern England. The house-surgeon of
a London hospital was attending to the injuries of a poor
woman whose arm had been severely bitten. As he was
dressing the wound he said, "I cannot make out what sort
of animal bit you. This is too small for a horse's bite, and
too large for a dog's." "O sir," replied the patient, "it
wasn't an animal; it was <i>another lydy.</i>" Surely the force of
Urbanity could no further go. On the other hand, it was a
country clergyman who, in view of the approaching Confirmation,
announced that on the morning of the ceremony
the young <i>ladies</i> would assemble at the Vicarage and the
young <i>women</i> at the National School.</p>
<p>"Let us distinguish," said the philosopher, and certainly
the arbitrary use of the term "lady" and "gentleman"
suggests some curious studies in the Art of Putting Things.
A good woman who let furnished apartments in a country
town, describing a lodger who had apparently "known better
days," said, "I am positive she was a real born lady, for she
hadn't the least idea how to do hanything for herself; it took
her hours to peel her potatoes." Carlyle has illustrated from
the annals of our criminal jurisprudence the truly British
conception of "a very respectable man" as one who keeps a
gig; and similarly, I recollect that in the famous trial of Kurr
and Benson, the turf-swindlers, twenty years ago, a witness
testified, with reference to one of the prisoners, that he had
always considered him a "perfect gentleman;" and, being
pressed by counsel to give his reasons for this view, said,
"He had rooms at the Langham Hotel, and dined with the
Lord Mayor."</p>
<p>On the other hand, it would seem that in certain circles
and contingencies the "grand old name of Gentleman" is
regarded as a term of opprobrium. The late Lord Wriothesley
Russell, who was for many years a Canon of Windsor,
<a name="Page_300"></a>used to conduct a mission service for the
Household troops
quartered there; and one of his converts, a stalwart trooper
of the Blues, expressing his gratitude for these voluntary
ministrations, and contrasting them with the officer-like and
disciplinary methods of the army chaplains, genially exclaimed,
"But I always say there's not a bit of the gentleman
about you, my lord." When Dr. Harold Browne
became Bishop of Ely, he asked the head verger some
questions as to where his predecessor had been accustomed
to sit in the Cathedral, what part he had taken in the
services, and so on. The verger proved quite unable to
supply the required information, and said in self-excuse,
"Well, you see, my lord, his late lordship wasn't at all a
church-going gentleman;" which, being interpreted, meant
that, on account of age and infirmities, Bishop Turton had
long confined his ministrations to his private chapel.</p>
<p>Just after a change of Government not many years ago,
an officer of the Royal Household was chatting with one of
the Queen's old coachmen (whose name and location I, for
obvious reasons, forbear to indicate). "Well, Whipcord,
have you seen your new Master of the Horse yet?" "Yes,
sir, I have; and I should say that his lordship is more of an
indoors man." The phrase has a touch of genial contempt
for a long-descended but effete aristocracy which tickles the
democratic palate. It was not old Whipcord, but a brother
in the craft, who, when asked, during the Jubilee of 1887, if
he was driving any of the Imperial and Royal guests then
quartered at Buckingham Palace, replied, with calm self-respect,
"No, sir; I am the Queen's Coachman. I don't
drive the riff-raff." I take this to be a sublime instance of the
Art of Putting Things. Lingering for a moment on these
back stairs of History, let me tell the tragic tale of Mr. and
Mrs. M----. Mr. M---- was one of the merchant princes
of London, and Mrs. M---- had occasion to engage a new
housekeeper for their palace in Park Lane. The outgoing
<a name="Page_301"></a>official wrote to her incoming successor a
detailed account of
the house and its inmates. The butler was a very pleasant
man. The <i>chef</i> was inclined to tipple. The lady's-maid
gave herself airs; and the head housemaid was a very well
principled young woman&#8212;and so on and so forth. After
the signature, huddled away in a casual postscript, came the
damning sentence, "As for Mr. and Mrs. M----, they
behave as well as they know how." Was it by inadvertence,
or from a desire to let people know their proper place,
that the recipient of this letter allowed its contents to find
their way to the children of the family?</p>
<p>As incidentally indicated above, a free recourse to alcoholic
stimulus used to be, in less temperate days, closely
associated with the culinary art; and one of the best cooks
I ever knew was urged by her mistress to attend a great
meeting for the propagation of the Blue Ribbon, to be held
not a hundred miles from Southampton, and addressed by a
famous preacher of total abstinence. The meeting was enthusiastic,
and the Blue Ribbon was freely distributed. Next
morning the lady anxiously asked her cook what effect the
oratory had produced on her, and she replied, with the evident
sense of narrow escape from imminent danger, "Well,
my lady, if Mr. ---- had gone on for five minutes more, I
believe I should have taken the Ribbon too; but, thank
goodness! he stopped in time."</p>
<p>So far, I find, I have chiefly dealt with the Art of Putting
Things as practised by the "urbane" or town-bred classes.
Let me give a few instances of "pagan" or countrified use.
A village blacksmith was describing to me with unaffected
pathos the sudden death of his very aged father; "and," he
added, "the worst part of it was that I had to go and break it
to my poor old mother." Genuinely entering into my friend's
grief, I said, "Yes; that must have been terrible. How did
you break it?" "Well, I went into her cottage and I said.
'Dad's dead.' She said, 'What?' and I said, 'Dad's dead,
<a name="Page_302"></a>and you may as well know it first as last.'"
Breaking
it! Truly a curious instance of the rural Art of Putting
Things.</p>
<p>A labourer in Buckinghamshire, being asked how the
rector of the village was, replied, "Well, he's getting wonderful
old; but they do tell me that his understanding's
no worse than it always was"&#8212;a pagan synonym for the
hackneyed phrase that one is in full possession of one's
faculties. This entire avoidance of flattering circumlocutions,
though it sometimes produces these rather startling
effects, gives a peculiar raciness to rustic oratory. Not long
ago a member for a rural constituency, who had always professed
the most democratic sentiments, suddenly astonished
his constituents by taking a peerage. During the election
caused by his transmigration, one of his former supporters
said at a public meeting, "Mr. ---- says as how he's going
to the House of Lords to leaven it. I tell you, you can't
no more leaven the House of Lords by putting Mr. ----
into it than you can sweeten a cart-load of muck with a pot
of marmalade." During the General Election of 1892 I
heard an old labourer on a village green denouncing the
evils of an Established Church. "I'll tell you how it is
with one of these 'ere State parsons. If you take away his
book, he can't preach; and if you take away his gownd,
he mustn't preach; and if you take away his screw, he'll
be d----d if he'll preach." The humour which underlies
the roughness of countrified speech is often not only
genuine but subtle. I have heard a story of a young
labourer who, on his way to his day's work, called at the
registrar's office to register his father's death. When the
official asked the date of the event, the son replied, "He
ain't dead yet, but he'll be dead before night, so I thought
it would save me another journey if you would put it down
now." "Oh, that won't do at all," said the registrar,
"perhaps your father will live till to-morrow." "Well, I
<a name="Page_303"></a>don't know, sir; the doctor says as he won't,
and he knows
what he has given him."</p>
<p>The accomplished authoress of <i>Country Conversations</i>
has put on record some delightful specimens of rural
dialogue, culled chiefly from the labouring classes of
Cheshire. And, rising in the social scale from the labourer
to the farmer, what could be more lifelike than this tale
of an ill-starred wooing? "My son Tom has met with a
disappointment about getting married. You know he's got
that nice farm at H----; so he met a young lady at a dance,
and he was very much took up, and she seemed quite agreeable.
So, as he heard she had Five Hundred, he wrote next
day to pursue the acquaintance, and her father wrote and
asked Tom to come over to S----. Eh, dear! Poor fellow!
He went off in such sperrits, and he looked so spruce
in his best clothes, with a new tie and all. So next day,
when I heard him come to the gate, I ran out as pleased
as could be; but I see in a moment he was sadly cast
down. 'Why, Tom, my lad,' says I, 'what is it?' 'Why,
mother,' says he, 'she'd understood mine was a harable;
<i>and she will not marry to a dairy</i>.'"</p>
<p>From Cheshire to East Anglia is a far cry, but let me
give one more lesson in the Art of Putting Things, derived
from that delightful writer Dr. Jessopp. In one of his
studies of rural life the Doctor tells, in his own inimitable
style, a story of which the moral is the necessity of using
plain words when you are preaching to the poor. The story
runs that in the parish where he served his first curacy there
was an old farmer on whom had fallen all the troubles of
Job&#8212;loss of stock, loss of capital, eviction from his holding,
the death of his wife, and the failure of his own health.
The well-meaning young curate, though full of compassion,
could find no more novel topic of consolation than to say
that all these trials were the dispensations of Providence.
On this the poor old victim brightened up and said with
<a name="Page_304"></a>a cheerful smile, "Ah yes, sir; I know that
right enough.
That old Providence has been against me all along; but
I reckon <i>there's One above</i> that will put a stopper on him
if he goes too far." Evidently, as Dr. Jessopp observes,
"Providence" was to the good old man a learned synonym
for the devil.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_305"></a>XXXI.</h2>
<h2>CHILDREN.</h2>
<p>The humours of childhood include in rich abundance
both Things which would have been better left
unsaid, and Things which might have been expressed
differently. But just now they lack their sacred bard.
There is no one to observe and chronicle them. It is a
pity, for the "heart that watches and receives" will often
find in the pleasantries of childhood a good deal that
deserves perpetuation.</p>
<p>The children of fiction are a mixed company, some lifelike
and some eminently the reverse. In <i>Joan</i> Miss Rhoda
Broughton drew with unequalled skill a family of odious
children. Henry Kingsley look a more genial view of his
subject, and sketched some pleasant children in <i>Austin
Elliot</i>, and some delightful ones in the last chapter of
<i>Ravenshoe</i>. The "Last of the Neros" in <i>Barchester Towers</i>
is admirably drawn, and all elderly bachelors must have
sympathized with good Mr. Thorne when, by way of making
himself agreeable to the mother, Signora Vesey-Neroni, he
took the child upon his knee, jumped her up and down,
saying, "Diddle, diddle, diddle," and was rewarded with, "I
don't want to be diddle-diddle-diddled. Let me go, you
naughty old man." Dickens's children are by common
consent intolerable, but a quarter of a century ago we
were all thrilled by Miss Montgomery's <i>Misunderstood</i>. It
is credibly reported that an earlier and more susceptible
<a name="Page_306"></a>generation was moved to tears by the sinfulness
of Topsy
and the saintliness of Eva; and the adventures of the <i>Fairchild
Family</i> enjoy a deserved popularity among all lovers of
unintentional humour. But the "sacred bard" of child-life
was John Leech, whose twofold skill immortalized it with
pen and with pencil. The childish incidents and sayings
which Leech illustrated were, I believe, always taken from
real life. His sisters "kept an establishment," as Mr.
Dombey said&#8212;the very duplicate of that to which little
Paul was sent. "'It is not a Preparatory School by any
means. Should I express my meaning,' said Miss Tox with
peculiar sweetness, 'if I designated it an infantine boarding-house
of a very select description?'"</p>
<p>"'On an exceedingly limited and particular scale,' suggested
Mrs. Chick, with a glance at her brother."</p>
<p>"'Oh! exclusion itself,' said Miss Tox."</p>
<p>The analogy may be even more closely pressed, for, as at
Mrs. Pipchin's so at Miss Leech's, "juvenile nobility itself
was no stranger to the establishment." Miss Tox told Mr.
Dombey that "the humble individual who now addressed
him was once under Mrs. Pipchin's charge;" and, similarly,
the obscure writer of these papers was once under Miss
Leech's. Her school supplied the originals of all the little
boys, whether greedy or gracious, grave or gay, on foot or
on pony-back, in knickerbockers or in nightshirts, who figure
so frequently in <i>Punch</i> between 1850 and 1864; and one of
the pleasantest recollections of those distant days is the
kindness with which the great artist used to receive us when,
as the supreme reward of exceptionally good conduct, we
were taken to see him in his studio at Kensington. It is my
rule not to quote at length from what is readily accessible,
and therefore I cull only one delightful episode from Leech's
<i>Sketches of Life and Character</i>. Two little chaps are discussing
the age of a third; and the one reflectively remarks,
"Well, I don't 'zactly know how old Charlie is; but he must
<a name="Page_307"></a>be very old, for he blows his own nose." Happy
and far
distant days, when such an accomplishment seemed to be
characteristic of a remotely future age! "Mamma,"
inquired an infant aristocrat of a superlatively refined mother,
"when shall I be old enough to eat bread and cheese with a
knife, and put the knife in my mouth?" But the answer is
not recorded.</p>
<p>The vagueness of the young with respect to the age of
their elders is pleasingly illustrated by the early history of a
nobleman who recently represented a division of Manchester
in Parliament. His mother had a maid, who seemed to
childish eyes extremely old. The children of the family
longed to know her age, but were much too well-bred to
ask a question which they felt would be painful; so they
sought to attain the desired end by a system of ingenious
traps. The future Member for Manchester chanced in a
lucky hour to find in his "Book of Useful Knowledge" the
tradition that the aloe flowers only once in a hundred years.
He instantly saw his opportunity, and accosting the maid
with winning air and wheedling accent, asked insinuatingly,
"Dunn, have you often seen the aloe flower?"</p>
<p>The <i>Enfant Terrible</i>, though his name is imported from
France, is an indigenous growth of English soil. A young
husband and wife of my acquaintance were conversing in the
comfortable belief that "Tommy didn't understand," when
Tommy looked up from his toys, and said reprovingly,
"Mamma, oughtn't you to have said that in French?"</p>
<p>The late Lord ----, who had a deformed foot, was going
to visit Queen Victoria at Osborne, and before his arrival the
Queen and Prince Albert debated whether it would be better
to warn the Prince of Wales and the Princess Royal of his
physical peculiarity, so as to avoid embarrassing remarks, or
to leave it to their own good feeling. The latter course was
adopted. Lord ---- duly arrived. The foot elicited no
remarks from the Royal children, and the visit passed off
<a name="Page_308"></a>anxiously but with success. Next day the
Princess Royal
asked the Queen, "Where is Lord ----?" "He has gone
back to London, dear." "Oh! what a pity! He had promised
to show Bertie and me his foot!" They had caught
him in the corridor and made their own terms with their
captive.</p>
<p>In more recent years the little daughter of one of the
Queen's most confidential advisers had the unexampled
honour of being invited to luncheon with her Majesty.
During the meal, an Illustrious Lady, negotiating a pigeon
after the German fashion, took up one of its bones with her
finger and thumb. The little visitor, whose sense of British
propriety was stronger than her awe of Courts, regarded the
proceeding with wonder-dilated eyes, and then burst out,
"Oh, Piggy-wiggy, Piggy-wiggy! You <i>are</i> Piggy-wiggy."
Probably she is now languishing in the dungeon keep of
Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>If the essence of the <i>Enfant Terrible</i> is that he or she
causes profound embarrassment to the surrounding adults,
the palm of pre-eminence must be assigned to the children
of a famous diplomatist, who, some twenty years ago, organized
a charade and performed it without assistance from
their elders. The scene displayed a Crusader knight returning
from the wars to his ancestral castle. At the castle gate
he was welcomed by his beautiful and rejoicing wife, to
whom, after tender salutations, he recounted his triumphs on
the tented field and the number of paynim whom he had
slain. "And I too, my lord," replied his wife, pointing with
conscious pride to a long roll of dolls of various sizes&#8212;
"and I too, my lord, have not been idle." <i>Tableau</i>
indeed!</p>
<p>The argumentative child is scarcely less trying than the
<i>Enfant Terrible</i>. Miss Sellon, the foundress of English
sisterhoods, adopted and brought up in her convent at
Devonport a little Irish waif who had been made an orphan
<a name="Page_309"></a>by the outbreak of cholera in 1849. The infant's
customs
and manners, especially at table, were a perpetual trial to a
community of refined old maids. "Chew your food, Aileen,"
said Miss Sellon. "If you please, mother, the whale didn't
chew Jonah," was the prompt reply of the little Romanist,
who had been taught that the examples of Holy Writ were
for our imitation. Answers made in examinations I forbear,
as a rule, to quote, but one I must give, because it so beautifully
illustrates the value of ecclesiastical observances in our
elementary schools:&#8212;</p>
<p><i>Vicar</i>. "Now, my dear, do you know what happened on
Ascension Day?"</p>
<p><i>Child</i>. "Yes, sir, please. We had buns and a swing."</p>
<p>Natural childhood should know nothing of social forms,
and the coachman's son who described his father's master as
"the man that rides in dad's carriage," showed a finely democratic
instinct. But the boastful child is a very unpleasant
product of nature or of art. "We've got a private master
comes to teach us at home, but we ain't proud, because Ma
says it's sinful," quoth Morleena Kenwigs, under her mother's
instructions, when Nicholas Nickleby gave her French lessons.
The infant daughter of a country clergyman, drinking tea in
the nursery of the episcopal Palace, boasted that at the
Vicarage they had a hen which laid an egg every day. "Oh,
that's nothing," retorted the bishop's daughter; "Papa lays
a foundation-stone every week."</p>
<p>The precocious child, even when thoroughly well-meaning,
is a source of terror by virtue of its intense earnestness. In
the days when Maurice first discredited the doctrine of
Eternal Punishment, some learned and theological people
were discussing, in a country house near Oxford, the abstract
credibility of endless pain. Suddenly the child of the house
(now its owner), who was playing on the hearth-rug, looked
up and said, "But how am I to know that it isn't hell already,
and that I am not in it?"&#8212;a question which threw a lurid
<a name="Page_310"></a>light on his educational and disciplinary
experiences. Some
of my readers will probably recollect the "Japanese Village"
at Knightsbridge&#8212;a pretty show of Oriental wares which was
burnt down, just at the height of its popularity, a few years
ago. On the day of its destruction I was at the house of a
famous financier, whose children had been to see the show
only two days before. One of them, an urchin of eight,
immensely interested by the news of the fire, asked, not if
the pretty things were burnt or the people hurt, but this one
question, "Mamma, was it insured?" Verily, <i>bon chat
chasse de race</i>. The children of an excellent but unfortunate
judge are said to have rushed one day into their mother's
drawing-room exclaiming, "Dear Mamma, may we have jam
for tea? One of Papa's judgments has been upheld in the
Court of Appeal." An admirable story of commercial precocity
reaches me from one of the many correspondents who
have been good enough to write to me in connection with
this book. It may be commended to the promoters of that
class of company which is specially affected by the widow,
the orphan, and the curate. Two small boys, walking down
Tottenham Court Road, passed a tobacconist's shop. The
bigger remarked, "I say, Bill, I've got a ha'penny, and, if
you've got one too, we'll have a penny smoke between us."
Bill produced his copper, and Tommy diving into the shop,
promptly reappeared with a penny cigar in his mouth. The
boys walked side by side for a few minutes, when the smaller
mildly said, "I say, Tom, when am I to have a puff? The
weed's half mine." "Oh, you shut up," was the business-like
reply. "I'm the Chairman of this Company, and you
are only a shareholder. <i>You can spit.</i>"</p>
<p>Mr. H.J. Barker, who is, I believe, what Mr. Squeers
called "A Educator of Youth," has lately given us some
pleasant echoes from the Board School. A young moralist
recorded his judgment, that it is not cruel to kill a turkey,
"if only you take it into the backyard and use a sharp knife,
<a name="Page_311"></a><i>and the turkey is yours!</i>" Another
dogmatized thus: "Don't
teese cats, for firstly, it is wrong so to do; and 2nd, cats
have clawses which is longer than people think." The following
theory of the Bank Holiday would scarcely commend
itself to that sound economist Sir John Lubbock:&#8212;"The
Banks shut up shop, so as people can't put their money in,
but has to spend it." So far the rude male: it required the
genius of feminine delicacy to define a Civil War as "one in
which the military are unnecessarily and punctiliously civil
or polite, often raising their helmets to each other before
engaging in deadly combat."</p>
<p>The joys of childhood are a theme on which a good deal
of verse has been expended. I am far from denying that
they are real, but I contend that they commonly take a form
which is quite inconsistent with poetry, and that the poet
(like heaven) "lies about us in our infancy." "I wish every
day in the year was a pot of jam," was the obviously sincere
exclamation of a fat little boy whom I knew, and whom Leech
would have delighted to draw. Two little London girls who
had been sent by the kindness of the vicar's wife to have "a
happy day in the country," narrating their experiences on
their return, said, "Oh yes, mum, we <i>did</i> 'ave a 'appy day.
We saw two pigs killed and a gentleman buried." And the
little boy who was asked if he thought he should like a hymn-book
for his birthday present replied that "he <i>thought</i> he
should like a hymn-book, but he <i>knew</i> he should like a
squirt." A small cousin of mine, hearing his big brothers
describe their experiences at a Public School, observed with
unction, "If ever I have a fag of my own, I will stick pins
into him." But now we are leaving childhood behind, and
attaining to the riper joys of full-blooded boyhood.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>"O running stream of sparkling joy</p>
<p>To be a soaring human boy!"</p>

<p>exclaimed Mr. Chadband in a moment of inspiration. "In
<a name="Page_312"></a>the strictest sense a boy," was Mr. Gladstone's
expressive
phrase in his controversy with Colonel Dopping. For my
own part, I confess to a frank dislike of boys. I dislike
them equally whether they are priggish boys, like Kenelm
Chillingly, who asked his mother if she was never overpowered
by a sense of her own identity; or sentimental
boys, like Dibbins in <i>Basil the Schoolboy</i>, who, discussing
with a friend how to spend a whole holiday, said, "Let us
go to Dingley Dell and talk about Byron;" or manly boys
like Tom Tulliver, of whom it is excellently said that he
was the kind of boy who is commonly spoken of as being
very fond of animals&#8212;that is, very fond of throwing stones
at them.</p>

<p>But before I do so let me tell one boy-story, connected
with the Eton and Harrow match, which has always struck
me as rather pleasing. In the year 1866, when F.C.
Cobden, who was afterwards so famous for his bowling in
the Cambridge Eleven, was playing for Harrow, an affable
father, by way of making conversation for a little Harrow
boy at Lord's, asked, "Is your Cobden any relation to
the great Cobden?" "Why, he <i>is</i> the great Cobden," was
the simple and swift reply. This is the true spirit of hero-worship.</p>

<h2>LETTER-WRITING.</h2>
<p>"Odd men write odd letters." This rather platitudinous
sentence, from an otherwise excellent essay
of the late Bishop Thorold's, is abundantly illustrated
alike by my Collections and by my Recollections.
I plunge at random into my subject, and immediately encounter
the following letter from a Protestant clergyman in
the north of Ireland, written in response to a suggestion
that he might with advantage study Mr. Gladstone's magnificent
speech on the Second Reading of the Affirmation Bill
in 1883:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"My dear Sir,&#8212;I have received your recommendation to
read carefully the speech of Mr. Gladstone in favour of
admitting the infidel Bradlaugh into Parliament, I did so
when it was delivered, and I must say that the strength of
argument rests with the opposition. I fully expect in the
event of a dissolution the Government will lose between
fifty and sixty seats. Any conclusion can be arrived at,
according to the premises laid down. Mr. G. avoided the
Scriptural lines and followed his own. All parties knew the
feeling of the country on the subject, and, notwithstanding
the bullying and majority of Gladstone, he was defeated.
Before the Irish Church was robbed, I was nominated to
the Deanery of Tuam, but Mr. Disraeli resigning, I was
defrauded of my just right by Mr. Gladstone, and my wife, <a
 name="Page_314"></a>Lady ----, the only surviving child of an
Earl,
was sadly
disappointed; but there is a just Judge above. The letter
of nomination is still in my possession. I am, dear sir,
yours faithfully, ----."</blockquote>
<p>It is highly characteristic of Mr. Gladstone that, when
this letter was shown to him by its recipient as a specimen
of epistolary oddity, he read it, not with a smile, but with
a portentous frown, and, handing it back, sternly asked,
"What does the fellow mean by quoting an engagement
entered into by my predecessor as binding on me?"</p>
<p>It is not only clergy "defrauded" of expected dignities
that write odd letters. Young curates in search of benefices
often seek to gratify their innocent ambitions by the most
ingenious appeals. Here is a letter received not many
years ago by the Prime Minister of the day:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"I have no doubt but that your time is fully occupied.
I will therefore compress as much as possible what I wish
to say, and frame my request in a few words. Some time
ago my mother wrote to her brother, Lord ----, asking him
to try and do something for me in the way of obtaining a
living. The reply from Lady ---- was that my uncle could
do nothing to help me. I naturally thought that a Premier
possessed of such a plenitude of power as yourself would
find it a matter of less difficulty to transform a curate into
a rector or vicar than to create a peer. My name is in the
Chancellor's List&#8212;a proceeding, as far as results, somewhat
suggestive, I fear, of the Greek Kalends.... My future
father-in-law is a member of the City Liberal Club, in which
a <i>large bust</i> of yourself was unveiled last year. I am 31
years of age; a High Churchman; musical, &amp;c.; graduate
of ----. If I had a living I could marry.... I am very
anxious to marry, but I am very poor, and a living would
help me very much. Being a Southerner, fond of music and
of books, I naturally would like to be somewhere near town.
I hope you will be able to help me in this respect, and thus <a
 name="Page_315"></a>afford much happiness to more than one." There
is great
force in that appeal to the "large bust."</blockquote>
<p>Here is a request which Bishop Thorold received from an
admirer, who unfortunately omitted to give his address:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Rev. and learned Sir,&#8212;Coming into your presence
through the medium of a letter, I do so in the spirit of
respect due to you as a gentleman and a scholar. I unfortunately
am a scholar, but a blackguard. I heard you preach
a few times, and thought you might pity the position I have
brought myself to. I should be grateful to you for an old
coat or an old pair of boots."</blockquote>
<p>And while the seekers after emolument write odd letters,
odd letters are also written by their admirers on their behalf.
A few years ago one of the principal benefices in West London
was vacated, and, the presentation lapsing to the Crown, the
Prime Minister received the following appeal:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Sir,&#8212;Doubtless you do not often get a letter from a
working man on the subject of clerical appointments, but as
I here you have got to find a minister for to fill Mr. Boyd
Carpenter's place, allow me to ask you to just go some
Sunday afternoon and here our little curate, Mr.----, at
St. Matthew's Church&#8212;he is a good, Earnest little man, and
a genuine little Fellow; got no humbug about him, but a
sound Churchman, is an Extempor Preacher, and deserves
promotion. Nobody knows I am writing to you, and it is
not a matter of kiss and go by favour, but simply asking you
to take a run over and here him, and then put him a stept
higher&#8212;he deserves it. I know Mr. Sullivan will give him a
good character, and so will Mr. Alcroft, the Patron. Now
do go over and here him before you make a choice. We
working men will be sorry to loose him, but we think he
ought not to be missed promotion, as he is a good
fellow.&#8212;Your obediently servant."</blockquote>
<p>Ladies, as might naturally be expected, are even more
enthusiastic in advocating the claims of their favourite
<a name="Page_316"></a>divines. Writing lately on the Agreeableness of
Clergymen,
I described some of the Canons of St. Paul's and Westminster,
and casually referred to the handsome presence of
Dr. Duckworth. I immediately received the following effusion,
which, wishing to oblige the writer, and having no
access to the <i>Church Family Newspaper</i>, I now make
public:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"A member of the Rev. Canon Duckworth's congregation
for <i>more than 25 years</i> has been much pained by the scant
and curious manner in which he is mentioned by you, and
begs to say that his Gospel teaching, his scholarly and yet
simple and charitable discourses (and teaching), his courteous
and sympathetic and prompt answers to his people's requests
and inquiries, his energetic and constant work in his parish,
are beyond praise. Added to all is his clear and sonorous
voice in his rendering of the prayer and praise amongst us.
A grateful parishioner hopes and <i>asks</i> for some further
recognition of his position in the Church of Christ, in the <i>Church
Family Newspaper</i>, June 12."</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;So far the Church.
I now turn to the world.</p>
<p>In the second volume of Lord Beaconsfield's <i>Endymion</i>
will be found a description, by a hand which was never excelled
at such business, of that grotesque revival of medievalism,
the Tournament at Eglinton Castle in 1839. But
the writer, conceding something to the requirements of art,
ignores the fact that the splendid pageant was spoilt by rain.
Two years' preparation and enormous expense were thrown
away. A grand cavalcade, in which Prince Louis Napoleon
rode as one of the knights, left Eglinton Castle on the 28th
of August at two in the afternoon, with heralds, banners,
pursuivants, the knight-marshal, the jester, the King of the
Tournament, the Queen of Beauty, and a glowing assemblage
of knights and ladies, seneschals, chamberlains, esquires,
pages, and men-at-arms, and took their way in procession to
the lists, which were overlooked by galleries in which nearly
<a name="Page_317"></a>two thousand spectators were accommodated; but
all the
while the rain came down in bucketfuls, never ceased while
the tourney proceeded, and brought the proceedings to a
premature and ignominious close. I only mention the occurrence
here because the Queen of Beauty, elected to that high
honour by unanimous acclamation, was Jane Sheridan, Lady
Seymour; and there is all the charm of vivid contrast in
turning from the reckless expenditure and fantastic brilliancy
of 1839 to the following correspondence, which was published
in the newspapers in the early part of 1840.</p>
<p>Anne, Lady Shuckburgh, was the wife of Sir Francis
Shuckburgh, a Northamptonshire Baronet, and to her the
Queen of Beauty, forsaking the triumphs of chivalry for
the duties of domestic economy, addressed the following
letter:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Lady Seymour presents her compliments to Lady Shuckburgh,
and would be obliged to her for the character of
Mary Stedman, who states that she lived twelve months, and
still is, in Lady Shuckburgh's establishment. Can Mary
Stedman cook plain dishes well? make bread? and is she
honest, good-tempered, sober, willing, and cleanly? Lady
Seymour would also like to know the reason why she
leaves Lady Shuckburgh's service. Direct, under cover to
Lord Seymour, Maiden Bradley."</blockquote>
<p>To this polite and business-like inquiry, Lady Shuckburgh
replied as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Lady Shuckburgh presents her compliments to Lady
Seymour. Her ladyship's note, dated October 28, only
reached her yesterday, November 3. Lady Shuckburgh
was unacquainted with the name of the kitchen-maid until
mentioned by Lady Seymour, as it is her custom neither to
apply for or to give characters to any of the under servants,
this being always done by the housekeeper, Mrs. Couch&#8212;and
this was well known to the young woman; therefore
Lady Shuckburgh is surprised at her referring any lady to <a
 name="Page_318"></a>her for a character. Lady Shuckburgh having a
professed
cook, as well as a housekeeper, in her establishment, it is
not very likely she herself should know anything of the
abilities or merits of the under servants; therefore she is
unable to answer Lady Seymour's note. Lady Shuckburgh
cannot imagine Mary Stedman to be capable of cooking for
any except the servants'-hall table.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"November 4, Pavilion, Hans Place."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Sheridan's granddaughter was quite the wrong subject
for these experiments in fine-ladyism, and she lost no time
in replying as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"Lady Seymour presents her compliments to Lady Shuckburgh,
and begs she will order her housekeeper, Mrs. Pouch,
to send the girl's character without delay; otherwise another
young woman will be sought for elsewhere, as Lady Seymour's
children cannot remain without their dinners because Lady
Shuckburgh, keeping a 'professed cook and a housekeeper,'
thinks a knowledge of the details of her establishment beneath
her notice. Lady Seymour understands from Stedman that,
in addition to her other talents, she was actually capable of
dressing food fit for the little Shuckburghs to partake of
when hungry."</blockquote>
<p>To this note was appended a pen-and-ink vignette by
Lady Seymour representing the three "little Shuckburghs,"
with large heads and cauliflower wigs, sitting at a round
table and voraciously scrambling for mutton chops dressed
by Mary Stedman, who was seen looking on with supreme
satisfaction, while Lady Shuckburgh appeared in the distance
in evident dismay. A crushing rejoinder closed this
correspondence:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Madam,&#8212;Lady Shuckburgh has directed me to acquaint
you that she declines answering your note, the vulgarity of
which is beneath contempt; and although it may be the
characteristic of the Sheridans to be vulgar, coarse, and <a
 name="Page_319"></a>witty, it is not that of a 'lady,' unless she
happens to have
been born in a garret and bred in a kitchen. Mary
Stedman informs me that your ladyship does not keep either a
cook or a housekeeper, and that you only require a girl
who can cook a mutton chop. If so, I apprehend that
Mary Stedman or any other scullion will be found fully
equal to cook for or manage the establishment of the Queen
of Beauty.&#8212;I am, your Ladyship's, &amp;c.,</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">"ELIZABETH COUCH (not Pouch)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Odd men," quoth Bishop Thorold, "write odd letters,"
and so do odd women. The original of the following
epistle to Mr. Gladstone lies before me. It is dated Cannes,
March 15, 1893:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Far away from my native Land, my bitter indignation
as a <i>Welshwoman</i> prompts me to reproach you, you <i>bad,
wicked, false</i>, treacherous Old Man! for your iniquitous
scheme to <i>rob</i> and overthrow the dearly-beloved Old Church
of my Country. You have no conscience, but I pray that
God may even yet give you one that will sorely <i>smart</i> and
trouble you before you die. You pretend to be religious,
you old hypocrite! that you may more successfully pander
to the evil passions of the lowest and most ignorant of the
Welsh people. But you neither care for nor respect the
principles of Religion, or you would not distress the minds
of all true Christian people by instigating a mob to Commit
the awful sin of Sacrilege. You think you will shine in
History, but it will be a notoriety similar to that of <i>Nero.</i>
I see some one pays you the unintentional compliment of
comparing you to Pontius Pilate, and I am sorry, for Pilate,
though a political time-server, was, with all his faults, a very
respectable man in comparison with you. And he did not,
like you, profess the Christian Religion You are certainly <i>clever</i>.
So also is your lord and master the Devil. And
I cannot regard it as sinful to hate and despise you, any <a
 name="Page_320"></a>more than it is sinful to abhor him. So, with
full measure
of contempt and detestation, accept these compliments from</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">"A DAUGHTER OF OLD WALES."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a triumph of female perseverance and ingenuity
that the whole of the foregoing is compressed into a single
postcard.</p>
<p>Some letters, like the foregoing, are odd from their extraordinary
rudeness. Others&#8212;not usually, it must be admitted,
Englishmen's letters&#8212;are odd from their excess of civility.
An Italian priest working in London wrote to a Roman
Catholic M.P., asking for an order of admission to the
House of Commons, and, on receiving it, acknowledged it
as follows:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: center;">"<i>To the Hon. Mr.----, M.P.</i></p>
  <p>"Hon. Sir, Son in Jesu Christ, I beg most respectfully
you, Hon. Sir, to accept the very deep gratitude for the
ticket which you, Hon. Sir, with noble kindness, favoured
me by post to-day. May the Blessing of God Almighty
come upon you, Hon. Sir, and may He preserve you, Hon.
Sir, for ever and ever, Amen! With all due respect, I have
the honour to be, Hon. Sir, your most</p>
  <p style="text-align: right; margin-left: 40px;">"humble and obedient
servant,</p>
  <p style="text-align: right; margin-left: 40px;">"----."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely the British Constituent might take a lesson from
this extremely polite letter-writer when his long-suffering
Member has squeezed him into the Strangers' Gallery.</p>
<p>Some letters, again, are odd from their excess of candour.
A gentleman, unknown to me, soliciting pecuniary assistance,
informed me that, having "sought relief from trouble
in dissipation," he "committed an act which sent him into
Penal Servitude," and shortly after his release, "wrote a
book containing many suggestions for the reform of prison
discipline," A lady, widely known for the benevolent use
<a name="Page_321"></a>which she makes of great wealth, received a
letter from an
absolute stranger, setting forth that he had been so unfortunate
as to overdraw his account at his bankers, and
adding, "As I know that it will only cost you a scratch of
the pen to set this right, I make no apology for asking you
to do so."</p>
<p>Among "odd men" might certainly be reckoned the late
Archdeacon Denison, and he displayed his oddness very
characteristically when, having quarrelled with the Committee
of Council on Education, he refused to have his
parish schools inspected, and thus intimated his resolve to
the inspector:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>"My dear Bellairs,&#8212;I love you very much; but if you
ever come here again to inspect, I lock the door of the
school, and tell the boys to put you in the pond."</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure whether the great Duke of Wellington can
properly be described as an "odd man," but beyond question
he wrote odd letters. I have already quoted from his reply
to Mrs. Norton when she asked leave to dedicate a song to
him: "I have made it a rule to have nothing dedicated to
me, and have kept it in every instance, though I have been
Chancellor of the University of Oxford, and in other situations
<i>much exposed to authors</i>." The Duke replied to every
letter that he received, but his replies were not always
acceptable to their recipients. When a philanthropist
begged him to present some petitions to the House of
Lords on behalf of the wretched chimney sweeps, the Duke
wrote back: "Mr. Stevens has <i>thought fit</i> to leave some
petitions at Apsley House. They will be found with the
porter." The Duke's correspondence with "Miss J.," which
was published by Mr. Fisher Unwin some ten years ago,
and is much less known than it deserves to be, contains
some gems of composition. Miss J. consulted the Duke
about her duty when a fellow-passenger in the stage-coach
swore, and he wrote: "I don't consider with you that it is
<a name="Page_322"></a>necessary to enter into a disputation with every
wandering
Blasphemer. Much must depend upon the circumstances."
And when the good lady mixed flirtation with piety, and
irritability with both, he wrote: "The Duke of Wellington
presents His Compliments to Miss J. She is quite mistaken.
He has no Lock of Hair of Hers. He never had one."<a name="FNanchor_34"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
The Letter of Condolence is a branch of the art of letter-writing
which requires very delicate handling. This was
evidently felt by the Oxford Don who, writing to condole
with a father on the death of his undergraduate son, concluded
his tribute of sympathy by saying: "At the same
time, I feel it my duty to tell you that your son would not
in any case have been allowed to return next term, as he
had failed to pass Responsions."</p>
<p>Curtness in letter-writing does not necessarily indicate
oddity. It often is the most judicious method of avoiding
interminable correspondence. When one of Bishop
Thorold's clergy wrote to beg leave of absence from his
duties in order that he might make a long tour in the East,
he received for all reply: "Dear&#8212;,&#8212;Go to Jericho.&#8212;
Yours, A.W.R." At a moment when scarlet fever was
ravaging Haileybury, and suggestions for treatment were
pouring in by every post, the Head Master had a lithographed
answer prepared, which ran: "Dear Sir,&#8212;I am obliged by
your opinions, and retain my own." An admirable answer
was made by another Head Master to a pompous matron,
who wrote that, before she sent her boy to his school, she
must ask if he was very particular about the social antecedents
of his pupils: "Dear Madam, as long as your son
behaves himself and his fees are paid, no questions will be
asked about his social antecedents."</p>
<p>Sydney Smith's reply, when Lord Houghton, then young
"<a name="Page_323"></a>Dicky Milnes," wrote him an angry letter about
some
supposed unfriendliness, was a model of mature and genial
wisdom: "Dear Milnes,&#8212;Never lose your good temper,
which is one of your best qualities." When the then Dean
of Hereford wrote a solemn letter to Lord John Russell,
announcing that he and his colleagues would refuse to elect
Dr. Hampden to the See, Lord John replied: "Sir,&#8212;I
have had the honour to receive your letter of the 22nd inst.,
in which you intimate to me your intention of violating the
law." Some years ago Lady----, who is well known as
an ardent worker in the interests of the Roman Church,
wrote to the Duke of----, a sturdy Protestant, that she
was greatly interested in a Roman Catholic Charity, and,
knowing the Duke's wide benevolence, had ventured to put
down his name for &pound;100. The Duke wrote back: "Dear
Lady----,&#8212;It is a curious coincidence that, just before I
got your letter, I had put down your name for a like sum to
the English Mission for converting Irish Catholics; so no
money need pass between us." But perhaps the supreme
honours of curt correspondence belong to Mr. Bright. Let
one instance suffice. Having been calumniated by a Tory
orator at Barrow, Mr. Bright wrote as follows about his
traducer: "He may not know that he is ignorant, but he
cannot be ignorant that he lies. And after such a speech
the meeting thanked him&#8212;I presume because they enjoyed
what he had given them. I think the speaker was named
Smith. He is a discredit to <i>the numerous family of that
name.</i>"<br>

<h2><a name="Page_324"></a>XXXIII.</h2>
<h2>OFFICIALDOM.</h2>
<p>The announcements relating to the first Cabinet of the
winter set me thinking whether my readers might be
interested in seeing what I have "collected" as to the
daily life and labours of her Majesty's Ministers. I
decided that I would try the experiment, and, acting on
the principle which I have professed before&#8212;that when
once one has deliberately chosen certain words to express
one's meaning one cannot, as a rule, alter them with advantage&#8212;I
shall borrow from some former writings of my own.</p>
<p>The Cabinet is the Board of Directors of the British
Empire. All its members are theoretically equal; but, as
at other Boards, the effective power really resides in three
or four. At the present moment<a name="FNanchor_35"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> Manchester is represented by
one of these potent few. Saturday is the usual day for
the meeting of the Cabinet, though it may be convened at
any moment as special occasion arises. Describing the
potato-disease which led to the repeal of the Corn Laws,
Lord Beaconsfield wrote: "This mysterious but universal
sickness of a single root changed the history of the world.
'There is no gambling like politics,' said Lord Roehampton,
as he glanced at the <i>Times</i>: 'four Cabinets in one week!
The Government must be more sick than the potatoes!'"</p>
<p><a name="Page_325"></a>Twelve is the usual hour for the meeting of
the Cabinet,
and the business is generally over by two. At the Cabinets
held during November the legislative programme for next
session is settled, and the preparation of each measure is
assigned to a sub-committee of Ministers specially conversant
with the subject-matter. Lord Salisbury holds his Cabinets
at the Foreign Office; but the old place of meeting was the
official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury at 10
Downing Street, in a pillared room looking over the Horse
Guards Parade, and hung with portraits of departed First
Lords.</p>
<p>In theory, of course, the proceedings of the Cabinet are
absolutely secret. The Privy Councillor's oath prohibits all
disclosures. No record is kept of the business done. The
door is guarded by vigilant attendants against possible eavesdroppers.
The dispatch-boxes which constantly circulate
between Cabinet Ministers, carrying confidential matters, are
carefully locked with special keys, said to date from the
administration
of Mr. Pitt; and the possession of these keys
constitutes admission into what Lord Beaconsfield called
"the circles of high initiation." Yet in reality more leaks
out than is supposed. In the Cabinet of 1880-5 the leakage
to the press was systematic and continuous. Even Mr.
Gladstone, the stiffest of sticklers for official reticence, held
that a Cabinet Minister might impart his secrets to his wife
and his Private Secretary. The wives of official men are not
always as trustworthy as Mrs. Bucket in <i>Bleak House</i>, and
some of the Private Secretaries in the Government of 1880
were little more than boys. Two members of that Cabinet
were notorious for their free communications to the press,
and it was often remarked that the <i>Birmingham Daily Post</i>
was peculiarly well informed. A noble Lord who held a
high office, and who, though the most pompous, was not
the wisest of mankind, was habitually a victim to a certain
journalist of known enterprise, who used to waylay him
<a name="Page_326"></a>outside Downing Street and accost him with
jaunty confidence:
"Well, Lord ----, so you have settled on so-and-so
after all?" The noble lord, astonished that the Cabinet's
decision was already public property, would reply, "As you
know so much, there can be no harm in telling the rest";
and the journalist, grinning like a dog, ran off to print the
precious morsel in a special edition of the <i>Millbank Gazette</i>.
Mr. Justin McCarthy could, I believe, tell a curious story of
a highly important piece of foreign intelligence communicated
by a Minister to the <i>Daily News</i>; of a resulting
question in the House of Commons; and of the same
Minister's emphatic declaration that no effort should be
wanting to trace this violator of official confidence and bring
him to condign punishment.</p>
<p>While it is true that outsiders sometimes become possessed
by these dodges of official secrets, it is not less true
that Cabinet Ministers are often curiously in the dark about
great and even startling events. A political lady once said
to me, "Do you in your party think much of my neighbour,
Mr. ----?" As in duty bound, I replied, "Oh yes, a
great deal." She rejoined, "I shouldn't have thought it,
for when the boys are shouting any startling news in the
special editions, I see him run out without his hat to buy an
evening paper. That doesn't look well for a Cabinet Minister."
On the fatal 6th of May 1882 I dined in company
with Mr. Bright. He stayed late, but never heard a word
of the murders which had taken place that evening in the
Phoenix Park; went off quietly to bed, and read them as
news in the next morning's <i>Observer</i>.</p>
<p>But, after all, attendance at the Cabinet, though a most
important, is only an occasional, event in the life of one
of her Majesty's Ministers. Let us consider the ordinary
routine of his day's work during the session of Parliament.
The truly virtuous Minister, we may presume, struggles
down to the dining room to read prayers and to breakfast
<a name="Page_327"></a>in the bosom of his family between 9 and 10 A.M.
But
the self-indulgent bachelor declines to be called, and sleeps
his sleep out. Mr. Arthur Balfour invariably breakfasts at
12; and more politicians than would admit it consume
their tea and toast in bed. Mercifully, the dreadful habit of
giving breakfast-parties, though sanctioned by the memories
of Holland and Macaulay and Rogers and Houghton, virtually
died out with the disappearance of Mr. Gladstone.</p>
<p>"Men who breakfast out are generally Liberals," says
Lady St. Julians in <i>Sybil</i>. "Have not you observed that?"</p>
<p>"I wonder why?"</p>
<p>"It shows a restless, revolutionary mind," said Lady
Firebrace, "that can settle to nothing, but must be running
after gossip the moment they are awake."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Lady St. Julians, "I think those men who
breakfast out, or who give breakfasts, are generally dangerous
characters; at least I would not trust them."</p>
<p>And Lady St. Julians's doctrine, though half a century
old, applies with perfect exactness to those enemies of the
human race who endeavour to keep alive or to resuscitate
this desperate tradition. Juvenal described the untimely
fate of the man who went into his bath with an undigested
peacock in his system. Scarcely pleasanter are the sensations
of the Minister or the M.P. who goes from a breakfast-party,
full of buttered muffins and broiled salmon, to the
sedentary desk-work of his office or the fusty wrangles of
a Grand Committee.</p>
<p>Breakfast over, the Minister's fancy lightly turns to
thoughts of exercise. If he is a man of active habits and
strenuous tastes, he may take a gentle breather up Highgate
Hill, like Mr. Gladstone, or play tennis, like Sir Edward
Grey. Lord Spencer when in office might be seen any
morning cantering up St. James's Street on a hack, or
pounding round Hyde Park in high naval debate with Sir
Ughtred Kay-Shuttleworth. Lord Rosebery drives himself
<a name="Page_328"></a>in a cab; Mr. Asquith is driven; both
occasionally survey
the riding world over the railings of Rotten Row; and even
Lord Salisbury may be found prowling about the Green
Park, to which his house in Arlington Street has a private
access. Mr. Balfour, as we all know, is a devotee of the
cycle, and his example is catching; but Mr. Chamberlain
holds fast to the soothing belief that, when a man has
walked upstairs to bed, he has made as much demand on
his physical energies as is good for him, and that exercise
was invented by the doctors in order to bring grist to their
mill.</p>
<p>Whichever of these examples our Minister prefers to
follow, his exercise or his lounge must be over by 12 o'clock.
The Grand Committees meet at that hour; on Wednesday
the House meets then; and if he is not required by departmental
business to attend either the Committee or the
House, he will probably be at his office by midday. The
exterior aspect of the Government Offices in Whitehall is
sufficiently well known, and any peculiarities which it may
present are referable to the fact that the execution of an
Italian design was entrusted by the wisdom of Parliament
to a Gothic architect. Inside, their leading characteristics
are the abundance and steepness of the stairs, the total
absence of light, and an atmosphere densely charged with
Irish stew. Why the servants of the British Government
should live exclusively on this delicacy, and why its odours
should prevail with equal pungency "from morn to noon,
from noon to dewy eve," are matters of speculation too
recondite for popular handling.</p>
<p>The Minister's own room is probably on the first floor&#8212;perhaps
looking into Whitehall, perhaps into the Foreign
Office Square, perhaps on to the Horse Guards Parade. It
is a large room with immense windows, and a fireplace
ingeniously contrived to send all its heat up the chimney.
If the office is one of the older ones, the room probably
<a name="Page_329"></a>contains some good pieces of furniture derived,
from a
less penurious age than ours&#8212;a bureau or bookcase of
mahogany dark with years, showing in its staid ornamentation
traces of Chippendale or Sheraton; a big clock in a
handsome case; and an interesting portrait of some historic
statesman who presided over the department two centuries
ago. But in the more modern offices all is barren. Since
the late Mr. Ayrton was First Commissioner of Works a
squalid cheapness has reigned supreme. Deal and paint
are everywhere; doors that won't shut, bells that won't ring,
and curtains that won't meet. In two articles alone there
is prodigality&#8212;books and stationery. Hansard's Debates,
the Statutes at Large, treatises illustrating the work of the
office, and books of reference innumerable, are there; and
the stationery shows a delightful variety of shape, size, and
texture, adapted to every conceivable exigency of official
correspondence.</p>
<p>It is indeed in the item of stationery, and in that alone,
that the grand old constitutional system of perquisites survives.
Morbidly conscientious Ministers sometimes keep a
supply of their private letter-paper on their office-table and
use it for their private correspondence; but the more
frankly human sort write all their letters on official paper.
On whatever paper written, Ministers' letters go free from
the office and the House of Commons; and certain artful
correspondents outside, knowing that a letter to a public
office need not be stamped, write to the Minister at his
official address and save their penny. In days gone by each
Secretary of State received on his appointment a silver
inkstand, which he could hand down as a keepsake to
his children. Mr. Gladstone, when he was Chancellor of
the Exchequer, abolished this little perquisite, and the only
token of office which an outgoing Minister can now take
with him is his dispatch-box. The wife of a minister who
had long occupied an official residence, on being evicted
<a name="Page_330"></a>from office said with a pensive sigh, "I hope I
am not
avaricious, but I must say, when one was hanging up pictures,
it was very pleasant to have the Board of Works carpenter
and a bag of the largest nails for nothing."</p>
<p>The late Sir William Gregory used to narrate how when
a child he was taken by his grandfather, who was Under-Secretary
for Ireland, to see the Chief Secretary, Lord Melbourne,
in his official room. The good-natured old Whig
asked the boy if there was anything in the room that he
would like; and he chose a large stick of sealing-wax,
"That's right," said Lord Melbourne, pressing a bundle
of pens into his hand: "begin life early. All these things
belong to the public, and your business must always be
to get out of the public as much as you can." There spoke
the true spirit of our great governing families.</p>
<p>And now our Minister, seated at his official table, touches
his pneumatic bell. His Private Secretary appears with a
pile of papers, and the day's work begins. That work, of
course, differs enormously in amount, nature, importance,
and interest with different offices. To the outside world
probably one office is much the same as another, but the
difference in the esoteric view is wide indeed. When the
Revised Version of the New Testament came out, an accomplished
gentleman who had once been Mr. Gladstone's Private
Secretary, and had been appointed by him to an important
post in the permanent Civil Service, said: "Mr. Gladstone,
I have been looking at the Revised Version, and I think it
distinctly inferior to the old one."</p>
<p>"Indeed," said Mr. Gladstone, with all his theological
ardour roused at once: "I am very much interested to
hear you say so. Pray give me an instance."</p>
<p>"Well," replied the Permanent Official, "look at the first
verse of the second chapter of St. Luke. That verse used
to run, 'There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus
that all the world should be taxed.' Well, I always
<a name="Page_331"></a>thought that a splendid idea&#8212;a tax levied on the
whole
world by a single Act&#8212;a grand stroke worthy of a great
empire and an imperial treasury. But in the Revised
Version I find, 'There went out a decree that all the world
should be enrolled'&#8212;a mere counting! a census! the sort
of thing the Local Government Board could do! Will any
one tell me that the new version is as good as the old one
in this passage?"</p>
<p>This story aptly illustrates the sentiments with which the
more powerful and more ancient departments regard those
later births of time, the Board of Trade, the Local Government
Board, the Board of Agriculture, and even the Scotch
Office&#8212;though this last is redeemed from utter contempt
by the irritable patriotism of our Scottish fellow-citizens,
and by the beautiful house in which it is lodged. For a
Minister who loves an arbitrary and single-handed authority
the India Office is the most attractive of all. The Secretary
of State for India, is (except in financial matters, where he
is controlled by his Council) a pure despot. He has the
Viceroy at the end of a telegraph-wire, and the Queen's
three hundred millions of Indian subjects under his thumb.
His salary is not voted by the House of Commons; very
few M.P.'s care a rap about India; and he is practically
free from Parliamentary control. The Foreign Office, of
course, is full of interest, and its social traditions have
always been of the most dignified sort&#8212;from the days when
Mr. Ranville-Ranville used to frequent Mrs. Perkins's Balls
to the existing reign of Sir Thomas Sanderson and Mr. Eric
Barrington.</p>
<p>The Treasury has its finger in every departmental pie
except the Indian one, for no Minister and no department
can carry out reforms or even discharge its ordinary routine
without public money, and of public money the Treasury is
the vigilant and inflexible guardian. "I am directed to acquaint
you that My Lords do not see their way to comply
<a name="Page_332"></a>with your suggestion, inasmuch as to do so would
be to
<i>open a serious door</i>." This delightful formula, with its dread
suggestion of a flippant door and all the mischief to which
it might lead, is daily employed to check the ardour of
Ministers who are seeking to advance the benefit of the race
(including their own popularity among their constituents)
by a judicious expenditure of public money. But whatever
be the scope and function of the office, and whatever the
nature of the work done there, the mode of doing it is pretty
much the same. Whether the matter in question originates
inside the office by some direction or inquiry of the chief,
or comes by letter from outside, it is referred to the particular
department of the office which is concerned with it.
A clerk makes a careful minute, giving the facts of the case
and the practice of the office as bearing on it. The paper
is then sent to any other department or person in the office
that can possibly have any concern with it. It is minuted
by each, and it gradually passes up, by more or fewer official
gradations, to the Under-Secretary of State, who reads, or is
supposed to read, all that has been written on the paper in
its earlier stages, balances the perhaps conflicting views of
different annotators, and, if the matter is too important for
his own decision, sums up in a minute of recommendation
to the chief. The ultimate decision, however, is probably
less affected by the Under-Secretary's minute than by the
oral advice of a much more important personage, the Permanent
Head of the office.</p>
<p>It would be beyond my present scope to discuss the
composition and powers of the permanent Civil Service,
whose chiefs have been, at least since the days of Bagehot,
recognized as the real rulers of this country. For absolute
knowledge of their business, for self-denying devotion to
duty, for ability, patience, courtesy, and readiness to help
the fleeting Political Official, the permanent chiefs of the
Civil Service are worthy of the highest praise. That they
<a name="Page_333"></a>are conservative<a name="FNanchor_36"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> to the core is only to say
that they are
human. On being appointed to permanent office the
extremist theorists, like the bees in the famous epigram,
"cease to hum" their revolutionary airs, and settle down
into the profound conviction that things are well as they
are. All the more remarkable is the entire equanimity with
which the Permanent Official accepts the unpalatable decision
of a chief who is strong enough to override him, and the
absolute loyalty with which he will carry out a policy which
he cordially disapproves.</p>
<p>Much of a Minister's comfort and success depends upon
his Private Secretary. Some Ministers import for this
function a young gentleman of fashion whom they know at
home&#8212;a picturesque butterfly who flits gaily through the
dusty air of the office, making, by the splendour of his
raiment, sunshine in its shady places, and daintily passing
on the work to unrecognized and unrewarded clerks. But
the better practice is to appoint as Private Secretary one of
the permanent staff of the office. He supplies his chief with
official information, hunts up necessary references, writes his
letters, and interviews his bores.</p>
<p>When the late Lord Ampthill was a junior clerk in the
Foreign Office, Lord Palmerston, then Foreign Secretary,
introduced an innovation whereby, instead of being solemnly
summoned by a verbal message, the clerks were expected to
answer his bell. Some haughty spirits rebelled against being
treated like footmen, and tried to organize resistance; but
Odo Russell, as he then was, refused to join the rebellious
movement, saying that whatever method apprized him most
quickly of Lord Palmerston's wishes was the method which
he preferred. The aggrieved clerks regarded him as a traitor
to his order&#8212;but he died an ambassador. Trollope described
<a name="Page_334"></a>the wounded feelings of a young clerk whose
chief sent him
to fetch his slippers; and in our own day a Private Secretary,
who had patiently taken tickets for the play for his chief's
daughters, drew the line when he was told to take the chief's
razors to be ground. But such assertions of independence
are extremely rare, and as a rule the Private Secretary is the
most cheerful and the most alert of ministering spirits.</p>
<p>But it is time to return from this personal digression to the
routine of the day's work. Among the most important of the
morning's duties is the preparation of answers to be given in
the House of Commons, and it is often necessary to have
answers ready by three o'clock to questions which have only
appeared that morning on the notice-paper. The range of
questions is infinite, and all the resources of the office are
taxed in order to prepare answers at once accurate in fact
and wise in policy, to pass them under the Minister's review,
and to get them fairly copied out before the House meets.
As a rule, the Minister, knowing something of the temper of
Parliament, wishes to give a full, explicit, and intelligible
answer, or even to go a little beyond the strict terms of the
question if he sees what his interrogator is driving at. But
this policy is abhorrent to the Permanent Official. The
traditions of the Circumlocution Office are by no means
dead, and the crime of "wanting to know, you know," is
one of the most heinous that the M.P. can commit. The
answers, therefore, as prepared for the Minister are generally
jejune, often barely civil, sometimes actually misleading.
But the Minister, if he be a wise man, edits them into a
more informing shape, and after a long and careful deliberation
as to the probable effect of his words and the reception
which they will have from his questioner, he sends the bundle
of written answers away to be fair-copied and turns to his
correspondence.</p>
<p>And here the practice of Ministers varies exceedingly.
Lord Salisbury writes almost everything with his own hand.
<a name="Page_335"></a>Mr. Balfour dictates to a shorthand clerk. Most
Ministers
write a great deal by their Private Secretaries. Letters of
any importance are usually transcribed into a copying-book.
A Minister whom I knew used to burn the fragment of
blotting-paper with which he had blotted his letter, and laid
it down as an axiom that, if a constituent wrote and asked a
Member to vote for a particular measure, the Member should
on no account give a more precise reply than, "I shall
have great pleasure in voting in the sense you desire." For,
as this expert observed with great truth, "unless the constituent
has kept a copy of his letter&#8212;and the chances are
twenty to one against that&#8212;there will be nothing to prove
what the sense he desired was, and you will be perfectly safe
in voting as you like." The letters received by a Minister
are many, various, and surprising. Of course, a great proportion
of them relate to public business, and a considerable
number to the affairs of his constituency. But, in addition
to all this, lunatics, cranks, and impostors mark a Minister
for their own, and their applications for loans, gifts, and
offices of profit would exhaust the total patronage of the
Crown and break the Bank of England.</p>
<p>When the day's official papers have been dealt with,
answers to questions settled, correspondence read, and the
replies written or dictated, it is very likely time to go to a
conference on some Bill with which the office is concerned.
This conference will consist of the Minister in charge of the
Bill, two or three of his colleagues who have special knowledge
of the subject, the Permanent Officials, the Parliamentary
draftsman, and perhaps one of the Law Officers. At
the conference the amendments on the paper are carefully
discussed, together with the objects for which they were presumably
put down, their probable effect, their merits or
demerits, and the best mode of meeting them. An hour
soon passes in this kind of anticipatory debate, and the
Minister is called away to receive a deputation.</p>
<p><a name="Page_336"></a>The scene is exactly like that which Matthew
Arnold
described at the Social Science Congress&#8212;the large bare
room, dusty air, and jaded light, serried ranks of men
with bald heads and women in spectacles; the local M.P.,
like Mr. Gregsbury in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, full of affability
and importance, introducing the selected spokesmen&#8212;"Our
worthy mayor; our leading employer of labour; Miss
Twoshoes, a philanthropic worker in all good causes"&#8212;the
Minister, profoundly ignorant of the whole subject,
smiling blandly or gazing earnestly from his padded chair;
the Permanent Official at his elbow murmuring what the
"practice of the department" has been, what his predecessor
said on a similar occasion ten years ago, and why the object
of the deputation is equally mischievous and impossible;
and the Minister finally expressing sympathy and promising
earnest consideration. Mr. Bright, though the laziest of
mankind at official work, was the ideal hand at receiving
deputations. Some Ministers scold or snub or harangue,
but he let the spokesmen talk their full, listened patiently,
smiled pleasantly, said very little, treated the subject with
gravity or banter as its nature required, paid the introducing
member a compliment on his assiduity and public spirit, and
sent them all away on excellent terms with themselves and
highly gratified by their intelligent and courteous reception.</p>
<p>So far we have described our Minister's purely departmental
duties. But perhaps the Cabinet meets at twelve,
and at the Cabinet he must, to use Mr. Gladstone's phrase,
"throw his mind into the common stock" with his fellow-Ministers,
and take part in the discussions and decisions
which govern the Empire. By two o'clock or thereabouts
the Cabinet is over. The labours of the morning are now
beginning to tell, and exhausted Nature rings her luncheon-bell.
Here again men's habits widely differ. If our Minister
has breakfasted late, he will go on till four or five, and then
have tea and toast, and perhaps a poached egg; but if he
<a name="Page_337"></a>is an early man, he craves for nutriment more
substantial.
He must not go out to luncheon to a friend's house, for he
will be tempted to eat and drink too much, and absence
from official territory in the middle of the day has a bad look
of idleness and self-indulgence. The <i>dura ilia</i> of the present<a
 name="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> Duke
of Devonshire could always cope with a slice of
the office-joint, a hunch of the office-bread, a glass of the
office-sherry. But, as a rule, if a man cannot manage to get
back to the family meal in South Kensington or Cavendish
Square, he turns into a club, has a cutlet and a glass of
claret, and gets back to his office for another hour's work
before going to the House.</p>
<p>At 3.30 questions begin, and every Minister is in his place,
unless, indeed, there is a Levee or a Drawing-room, when a
certain number of Ministers, besides the great Officers of
State, are expected to be present. The Minister lets himself
into the House by a private door&#8212;of which Ministers alone
have the key&#8212;at the back of the Chair. For an hour and
a half, or perhaps longer, the storm of questions rages, and
then the Minister, if he is in charge of the Bill under discussion,
settles himself on the Treasury Bench to spend the
remainder of the day in a hand-to-hand encounter with the
banded forces of the Opposition, which will tax to their
utmost his brain, nerve, and physical endurance. If, however,
he is not directly concerned with the business, he goes
out perhaps for a breath of air and a cup of tea on the
Terrace, and then buries himself in his private room&#8212;generally
a miserable little dog-hole in the basement of the
House&#8212;where he finds a pile of office-boxes, containing
papers which must be read, minuted, and returned to the
office with all convenient dispatch. From these labours he
is suddenly summoned by the shrill ting-ting of the division-bell
and the raucous bellow of the policeman to take part in
a division. He rushes upstairs two steps at a time, and
<a name="Page_338"></a>squeezes himself into the House through the
almost closed
doors. "What are we?" he shouts to the Whip. "Ayes"
or "Noes" is the hurried answer; and he stalks through
the lobby to discharge this intelligent function, dives down
to his room again, only, if the House is in Committee, to
be dragged up again ten minutes afterwards for another
repetition of the same farce, and so on indefinitely.</p>
<p>It may be asked why a Minister should undergo all this
worry of running up and down and in and out, laying down
his work and taking it up again, dropping threads, and losing
touch, and wasting time, all to give a purely party vote,
settled for him by his colleague in charge of the Bill, on a
subject with which he is personally unfamiliar. If the
Government is in peril, of course every vote is wanted; but,
with a normal majority, Ministers' votes might surely be
"taken as read," and assumed to be given to the side to
which they belong. But the traditions of Government require
Ministers to vote. It is a point of honour for each
man to be in as many divisions as possible. A record is
kept of all the divisions of the session and of the week, and
a list is sent round every Monday morning showing in how
many each Minister has voted.</p>
<p>The Whips, who must live and move and have their being
in the House, naturally head the list, and their colleagues
follow in a rather uncertain order. A Minister's place in
this list is mainly governed by the question whether he dines
at the House or not. If he dines away and "pairs," of
course he does not in the least jeopardize his party or embarrass
his colleagues; but "pairs" are not indicated in
the list of divisions, and, as divisions have an awkward
knack of happening between nine and ten, the habitual
diner-out naturally sinks in the list. If he is a married man,
the claims of the home are to a certain extent recognized
by his Whips, but woe to the bachelor who, with no domestic
excuse, steals away for two hours' relaxation. The good
<a name="Page_339"></a>Minister therefore stays at the House and dines
there. Perhaps
he is entertaining ladies in the crypt-like dining-rooms
which look on the Terrace, and in that case the charms of
society may neutralize the material discomforts. But, if he
dine upstairs at the Ministerial table, few indeed are the
alleviations of his lot. In the first place he must dine
with the colleagues with whom his whole waking life is
passed&#8212;excellent fellows and capital company&#8212;but nature
demands an occasional enlargement of the mental horizon.
Then if by chance he has one special bugbear&#8212;a bore or an
egotist, a man with dirty hands or a churlish temper&#8212;that
man will inevitably come and sit down beside him and insist
on being affectionate and fraternal.</p>
<p>The room is very hot; dinners have been going on in it
for the last two hours; the &#954;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#951;&#8212;the odour of roast
meat,
which the gods loved, but which most men dislike&#8212;pervades
the atmosphere; your next-door neighbour is eating a
rather high grouse while you are at your apple-tart, or the
perfumes of a deliquescent Camembert mingle with your
coffee. As to beverages, you may, if you choose, follow the
example of Lord Cross, who, when he was Sir Richard, drank
beer in its native pewter, or of Mr. Radcliffe Cooke, who
tries to popularize cider; or you may venture on that thickest,
blackest, and most potent of vintages which a few years back
still went by the name of "Mr. Disraeli's port." But as a
rule these heroic draughts are eschewed by the modern
Minister. Perhaps, if he is in good spirits after making a
successful speech or fighting his Estimates through Committee,
he will indulge himself with an imperial pint of
champagne; but more often a whiskey-and-soda or a half-bottle
of Zeltinger quenches his modest thirst.</p>
<p>On Wednesday and Saturday our Minister, if he is not out
of London, probably dines at a large dinner-party. Once a
session he must dine in full dress with the Speaker; once he
must dine at, or give, a full-dress dinner "to celebrate her
<a name="Page_340"></a>Majesty's Birthday." On the eve of the meeting
of Parliament
he must dine again in full dress with the Leader of the
House, to hear the rehearsal of the "gracious Speech from
the Throne." But, as a rule, his fate on Wednesday and
Saturday is a ceremonious banquet at a colleague's house,
and a party strictly political&#8212;perhaps the Prime Minister
as the main attraction, reinforced by Lord and Lady
Decimus Tite-Barnacle, Mr. and Mrs. Stiltstalking, Sir
John Taper, and young Mr. Tadpole. A political
dinner of thirty colleagues, male and female, in the dog-days
is only a shade less intolerable than the greasy
rations and mephitic vapours of the House of Commons'
dining-room.</p>
<p>At the political dinner "shop" is the order of the day.
Conversation turns on Brown's successful speech, Jones's
palpable falling-off, Robinson's chance of office, the explanation
of a recent by-election, or the prospects of an impending
division. And, to fill the cup of boredom to the brim,
the political dinner is usually followed by a political evening-party.
On Saturday the Minister probably does two hours'
work at his office and has some boxes sent to his house, but
the afternoon he spends in cycling, or golfing, or riding,
or boating, or he leaves London till Monday morning. On
Wednesday he is at the House till six, and then escapes
for a breath of air before dinner. But on Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday, and Friday, as a rule, he is at the House from its
meeting at three till it adjourns at any hour after midnight.
After dinner he smokes and reads and tries to work in his
room, and goes to sleep and wakes again, and towards midnight
is unnaturally lively. Outsiders believe in the "twelve
o'clock rule," but insiders know that, as a matter of fact,
it is suspended as often as an Irish member in the '80
Parliament. Whoever else slopes homewards, the Government
must stay. Before now a Minister has been fetched
out of his bed, to which he had surreptitiously retired, by a
<a name="Page_341"></a>messenger in a hansom, and taken back to the
House to
defend his Estimates at three in the morning.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"There they sit with ranks unbroken, cheering on the fierce debate,</p>
<p>Till the sunrise lights them homeward as they tramp
through Storey's Gate,</p>
<p>Racked with headache, pale and haggard, worn by nights of endless
talk,</p>
<p>While the early sparrows twitter all along the Birdcage Walk."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some ardent souls there are who, if report speaks true,
are not content with even this amount of exertion and
excitement, but finish the night, or begin the day, with a
rubber at the club or even a turn at baccarat. However,
we are describing, not choice spirits or chartered <i>viveurs</i>,
but the blameless Minister, whose whole life during the
Parliamentary session is the undeviating and conscientious
discharge of official duty; and he, when he lays his head
upon his respectable pillow any time after 1 a.m., may surely
go to sleep in the comfortable consciousness that he has
done a fair day's work for a not exorbitant remuneration.<br>

<h2><a name="Page_342"></a>XXXIV.</h2>
<h2>AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH-BOOK.</h2>
<p>The diary from which these Recollections have been
mainly gathered dates from my thirteenth year, and
it has lately received some unexpected illustrations.
In turning out the contents of a neglected cupboard, I
stumbled on a photograph-book which I filled while I was
a boy at a Public School. The school has lately been
described under the name of Lyonness,<a name="FNanchor_38"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> and that name will serve as
well as another.
The book had been mislaid years
ago, and when it accidentally came to light a strange aroma
of old times seemed still to hang about it. Inside and out,
it was reminiscent of a life in which for five happy years I
bore my part. Externally the book showed manifest traces
of a schoolboy's ownership, in broken corners; plentiful ink-stains,
from exercises and punishments; droppings of illicit
candle grease, consumed long after curfew-time; round marks
like fairy rings on a greensward, which indicated the standpoint
of extinct jam pots&#8212;where are those jam pots now?
But, while the outside of the book spoke thus, as it were,
by innuendo and suggestion, the inside seemed to shout
with joyous laughter or chuckle with irreverent mirth; or
murmured, in tones lower perhaps, but certainly not less
distinct, of things which were neither joyous nor mirthful.</p>
<p><a name="Page_343"></a>The book had been carefully arranged. As I
turned over
the leaves, there came back the memory of holiday-evenings
and the interested questionings of sisters over each new face
or scene; and the kind fingers which did the pasting-in;
and the care with which we made portrait and landscape fit
into and illustrate one another. And what memories, what
impressions, strong and clear as yesterday's, clung to each
succeeding view! The Spire&#8212;that "pinnacle perched on a
precipice"&#8212;with its embosoming trees, as one had so often
seen it from the North-Western Railway, while the finger of
fate, protruding from the carriage window, pointed it out
with&#8212;"That's where you will go to school." And, years
later, came the day when one travelled for the first time by
a train which did not rush through Lyonness Station (then
how small), but stopped there, and disgorged its crowd of
boys and their confusion of luggage, and oneself among the
rest, and one's father just as excited and anxious and eager
as his son.</p>
<p>A scurry for a seat on the omnibus or a tramp uphill, and
we find ourselves abruptly in the village street. Then did
each page as I turned it over bring some fresh recollection
of one's unspeakable sense of newness and desolation; the
haunting fear of doing something ludicrous; the morbid
dread of chaff and of being "greened," which even in my
time had, happily, supplanted the old terrors of being tossed
in a blanket or roasted at a fire. Even less, I venture to
think, was one thrilled by the heroic ambitions, the magnificent
visions of struggle and success, which stir the heroes
of schoolboy novels on the day of their arrival.</p>
<p>Here was a view of the School Library, with its patch of
greensward separating it from the dust and traffic of the
road. There was the Old School with its Fourth Form
Room, of which one had heard so much that the actual
sight of it made one half inclined to laugh and half to cry
with surprise and disappointment. There was the twisting
<a name="Page_344"></a>High Street, with its precipitous causeway;
there was the
faithful presentment of the fashionable "tuck-shop," with
two boys standing in the road, and the leg of a third caught
by the camera as he hurried past; and, wandering through
all these scenes in the album as one had wandered through
them in real life, I reached at last my boarding-house, once
a place of mystery and wonderful expectations and untried
experiences; now full of memories, some bright, some sad,
but all gathering enchantment from their retrospective distance;
and in every brick and beam and cupboard and
corner as familiar as home itself.</p>
<p>The next picture, a view of the School Bathing-place,
carried me a stage onward in memory to my first summer
quarter. Two terms of school life had inured one to a new
existence, and one began to know the pleasures, as well as
the pains, of a Public School. It was a time of cloudless
skies, and abundant "strawberry mashes," and <i>dolce far
niente</i> in that sweetly-shaded pool, when the sky was at its
bluest, and the air at its hottest, and the water at its most
inviting temperature.</p>
<p>And then the Old Speech-Room, so ugly, so incommodious,
where we stood penned together like sheep for the slaughter,
under the gallery, to hear our fate on the first morning of
our school life, and where, when he had made his way up
the school, the budding scholar received his prize or declaimed
his verses on Speech Day. That was the crowning
day of the young orator's ambition, when there was an arch
of evergreens reared over the school gate, and Lyonness was
all alive with carriages, and relations, and grandees,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And, as Lear, he poured forth the deep imprecation,</p>
<p class="i1">By his daughters of Kingdom and reason deprived;</p>
<p>Till, fired by loud plaudits and self-adulation,</p>
<p class="i1">He regarded himself as a Garrick revived."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Opposite the Old Speech-Room was the interior of the
Chapel, with its roof still echoing the thunder of the Parting
<a name="Page_345"></a>Hymn; and the pulpit with its unforgotten
pleadings for
truthfulness and purity; and the organ, still vocal with those
glorious psalms. And, high over all, the Churchyard Hill,
with its heaven-pointing spire, and the Poet's Tomb; and,
below, the incomparable expanse of pasture and woodland
stretching right away to the "proud keep with its double
belt of kindred and coeval towers."</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Still does yon bank its living hues unfold,</p>
<p>With bloomy wealth of amethyst and gold;</p>
<p>How oft at eve we watched, while there we lay,</p>
<p>The flaming sun lead down the dying day,</p>
<p>Soothed by the breeze that wandered to and fro</p>
<p>Through the glad foliage musically low.</p>
<p>Still stands that tree, and rears its stately form</p>
<p>In rugged strength, and mocks the winter storm;</p>
<p>There, while of slender shade and sapling growth,</p>
<p>We carved our schoolboy names, a mutual troth.</p>
<p>All, all, revives a bliss too bright to last,</p>
<p>And every leaflet whispers of the past."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And while the views of places were thus eloquent of the
old days, assuredly not less so were the portraits. There
was the Head Master in his silken robes, looking exactly as
he did when, enthroned in the Sixth Form Room, he used
to deliver those well-remembered admonitions&#8212;"Never say
what you know to be wrong," and "Let us leave <i>commence</i>
and <i>partake</i> to the newspapers."</p>
<p>And there was the Mathematical Master&#8212;the Rev. Rhadamanthus
Rhomboid&#8212;compared with whom his classical
namesake was a lenient judge. An admirable example was
old Mr. Rhomboid of a pedagogic type which, I am told,
is passing away&#8212;precise, accurate, stern, solid; knowing
very little, but that little thoroughly; never overlooking a
slip, but seldom guilty of an injustice; sternest and most
unbending of prehistoric Tories, both in matters political
and educational; yet carrying concealed somewhere under
the square-cut waistcoat a heart which knew how to sympathize
with boy-flesh and the many ills which it is heir
<a name="Page_346"></a>to. Good old Mr. Rhomboid! I wonder if he is
still
alive.</p>
<p>Facing him in the album, and most appropriately contrasted,
was the portrait of a young master&#8212;the embodiment
of all that Mr. Rhomboid most heartily loathed. We will
call him Vivian Grey. Vivian Grey was an Oxford Double
First of unusual brilliancy, and therefore found a special
charm and a satisfying sense of being suitably employed
in his duty at Lyonness, which was to instil &#964;&#965;&#960;&#964;&#969; and
Phaedrus into the five-and-thirty little wiseacres who constituted
the lowest form. Over the heads of these sages his
political and metaphysical utterances rolled like harmless
thunder, for he was at once a transcendentalist in philosophy
and a utilitarian Radical of the purest dye. All of which
mattered singularly little to his five-and-thirty disciples, but
caused infinite commotion and annoyance to the Rhomboids
and Rhadamanthuses. Vivian Grey at Oxford had belonged
to that school which has been described as professing</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"One Kant with a K,</p>
<p>And many a cant with a c."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At Lyonness he was supposed to have helped to break the
railings of Hyde Park in the riot of 1866, and to be a Head
Centre of the Fenian Brotherhood. As to personal appearance,
Mr. Grey was bearded like the pard&#8212;and in those
days the scholastic order shaved&#8212;while his taste in dress
made it likely that he was the "Man in the Red Tie" whom
we remember at the Oxford Commemoration some thirty
years ago. In short, he was the very embodiment of all
that was most abhorrent to the old traditions of the schoolmaster's
profession; and proportionately great was the appositeness
of a practical joke which was played me on my
second or third morning at Lyonness. I was told to go for
my mathematical lesson to Mr. Rhomboid, who tenanted a
room in the Old School. Next door to his room was Mr.
<a name="Page_347"></a>Grey's, and I need not say that the first boy
whom I asked
for guidance playfully directed me to the wrong door. I
enter, and the Third Form suspend their Phaedrus, "Please,
sir, are you Mr. Rhomboid?" I ask, amid unsmotherable
laughter. Never shall I forget the indignant ferocity with
which the professor of the new lights drove me from the
room, nor the tranquil austerity with which Mr. Rhomboid,
when I reached him, set me "fifty lines" before he asked
me my name.</p>
<p>On the same page I find the portrait of two men who have
before now figured in the world of school-fiction under the
names of Rose and Gordon.<a name="FNanchor_39"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> Of Mr. Rose I will say no
more than that he was an excellent schoolmaster and a most
true saint, and that to his influence and warnings many a
man can, in the long retrospect, trace his escape from moral
ruin. Mr. Gordon is now a decorous Dean; at Lyonness he
was the most brilliant, the most irregular, and the most fascinating
of teachers. He spoilt me for a whole quarter. I
loved him for it then, and I thank him even now.</p>
<p>These more distinguished portraits, of cabinet dimensions,
were scattered up and down among the miscellaneous herd
of <i>cartes de visits</i>. The art of Messrs. Hills and Saunders
was denoted by the pretentious character of the chairs introduced&#8212;the
ecclesiastical Glastonbury for masters, and
velvet backs studded with gilt nails for boys. The productions
of the rival photographer were distinguished by a pillar
of variegated marble, or possibly scagliola, on which the
person portrayed leaned, bent, or propped himself in every
phase of graceful discomfort. The athletes and members of
the School Eleven, dressed in appropriate flannel, were depicted
as a rale with their arms crossed over the backs of
chairs, and brought very much into focus so as to display the
muscular development in high relief. The more studious
portion of the community, "with leaden eye that loved the
<a name="Page_348"></a>ground," scanned small photograph-books with
absorbing
interest; while a group of editors, of whom I was one, were
gathered round a writing-table, with pens, ink, and paper,
the finger pressed on the forehead, and on the floor proofs
of the journal which we edited&#8212;was it the <i>Tyro</i> or the
<i>Triumvirate</i>?</p>
<p>Among the athletes I instantly recognize Biceps Max.,
captain of the Cricket Eleven, and practically autocrat of my
house&#8212;"Charity's" the house was called, in allusion to a
prominent feature of my tutor's character. Well, at Charity's
we did not think much of intellectual distinction in those
days, and little recked that Biceps was "unworthy to be
classed" in the terminal examination. We were much more
concerned with the fact that he made the highest score at
Lord's; that we at Charity's were absolutely under his
thumb, in the most literal acceptation of that phrase; that he
beat us into mummies if we evaded cricket-fagging; and that
if we burnt his toast he chastised us with a tea-tray. Where
is Biceps now, and what? If he took Orders, I am sure he
must be a muscular Christian of the most aggressive type.
If he is an Old Bailey barrister, I pity the timid witness
whom he cross-examines. Why do I never meet him at the
club or in society? It would be a refreshing novelty to sit
at dinner opposite a man who corrected your juvenile shortcomings
with a tea-tray. Would he attempt it again if I
contradicted him in conversation, or confuted him in argument,
or capped his best story with a better?</p>
<p>Next comes Longbow&#8212;Old Longbow, as we called him;
I suppose as a term of endearment, for there was no Young
Longbow. He was an Irishman, and the established wit,
buffoon, and jester of the school. Innumerable stories are
still told of his youthful escapades, of his audacity and skill
in cribbing, of his dexterity in getting out of scrapes, of his
repartees to masters and persons in authority. He it was
who took up the same exercise in algebra to Mr. Rhomboid
<a name="Page_349"></a>all the time he was in the Sixth Form, and
obtained maiks,
ostensibly for a French exercise, with a composition called
<i>De Camelo qualis sit</i>. He alone of created boys could joke
in the rarefied air of the Head Master's schoolroom, and
had power to "chase away the passing frown" with some
audacious witticism for which an English boy would have
been punished. Longbow was ploughed three times at
Oxford, and once "sent down." But he is now the very
orthodox vicar of a West End parish, a preacher of culture,
and a pattern of ecclesiastical propriety. Then, leaving
these heroic figures and coming to my own contemporaries,
I discern little Paley, esteemed a prodigy of parts&#8212;Paley,
who won an Entrance Scholarship while still in knickerbockers;
Paley, who ran up the school faster than any boy
on record; Paley, who was popularly supposed never to
have been turned in a "rep" or to have made a false
quantity; Paley, for whom his tutor and the whole magisterial
body were never tired of predicting a miraculous
success in after life. Poor Paley! He is at this moment
languishing in Lincoln's Inn, consoling himself for professional
failure by contemplating the largest extant collection
of Lyonness prize-books. I knew Paley, as boys say,
"at home," and, when he had been a few years at the Bar,
I asked his mother if he had got any briefs yet. "Yes,"
she answered with maternal pride; "he has been very lucky
in that way." "And has he got a verdict?" I asked. "Oh,
no," replied the simple soul; "we don't aspire to anything
so grand as that."</p>
<p>Next to Paley in my book is Roderick Random, the
cricketer. Dear Random, my contemporary, my form-fellow
and house-fellow; partaker with me in the ignominy
of Biceps's tea-tray and the tedium of Mr. Rhomboid's
problems: my sympathetic companion in every amusement,
and the pleasant drag on every intellectual effort&#8212;Random,
who never knew a lesson, nor could answer a question;
<a name="Page_350"></a>who never could get up in time for First School,
nor lay his
hand on his own Virgil&#8212;Random, who spent more of his
half-holidays in Extra School than any boy of his day, and
had acquired by long practice the power of writing the
"record" number of lines in an hour; who never told a
lie, nor bullied a weaker boy, nor dropped an unkind jest,
nor uttered a shameful word&#8212;Random, for whom every one
in authority prophesied ruin, speedy and inevitable; who is,
therefore, the best of landlords and the most popular of
country gentlemen; who was the most popular officer in
the Guards till duty called him elsewhere, and at the last
election came in at the top of the poll for his native county.</p>
<p>Then what shall we say for Lucian Gay, whose bright
eyes and curly hair greet me on the same page, with the
attractive charm which won me when we stood together
under the Speech-Room gallery on the first morning of our
school life? Gay was often at the top of his form, yet sometimes
near the bottom; wrote, apparently by inspiration,
the most brilliant verses; and never could put two and two
together in Mr. Rhomboid's schoolroom. He had the most
astonishing memory on record, and an inventive faculty
which often did him even better service. He was the soul
of every intellectual enterprise in the school, the best speaker
at the Debating Society; the best performer on Speech
Day; who knew nothing about &#947;&#949; and less about &#956;&#949;&#957; and
&#948;&#949;; who composed satirical choices when he should have
been taking notes on Tacitus; edited a School Journal with
surprising brilliancy; failed, to conjugate the verbs in &#956;&#953;
during his last fortnight in the school; and won the Balliol
Scholarship when he was seventeen. I trust, if this meets
his eye, he will accept it as a tribute of affectionate recollection
from one who worked with him, idled with him, and
joked with him for five happy years.</p>
<p>Under another face, marked by a more spiritual grace, I
find written <i>Requiescat</i>. None who ever knew them will
<a name="Page_351"></a>forget that bright and pure beauty, those eyes
of strange,
supernatural light, that voice which thrilled and vibrated
with an unearthly charm. All who were his contemporaries
remember that dauntless courage, that heroic virtue, that
stainless purity of thought and speech, before which all evil
things seemed to shrink away abashed. We remember how
the outward beauty of body seemed only the visible symbol
of a goodness which dwelt within, and how moral and intellectual
excellence grew up together, blending into a perfect
whole. We remember the School Concert, and the enchanting
voice, and the words of the song which afterwards
sounded like a warning prophecy, and the last walk together
in the gloaming of a June holiday, and the loving, trusting
companionship, and the tender talk of home. And then for
a day or two we missed the accustomed presence, and dimly
caught a word of dangerous illness; and then came the
agony of the parting scene, and the clear, hard, pitiless
school bell, cutting on our hearts the sense of an irreparable
loss, as it thrilled through the sultry darkness of the summer
night.</p>
<p>Here I shut the book. And with the memories which
that picture called up I may well bring these Recollections
to a close. It is something to remember, amid the bustle
and bitterness of active life, that one once had youth, and
hope, and eagerness, and large opportunities, and generous
friends. A tender and regretful sentiment seems to cling to
the very walls and trees among which one cherished such
bright ambitions and felt the passionate sympathy of such
loving hearts. The innocence and the confidence of boyhood
pass away soon enough, and thrice happy is he who has
contrived to keep</p>

ANGLAISES.</h2>
<h3>JEAN LA FRETTE.</h3>
<p>De ce c&ocirc;t&eacute; de la Manche nous avons une
sp&eacute;cialit&eacute; de
souvenirs militaires, et le public para&icirc;t prendre go&ucirc;t
&agrave; ce
genre de lectures. De l'autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, les souvenirs sont
plut&ocirc;t
d'ordre politique ou litt&eacute;raire. Ils n'en sont pas moins
int&eacute;ressants. Apr&egrave;s tout, les r&eacute;cits de massacres
et de
saccages se ressemblent beaucoup, qu'ils soient d'H&eacute;rodote
ou de Canrobert: et m&ecirc;me il ne semble pas que le genre
soit en progr&egrave;s, si l'on compare les termes extr&ecirc;mes de la
s&eacute;rie. Car H&eacute;rodote vit autre chose que les tueries, et
il l'en
faut f&eacute;liciter.</p>
<p>Il y a une autre diff&eacute;rence entre les deux groupes de
m&eacute;moires en question. Les n&ocirc;tres ont trait pour la plupart
&agrave; une &eacute;poque que beaucoup de gens consid&egrave;rent
comme un
apog&eacute;e, de sorte que, pour le lecteur, ils apportent
plut&ocirc;t un
sentiment de d&eacute;couragement. "Voil&agrave; ce qu'ils firent," se
dit-il: "et nous?..." Car ce qu'on est convenu d'appeler
"les gloires" napol&eacute;oniennes du d&eacute;but du si&egrave;cle ne
suffit
pas, h&eacute;las, &agrave; effacer la tache&#8212;non moins
napol&eacute;onienne&#8212;de
1870. Ce sentiment, le lecteur anglais ne l'&eacute;prouve pas
&agrave; lire les m&eacute;moires qui lui sont offerts, et qui, s'ils
ne racontent
pas, d'habitude, des exploits guerriers, relatent les
phases principales d'une lente &eacute;volution, d'un progr&egrave;s
tr&egrave;s r&eacute;el
<a name="Page_354"></a>dans les moeurs, dans la culture et dans
l'am&eacute;lioration sociale
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale.</p>
<p>Quel &eacute;tait l'auteur du plus r&eacute;cent volume de
souvenirs,
<i>Collections and Recollections</i>, publi&eacute; par MM. Smith,
Elder
et C<sup>ie</sup>, &agrave; Londres, on l'ignora quelques semaines.
Maintenant
il n'y a plus de doute: l'auteur s'est fait conna&icirc;tre; c'est
M. G.W.E. Russell. Sa personnalit&eacute; importait assez peu
d'ailleurs: car ce n'est lui-m&ecirc;me qu'il raconte: ce sont ses
contemporains et les faits dont il a &eacute;t&eacute; t&eacute;moin.
Mais M.
Russell est un homme de culture, qui a beaucoup approch&eacute;
de notabilit&eacute;s politiques et litt&eacute;raires, et a su les
&eacute;couter
parler, saisissant plus volontiers le c&ocirc;t&eacute; humoristique ou
anecdotique de leurs propos. Son livre est amusant et
instructif &agrave; la fois: et il met bien en lumi&egrave;re, dans les
premiers chapitres en particulier, l'&eacute;volution dont il
&eacute;tait
parl&eacute; plus haut, la transformation graduelle que les moeurs
anglaises ont subie depuis le commencement du si&egrave;cle.</p>
<p>Ce n'est point que l'auteur soit centenaire, d'ailleurs. Il
nous le dit express&eacute;ment: ses souvenirs personnels remontent
&agrave; 1856 seulement: mais il a beaucoup vu de vieilles gens,
il a pris note de leurs r&eacute;cits, et c'est par ces r&eacute;cits
qu'il est
facile de mesurer le chemin parcouru.</p>
<p>Ils confirment ce qu'on savait d&eacute;j&agrave; de la
grossi&egrave;ret&eacute; des
moeurs &agrave; une &eacute;poque encore r&eacute;cente. Du reste
l'exemple
venait de haut, et la famille royale ne pouvait en imposer ni
par la tenue, ni par la moralit&eacute;.</p>
<p>Le prince de Galles, raconte Lord Seymour, dans des
m&eacute;moires in&eacute;dits, le prince de Galles assure&#8212;et doit s'y
conna&icirc;tre&#8212;"qu'il n'y a pas une honn&ecirc;te femme &agrave;
Londres,
except&eacute; Lady Parker et Lady Westmorland: et encore sont-elles
si b&ecirc;tes qu'on n'en peut rien tirer: tout au plus sont-elles
capables de se moucher elles-m&ecirc;mes." A la r&eacute;ception
de Mme Vaneck, la semaine derni&egrave;re [ceci se passe en 1788],
le prince de Galles; &agrave; l'honneur de la politesse et de
l'&eacute;l&eacute;gance
de ses mani&egrave;res, mesura la largeur de Mme V---- par
<a name="Page_355"></a>derri&egrave;re avec son mouchoir, et alla
montrer les dimensions
&agrave; presque tous ceux qui &eacute;taient l&agrave;. "Un autre
trait de la
conduite respectueuse du prince: &agrave; cette m&ecirc;me
assembl&eacute;e
il a fait signe &agrave; la pauvre vieille duchesse de Bedford &agrave;
travers
une grande salle, et apr&egrave;s qu'elle eut pris la peine de
traverser
cette derni&egrave;re, il lui dit brusquement n'avoir rien &agrave; lui
communiquer. Le prince a rendu visite la semaine derni&egrave;re
&agrave; Mme Vaneck, avec deux de ses &eacute;cuyers. En entrant dans
la salle il s'est exclame: "Il <i>faut</i> que je le fasse: il le
<i>faut</i> ..." Mme V---- lui a demand&eacute; ce qu'il &eacute;tait
oblig&eacute;
de faire, et l&agrave;-dessus il a jet&eacute; un clignement d'oeil
&agrave; St. L&eacute;ger
et &agrave; l'autre complice qui ont couch&eacute; Mme V---- &agrave;
terre, et
le prince l'a positivement fouett&eacute;e...</p>
<p>C'&eacute;tait le r&eacute;sultat d'un pari. Mais Mlle Vaneck avait
quelque habitude des "jeux de rois": le prince fit p&eacute;nitence
le lendemain, et elle ne lui en voulut point. Autre aimable
fantaisie du prince: il re&ccedil;oit le duc d'Orl&eacute;ans,
accompagn&eacute;
de son fr&egrave;re naturel, l'abb&eacute; de la Fai(?). L'abb&eacute;
pr&eacute;tend
avoir un secret pour charmer les poissons: d'o&ugrave; le pari,
&agrave; la
suite duquel l'abb&eacute; s'approche de l'eau pour chatouiller un
poisson avec une baguette. Se m&eacute;fiant toutefois du prince,
qu'il connaissait sans doute de r&eacute;putation, il dit qu'il
esp&egrave;re
bien que celui-ci ne lui jouera pas le tour de le jeter &agrave; l'eau.
Le prince de protester et de donner "sa parole d'honneur."
L'abb&eacute; commence &agrave; se pencher sur un petit pont et le
prince
aussit&ocirc;t le saisit et le fait culbuter &agrave; l'eau,
d'o&ugrave; l'abb&eacute; se tire
non sans peine, et non sans col&egrave;re, car il court sur le prince
avec un fouet pour le corriger, d&eacute;clarant &agrave; qui veut
l'entendre
ce qu'il pense d'un prince incapable de tenir parole. Les
<i>practical jokers</i> de ce genre n'&eacute;taient pas rares: le duc
de Cumberland fit partager le m&ecirc;me sort &agrave; une jeune fille
qui servait de dame de compagnie. Les "grands" s'amusent....</p>
<p>Ils ont d'autres mani&egrave;res de s'amuser: le jeu, la boisson,
et le reste, qui sont de tous les temps et de tous les pays:
<a name="Page_356"></a>l'histoire de France en peut t&eacute;moigner
autant que celle de
n'importe quelle nation. Il faut croire que ces plaisirs sont
les plus appropri&eacute;s &agrave; la caste oisive et riche, &agrave;
qui il a suffi
de na&icirc;tre pour &ecirc;tre&#8212;ou para&icirc;tre&#8212;quelque chose. Au
reste,
il n'y aurait gu&egrave;re &agrave; s'en plaindre: ils font office
d'agents de
s&eacute;lection; ils &eacute;liminent&#8212;dans la st&eacute;rilit&eacute;
ou imb&eacute;cillit&eacute;&#8212;des
&ecirc;tres imb&eacute;ciles et malfaisants, et ils remettent en
circulation
des richesses qui n'ont souvent &eacute;t&eacute; accumul&eacute;es
qu'&agrave; coups
de rapines, ou par une pers&eacute;v&eacute;rante marche dans les voies
d&eacute;shonn&ecirc;tes.</p>
<p>Mais ces soi-disant plaisirs m&egrave;nent de fa&ccedil;on
tr&egrave;s directe
au crime: c'est l&agrave; une notion banale, et les exemples ne
manquent point.</p>
<p>Le duc de Bedford&#8212;cinqui&egrave;me du nom&#8212;ayant perdu de
grosses sommes un soir, &agrave; Newmarket, incrimina les d&eacute;s,
les
accusant d'&ecirc;tre pip&eacute;s. Il se leva de table en
col&egrave;re, saisit les
instruments de son malheur, et les emporta pour les examiner
&agrave; loisir. Rentr&eacute; chez lui, il se coucha, pour se calmer,
remettant ses investigations au lendemain. Celles-ci se firent
avec le concours de ses compagnons, et il dut reconna&icirc;tre
que les d&eacute;s &eacute;taient fort orthodoxes. Cela le surprit,
mais il
n'avait qu'&agrave; s'ex&eacute;cuter et c'est ce qu'il fit: il adressa
des
excuses, et paya. Quelques ann&eacute;es apr&egrave;s, un des joueurs
qui se mourait le fit appeler. "Je vous ai pri&eacute; de venir,"
dit-il,
"parce que je voulais vous dire que vous &eacute;tiez dans le
vrai. Les d&eacute;s &eacute;taient effectivement pip&eacute;s. Mais
nous
attend&icirc;mes que vous fussiez couch&eacute;: nous nous sommes
gliss&eacute;s dans votre chambre, et aux d&eacute;s pip&eacute;s que
vous aviez
emport&eacute;s nous avons substitu&eacute; qui ne l'&eacute;taient
point, et nous
les avons plac&eacute;s dans votre poche." "Mais si je m'&eacute;tais
&eacute;veill&eacute;, et si je vous avais pris sur le fait?..." "Eh
bien!
nous &eacute;tions d&eacute;cid&eacute;s &agrave; tout ... et nous
avions des pistolets."</p>
<p>La seule action m&eacute;ritoire de sa vie, disait M. Goldwin
Smith du duc d'York, c'est de l'avoir une fois risqu&eacute;e en
<a name="Page_357"></a>duel.... C'&eacute;tait maigre, pour un prince
du sang, et pour
un simple particulier aussi bien. Car il ne la perdit point.</p>
<p>La d&eacute;licatesse est tr&egrave;s m&eacute;diocre.</p>
<p>William et John Scott, plus tard Lord Stowell et Lord
Eldon, ayant obtenu quelque succ&egrave;s comme avocats; dans
leurs jeunes aim&eacute;es, avaient r&eacute;solu de
c&eacute;l&eacute;brer l'&eacute;v&eacute;nement
par un d&icirc;ner &agrave; la taverne, apr&egrave;s quoi l'on irait au
th&eacute;&acirc;tre.
En payant l'addition, William laissa tomber une guin&eacute;e que
les deux fr&egrave;res ne purent retrouver. "Mauvaise affaire," fit
William: "voil&agrave; qu'il nous faut renoncer au
th&eacute;&acirc;tre." "Que
non pas," dit John: "je sais un tour qui vaut mieux." Il
appela la servante. "Betty, nous avons perdu deux guin&eacute;es:
voyez donc si vous pouvez les retrouver." Betty se met &agrave;
quatre pattes et cherche si bien qu'elle retrouve la pi&egrave;ce.
"Bonne fille," fait William: "quand vous trouverez l'autre,
vous pourrez la garder pour votre peine." Et les deux fr&egrave;res
s'en furent au th&eacute;&acirc;tre, et plus tard aux plus hautes
dignit&eacute;s
de la magistrature. La pauvre Betty a-t-elle jamais compris
le tour? Il se peut: ce n'est point par la d&eacute;licatesse et les
scrupules que se distinguait la client&egrave;le &agrave; laquelle elle
avait
d'habitude affaire.</p>
<p>De fa&ccedil;on g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, pourtant, ce monde avait un
certain
courage personnel.</p>
<p>Le cinqui&egrave;me comte de Berkeley avait dit un jour, devant
t&eacute;moins, qu'il n'y a point de honte &agrave; &ecirc;tre
r&eacute;duit par des
adversaires, quand ceux-ci l'emportent par le nombre, mais
que, pour lui, il ne se rendrait jamais &agrave; un voleur de grand
chemin qui l'attaquerait seul.</p>
<p>En ce temps le brigandage &eacute;tait r&eacute;pandu. Une nuit
qu'il
se rendait de Berkeley &agrave; Londres, sa voiture fut
arr&ecirc;t&eacute;e par un
seigneur de grande route qui, passant sa t&ecirc;te &agrave; la
porti&egrave;re, lui
dit: "N'&ecirc;tes-vous pas Lord Berkeley?"</p>
<p>"Certainement," r&eacute;pliqua celui-ci.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_358"></a>C'est bien vous qui avez
d&eacute;clar&eacute; que vous ne vous
rendriez jamais &agrave; un voleur de grand chemin qui vous
attaquerait seul?"</p>
<p>"Parfaitement."</p>
<p>"Eh bien!"&#8212;et ce disant il braquait un pistolet sur Lord
Berkeley&#8212;"je suis un de ces voleurs, et je suis seul; je vous
demande la bourse ou la vie."</p>
<p>"Chien couard," crie Lord Berkeley, "crois-tu donc me
tromper? Est-ce que je ne vois pas tes complices cach&eacute;s
derri&egrave;re toi?"</p>
<p>Le voleur se retourne, surpris, pour voir ces complices
qu'il ignorait, car il &eacute;tait r&eacute;ellement seul, et dans ce
moment
Lord Berkeley lui br&ucirc;le la cervelle.</p>
<p>Courage, et surtout pr&eacute;sence d'esprit. Cette anecdote a
&eacute;t&eacute; racont&eacute;e &agrave; notre auteur par la propre
fille de Lord
Berkeley.</p>
<p>La religion n'inspirait qu'un m&eacute;diocre respect. La faute
en &eacute;tait en partie &agrave; ses repr&eacute;sentants, en partie
&agrave; l'esprit
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral. Un pur formalisme, une &eacute;tiquette
mondaine, telle
elle &eacute;tait: rien de plus. Le syst&egrave;me &eacute;tait
commode; il est
rest&eacute; tel, d'ailleurs, et non pas seulement en Angleterre.</p>
<p>Le m&eacute;pris des choses religieuses &eacute;tait naturel, et
l'exemple
partait de haut. Un des fr&egrave;res du roi, le duc de Cambridge,
s'&eacute;tait fait une sp&eacute;cialit&eacute; dans
l'irr&eacute;v&eacute;rence, en se cr&eacute;ant pour
lui seul une liturgie, et en r&eacute;pondant personnellement &agrave;
l'officiant.</p>
<p>"Prions," disait ce dernier &agrave; la congr&eacute;gation.</p>
<p>"Certainement," faisait observer le duc; "c'est cela;
prions."</p>
<p>Le clergyman commen&ccedil;a. Sans doute, la saison &eacute;tait
fort s&egrave;che, car il demanda d'abord au ciel d'envoyer de la
pluie. Mais le duc l'interrompit:</p>
<p>"Inutile; rien &agrave; faire pour le moment, le vent est &agrave;
l'Est...."</p>
<p>Le service continua par une lecture de la Bible. "Et
<a name="Page_359"></a>Zacch&eacute;e se leva et dit: Vois, Seigneur,
je donne la moiti&eacute;
de mes biens aux pauvres ..."</p>
<p>"C'est trop, c'est beaucoup trop," interrompit le duc;
"des privil&egrave;ges, si vous voulez, mais pas le reste."</p>
<p>On lit les commandements. Le duc les commente. Il
en est deux qui le g&ecirc;nent:</p>
<p>"C'est tr&egrave;s bien dit; mais il est des cas o&ugrave; c'est
diablement
difficile d'ob&eacute;ir.... Ah! pour celui-l&agrave;, non; c'est
mon fr&egrave;re Ernest qui l'a viol&eacute;; cela ne me regarde pas."</p>
<p>A ce troupeau grossier, et men&eacute; par des pasteurs grossiers,
on chercherait avec peine quelques sentiments &eacute;lev&eacute;s, en
dehors du courage personnel. C'est quelque chose assur&eacute;ment:
mais n'est-il pas infiniment plus d&eacute;shonorant de ne
l'avoir point, qu'il n'est honorable de l'avoir? Il ne semble
pas qu'il y ait tant &agrave; vanter la possession d'un attribut qu'il
serait d&eacute;gradant de ne pas poss&eacute;der: c'est une vertu
n&eacute;gative.
La condition du peuple &eacute;tait pitoyable: entre le <i>status</i>
des
enfants des fabriques et l'esclavage, il &eacute;tait difficile
d'apercevoir
une diff&eacute;rence. A Bedlam, les ali&eacute;n&eacute;s
&eacute;taient encha&icirc;n&eacute;s
&agrave; leurs lits de paille, en 1828, et du samedi au lundi ils
&eacute;taient abandonn&eacute;s &agrave; eux-m&ecirc;mes, avec les
aliments n&eacute;cessaires
&agrave; port&eacute;e, tandis que le ge&ocirc;lier allait s'amuser au
dehors. En
1770, il y avait 160 offenses punies de la peine de mort, et le
nombre s'en &eacute;tait beaucoup accru au commencement de ce
si&egrave;cle. Le vol simple appelait la peine capitale, et pour avoir
vol&eacute; cinq <i>shillings</i> de marchandises dans un magasin,
c'&eacute;tait
la corde. En 1789, on br&ucirc;lait les faux monnayeurs.
C'&eacute;taient du reste des r&eacute;jouissances, que les
ex&eacute;cutions, et
pour inculquer &agrave; la jeunesse des sentiments moraux, on
conduisait
des &eacute;coles enti&egrave;res au spectacle. Ceci se passait encore
en 1820. Sur le chapitre des dettes, la loi &eacute;tait f&eacute;roce.
Une femme est morte dans la prison d'Exeter apr&egrave;s quarante
cinq ans d'incarc&eacute;ration, cette derni&egrave;re motiv&eacute;e
par le fait
qu'elle ne pouvait acquitter une dette de moins de 500 francs...
Aussi les malheureux qui avaient perdu leur avoir, ou
<a name="Page_360"></a>qui ne pouvaient faire face &agrave; leurs
engagements, &eacute;taient-ils,
pour ainsi dire, jet&eacute;s dans les bras du crime. Plut&ocirc;t que
d'aller moisir dans les cachots, ils prenaient la fuite, et comme
il faut manger, ils demandaient le n&eacute;cessaire &agrave; la
soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Ils
le demandaient de fa&ccedil;ons vari&eacute;es: l'une des plus
r&eacute;pandues,
et qui est relativement honorable, consistait &agrave; se faire brigand
de grand chemin. Nombre de vaincus de la vie embrass&egrave;rent
cette carri&egrave;re o&ugrave; l'on put voir des gentlemen
ruin&eacute;s et
jusqu'&agrave; un pr&eacute;lat, l'&eacute;v&ecirc;que de Raphoe. Ils
avaient beaucoup
d'audace, pillant les voitures des invit&eacute;s &agrave; peu de
distance
du palais.</p>
<p>Voil&agrave; pour le pass&eacute;.</p>
<p>C'est par le mouvement religieux, issu d'Oxford il y a
bient&ocirc;t soixante-dix ans, que la transformation fut
op&eacute;r&eacute;e.
Par le mouvement religieux, qui fut admirable, et aussi par le
mouvement politique o&ugrave; la R&eacute;volution et la France
jou&egrave;rent
un r&ocirc;le pr&eacute;pond&eacute;rant. Ces deux facteurs ont
puissamment
contribu&eacute; &agrave; remodeler l'Angleterre.</p>
<p>La passion politique &eacute;tait vive: et pendant un temps, tout
l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t se concentra sur ce qui se passait en France.
Tous
les esprits qui avaient &agrave; coeur la libert&eacute; civile et la
libert&eacute;
religieuse, tous ceux que l'imp&eacute;ritie et la suffisance de la
classe
aristocratique d&eacute;go&ucirc;taient, tous ceux qui voyaient avec
m&eacute;pris
ce que l'Eglise avait pu faire de la religion, avaient embrass&eacute;
la cause de la France r&eacute;volutionnaire. Fox, &agrave; la prise de
la
Bastille, s'exclamait: "C'est le plus grand &eacute;v&eacute;nement qui
se
soit pass&eacute; au monde, et c'en est le meilleur." Il croyait que
tout serait fini avec le d&eacute;mant&egrave;lement de la vieille
forteresse
symbolique et ne pr&eacute;voyait pas qu'elle pouvait &ecirc;tre
sit&ocirc;t
reconstitu&eacute;e: l'id&eacute;e que le peuple serait assez
b&ecirc;te pour se
forger, b&eacute;n&eacute;volement, des cha&icirc;nes pour s'entraver
lui-m&ecirc;me
ne lui &eacute;tait point apparue. Par contre, Burke &eacute;tait
pessimiste.
Il ne voyait l&agrave; que "la vieille f&eacute;rocit&eacute;
parisienne," et se
demandait si, apr&egrave;s tout, ce peuple n'est pas impropre &agrave;
la
libert&eacute;, et s'il n'a pas besoin d'une main vigoureuse pour le
<a name="Page_361"></a>contenir. Il &eacute;tait pessimiste et
autoritaire: aussi eut-il beaucoup
d'adh&eacute;rents; et Pitt bient&ocirc;t se joignit &agrave; lui, au
moins
dans la haine des r&eacute;volutionnaires. Son humiliation fut une
joie profonde pour les whigs qui suivaient Fox: et il est
int&eacute;ressant de voir que, pour beaucoup, la d&eacute;faite de
Pitt
comptait plus que celle de Napol&eacute;on. Il y avait des whigs
jusque dans la famille royale, et ils &eacute;taient pleins d'ardeur.
Au reste la cause &eacute;tait belle: c'&eacute;tait celle de la
libert&eacute; contre
l'autorit&eacute;. "Nos adversaires," s'&eacute;criait Lord John
Russell,
"nous cassent le tympan avec le cri: 'Le roi et l'Eglise.'
Savez-vous ce qu'ils entendent par l&agrave;? C'est une Eglise sans
&eacute;vangile et un roi qui se met au-dessus de la loi."
Oxford&#8212;cl&eacute;rical
et litt&eacute;raire&#8212;&eacute;tait tory; Cambridge, scientifique, qui
avait eu Newton et attendait Darwin, &eacute;tait whig. Il est bon
que la politique inspire de telles passions: car, au total, c'est
la lutte entre les principes fondamentaux, et l'enjeu est de
nature telle que nul n'a le droit de se d&eacute;sint&eacute;resser de
la
partie. Car l'enjeu ce sont les hommes m&ecirc;mes, leurs
privil&egrave;ges et leurs droits, et s'ils se
d&eacute;sint&eacute;ressent, ils n'ont
que ce qu'ils m&eacute;ritent le jour o&ugrave; la force s'appesantit
sur eux
brutalement.</p>
<p>A n'entendre parler que de politique, les enfants m&ecirc;mes
se troublaient "Maman," demandait la fille d'un whig
&eacute;minent; "les tories naissent-ils m&eacute;chants, ou bien le
deviennent-ils?" "Ils naissent m&eacute;chants," r&eacute;pliqua la
m&egrave;re,
"et deviennent pires....' Une vieille fille excentrique,
que l'auteur a connue, ne consentait &agrave; monter dans une
voiture de louage qu'apr&egrave;s avoir demand&eacute; au cocher s'il
n'avait point transport&eacute; de malades atteints d'une maladie
infectieuse, s'il n'&eacute;tait pas puseyite, et enfin s'il
adh&eacute;rait au
programme whig.</p>
<p>"La passion aveugle," dit Topffer: elle aveuglait sur la
moralit&eacute; des proc&eacute;d&eacute;s. Pitt, en visite chez une
femme qui
occupait un rang &eacute;lev&eacute; dans le monde whig, au moment
d'une &eacute;lection, dit &agrave; son interlocutrice: "Eh bien! vous
<a name="Page_362"></a>savez, nous l'emporterons. Dix mille
guin&eacute;es partiront
demain par un homme de confiance pour le Yorkshire, et
c'est pour notre usage qu'elles partent." "Du diable s'il en
est ainsi," r&eacute;plique la dame. Et la nuit m&ecirc;me le porteur
&eacute;tait arr&ecirc;t&eacute;, et son pr&eacute;cieux fardeau allait
grossir les poches
des &eacute;lecteurs qui vot&egrave;rent pour le candidat whig et en
assur&egrave;rent la nomination.</p>
<p>C'est au cours de ces luttes politiques, pleines de feu et
glorieuses, qui marqu&egrave;rent principalement le d&eacute;but de ce
si&egrave;cle, et firent tant de bien &agrave; la nation, que les
barri&egrave;res
entre les castes commenc&egrave;rent &agrave; s'abaisser.
Jusque-l&agrave;, il
n'y avait point de rapports entre l'aristocratie et la classe
moyenne, en dehors des cas, encore rares, o&ugrave; la premi&egrave;re
patronnait l'aristocratie intellectuelle. (Voyez <i>La Vie de
Johnson</i> par Boswell, par exemple.)</p>
<p>Les choses allaient &agrave; ce point que Wilberforce refusa la
pairie pour ne point retirer &agrave; ses fils le privil&egrave;ge de
fr&eacute;quenter
chez les <i>gentlemen</i>, les familles du commerce, etc. A
l'&eacute;cole
&#8212;et c'est lord Bathurst qui a racont&eacute; ceci &agrave; l'auteur&#8212;les
fils de nobles &eacute;taient assis sur un banc &agrave; part, loin du
contact avec les roturiers. Il fallait garder la tradition.
C'est ce que faisait le marquis d'Abercorn, qui mourut en
1818. Il n'allait jamais &agrave; la chasse sans arborer sa
d&eacute;coration&#8212;
son <i>Blue Ribbon</i>&#8212;et exigeait que pour faire son lit les
femmes de chambre eussent les mains gant&eacute;es, et de gants de
peau, pas de fil.... Avant d'&eacute;pouser sa cousine Hamilton,
il la fit anoblir par le r&eacute;gent, pour ne pas se marier
au-dessous
de sa condition. Et quand il apprit qu'elle le voulait planter
l&agrave; pour suivre un amant, il la pria de prendre le carrosse de
famille afin qu'il ne f&ucirc;t pas dit que Lady Abercorn avait
quitt&eacute; le domicile conjugal dans une voiture de louage. A
ses yeux cette "voiture de louage" jetait &eacute;videmment un
grand discr&eacute;dit sur les operations. On a de la race ou l'on
n'en a pas.</p>
<p>Nous avons dit plus haut que M. G.W.E. Russell avait
<a name="Page_363"></a>connu beaucoup d'hommes marquants de ce
si&egrave;cle, et avait
eu avec eux des relations personnelles. Il en fut de toutes
sortes; leurs opinions religieuses et politiques &eacute;taient souvent
tr&egrave;s oppos&eacute;es, mais tous &eacute;taient au nombre des,
notabilit&eacute;s du
jour. Sur chacun d'eux, notre auteur donne son impression
personnelle, et rappelle des souvenirs personnels ou des
anecdotes int&eacute;ressantes. Nous ne pouvons les passer tous
en revue: mais on en peut citer quelques-uns.</p>
<p>Sir Moses Montefiore ne fut pas le plus c&eacute;l&egrave;bre: mais
il
avait une sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;. N&eacute; en 1784, il mourut en
1885, ayant
&eacute;t&eacute; toute sa vie un objet d'horreur pour les <i>teetotallers</i>;
car
de quel oeil en v&eacute;rit&eacute; pouvaient-ils consid&eacute;rer un
homme qui
buvait chaque jour une bouteille de porto, et &agrave; qui la
Providence
permettait de se bien porter? C'&eacute;tait ind&eacute;cent...</p>
<p>Une physionomie plus curieuse &eacute;tait celle de Lord Russell,
plein d'anecdotes, spirituel, souvent froid en apparence, &agrave;
l'occasion &eacute;loquent. A une dame qui demandait la permission
de lui d&eacute;dier un livre, il r&eacute;pliquait qu'&agrave; son
grand regret
il se voyait oblig&eacute; de refuser: "parce que, comme chancelier
de l'Universit&eacute; d'Oxford, il avait &eacute;t&eacute; tr&egrave;s
expos&eacute; aux
auteurs."</p>
<p>Pour un chef politique, il avait un grave d&eacute;faut. Sa
m&eacute;moire des visages &eacute;tait tr&egrave;s faible. Il se
rencontra une fois
en Ecosse chez un ami commun avec le jeune Lord D....,
depuis comte de S.... Le jeune homme lui plut par sa
personne et par ses opinions <i>whig</i>. Quand vint l'heure de la
s&eacute;paration, Lord John dit &agrave; Lord D.... tout le plaisir
qu'il avait eu &agrave; faire sa connaissance, et ajouta: "Maintenant
il faut que vous veniez me donner votre appui &agrave; la Chambre
des communes." "Mais je ne fais pas autre chose depuis dix
ans," r&eacute;pondit le jeune politicien. Son chef ne l'avait pas
reconnu. Avec cela des distractions qui auraient pu le
faire croire d&eacute;nu&eacute; d'&eacute;ducation alors qu'il
n'&eacute;tait que d&eacute;nu&eacute;
d'artifice.</p>
<p>Etant assis un soir &agrave; un concert &agrave; Buckingham Palace,
<a name="Page_364"></a>aux c&ocirc;t&eacute;s de la duchesse de
Sutherland, il se leva tout &agrave;
coup, et s'en fut au fond de la pi&egrave;ce, o&ugrave; il s'assit
aupr&egrave;s de la
duchesse d'Inverness. La chose fut remarqu&eacute;e, et l'on
soup&ccedil;onna quelque querelle, aussi fut-il interrog&eacute; par un
ami
sur la cause de son attitude, et il r&eacute;pondit en toute
sinc&eacute;rit&eacute;:
"Je ne pouvais rester plus longtemps aupr&egrave;s d'un feu aussi
vif: je me serais &eacute;vanoui." "Ah! tr&egrave;s bien: la raison est
bonne en effet, mais au moins avez-vous dit &agrave; la duchesse
de Sutherland la raison de votre changement de place?"
"Tiens, non, je ne crois pas le lui avoir dit: mais j'ai dit
&agrave; la duchesse d'Inverness pourquoi je venais m'asseoir
pr&egrave;s
d'elle."</p>
<p>Il n'&eacute;tait pas diplomate&#8212;comme on le peut voir&#8212;mais il
avait de l'esprit, et sa conversation &eacute;tait pleine d'anecdotes
curieuses. Il avait convers&eacute; avec Napol&eacute;on &agrave;
l'&icirc;le d'Elbe.
Celui-ci l'avait pris par l'oreille, et lui avait demand&eacute; ce
qu'en
Angleterre on pensait des chances qu'il pouvait avoir de
remonter sur le tr&ocirc;ne de France. "Sire," r&eacute;pondit Russell,
"les Anglais consid&egrave;rent vos chances comme nulles." "Alors
vous pouvez leur dire de ma part qu'ils se trompent."</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p>Autre physionomie int&eacute;ressante, celle de Lord Shaftesbury,
un beau type d'aristocrate, au physique comme au moral,
tr&egrave;s sensible et compatissant, un philanthrope bon et loyal,
anti-esclavagiste militant. "Pauvres enfants," disait-il en
&eacute;coutant le r&eacute;cit d'un inspecteur d'&eacute;cole
d'enfants assist&eacute;s.
"Que pouvons-nous faire pour eux?" "Notre Dieu subviendra
&agrave; tous leurs besoins," dit l'inspecteur, en servant le
clich&eacute; habituel. "Oui, sans doute, mais il faut qu'ils aient
&agrave;
manger tout de suite," dit Shaftesbury, et sur l'heure il rentre
chez lui, et exp&eacute;die 400 rations de soupe. Le quiproquo
d'un journaliste am&eacute;ricain l'amusa fort. Devenu Lord
Shaftesbury apr&egrave;s avoir longtemps port&eacute; le nom de Lord
Ashley, il signa une lettre sur l'&eacute;mancipation des esclaves des
Etats-Unis du Sud. "O&ugrave; &eacute;tait-il donc, ce lord
Shaftesbury,"
<a name="Page_365"></a>demandait le journaliste, "pendant que ce noble
coeur, Lord
Ashley, seul et sans appui, se faisait le champion des esclaves
anglais dans les manufactures du Lancashire et du Yorkshire?"
C'&eacute;tait un type admirable de grand seigneur, et de
grand coeur, et l'on comprend ce que lui disait Beaconsfield,
avec un peu d'emphase, une fois qu'il prenait cong&eacute;,
apr&egrave;s lui
avoir rendu visite dans son ch&acirc;teau: "Adieu, mon cher
lord. Vous m'avez donn&eacute; le privil&egrave;ge de contempler l'un
des plus impressionnants des spectacles; de voir un grand
noble anglais vivant &agrave; l'&eacute;tat patriarcal dans son domaine
h&eacute;r&eacute;ditaire."</p>
<p>Puis c'est Lord Houghton, qui avait de l'esprit et de la
psychologie. Il venait de gagner une livre a un jeune homme
de ressources tr&egrave;s modestes, au cours d'une partie de whist, et
comme il empochait la pi&egrave;ce: "Ah! mon cher enfant,"
dit-il, "le <i>grand</i> Lord Hertford, que les sots appellent le
<i>m&eacute;chant</i> Lord Hertford, avait accoutum&eacute; de dire: Il
n'y a pas
de plaisir &agrave; gagner de l'argent &agrave; un homme qui ne sent
point
sa perte. Comme c'est vrai!"</p>
<p>Et apercevant un jeune ami, au club, qui faisait un souper
de p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras et de Champagne, il lui fit un regard
d'encouragement: "Voil&agrave; qui est bien, mon ami: toutes les
choses agr&eacute;ables de la vie sont malsaines, ou co&ucirc;teuses,
ou
illicites." C'est un peu la philosophie du <i>Pudd'n-head
Wilson</i> de Mark Twain, qui d&eacute;clare que, pour bien faire dans
la vie, il faut se priver de tout ce que l'on aime, et faire tout
ce que l'on n'aime point.</p>
<p>Notre auteur n'a point connu Wellington, mais des anecdotes
lui ont &eacute;t&eacute; fournies &agrave; son &eacute;gard, de
premi&egrave;re main.</p>
<p>C'&eacute;tait lors du couronnement de la reine Victoria. Celle-ci
voulait aller au palais de Saint-James, n'ayant dans son
carrosse que la duchesse de Kent et une dame d'honneur;
mais Lord Albemarle, <i>master of the Horse</i>, exposa qu'il avait
le droit de faire le trajet avec la reine, dans la m&ecirc;me voiture,
<a name="Page_366"></a>comme il l'avait fait avec Guillaume IV. De
l&agrave;, discussion.
L'affaire fut soumise au duc de Wellington, consid&eacute;r&eacute;
comme
une sorte d'arbitre en choses de la cour. Sa r&eacute;ponse fut
pr&eacute;cise et peu satisfaisante. "La reine seule a droit de
d&eacute;cider," dit-il: "elle peut vous faire aller dans la voiture ou
hors de la voiture, ou courir derri&egrave;re comme un s... chien
de raccommodeur."</p>
<p>A un autre moment le gouvernement m&eacute;ditait une
exp&eacute;dition
en Birmanie pour la prise de Rangoon, et l'on se
demandait &agrave; quel g&eacute;n&eacute;ral la t&acirc;che serait
confi&eacute;e. Le cabinet
consulta Wellington. Celui-ci r&eacute;pliqua aussit&ocirc;t: 'Envoyez
Lord Combermere.'</p>
<p>"Mais nous avons toujours compris que Votre Seigneurie
consid&eacute;rait Lord Combermere comme un imb&eacute;cile...."
"Assur&eacute;ment, c'est un imb&eacute;cile," r&eacute;pliqua
Wellington, "c'est
un s... imb&eacute;cile, mais il peut bien prendre Rangoon."</p>
<p>Autre trait de la m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode, et qui se rapporte
&agrave; Lord
Melbourne.</p>
<p>La reine Victoria venait de se fiancer, et elle voulait que le
prince Albert f&ucirc;t fait roi consort, par acte du Parlement.
Elle parla de ceci &agrave; Lord Melbourne, le premier ministre.
Celui-ci commen&ccedil;a par &eacute;viter la discussion, mais comme
Sa Majest&eacute; insistait pour obtenir un avis cat&eacute;gorique:
"Pour
l'amour de Dieu, Madame, ne parlons plus de ceci. Car, une
fois que vous aurez donn&eacute; &agrave; la nation anglaise le moyen
de
faire des rois, vous lui aurez aussi donn&eacute; le moyen de les
d&eacute;faire."</p>
<p>Il avait de la philosophie, Lord Melbourne.... C'est lui
qui disait que l'intelligence n'est pas toujours indispensable:
le grand avantage du c&eacute;l&egrave;bre ordre de la
Jarreti&egrave;re, ajoutait-il,
c'est qu'au moins "il n'y a pas, dans toute cette b&ecirc;te
d'histoire,
de <i>m&eacute;rite</i> &agrave; l'avoir." Lord Melbourne avait la
bosse de
l'esprit pratique, en m&ecirc;me temps que la philosophie.</p>
<p>Pour les personnalit&eacute;s plus modernes, notre auteur insiste
<a name="Page_367"></a>assez longuement sur Disraeli, <i>alias</i>
Dizzy, <i>alias</i> encore Lord
Beaconsfield. C'&eacute;tait un homme ing&eacute;nieux.</p>
<p>"On m'accuse d'&ecirc;tre un flatteur," disait-il &agrave; Matthew
Arnold. "Cela est vrai, je suis un flatteur. Il est utile de
l'&ecirc;tre. Chacun aime la flatterie, et, si vous approchez les
rois, il faut l'empiler avec une truelle...." "Mon secret,
c'est de ne jamais contredire et de ne jamais nier; j'oublie
quelquefois...."</p>
<p>Il savait &ecirc;tre aimable quand il le fallait, et voici son
proc&eacute;d&eacute; pour se faire bien venir des personnes qu'il ne
reconnaissait
pas, mais qui le connaissaient, &agrave; en juger par leur
mani&egrave;re de venir &agrave; lui: "Eh bien!" disait-il sur un ton
d'affectueuse sollicitude, "et le vieil ennemi, que fait-il?"
(<i>How is the old complaint?</i> Comment va l'indisposition
accoutum&eacute;e?) Cela tombait rarement &agrave; faux; et cela
faisait
toujours plaisir.</p>
<p>Bismarck, qui s'y connaissait, avait une haute opinion de
Disraeli, "Salisbury est sans importance," disait-il durant le
congr&egrave;s de Berlin: "ce n'est qu'une baguette peinte pour
ressembler &agrave; du fer. Mais ce vieux juif&#8212;Disraeli&#8212;s'entend
aux affaires."</p>
<p>Un amusant &eacute;pisode se rapporte au m&ecirc;me congr&egrave;s,
et au
m&ecirc;me "vieux juif."</p>
<p>Lord Beaconsfield arriva &agrave; Berlin la veille de l'ouverture,
et l'ambassade anglaise le re&ccedil;ut avec beaucoup d'apparat. Dans
le courant de la soir&eacute;e un des secr&eacute;taires vint trouver
Lord
Odo Russell qui &eacute;tait l'ambassadeur en ce moment et lui dit:</p>
<p>"Nous sommes dans un terrible embarras. Vous seul
pouvez nous en tirer. Le vieux chef a r&eacute;solu d'ouvrir le
congr&egrave;s avec un discours en fran&ccedil;ais.... Il a
r&eacute;dig&eacute; une
longue oraison, en fran&ccedil;ais, et il l'a apprise par coeur. Il
ouvrira les &eacute;cluses demain. L'Europe enti&egrave;re va se moquer
de nous: sa prononciation est ex&eacute;crable. Nous perdrions
nos places &agrave; vouloir le lui dire: voulez-vous nous tirer
d'affaire?"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_368"></a>La mission est d&eacute;licate," fit Lord
Odo: "mais j'aime
les missions d&eacute;licates. Je vais voir ce que je puis faire."</p>
<p>Il alla rejoindre Dizzy dans la chambre &agrave; coucher
d'honneur de l'ambassade.</p>
<p>"Mon cher lord," dit-il, "une terrible rumeur est arriv&eacute;e
jusqu'&agrave; mes oreilles."</p>
<p>"Vraiment, qu'est-ce donc?"</p>
<p>"On nous dit que vous avez l'intention d'ouvrir demain
les travaux du congr&egrave;s en fran&ccedil;ais."</p>
<p>"Eh bien! et apr&egrave;s?"</p>
<p>"Ce qu'il y a, c'est que nous savons tous que nul en
Europe n'est mieux en &eacute;tat de ce faire. Mais, &agrave; tout
prendre,
faire un discours en fran&ccedil;ais est un tour de force banal.
Il y aura au congr&egrave;s au moins une demi-douzaine d'hommes
qui pourraient en faire autant, presque aussi bien. Mais,
d'un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, qui donc, hormis vous, pourrait prononcer
un discours en anglais? Tous ces pl&eacute;nipotentiaires sont
venus des diff&eacute;rentes cours d'Europe dans l'expectative du
plus grand r&eacute;gal intellectuel de leur existence: entendre parler
en anglais par le ma&icirc;tre le plus &eacute;minent de la langue. La
question est de savoir si vous les voulez d&eacute;sappointer?..."</p>
<p>Dizzy &eacute;couta avec attention, mit son monocle,
consid&eacute;ra
Lord Odo, et dit enfin:</p>
<p>"Il y a un argument s&eacute;rieux dans ce que vous me dites
l&agrave;. Je vais y r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir."</p>
<p>Et il y r&eacute;fl&eacute;chit si bien que le lendemain il ouvrait
le
congr&egrave;s en langue anglaise. Avait-il r&eacute;ellement
aval&eacute; la
flatterie, ou bien avait-il compris&#8212;f&ucirc;t-ce vaguement&#8212;son
inf&eacute;riorit&eacute; en fran&ccedil;ais? On ne sait; mais un
flatteur tel
que lui devait avoir quelque m&eacute;fiance; et la seconde
hypoth&egrave;se est sans doute la plus exacte.</p>
<p>Autre anecdote. Il d&icirc;nait un jour &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute;
de la princesse
de Galles, et se blessa le doigt en voulant couper du pain trop
dur. La princesse, pleine de gr&acirc;ce, entoura le doigt de son
propre mouchoir. Et Dizzy, avec &agrave;-propos, de s'exclamer:</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_369"></a>Je leur ai demand&eacute; du pain, et c'est
une pierre qu'ils
m'ont donn&eacute;e.... Mais j'ai eu une princesse pour panser
mes plaies."</p>
<p>Sa mort fut longue et douloureuse. Pendant six semaines
elle approcha et s'&eacute;loigna tour &agrave; tour. Un ami&#8212;ce nom
est-il bien en situation&#8212;trouva le courage de dire &agrave; ce
propos: "Ah! le voil&agrave; bien; il exag&egrave;re: il a toujours
exag&eacute;r&eacute;."</p>
<p>Sur Gladstone, Newman et beaucoup d'autres, il faut
passer rapidement. Manning a toutefois laiss&eacute; une grande
impression &agrave; l'auteur, par sa prestance et sa dignit&eacute;. Il
&eacute;tait
malicieux aussi.</p>
<p>Peu apr&egrave;s la mort de Newman, un article n&eacute;crologique
parut dans une revue, qui &eacute;tait piquant et m&ecirc;me
m&eacute;chant.
Manning fut interrog&eacute; &agrave; ce propos; il d&eacute;clara
qu'il plaignait
l'auteur de l'avoir &eacute;crit, que celui-ci devait avoir un fort
mauvais esprit, etc., mais, ajouta-t-il: "Si vous demandez si
c'est bien l&agrave; Newman, je suis bien oblig&eacute; de vous le
dire;
c'est une vraie photographie."</p>
<p>On peut du reste ouvrir <i>Collections and Recollections</i> au
hasard; &agrave; toute page c'est un trait curieux et spirituel qui
se montre. J'en cite quelques-uns, "tout venant," comme
disent les carriers. Les deux premiers rapportent &agrave; Henry
Smith, un Irlandais des plus spirituels, qui fut professeur
de g&eacute;om&eacute;trie &agrave; Oxford. Un homme politique
&eacute;minent, qui
est actuellement un des premiers jurisconsultes de son pays,
et dont le principal d&eacute;faut est une suffisance
exag&eacute;r&eacute;e, se pr&eacute;sentait
aux &eacute;lections en 1880, comme candidat lib&eacute;ral. Pour
le discr&eacute;diter, ses adversaires politiques le
repr&eacute;sent&egrave;rent aux
&eacute;lections comme ath&eacute;e; c'&eacute;tait une manoeuvre.
Apprenant
cette accusation, Henry Smith s'&eacute;cria, avec une indignation
feinte:</p>
<p>"Tout cela est faux. Il n'est nullement un ath&eacute;e. Il
<a name="Page_370"></a>croit le plus fermement du monde &agrave;
l'existence d'un &ecirc;tre
sup&eacute;rieur "&#8212;sans ajouter que l'&ecirc;tre sup&eacute;rieur, en
qui X----
croyait, &eacute;tait X---- lui-m&ecirc;me.</p>
<p>"Que vaut-il le mieux &ecirc;tre, &eacute;v&ecirc;que ou juge?"
"Oh!"
fait Henry Smith, "&eacute;v&ecirc;que. Car le juge, au plus, peut
dire:
'Allez vous faire pendre;' mais l'&eacute;v&ecirc;que peut vous
damner."
"Oui," dit le ma&icirc;tre de Balliol, "mais si le juge dit: 'Allez
vous faire pendre,' vous &ecirc;tes effectivement pendu." Ici Smith
avait le dessous.</p>
<p>Une jolie anecdote dont Napol&eacute;on III. <i>n'est pas</i> le
h&eacute;ros:</p>
<p>Napol&eacute;on III., alors qu'il n'&eacute;tait que
pr&eacute;tendant, et plus
riche d'esp&eacute;rances que de monnaie ayant cours l&eacute;gal,
fr&eacute;quentait
beaucoup, &agrave; Londres, chez Lady Blessington,
maison plus clinquante que solide. Apr&egrave;s le coup d'Etat,
la dame vint &agrave; Paris faire un petit voyage, et elle s'attendait
&agrave; ce que ses politesses lui fussent rendues. Aucune invitation
ne venait, l'empereur oubliait les bienfaits re&ccedil;us par le
prince. A la fin, pourtant, Lady Blessington r&eacute;ussit &agrave; le
rencontrer au cours d'une r&eacute;ception quelconque. Il ne put
&eacute;viter de la voir et l'interpella: "Ah! milady Blessington,
restez-vous longtemps &agrave; Paris?" "Et vous, Sire?" repliqua-t-elle.</p>
<p>Revenons un peu en arri&egrave;re et voici une autre jolie ironie.</p>
<p>Au coll&egrave;ge d'Oriel, un soir, un des compagnons de Charles
Marriott, qui joua un si grand r&ocirc;le dans le <i>Tractarian
Movement</i>,
s'oublia, et se conduisit de fa&ccedil;on d&eacute;plac&eacute;e. Le
lendemain,
rencontrant Marriott, il essaya de s'excuser. "Mon
cher ami, je crois bien que j'ai quelque peu fait la b&ecirc;te hier
au soir." "Comment donc, cher camarade?" repliqua
Marriott. "Je ne me suis pas aper&ccedil;u que vous fussiez autrement
qu'&agrave; l'ordinaire."</p>
<p>Le tact n'est pas donn&eacute; &agrave; tous; et pour en avoir, il
ne
suffit pas d'occuper une haute situation.</p>
<p><a name="Page_371"></a>Il y a &agrave; Windsor, au bout d'une des
promenades du
ch&acirc;teau, une statue &eacute;questre que le peuple a
d&eacute;nomm&eacute;e le
Cheval de cuivre. Un grand de distinction, mais assez
pauvre en culture historique, &eacute;tait l'h&ocirc;te de la Reine, et
une apr&egrave;s-midi il fit une promenade. A d&icirc;ner la Reine
s'informa de ce qu'il avait fait, demandant s'il n'&eacute;tait point
fatigu&eacute;.</p>
<p>"Du tout, Madame, merci; j'ai trouv&eacute; une voiture qui
m'a ramen&eacute; jusqu'au Cheval de cuivre."</p>
<p>"Jusqu'o&ugrave;?" dit la Reine avec effarement</p>
<p>"Jusqu'au Cheval de cuivre, vous savez bien, au bout de
Long Walk."</p>
<p>"Mais ce n'est pas un cheval de cuivre: c'est mon grand-p&egrave;re."</p>
<p>"Avez-vous lu les <i>Greville Memoirs</i>?" demandait quelqu'un
&agrave; Disraeli. "Non," repliqua-t-il. "Ils ne m'attirent
pas. Il me souvient de l'auteur, et c'&eacute;tait la personne la
plus vaniteuse avec qui je sois jamais entr&eacute; en contact,
encore que j'aie lu Cic&eacute;ron et connu Bulwer Lytton." D'une
pierre trois coups; et ils sont bons. Voulez-vous de la
malice f&eacute;minine?</p>
<p>"Que Lady Jersey est donc belle!" s'exclamait un admirateur
fervent, devant Lady Morley, sa rivale en beaut&eacute;.
"Dans sa toilette de deuil, en noir et avec ses diamants, elle
semble personnifier la nuit." "Oui, mon cher," fit Lady
Morley, "mais minuit pass&eacute;."</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p>Le chapitre des mots d'enfants est fort &eacute;tendu. J'en
cueille quelques-uns au hasard:</p>
<p>Voici un trait d'Alexandre de Battenberg, alors qu'il &eacute;tait
tout jeune encore. Manquant d'argent de poche, il imagina
d'&eacute;crire &agrave; son auguste grand'm&egrave;re, la reine et
imp&eacute;ratrice
Victoria, pour en demander. Elle lui r&eacute;pondit une admonestation,
et en l'engageant &agrave; &ecirc;tre d&eacute;sormais plus
&eacute;conome, de
fa&ccedil;on &agrave; ne pas se trouver d&eacute;pourvu &agrave; la fin
du mois. Tr&egrave;s
<a name="Page_372"></a>bien. Quelque jours apr&egrave;s, elle
re&ccedil;ut un second billet de
son petit-fils.</p>
<p>"Ch&egrave;re grand'm&egrave;re," disait le tr&egrave;s pratique
personnage,
"je suis certain que vous apprendrez avec plaisir que je n'ai
pas besoin de vous ennuyer pour de l'argent en ce moment,
car j'ai vendu votre derni&egrave;re lettre pour 30 shillings &agrave;
un de
mes camarades d'ici!..."</p>
<p>Un enfant&#8212;qui depuis a &eacute;t&eacute; repr&eacute;sentant de
Manchester
au Parlement&#8212;avait dans sa famille une servante qu'il jugeait
&ecirc;tre fort vieille. Il e&ucirc;t voulu savoir son &acirc;ge, mais
il n'osait
le lui demander, sachant que c'est l&agrave; une question qu'on ne
pose pas. Il fallait ruser. Enfin, un jour, il trouva le biais
requis. Il venait de lire que l'alo&egrave;s ne fleurit qu'une fois
tous les cent ans&#8212;ce qui est une erreur d'ailleurs&#8212;et il y
avait des alo&egrave;s dans la serre. Abordant la servante d'un air
c&acirc;lin: "Avez-vous souvent vu fleurir l'alo&egrave;s?"</p>
<p>Une &eacute;l&eacute;gante forme de politesse. C'est aux Indes, et
un
Indien rend compte au gouverneur d'une partie de chasse
qui a &eacute;t&eacute; organis&eacute;e en l'honneur d'un jeune lord
de passage.
"Eh bien?" fait le gouverneur. "Oh!" dit l'Indien, "le
jeune Sahib a tir&eacute; divinement; mais Dieu a &eacute;t&eacute;
tr&egrave;s mis&eacute;ricordieux
pour les petits oiseaux."</p>
<p>Comme cela est finement dit! Je n'en dirai pas autant de
quelques exemples de rh&eacute;torique religieuse.</p>
<p>C'est une m&eacute;taphore cueillie dans le sermon d'un clergyman:
"Et si quelque &eacute;tincelle de gr&acirc;ce a pu &ecirc;tre
allum&eacute;e
par cet exercice, veuille, &ocirc; Dieu, l'arroser."</p>
<p>Et que dites-vous de cette pri&egrave;re prononc&eacute;e devant la
reine
Victoria par un pr&eacute;dicateur de petite ville? "Elle," c'est la
souveraine: "accorde, &ocirc; Dieu! qu'en devenant plus
&acirc;g&eacute;e
elle soit faite un homme nouveau, et que dans toutes les
causes de justice elle marche en avant de son peuple comme
un b&eacute;lier dans les montagnes."</p>
<p>Que de m&eacute;tamorphoses, grand Dieu!</p>
<p><a name="Page_373"></a>Et enfin, pour ne pas sortir de la
th&eacute;ologie. C'est aux
examens de l'Universit&eacute;.</p>
<p>"Qu'est-ce que la foi?</p>
<p>"C'est cette facult&eacute; par laquelle nous pouvons croire ce
que nous savons n'&ecirc;tre pas vrai."</p>
<p>Et j'en passe, et des meilleures, et en grand nombre.
Lisez <i>Collections and Recollections</i> l'occupation est amusante
et instructive, et une excellente table des noms vous permettra
de savoir tout de suite s'il est parl&eacute; de tel ou toi personnage
et de retrouver les anecdotes qui le concernent.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
