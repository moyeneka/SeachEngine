     A lively and amusing collection of letters on western living
     written by Kong Ho, a Chinese gentleman. These addressed to
     his homeland, refer to the Westerners in London as
     barbarians and many of the aids to life in our society give
     Kong Ho endless food for thought. These are things such as
     the motor car and the piano; unknown in China at this time.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      ESTIMABLE BARBARIAN,&mdash;Your opportune suggestion that I should permit
      the letters, wherein I have described with undeviating fidelity the
      customs and manner of behaving of your accomplished race, to be set forth
      in the form of printed leaves for all to behold, is doubtless
      gracefully-intentioned, and this person will raise no barrier of dissent
      against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this he is inspired by the benevolent hope that his immature
      compositions may to one extent become a model and a by-word to those who
      in turn visit his own land of Fragrant Purity; for with exacting care he
      has set down no detail that has not come under his direct observation
      (although it is not to be denied that here or there he may, perchance,
      have misunderstood an involved allusion or failed to grasp the inner
      significance of an act), so that Impartiality necessarily sways his brush,
      and Truth lurks within his inkpot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an entirely contrary manner some, who of recent years have gratified us
      with their magnanimous presence, have returned to their own countries not
      only with the internal fittings of many of our palaces (which, being for
      the most part of a replaceable nature, need be only trivially referred to,
      the incident, indeed, being generally regarded as a most cordial and
      pressing variety of foreign politeness), but also&mdash;in the lack of
      highly-spiced actuality&mdash;with subtly-imagined and truly objectionable
      instances. These calumnies they have not hesitated to commit to the form
      of printed books, which, falling into the hands of the ignorant and
      undiscriminating, may even suggest to their ill-balanced minds a doubt
      whether we of the Celestial Empire really are the wisest, bravest, purest,
      and most enlightened people in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a parting, it only remains to be said that, in order to maintain
      unimpaired the quaint-sounding brevity and archaic construction of your
      prepossessing language, I have engraved most of the remarks upon the
      receptive tablets of my mind as they were uttered. To one who can repeat
      the Five Classics without stumbling this is a contemptible achievement.
      Let it be an imposed obligation, therefore, that you retain these portions
      unchanged as a test and a proof to all who may read. Of my own deficient
      words, I can only in truest courtesy maintain that any alteration must of
      necessity make them less offensively commonplace than at present they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sign and immutable Thumb-mark of, Kong Ho

      LETTER I
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the journey. The unlawful demons invoked by
 certain of the barbarians; their power and the manner of
 their suppression. Suppression. The incredible obtuseness of
 those who attend within tea-houses. The harmonious attitude
 of a person of commerce.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE (at whose virtuous and well-established feet an unworthy
      son now prostrates himself in spirit repeatedly),&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having at length reached the summit of my journey, that London of which
      the merchants from Canton spoke so many strange and incredible things, I
      now send you filial salutations three times increased, and in accordance
      with your explicit command I shall write all things to you with an
      unvarnished brush, well assured that your versatile object in committing
      me to so questionable an enterprise was, above all, to learn the truth of
      these matters in an undeviating and yet open-headed spirit of accuracy and
      toleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the perils incurred while travelling in the awe-inspiring devices by
      which I was transferred from shore to shore and yet further inland, of the
      utter absence of all leisurely dignity on the part of those controlling
      their movements, and of the almost unnatural self-opinionatedness which
      led them to persist in starting at a stated and prearranged time, even
      when this person had courteously pointed out to them by irrefutable omens
      that neither the day nor the hour was suitable for the venture, I have
      already written. It is enough to assert that a similar want of prudence
      was maintained on every occasion, and, as a result, when actually within
      sight of the walls of this city, we were involved for upwards of an hour
      in a very evilly-arranged yellow darkness, which, had we but delayed for a
      day, as I strenuously advised those in authority after consulting the
      Sacred Flat and Round Sticks, we should certainly have avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the real nature of the devices by which the ships are propelled
      at sea and the carriages on land, I must still unroll a blank mind until I
      can secretly, and without undue hazard, examine them more closely. If, as
      you maintain, it is the work of captive demons hidden away among their
      most inside parts, it must be admitted that these usually intractable
      beings are admirably trained and controlled, and I am wide-headed enough
      to think that in this respect we might&mdash;not-withstanding our nine
      thousand years of civilised refinement&mdash;learn something of the
      methods of these barbarians. The secret, however, is jealously guarded,
      and they deny the existence of any supernatural forces; but their protests
      may be ignored, for there is undoubtedly a powerful demon used in a
      similar way by some of the boldest of them, although its employment is
      unlawful. A certain kind of chariot is used for the occupation of this
      demon, and those who wish to invoke it conceal their faces within masks of
      terrifying design, and cover their hands and bodies with specially
      prepared garments, without which it would be fatal to encounter these very
      powerful spirits. While yet among the habitations of men, and in crowded
      places, they are constrained to use less powerful demons, which are
      lawful, but when they reach the unfrequented paths they throw aside all
      restraint, and, calling to their aid the forbidden spirit (which they do
      by secret movements of the hands), they are carried forward by its agency
      at a speed unattainable by merely human means. By day the demon looks
      forth from three white eyes, which at night have a penetrating brilliance
      equal to the fiercest glances of the Sacred Dragon in anger. If any person
      incautiously stands in its way it utters a warning cry of intolerable
      rage, and should the presumptuous one neglect to escape to the roadside
      and there prostrate himself reverentially before it, it seizes him by the
      body part and contemptuously hurls him bruised and unrecognisable into the
      boundless space of the around. Frequently the demon causes the chariot to
      rise into the air, and it is credibly asserted by discriminating witnesses
      (although this person only sets down as incapable of denial that which he
      has actually beheld) that some have maintained an unceasing flight through
      the middle air for a distance of many li. Occasionally the captive demon
      escapes from the bondage of those who have invoked it, through some
      incautious gesture or heretical remark on their part, and then it never
      fails to use them grievously, casting them to the ground wounded,
      consuming the chariot with fire, and passing away in the midst of an
      exceedingly debased odour, by which it is always accompanied after the
      manner of our own earth spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being, as this person has already set forth, an unlawful demon on
      account of its power when once called up, and the admitted uncertainty of
      its movements, those in authority maintain a stern and inexorable face
      towards the practice. To entrap the unwary certain persons (chosen on
      account of their massive outlines, and further protected from evil
      influences by their pure and consistent habits) keep an unceasing watch.
      When one of them, himself lying concealed, detects the approach of such a
      being, he closely observes the position of the sun, and signals to the
      other a message of warning. Then the second one, shielded by the sanctity
      of his life and rendered inviolable by the nature of his garments&mdash;his
      sandals alone being capable of overturning any demon from his path should
      it encounter them&mdash;boldly steps forth into the road and holds out
      before him certain sacred emblems. So powerful are these that at the sight
      the unlawful demon confesses itself vanquished, and although its whole
      body trembles with ill-contained rage, and the air around is poisoned by
      its discreditable exhalation, it is devoid of further resistance. Those in
      the chariot are thereupon commanded to dismiss it, and being bound in
      chains they are led into the presence of certain lesser mandarins who
      administer justice from a raised dais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; exclaims the chief of the captors, when the prisoners have been
      placed in obsequious attitudes before the lesser mandarins, &ldquo;thus the
      matter chanced: The honourable Wang, although disguised under the
      semblance of an applewoman, had discreetly concealed himself by the
      roadside, all but his head being underneath a stream of stagnant water,
      when, at the eighth hour of the morning, he beheld these repulsive
      outcasts approaching in their chariot, carried forward by the diabolical
      vigour of the unlawful demon. Although I had stationed myself several li
      distant from the accomplished Wang, the chariot reached me in less than a
      breathing space of time, those inside assuming their fiercest and most
      aggressive attitudes, and as they came repeatedly urging the demon to
      increased exertions. Their speed exceeded that of the swallow in his
      hymeneal flight, all shrubs and flowers by the wayside withered incapably
      at the demon&rsquo;s contaminating glance, running water ceased to flow, and the
      road itself was scorched at their passage, the earth emitting a dull
      bluish flame. These facts, and the times and the distances, this person
      has further inscribed in a book which thus disposes of all possible
      defence. Therefore, O lesser mandarins, let justice be accomplished
      heavily and without delay; for, as the proverb truly says, &lsquo;The fiercer
      the flame the more useless the struggles of the victim.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the prisoners frequently endeavour to make themselves heard,
      protesting that in the distance between the concealed Wang and the one who
      stands accusing them they had thrice stopped to repair their innermost
      details, had leisurely partaken of food and wine, and had also been
      overtaken, struck, and delayed by a funeral procession. But so great is
      the execration in which these persons are held, that although murderers by
      stealth, outlaws, snatchers from the body, and companies of men who by
      strategy make a smaller sum of money appear to be larger, can all freely
      testify their innocence, raisers of this unlawful demon must not do so,
      and they are beaten on the head with chains until they desist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lesser mandarins, raising their voices in unison, exclaim, &ldquo;The
      amiable Tsay-hi has reported the matter in a discreet and impartial
      spirit. Hear our pronouncement: These raisers of illegal spirits shall
      each contribute ten taels of gold, which shall be expended in joss-sticks,
      in purifying the road which they have scorched, and in alleviating the
      distress of the poor and virtuous of both sexes. The praiseworthy Tsay-hi,
      moreover, shall embroider upon his sleeve an honourable sign in
      remembrance of the event. Let drums now be beat, and our verdict loudly
      proclaimed throughout the province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These things, O my illustrious father (although on account of my
      contemptible deficiencies of style much may seem improbable to your
      all-knowing mind), these things I write with an unbending brush; for I set
      down only that which I have myself seen, or read in their own printed
      records. Doubtless it will occur to one of your preternatural intelligence
      that our own system of administering justice, whereby the person who can
      hire the greater number of witnesses is reasonably held to be in the
      right, although perhaps not absolutely infallible, is in every way more
      convenient; but, as it is well said, &ldquo;To the blind, night is as acceptable
      as day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth you will have no hesitation in letting it be known throughout
      Yuen-ping that these foreign barbarians do possess secret demons, in spite
      of their denials. Doubtless I shall presently discover others no less
      powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      With honourable distinction this person has at length grasped the
      essential details of the spoken language here&mdash;not sufficiently well,
      indeed, to make himself understood on most occasions, or even to
      understand others, but enough to perceive clearly when he fails to become
      intelligible or when they experience a like difficulty with him. Upon an
      earlier occasion, before he had made so much progress, being one day left
      to his own resources, and feeling an internal lack, he entered what
      appeared to be a tea-shop of reputable demeanour, and, seating himself at
      one of the little marble tables, he freely pronounced the
      carefully-learned word &ldquo;rice&rdquo; to the attending nymph. To put aside all
      details of preparation (into which, indeed, this person could not enter)
      he waved his hand gracefully, at the same time smiling with an expression
      of tolerant acquiescence, as of one who would say that what was good
      enough to be cooked and offered by so entrancing a maiden was good enough
      to be eaten by him. After remaining in unruffled tranquillity for the full
      portion of an hour, and observing that no other person around had to wait
      above half that period, this one began to perceive that the enterprise was
      not likely to terminate in a manner satisfactory to himself; so that,
      leaving this place with a few well-chosen phrases of intolerable regret in
      his own tongue, he entered another, and conducted himself in a like
      fashion.... Towards evening, with an unperturbed exterior, but materially
      afflicted elsewhere, this person seated himself within the eleventh
      tea-shop, and, pointing first towards his own constituents of digestion,
      then at the fire, and lastly in an upward direction, thereby signified to
      any not of stunted intellect that he had reached such a condition of mind
      and body that he was ready to consume whatever the ruling deities were
      willing to allot, whether boiled, baked, roast, or suspended from a
      skewer. In this resolve nothing would move him, until&mdash;after many
      maidens had approached with outstretched hands and gestures of despair&mdash;there
      presently entered a person wearing the helmet of a warrior and the manner
      of a high official, who spoke strongly, yet persuasively, of the virtues
      of immediate movement and a quiet and reposeful bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly a people who devote so little attention to the study of food,
      and all matters connected with it, must inevitably remain barbaric,
      however skilfully they may feign a superficial refinement. It is said,
      although I do not commit this matter to my own brush, that among them are
      more books composed on subjects which have no actual existence than on
      cooking, and, incredible as it may appear, to be exceptionally
      round-bodied confers no public honour upon the individual. Should a
      favourable occasion present itself, there are many who do not scruple to
      jest upon the subject of food, or, what is incalculably more depraved,
      upon the scarcity of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there are exceptions of a highly distinguished radiance.
      Among these must be accounted one into whose presence this person was
      recently led by our polished and harmonious friend Quang-Tsun, the
      merchant in tea and spices. This versatile person, whose business-name is
      spoken of as Jones Bob-Jones, is worthy of all benignant respect, and in a
      really enlightened country would doubtless be raised to a more exalted
      position than that of a breaker of outsides (an occupation difficult to
      express adequately in the written language of a country where it is
      unknown), for his face is like the sun setting in the time of harvest, his
      waist garment excessive, and the undoubted symmetry of his middle portions
      honourable in the extreme. So welcome in my eyes, after witnessing an
      unending stream of concave and attenuated barbarian ghosts, was the sight
      of these perfections of Jones Bob-Jones, that instead of the formal
      greeting of this Island&mdash;the unmeaning &ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo;&mdash;I
      shook hands cordially with myself, and exclaimed affectionately in our own
      language, &ldquo;Illimitable felicities! How is your stomach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Jones Bob-Jones, after Quang-Tsun had interpreted this
      polite salutation to his understanding, &ldquo;since you mention it, that&rsquo;s just
      the trouble; but I&rsquo;m going on pretty well, thanks. I&rsquo;ve tried most of the
      advertised things, and now my doctor has put me practically on a
      bread-and-water course&mdash;clear soup, boiled fish, plain joint, no
      sweets, a crumb of cheese, and a bare three glasses of Hermitage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this amiable remark (of which, as it is somewhat of a technical
      nature, I was unable to grasp the contained significance until the
      agreeable Quang-Tsun had subsequently repeated it several times for my
      retention), I maintained a consistent expression of harmonious agreement
      and gratified esteem (suitable, I find, for all like occasions), and then,
      judging from the sympathetic animation of Jones Bob-Jones&rsquo;s countenance,
      that it had not improbably been connected with food, I discreetly
      introduced the subject of sea-snails, preserved in the essence of crushed
      peaches, by courteously inquiring whether he had ever partaken of such a
      delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the liberal-minded person, when&mdash;encouraged by the
      protruding eagerness of his eyes at the mention of the viand&mdash;I had
      further spoken of the refined flavour of the dish, and explained the
      manner of its preparation. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I have, but it sounds
      uncommonly good&mdash;something like turtle, I should imagine. I&rsquo;ll see if
      they can get it for me at Pimm&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This filial tribute goes by a trusty hand, in the person of one Ki Nihy,
      who is shortly committing himself to the protection of his ancestors and
      the voracity of the unbounded Bitter Waters; and with brightness and gold
      it will doubtless reach you in the course of twelve or eighteen moons. The
      superstitious here, this person may describe, when they wish to send
      messages from one to another, inscribe upon the outer cover a written
      representation of the one whose habitation they require, and after
      affixing a small paper talisman, drop it into a hole in the nearest wall,
      in the hope that it may be ultimately conveyed to the appointed spot,
      either by the services of the charitably-disposed passer-by, or by the
      intervention of the beneficent deities.

      LETTER II
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the ill-destined manner of existence of the hound
 Hercules. The thoughtlessly-expressed desire of the
 entrancing maiden and its effect upon a person of
 susceptible refinement. The opportune (as it may yet be
 described) visit of one Herbert. The behaviour of those
 around. Reflections.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE (whose large right hand is continuously floating in spirit
      over the image of this person&rsquo;s dutiful submission),&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless to your all-consuming prescience, it will at once become plain
      that I have abandoned the place of residence from which I directed my
      former badly-written and offensively-constructed letter, the house of the
      sympathetic and resourceful Maidens Blank, where in return for an utterly
      inadequate sum of money, produced at stated intervals, this very much
      inferior person was allowed to partake of a delicately-balanced and
      somewhat unvarying fare in the company of the engaging of both sexes, and
      afterwards to associate on terms of honourable equality with them in the
      chief apartment. The reason and manner of this one&rsquo;s departure are in no
      degree formidable to his refined manner of conducting any enterprise, but
      arose partly from an insufficient grasp of the more elaborate outlines of
      a confessedly involved language, and still more from a too excessive
      impetuousness in carrying out what at the time he believed to be the
      ambition of one who had come to exercise a melodious influence over his
      most internal emotions. Well remarked the Sage, &ldquo;A piece of gold may be
      tried between the teeth; a written promise to pay may be disposed of at a
      sacrifice to one more credulous; but what shall be said of the wind, the
      Hoang Ho, and the way of a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To contrive a pitfall for this short-sighted person&rsquo;s immature feet,
      certain malicious spirits had so willed it that the chief and more
      autumnal of the Maidens Blank (who, nevertheless, wore an excessively
      flower-like name), had long lavished herself upon the possession of an
      obtuse and self-assertive hound, which was in the habit of gratifying this
      inconsiderable person and those who sat around by continually depositing
      upon their unworthy garments details of its outer surface, and when the
      weather was more than usually cold, by stretching its graceful and refined
      body before the fire in such a way as to ensure that no one should suffer
      from a too acute exposure to the heat. From these causes, and because it
      was by nature a hound which even on the darkest night could be detected at
      a more than reasonable distance away, while at all times it did not
      hesitate to shake itself freely into the various prepared viands, this
      person (and doubtless others also) regarded it with an emotion very
      unfavourable towards its prolonged existence; but observing from the first
      that those who permitted themselves to be deposited upon, and their hands
      and even their faces to be hound-tongue-defiled with the most externally
      cheerful spirit of word suppression, invariably received the most
      desirable of the allotted portions of food, he judged it prudent and
      conducive to a settled digestion to greet it with favourable terms and
      actions, and to refer frequently to its well-displayed proportions, and to
      the agile dexterity which it certainly maintained in breathing into the
      contents of every dish. Thus the matter may be regarded as being
      positioned for a space of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening I returned at the appointed gong-stroke of dinner, and was
      beginning, according to my custom, to greet the hound with ingratiating
      politeness, when the one of chief authority held up a reproving hand, at
      the same time exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Kong, you must not encourage Hercules with your amiable
      condescension, for just now he is in very bad odour with us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied this person, somewhat puzzled, nevertheless, that
      the imperfection should thus be referred to openly by one who hitherto had
      not hesitated to caress the hound with most intimate details, &ldquo;undoubtedly
      the surrounding has a highly concentrated acuteness to-night, but the
      ever-present characteristic of the hound Hercules is by no means new, for
      whenever he is in the room&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point it is necessary to explain that the ceremonial etiquette of
      these barbarian outcasts is both conflicting and involved. Upon most of
      the ordinary occasions of life to obtrude oneself within the conversation
      of another is a thing not to be done, yet repeatedly when this
      unpretentious person has been relating his experience or inquiring into
      the nature and meaning of certain matters which he has witnessed, he has
      become aware that his words have been obliterated, as it were, and his
      remarks diverted from their original intention by the sudden and
      unanticipated desire of those present to express themselves loudly on some
      topic of not really engrossing interest. Not infrequently on such
      occasions every one present has spoken at once with concentrated anxiety
      upon the condition of the weather, the atmosphere of the room, the hour of
      the day, or some like detail of contemptible inferiority. At other times
      maidens of unquestionable politeness have sounded instruments of brass or
      stringed woods with unceasing vigour, have cast down ornaments of china,
      or even stood upon each other&rsquo;s&mdash;or this person&rsquo;s&mdash;feet with
      assumed inelegance. When, therefore, in the midst of my agreeable remark
      on the asserted no fragrance of the hound Hercules, a gentleman of
      habitual refinement struck me somewhat heavily on the back of the head
      with a reclining seat which he was conveying across the room for the
      acceptance of a lady, and immediately overwhelmed me with apologies of
      almost unnecessary profusion, my mind at once leapt to an inspired
      conclusion, and smiling acquiescently I bowed several times to each person
      to convey to them an admission of the undoubted fact that to the wise a
      timely omen before the storm is as effective as a thunderbolt afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that there was present the exceptionally prepossessing maiden
      to whom this person has already referred. So varied and ornate were her
      attractions that it would be incompetent in one of my less than average
      ability to attempt an adequate portrayal. She had a light-coloured name
      with the letters so harmoniously convoluted as to be quite beyond my
      inferior power of pronunciation, so that if I wished to refer to her in
      her absence I had to indicate the one I meant by likening her to a
      full-blown chrysanthemum, a piece of rare jade, an ivory pagoda of
      unapproachable antiquity, or some other object of admitted grace. Even
      this description may scarcely convey to you the real extent of her elegant
      personality; but in her presence my internal organs never failed to
      vibrate with a most entrancing uncertainty, and even now, at the
      recollection of her virtuous demeanour, I am by no means settled within
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed this melodious vision, with sympathetic tact, &ldquo;if every
      one is going to disown poor Hercules because he has eaten all our dinners,
      I shall be quite willing to have him, for he is a dzear ole loveykins,
      wasn&rsquo;t ums?&rdquo; (This, O my immaculate and dignified sire, which I transcribe
      with faithful undeviation, appears to be the dialect of a remote province,
      spoken only by maidens&mdash;both young and of autumnal solitude&mdash;under
      occasional mental stress; as of a native of Shan-si relapsing without
      consciousness into his uncouth tongue after passing a lifetime in the
      Capital.) &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so too, Mr. Kong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the sun shines the shadow falls, for truly it is said, &lsquo;To the
      faithful one even the voice of the corncrake at evening speaks of his
      absent love,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied this person, so engagingly disconcerted at being
      thus openly addressed by the maiden that he retained no delicate
      impression of what she said, or even of what he was replying, beyond an
      unassuming hope that the nature of his feelings might perchance be
      inoffensively revealed to her in the semblance of a discreet allegory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; interposed a person of neglected refinement, turning towards
      the maiden, &ldquo;you would like to have a corncrake also, to remind you of Mr.
      Kong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what a corncrake is like,&rdquo; replied the maiden with
      commendable dignity. &ldquo;I do not think so, however, for I once had a pair of
      canaries, and I found them very unsatisfying, insipid creatures. But I
      should love to have a little dog I am sure, only Miss Blank won&rsquo;t hear of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kong Ho,&rdquo; thought this person inwardly, &ldquo;not in vain have you burnt joss
      sticks unceasingly, for the enchanting one has said into your eyes that
      she would love to partake of a little dog. Assuredly we have recently
      consumed the cold portion of sheep on more occasions than a strict
      honourableness could require of those who pay a stated sum at regular
      intervals, and the change would be a welcome one. As she truly says, the
      flavour even of canaries is trivial and insignificant by comparison.&rdquo;
       During the period of dinner&mdash;which consisted of eggs and green herbs
      of the field&mdash;this person allowed the contemplation to grow within
      him, and inspired by a most pleasant and disinterested ambition to carry
      out the expressed wishes of the one who had spoken, he determined that the
      matter should be unobtrusively arranged despite the mercenary opposition
      of the Maidens Blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      This person had already learned by experience that dogs are rarely if ever
      exposed for sale in the stalls of the meat venders, the reason doubtless
      being that they are articles of excessive luxury and reserved by law for
      the rich and powerful. Those kept by private persons are generally closely
      guarded when they approach a desirable condition of body, and the hound
      Hercules would not prove an attractive dish to those who had known him in
      life. Nevertheless, it is well said, &ldquo;The Great Wall is unsurmountable,
      but there are many gaps through,&rdquo; and that same evening I was able to
      carry the first part of my well-intentioned surprise into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter now involves one named Herbert, who having exchanged gifts of
      betrothal with a maiden staying at the house, was in the habit of
      presenting himself openly, when he was permitted to see her, after the
      manner of these barbarians. (Yet even of them the more discriminating
      acknowledge that our customs are immeasurably superior; for when I
      explained to the aged father of the Maidens Blank that among us the
      marriage rites are irrevocably performed before the bride is seen unveiled
      by man, he sighed heavily and exclaimed that the parents of this country
      had much to learn.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The genial-minded Herbert had already acquired for himself the reputation
      of being one who ceaselessly removes the gravity of others, both by word
      and action, and from the first he selected this obscure person for his
      charitable purpose to a most flattering extent. Not only did he&mdash;on
      the pretext that his memory was rebellious&mdash;invariably greet me as
      &ldquo;Mr. Hong Kong,&rdquo; but on more than one occasion he insisted, with
      mirth-provoking reference to certain details of my unbecoming garments,
      that I must surely have become confused and sent a Mrs. Hong Kong instead
      of myself, and frequently he undermined the gravity of all most
      successfully by pulling me backwards suddenly by the pigtail, with the
      plea that he imagined he was picking up his riding-whip. This attractive
      person was always accompanied by a formidable dog&mdash;of convex limbs,
      shrunken lip, and suspicious demeanour&mdash;which he called Influenza, to
      the excessive amusement of those to whom he related its characteristics.
      For some inexplicable reason from the first it regarded my lower apparel
      as being unsuitable for the ordinary occasions of life, and in spite of
      the low hissing call by which its master endeavoured to attract its
      attention to himself, it devoted its energies unceasingly to the
      self-imposed task of removing them fragment by fragment. Nevertheless it
      was a dog of favourable size and condition, and it need not therefore be a
      matter for surprise that when the intellectual person Herbert took his
      departure on the day in question it had to be assumed that it had already
      preceded him. Having accomplished so much, this person found little
      difficulty in preparing it tastefully in his own apartment, and making the
      substitution on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although his mind was confessedly enlarged at the success of his venture,
      and his hopes most ornamentally coloured at the thought of the adorable
      one&rsquo;s gratified esteem when she discovered how expertly her wishes had
      been carried out, this person could not fail to notice that the Maiden
      Blank was also materially agitated when she distributed the contents of
      the dish before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, of your enlightened courtesy, accept, and overlook the
      deficiencies of, a portion of rabbit-pie, O high-souled Mr. Kong?&rdquo; she
      inquired gracefully when this insignificant person was reached, and,
      concealing my many-hued emotion beneath an impassive face, I bowed
      agreeably as I replied, &ldquo;To the beggar, black bread is a royal course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT pie did you say, dear?&rdquo; whispered another autumnal maiden, when all
      had partaken somewhat, and at her words a most consistently acute silence
      involved the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know,&rdquo; replied the one of the upper end, becoming
      excessively devoid of complexion; and restraining her voice she forthwith
      sent down an attending slave to inquire closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point a person of degraded ancestry endeavoured to remove the
      undoubted cloud of depression by feigning the nocturnal cry of the
      domestic cat; but in this he was not successful, and a maiden opposite,
      after fixedly regarding a bone on her plate, withdrew suddenly, embracing
      herself as she went. A moment later the slave returned, proclaiming aloud
      that the dish which had been prepared for the occasion had now been
      accidentally discovered by the round-bodied cook beneath the cushions of
      an arm-chair (a spot by no means satisfactory to this person&rsquo;s imagination
      had the opportunities at his disposal been more diffuse).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, is this of which we have freely partaken?&rdquo; cried they around,
      and, in the really impressive silence which followed, an inopportune
      person discovered a small silver tablet among the fragments upon his
      plate, and, taking it up, read aloud the single word, &ldquo;Influenza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the day, and even far into the uncounted gong-strokes of the time
      of darkness, this person had frequently remained in a fascinated
      contemplation of the moment when he should reveal himself and stand up to
      receive the benevolently-expressed congratulations of all who paid an
      agreed sum at fixed intervals, and, particularly, the dazzling though
      confessedly unsettling glance-thanks of the celestially-formed maiden who
      had explicitly stated that she was desirous of having a little dog. Now,
      however, when this part of the enterprise ought to have taken place, I
      found myself unable to evade the conclusion that some important detail of
      the entire scheme had failed to agree harmoniously with the rest, and, had
      it been possible, I would have retired with unobtrusive tact and permitted
      another to wear my honourable acquirements. But, for some reason, as I
      looked around I perceived that every eye was fixed upon me with what at
      another time would have been a most engaging unanimity, and, although I
      bowed with undeterred profusion, and endeavoured to walk out behind an
      expression of all-comprehensive urbanity that had never hitherto failed
      me, a person of unsympathetic outline placed himself before the door, and
      two others, standing one on each side of me, gave me to understand that a
      recital of the full happening was required before I left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hopeless to expect a display of refined intelligence at the hands of
      a people sunk in barbarism and unacquainted with the requirements of true
      dignity and the essentials of food preparation. On the manner of behaving
      of the male portion of those present this person has no inducement
      whatever to linger. Even the maiden for whom he had accomplished so much,
      after the nature of the misunderstanding had been made plain to her,
      uttered only a single word of approval, which, on subsequently consulting
      a book of interpretations, this person found to indicate: &ldquo;A person of
      weak intellect; one without an adequate sense of the proportion and
      fitness of things; a buffoon; a jester; a compound of gooseberries scalded
      and crushed with cream&rdquo;; but although each of these definitions may in a
      way be regarded as applicable, he is still unable to decide which was the
      precise one intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      With salutations of filial regard, and in a spirit seven times refined by
      affliction and purified by vain regrets.
    </p>
    <p>

      LETTER III
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the virtuous amusements of both old and young.
 The sit-round games. The masterpiece of the divine Li Tang,
 and its reception by all, including that same Herbert.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE (whose breadth of mind is so well developed as to take for
      granted boundless filial professions, which, indeed, become vapid by a too
      frequent reiteration),&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Your amiable inquiry as to how the barbarians pass their time, when not
      employed in affairs of commerce or in worshipping their ancestors, has
      inspired me to examine the matter more fully. At the same time your
      pleasantly-composed aphorism that the interior nature of persons does not
      vary with the colour of their eyes, and that if I searched I should find
      the old flying kites and the younger kicking feather balls or working
      embroidery, according to their sex, does not appear to be accurately
      sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lesser ones, it is true, engage in a variety of sumptuous handicrafts,
      such as the scorching of wooden tablets with the semblance of a pattern,
      and gouging others with sharpened implements into a crude relief;
      depicting birds and flowers upon the surface of plates, rending leather
      into shreds, and entwining beaten iron, brass, and copper into a diversity
      of most ingenious complications; but when I asked a maiden of affectionate
      and domesticated appearance whether she had yet worked her age-stricken
      father&rsquo;s coffin-cloth, she said that the subject was one upon which she
      declined to jest, and rapidly involving herself in a profuse display of
      emotion, she withdrew, leaving this one aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable my mind to retranquillise, I approached a youth of highly-gilded
      appearance, and, with many predictions of self-inferiority, I suggested
      that we should engage in the stimulating rivalry of feather ball. When he
      learned, however, that the diversion consisted in propelling upwards a
      feather-trimmed chip by striking it against the side of the foot, he
      candidly replied that he was afraid he had grown out of shuttle-cock, but
      did not mind, if I was vigorously inclined, &ldquo;taking me on for a set of
      yang-pong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old men here, it is said, do not fly kites, and they affect to despise
      catching flies for amusement, although they frequently go fishing. Struck
      by this peculiarity, I put it in the form of an inquiry to one of
      venerable appearance, why, when at least five score flies were undeniably
      before his eyes, he preferred to recline for lengthy periods by the side
      of a stream endeavouring to snare creatures of whose existence he himself
      had never as yet received any adequate proof. Doubtless in my contemptible
      ignorance, however, I used some word inaccurately, for those who stood
      around suffered themselves to become amused, and the one in question
      replied with no pretence of amiable condescension that the jest had
      already been better expressed a hundred times, and that I would find the
      behind parts of a printed leaf called &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; in the bookcase. Not being
      desirous of carrying on a conversation of which I felt that I had
      misplaced the most highly rectified ingredient, I bowed repeatedly, and
      replied affably that wisdom ruled his left side and truth his right.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon this same occasion that a young man of unprejudiced
      wide-mindedness, taking me aside, asserted that the matter had not been
      properly set forth when I was inquiring about kites. Both old and young
      men, he continued, frequently endeavoured to fly kites, even in the
      involved heart of the city. He had tried once or twice himself, but never
      with encouraging success, chiefly, he was told, because his paper was not
      good enough. Many people, he added, would not scruple to mislead me with
      evasive ambiguity on this one subject owing to an ill-balanced conception
      of what constituted true dignity, but he was unwilling that his countrymen
      should be thought by mine to be sunk into a deeper barbarism than actually
      existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His warning was not inopportune. Seated next to this person at a later
      period was a maiden from whose agreeably-poised lips had hitherto
      proceeded nothing but sincerity and fact. Watching her closely I asked
      her, as one who only had a languid interest either one way or the other,
      whether her revered father or her talented and richly-apparelled brothers
      ever spent their time flying kites about the city. In spite of a most
      efficient self-control her colour changed at my words, and her features
      trembled for a moment, but quickly reverting to herself she replied that
      she thought not; then&mdash;as though to subdue my suspicions more
      completely&mdash;that she was sure they did not, as the kites would
      certainly frighten the horses and the appointed watchmen of the street
      would not allow it. She confessed, however, with unassumed candour, that
      the immediate descendants of her sister were gracefully proficient in the
      art.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this, great and enlightened one, you will readily perceive how
      misleading an impression might be carried away by a person
      scrupulously-intentioned but not continually looking both ways, when
      placed among a people endowed with the uneasy suspicion of the barbarian
      and struggling to assert a doubtful refinement. Apart from this, there has
      to be taken into consideration their involved process of reasoning, and
      the unexpectedly different standards which they apply to every subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the house of the Maidens Blank, when the evening was not spent in
      listening to melodious voices and the harmony of stringed woods, it was
      usual to take part in sit-round games of various kinds. (And while it is
      on his brush this person would say with commendable pride that a
      well-trained musician among us can extort more sound from a hollow wooden
      pig, costing only a few cash, than the most skilful here ever attain on
      their largest instrument&mdash;a highly-lacquered coffin on legs, filled
      with bells and hidden springs, and frequently sold for a thousand taels.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a certain evening, at the conclusion of one sit-round game which
      involved abrupt music, a barrier of chairs, and the exhilarating
      possibility of being sat upon by the young and vivacious in their zeal, a
      person of the company turned suddenly to the one who is communicating with
      you and said enticingly, &ldquo;Why did Birdcage Walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not judging from his expression that this was other than a polite inquiry
      on a matter which disturbed his repose, I was replying that the
      manifestation was undoubtedly the work of a vexatious demon which had
      taken up its abode in the article referred to, when another, by my side,
      cried aloud, &ldquo;Because it envied Queen Anne&rsquo;s Gate&rdquo;; and without a pause
      cast back the question, &ldquo;Who carved The Poultry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the apparent simplicity of the demand it was received by all
      in an attitude of complicated doubt, and this person was considering
      whether he might not acquire distinction by replying that such an office
      fell by custom to the lot of the more austere Maiden Blank, when the very
      inadequate reply, &ldquo;Mark Lane with St. Mary&rsquo;s Axe,&rdquo; was received with
      applause and some observations in a half-tone regarding the identity of
      the fowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the laws of the sit-round games the one who had last spoken now
      proclaimed himself, demanding to know, &ldquo;Why did Battersea Rise?&rdquo; but the
      involvement was evidently superficial, for the maiden at whose memory this
      one&rsquo;s organs still vibrate ignobly at once replied, &ldquo;Because it thought
      Clapham Common,&rdquo; in turn inquiring, &ldquo;What made the Marble Arch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although I would have willingly sacrificed to an indefinite extent to be
      furnished with the preconcerted watchword, so that I might have enlarged
      myself in the eyes of this consecrated being&rsquo;s unapproachable esteem, I
      had already decided that the competition was too intangible for one whose
      thoughts lay in well-defined parallel lines, and it fell to another to
      reply, &ldquo;To hear Salisbury Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, O my broad-minded ancestor of the first degree&mdash;an aimless
      challenge coupled with the name of one recognisable spot, replied to by
      the haphazard retort of another place, frequently in no way joined to it,
      was regarded as an exceptionally fascinating sit-round game by a company
      of elderly barbarians!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What couldn&rsquo;t Walbrook?&rdquo; it might be, and &ldquo;Such Cheapside,&rdquo; would be
      deemed a praiseworthy solution. &ldquo;When did King&rsquo;s Bench Walk?&rdquo; would be
      asked, and to reply, &ldquo;When Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road,&rdquo; covered the one with
      overpowering acclamation. &ldquo;Bevis Marks only an Inner Circle at The Butts;
      why?&rdquo; was a demand of such elaborate complexity that (although this person
      was lured out of his self-imposed restraint by the silence of all round,
      and submerging his intelligence to an acquired level, unobtrusively
      suggested, &ldquo;Because Aylesbury ducks, perchance&rdquo;) it fell to the one
      propounding to announce, &ldquo;Because St. John&rsquo;s Wood Shoot-up Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Admittedly it is written, &ldquo;When the shutter is fastened the girdle is
      loosened,&rdquo; but it is as truly said, &ldquo;Not in the head, nor yet in the feet,
      but in the organs of digestion does wisdom reside,&rdquo; and even in jesting
      the middle course of neither an excessive pride nor an absolute
      weak-mindedness is to be observed. With what concrete pangs of acute
      mental distress would this person ever behold his immaculate progenitor
      taking part in a similar sit-round game with an assembly of worthy
      mandarins, the one asking questions of meaningless import, as &ldquo;Why did
      they Hangkow?&rdquo; and another replying in an equal strain of no
      consecutiveness, &ldquo;In order to T&rsquo;in Tung!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length a person who is spoken of as having formerly been the captain of
      a band of warriors turned to me with an unsuspected absence of ferocity
      and said, &ldquo;Your countrymen are very proficient in the art of epigram, are
      they not, Mr. Kong? Will you not, in turn, therefore, favour us with an
      example?&rdquo; Whereupon several maidens exclaimed with engaging high temper,
      &ldquo;Oh yes; do ask us some funny Chinese riddles, Mr. Kong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly there are among us many classical instances of the light
      sayings which require matching,&rdquo; I replied, gratified that I should have
      the opportunity of showing their superiority. &ldquo;One, harmonious beyond the
      blend of challenge and retort, is as follows&mdash;&lsquo;The Phoenix
      embroidered upon the side of the shoe: When the shoe advances the Phoenix
      leaps forward.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried several of the maidens, and from the nature of their glances
      it might reasonably be gathered that already they began to recognise the
      inferiority of their own sayings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the question, or the answer, or both?&rdquo; asked a youth of unfledged
      maturity, and to hide their conscious humiliation several persons allowed
      their faces to melt away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which has been expressed,&rdquo; replied this person with an ungrudging
      toleration, &ldquo;is the first or question portion of the contrast. The answer
      is that which will be supplied by your honourable condescension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposed one of the maidens, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t really a question, you
      know, Mr. Kong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way of regarding it, it may be said to be question, inasmuch as it
      requires an answer to establish the comparison. The most pleasing answer
      is that which shall be dissimilar in idea, and yet at the same time
      maintain the most perfect harmony of parallel thought,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Now
      permit your exceptional minds to wander in a forest of similitudes: &lsquo;The
      Phoenix embroidered upon the side of the shoe: When the shoe advances the
      Phoenix leaps forward.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s all you want,&rdquo; said the one Herbert, who by an ill destiny
      chanced to be present, &ldquo;&lsquo;The red-hot poker held before the Cat&rsquo;s nose:
      When the poker advances the Cat leaps backwards.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very good!&rdquo; cried several of those around, &ldquo;of course it naturally
      would. Is that right, Mr. Kong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the high-souled company is satisfied, then it must be, for there is no
      conclusive right or wrong&mdash;only an unending search for that which is
      most gem-set and resourceful,&rdquo; replied this person, with an ever-deepening
      conviction of no enthusiasm towards the sit-round game. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added,
      resolved to raise for a moment the canopy of a mind swan-like in its
      crystal many-sidedness, and then leave them to their own ineptitude, &ldquo;for
      five centuries nothing has been judged equal to the solution offered by Li
      Tang. At the time he was presented with a three-sided banner of silk with
      the names of his eleven immediate ancestors embroidered upon it in seven
      colours, and his own name is still handed down in imperishable memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do tell us what it was,&rdquo; cried many. &ldquo;It must have been clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Dragon painted upon the face of the fan: When the fan is shaken the
      Dragon flies upwards,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied this person.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be denied that this was received with an attitude of respectful
      melancholy strikingly complimentary to the wisdom of the gifted Li Tang.
      But whether it may be that the time was too short to assimilate the more
      subtle delicacies of the saying, or whether the barbarian mind is
      inherently devoid of true balance, this person was panged most internally
      to hear one say to another as he went out, &ldquo;Do you know, I really think
      that Herbert&rsquo;s was much the better answer of the two&mdash;more realistic,
      and what you might expect at the pantomime.&rdquo; *
    </p>
    <p>
      A like inability to grasp with a clear and uninvolved vision, permeates
      not only the triviality of a sit-round game but even the most important
      transactions of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after his arrival in the Island, this person was initiated by the
      widely-esteemed Quang-Tsun into the private life of one whose occupation
      was that of a Law-giver, where he frequently drank tea on terms of mutual
      cordiality. Upon such an occasion he was one day present, conversing with
      the lesser ones of the household&mdash;the head thereof being absent,
      setting forth the Law in the Temple&mdash;when one of the maidens cried
      out with amiable vivacity, &ldquo;Why, Mr. Kong, you say such consistently
      graceful things of the ladies you have met over here, that we shall expect
      you to take back an English wife with you. But perhaps you are already
      married in China?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conclusion is undeviating in its accuracy,&rdquo; replied this person,
      unable to evade the allusion. &ldquo;To Ning, Hia-Fa and T&rsquo;ain Yen, as the
      matter stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ning Hia-Fa An T&rsquo;ain Yen!&rdquo; exclaimed the wife of the Law-giver
      pleasantly. &ldquo;What an important name. Can you pardon our curiosity and tell
      us what she is like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ning, Hia-Fa AND T&rsquo;ain Yen,&rdquo; repeated this person, not submitting to be
      deprived of the consequence of two wives without due protest. &ldquo;Three
      names, three wives. Three very widely separated likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this in no way boastfully uttered statement the agreeably outlined
      surface of the faces around variated suddenly, the effect being one which
      I have frequently observed in the midst of my politest expressions of
      felicity. For a moment, indeed, I could not disguise from myself that the
      one who had made the inquiry stretched forth her lotus-like hand towards
      the secret spring by which it is customary to summon the attending slaves
      from the underneath parts, but restraining herself with the manner of one
      who would desire to make less of a thing that it otherwise might seem, she
      turned to me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;What a pity you did not bring them all with
      you, Mr. Kong. They would have been a great acquisition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it must be well weighed,&rdquo; I replied, not to be out-complimented
      touching one another, &ldquo;that here they would have met so many fine and
      superior gentlemen that they might have become dissatisfied with my less
      than average prepossessions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if they did not think of that in your case, and refuse to let
      you come,&rdquo; said one of the maidens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The various persons must not be regarded as being on their all fours,&rdquo; I
      replied, anxious that there should be no misunderstanding on this point.
      &ldquo;They, of course, reside within one inner chamber, but there would be no
      duplicity in this one adding indefinitely to the number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not; how silly of me!&rdquo; exclaimed the maiden. &ldquo;What splendid
      musical evenings you can have. But tell me, Mr. Kong (ought it not to be
      Messrs. Kong, mamma?), if a girl married you here would she be legally
      married to you in China?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; replied this person positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But could you not, by your own laws, have the marriage set aside whenever
      you wished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;It is so appointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how could she be legally married?&rdquo; she persisted, with really
      unbecoming suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legally married, legally unmarried,&rdquo; replied this person, quite
      distressed within himself at not being able to understand the difficulty
      besetting her. &ldquo;All perfectly legal and honourably observed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Gwendoline&mdash;&rdquo; said the one of authority, and although the
      matter was no further expressed, by an instinct which he was powerless to
      avert, this person at once found himself rising with ceremonious partings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not desiring that the obstacle should remain so inadequately swept away, I
      have turned my presumptuous footsteps in the direction of the Law-giver&rsquo;s
      house on several later occasions, but each time the word of the slave
      guarding the door has been that they of the household, down even to those
      of the most insignificant degree of kinship, have withdrawn to a distant
      and secluded spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      With renewed assurances that the enterprise is being gracefully conducted,
      however ill-digested and misleading these immature compositions may
      appear.

    <h2>
      LETTER IV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning a desire to expatiate upon subjects of
 philosophical importance and its no accomplishment. Three
 examples of the mental concavity sunk into by these
 barbarians. An involved episode which had the outward
 appearance of being otherwise than what it was.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE (whose genial liberality on all necessary occasions is well
      remembered by this person in his sacrifices, with the titles &ldquo;Benevolent&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Open-sleeved&rdquo;),&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had it in my head at one time to tell you somewhat of the Classics most
      reverenced in this country, of the philosophical opinions which prevail,
      and to enlighten you generally upon certain other subjects of
      distinguished eminence. As the deities arranged, however, it chanced that
      upon my way to a reputable quarter of the city where the actuality of
      these matters can be learnt with the least evasion, my footsteps were
      drawn aside by an incident which now permeates my truth-laden brush to the
      exclusion of all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the first place, if it be permitted for a thoroughly untrustworthy
      son to take so presumptuous a liberty with an unvaryingly sagacious
      father, let this one entreat you to regard everything he writes in a very
      wide-headed spirit of looking at the matter from all round. My former
      letters will have readily convinced you that much that takes place here,
      even among those who can afford long finger-nails, would not be tolerated
      in Yuen-ping, and in order to avoid the suspicion that I am suffering from
      a serious injury to the head, or have become a prey to a conflicting
      demon, it will be necessary to continue an even more highly-sustained
      tolerant alertness. This person himself has frequently suffered the ill
      effects of rashly assuming that because he is conducting the adventure in
      a prepossessing spirit his efforts will be honourably received, as when he
      courteously inquired the ages of a company of maidens into whose presence
      he was led, and complimented the one whom he was desirous of especially
      gratifying by assuring her that she had every appearance of being at least
      twice the nine-and-twenty years to which she modestly laid claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon another occasion I entered a barber&rsquo;s stall, and finding it
      oppressively hot within, I commanded the attendant to carry a reclining
      stool into the street and there shave my lower limbs and anoint my head.
      As he hesitated to obey&mdash;doubtless on account of the trivial labour
      involved&mdash;I repeated my words in a tone of fuller authority, holding
      out the inducement of a just payment when he complied, and assuring him
      that he would certainly be dragged before the nearest mandarin and
      tortured if he held his joints stiffly. At this he evidently understood
      his danger, for obsequiously protesting that he was only a barber of very
      mean attainments, and that his deformed utensils were quite inadequate for
      the case, he very courteously directed me in inquire for a public chariot
      bound for a quarter called Colney Hatch (the place of commerce, it is
      reasonable to infer, of the higher class barbers), and, seating myself in
      it, instruct the attendant to put me down at the large gates, where they
      possessed every requisite appliance, and also would, if desirable, shave
      my head also. Here the incident assumes a more doubtful guise, for,
      notwithstanding the admitted politeness of the one who spoke, each of
      those to whom I subsequently addressed myself on the subject, presented to
      me a face quite devoid of encouragement. While none actually pointed out
      the vehicle I sought, many passed on in a state of inward contemplation
      without replying, and some&mdash;chiefly the attendants of other chariots
      of a similar kind&mdash;replied in what I deemed to be a spirit of elusive
      metaphor, as he who asserted that such a conveyance must be sought for at
      a point known intimately as the Aldgate Pump, whence it started daily at
      half-past the thirteenth gong-stroke; and another, who maintained that I
      had no prospect of reaching the desired spot until I secured the services
      of one of a class of female attendants who wear flowing blue robes in
      order to indicate that they are prepared to encounter and vanquish any
      emergency in life. To make no elaborate pretence in the matter this person
      may definitely admit that he never did reach the place in question, nor&mdash;in
      spite of a diligent search in which he has encountered much obloquy&mdash;has
      he yet found any barber sufficiently well equipped to undertake the
      detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more recently I suffered the unmerited rebuke of the superficial
      through performing an act of deferential politeness. Learning that the
      enlightened and magnanimous sovereign of this country was setting out on a
      journey I stationed myself in the forefront of those who stood before his
      palace, intending to watch such parts of the procession as might be fitly
      witnessed by one of my condition. When these had passed, and the chariot
      of the greatest approached, I respectfully turned my back to the road with
      a propitiatory gesture, as of one who did not deem himself worthy even to
      look upon a being of such majestic rank and acknowledged excellence. This
      delicate action, by some incredible process of mental obliquity, was held
      by those around to be a deliberate insult, if not even a preconcerted
      signal, of open treachery, and had not a heaven-sent breeze at that moment
      carried the hat of a very dignified bystander into the upper branches of
      an opportune tree, and successfully turned aside the attention of the
      assembly into a most immoderate exhibition of utter loss of gravity, I
      should undoubtedly have been publicly tortured, if not actually torn to
      pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the incident first alluded to was of an even more
      elaborately-contrived density than these, and some of the details are
      still unrolled before the keenest edge of this one&rsquo;s inner perception.
      Nevertheless, all is now set down in unbroken exactness for your impartial
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of this exploit I had only ventured out on a few occasions,
      and then, save those recorded, to no considerable extent; for it had
      already become obvious that the enterprises in which I persistently became
      involved never contributed to my material prosperity, and the
      disappointment of finding that even when I could remember nine words of a
      sentence in their language none of the barbarians could understand even so
      much as a tenth of my own, further cast down my enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day which has been the object of this person&rsquo;s narration from the
      first, he set out to become more fully instructed in the subjects already
      indicated, and proceeding in a direction of which he had no actual
      knowledge, he soon found himself in a populous and degraded quarter of the
      city. Presently, to his reasonable astonishment, he saw before him at a
      point where two ill-constructed thoroughfares met, a spacious and
      important building, many-storied in height, ornamented with a profusion of
      gold and crystal, marble and precious stones, and displaying from a tall
      pole the three-hued emblem of undeniable authority. A never-ending stream
      of people passed in and out by the numerous doors; the strains of expertly
      wielded instruments could be distinctly heard inside, and the warm odour
      of a most prepossessing spiced incense permeated the surroundings.
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; thought the person who is now recording the incident, &ldquo;this
      is one of the Temples of barbarian worship&rdquo;; and to set all further doubt
      at rest he saw in letters of gilt splendour a variety of praiseworthy and
      appropriate inscriptions, among which he read and understood, &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Fine Old,&rdquo; &ldquo;Well Matured,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spirits only of the choicest quality within,&rdquo;
       together with many other invocations from which he could not wrest the
      hidden significance, as &ldquo;Old Vatted,&rdquo; &ldquo;Barclay&rsquo;s Entire,&rdquo; &ldquo;An Ordinary at
      One,&rdquo; and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time an impressive gathering had drawn around, and from its manner
      of behaving conveyed the suspicion that an entertainment or manifestation
      of some kind was confidently awaited. To disperse so outrageous a
      misconception this person was on the point of withdrawing himself when he
      chanced to see, over the principal door of the Temple, a solid gold figure
      of colossal magnitude, represented as crowned with leaves and tendrils,
      and holding in his outstretched hands a gigantic, and doubtless symbolic,
      bunch of grapes. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;is evidently the tutelary
      deity of the place, so displayed to receive the worship of the passer-by.&rdquo;
       With the discovery a thought of the most irreproachable benevolence
      possessed me. &ldquo;Why should not this person,&rdquo; I reflected, &ldquo;gain the
      unstinted approbation of those barbarians&rdquo; (who by this time completely
      encircled me in) &ldquo;by doing obeisance towards their deity, and by the same
      act delicately and inoffensively rebuke them for their own too-frequent
      intolerable attitude towards the susceptibilities of others? As an
      unprejudiced follower, in his own land, of the systems of Confucius,
      Lao-tse, and Buddha, this person already recognises the claims of
      seventeen thousand nine hundred and thirty-three deities of various
      grades, so that the addition of one more to that number can be a heresy of
      very trivial expiation.&rdquo; Inspired by these honourable sentiments,
      therefore, I at once prostrated myself on the ground, and, amid a silence
      of really illimitable expectation, I began to kow-tow repeatedly with
      ceremonious precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this display of charitable broadmindedness an approving shout went up
      on all sides. Thus encouraged I proceeded to kow-tow with even more
      unceasing assiduousness, and presently words of definite encouragement
      mingled with the shout. &ldquo;Do not flag in your amiable disinterestedness,
      Kong Ho,&rdquo; I whispered in my ear, &ldquo;and out of your well-sustained endurance
      may perchance arise a cordial understanding, and ultimately a remunerative
      alliance between two distinguished nations.&rdquo; Filled with this patriotic
      hope I did not suffer my neck to stiffen, and doubtless I would have
      continued the undertaking as long as the sympathetic persons who hemmed me
      in signified their refined approval, when suddenly the cry was raised,
      &ldquo;Look out, here comes the coppers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, O my venerable-headed father, I at once guessed to be the
      announcement heralding the collecting-bowl which some over-zealous
      bystander was preparing to pass round on my behalf, doubtless under the
      impression&mdash;so obtuse in grasping the true relationship of events are
      many of the barbarians&mdash;that I was a wandering monk, displaying my
      reverence for the purpose of mendicancy. Not wishing to profit by this
      offensive misapprehension, I was preparing to rise, when a hand was
      unceremoniously laid upon my shoulder, and turning round I saw behind me
      one of the official watch&mdash;a class of men so powerful that at a
      gesture from their uplifted hands even the fiercest untamed horse will not
      infrequently stand upon its hind legs in mute submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early morning salutations,&rdquo; I said pleasantly, though somewhat involved
      in speech by my exertion (for these persons are ever to be treated with
      discriminating courtesy). &ldquo;Prosperity to your house, O energetic
      street-watcher, and a thousand grandsons to worship their illustrious
      ancestor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he replied concisely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a single man. As yet. Now then, will
      you make a way there? Can you stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand?&rdquo; repeated this person, at once recognising one of the important
      words of inner meaning concerning which he had been initiated by the
      versatile Quang-Tsun. &ldquo;Certainly this person will not hesitate to
      establish his footing if the exaction is thought to be desirable. Let us,
      therefore, bend our steps in the direction of a tea-house of
      unquestionable propriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve bent your steps into quite enough tea-houses, as you call them,
      for one day,&rdquo; replied the official with evasive meaning, at the same time
      assisting me to rise (for it need not be denied that the restrained
      position had made me for the moment incapable of a self-sustaining
      effort). &ldquo;Look what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the direction of his glance I cast my eyes along the street, east and
      west, and for the first time I became aware that what I had last seen as a
      reasonable gathering had now taken the proportions of an innumerable
      multitude which filled the entire space of the thoroughfare, while others
      covered the roofs above and protruded themselves from every available
      window. In our own land the interspersal of umbrellas, musical
      instruments, and banners, with an occasional firework, would have given a
      greater animation to the scene; but with this exception I have never taken
      part in a more impressive and well-extended procession. Even while I
      looked, the helmets of other official watchers appeared in the distance,
      as immature junks upon the storm-tossed Whang-Hai, apparently striving
      fruitlessly to reach us.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was by no means sure what attitude was expected of me, I smiled with
      an all-embracing approval, and signified to the one at my side, by way of
      passing the time pleasurably together, that the likelihood of his
      nimble-witted friends reaching us with unruffled garments was remote in
      the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you let that worry you, Li Hung Chang,&rdquo; he said, in a tone that had
      the appearance of being outside itself around a deeper and more bitter
      significance; &ldquo;if we get out again with any garments at all it won&rsquo;t be
      your fault. Why, you&mdash;well, YOU ought to have been put on the Black
      List long ago, by rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, exalted one, although I have not yet been able to learn the exact
      dignity of it from any of the books of civil honours, is undoubtedly a
      mark of signal attainment, conferred upon the few for distinguishing
      themselves by some particular capacity; as our Double Dragon, for
      instance. Anxious to learn something of the privileges of the rank from
      one who evidently was not without influence in the bestowal, and not
      unwilling to show him that I was by no means of low-caste descent, I said
      to the official, &ldquo;In his own country one of this person&rsquo;s ancestors wore
      the Decoration of the Yellow Scabbard, which entitled him to be carried in
      his chair up to the gate of the Forbidden Palace before descending to
      touch the ground. Is this Order of the Black List of a like purport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is. In this country it entitles you to be
      carried right inside the door at Bow Street without ever touching the
      ground. Look out! Now we shall not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment what this person at first assumed to be a floral tribute,
      until he saw that not only the entire plant, but the earthenware jar also
      were attached, struck the official upon the helmet, whereupon, drawing a
      concealed club, he ceased speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the entertainment was conducted to such a development this person is
      totally inadequate to express; but in an incredibly short space of time
      the scene became one of most entrancing variety. From every visible point
      around the air became filled with commodities which&mdash;though doubtless
      without set intention&mdash;fittingly represented the arts, manufactures,
      and natural history of this resourceful country, all cast in prolific
      abundance at the feet of the official and myself, although the greater
      part inevitably struck our heads and bodies before reaching them. Beyond
      our immediate circle, as it may be expressed, the crowd never ceased to
      press forward with resistless activity, and among it could be seen
      occasionally the official watchmen advancing self-reliantly, though
      frequently without helmets, and, not less often, the helmets advancing
      without the official watchmen. To add to the acknowledged interest, every
      person present was proclaiming his views freely on a diversity of
      subjects, and above all could be heard the clear notes of the musical
      instruments by which the officials sought to encourage one another in
      their extremity, and to deaden the cries of those whom they outclubbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite this person&rsquo;s repeated protests that the distinction was too
      excessive, he was plucked from hand to hand irresistibly among those
      around, losing a portion of his ill-made attire at each step, so agreeably
      anxious were all to detain him. Just when the exploit seemed likely to
      have a disagreeable ending, however, he was thrust heavily against a door
      which yielded, and at once barring it behind him, he passed across the
      open space into which it led, along a passage between two walls, and
      thence through an involved labyrinth and beneath the waters of a canal
      into a wood of attractive seclusion. Here this person remained, spending
      the time in a profitable meditation, until the light withdrew and the
      great sky lantern had ascended. Then he cautiously crept forth, and after
      some further trivial episodes which chiefly concern the obstinate-headed
      slave guarding the outer door of a tea-house, an unintelligent maiden in
      the employment of one vending silk-embroidered raiment, the mercenary
      controller of a two-wheeled chariot and the sympathetic and opportune
      arrival of a person seated upon a funeral car, he succeeded in reaching
      the place of his abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      With unalterable affection and a material request that an unstinted
      adequacy of new garments may be sent by a sure and speedy hand.

    <h2>
      LETTER V
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the neglect of ancestors and its discreditable
 consequences. Two who state the matter definitely.
 Concerning the otherside way of looking at things and the
 self-contradictory bearing of the maiden Florence.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;A discovery of overwhelming malignity oppresses me.
      In spite of much baffling ambiguity and the frequent evasion of conscious
      guilt, there can be no longer any reasonable doubt that these barbarians
      DO NOT WORSHIP THEIR ANCESTORS!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto the matter had rested in my mind as an uneasy breath of
      suspicion, agitated from time to time by countless indications that such a
      possibility might, indeed, exist in a condensed form, but too
      inauspiciously profane to be contemplated in the altogether. Thus, when in
      the company of the young this person has walked about the streets of the
      city, he may at length have said, &ldquo;Truly, out of your amiable
      condescension, you have shown me a variety of entrancing scenes. Let us
      now in turn visit the tombs of your ancestors, to the end that I may
      transmit fitting gifts to their spirits and discharge a few propitious
      fireworks as a greeting.&rdquo; Yet in no case has this well-intentioned offer
      been agilely received, one asserting that he did not know the
      resting-place of the tombs in question, a second that he had no ancestors,
      a third that Kensal Green was not an entrancing spot for a wet afternoon,
      a fourth that he would see them removed to a greater distance first,
      another that he drew the line at mafficking in a cemetery, and the like.
      These things, it may occur to your omniscience, might in themselves have
      been conclusive, yet the next reference to the matter would perhaps be
      tending to a more alluring hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; a person has remarked in the hearing of this one, &ldquo;I go to
      the Stratford which is upon the Avon, and without a pause I shall
      prostrate myself intellectually before the immortal Shakespeare&rsquo;s tomb and
      worship his unequalled memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The intention is benevolently conceived,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;Yet has he no
      descendants, this same Shakespeare, that the conciliation of his spirit
      must be left to chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he assured me that this calamity had come about, I would have added a
      richly-gilded brick from my store for transmission also, in the hope that
      the neglected and capricious shadow would grant me an immunity from its
      resentful attention, but the one in question raised a barrier of dissent.
      If I wished to adorn a tomb, he added (evading the deeper significance of
      the act), there was that of Goldsmith within its Temple, upon which many
      impressionable maidens from across the Bitter Waters of the West make it a
      custom to deposit chaplets of verses, in the hope of seeing the offering
      chronicled in the papers; and in the Open Space called Trafalgar there
      were the images of a great captain who led many junks to victory and the
      Emperor of a former dynasty, where doubtless the matter could be arranged;
      but the surrounding had by this time become too involved, and this person
      had no alternative but to smile symmetrically and reply that his words
      were indeed opals falling from a topaz basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day, being desirous of becoming instructed more definitely, I
      addressed myself to a venerable person who makes clean the passage of the
      way at a point not far distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have no sons to extend your industrious line,&rdquo; I said, when he had
      revealed this fact to me, &ldquo;why do you not adopt one to that end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With narrow-minded covetousness, he replied that nowadays he had enough to
      do to keep himself, and that it would be more reasonable to get some one
      to adopt HIM.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I exclaimed, ignoring this ill-timed levity, &ldquo;who, when you have
      Passed Beyond, will worship you and transmit to your spirit the
      necessities of life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor,&rdquo; he replied, using the term of familiar dignity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made
      shift without being worshipped for five and sixty years, and it worries me
      a sight more to know who will transmit to my body the necessities of life
      until I HAVE Passed Beyond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The final consequences of your self-opinionated carelessness,&rdquo; this
      person continued, &ldquo;will be that your neglected and unprovided shadow,
      finding itself no longer acceptable to the society of the better class
      demons, will wander forth, and allying itself in despair to the
      companionship of a band of outcasts like itself, will be driven to dwell
      in unclean habitations and to subsist on the uncertain bounty of the
      charitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied the irredeemable person before me. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help
      its troubles. I have to do all that myself as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless this fanaticism contains the secret of the ease with which these
      barbarians have possessed themselves of the greater part of the earth, and
      have even planted their assertive emblems on one or two spots in our own
      Flowery Kingdom. What, O my esteemed parent, what can a brave but devout
      and demon-fearing nation do when opposed to a people who are quite
      prepared to die without first leaving an adequate posterity to tend their
      shrines and offer incense? Assuredly, as a neighbouring philosopher once
      had occasion to remark, using for his purpose a metaphor so
      technically-involved that I must leave the interpretation until we meet,
      &ldquo;It may be war, but it isn&rsquo;t cricket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inevitable outcome, naturally, is that the Island must be the
      wandering-place of myriads of spirits possessing no recognised standing,
      and driven by want&mdash;having none to transmit them offerings&mdash;to
      the most degraded subterfuges. It is freely admitted that there is
      scarcely an ancient building not the abode of one or more of these
      abandoned demons, doubtless well-disposed in the first instance, and
      capable of becoming really beneficent Forces until they were driven to
      despair by obstinate neglect. A society of very honourable persons (to
      which this one has unobtrusively contributed a gift), exists for the
      purpose of searching out the most distressing and meritorious cases among
      them, and removing them, where possible, to a more congenial spot. The
      remarkable fact, to this person&rsquo;s mind, is, that with the air and every
      available space around absolutely packed with demons (as certainly must be
      the prevailing state of things), the manifestations of their malignity and
      vice are, if anything, rather less evident here than in our own favoured
      country, where we do all in our power to satisfy their wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening I found myself seated next to a maiden of prepossessing
      vivacity, who was spoken of as being one of a kindred but not identical
      race. Filled with the incredible profanity of those around, and hoping to
      find among a nation so alluringly high-spirited a more congenial elevation
      of mind, I at length turned to her and said, &ldquo;Do not regard the question
      as one of unworthy curiosity, for this person&rsquo;s inside is white and
      funereal with his fears; but do you, of your allied race, worship your
      ancestors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maiden spent a moment in conscientious thought. &ldquo;No, Mr. Kong,&rdquo; she
      replied, with a most commendable sigh of unfeigned regret, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say
      that we do. I guess it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re too new. Mine, now, only go back
      two generations, and they were mostly in lard. If they were old and
      baronial it might be different, but I can&rsquo;t imagine myself worshipping an
      ancestor in lard.&rdquo; (This doubtless refers to some barbaric method of
      embalming.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your wide and enlightened countrymen?&rdquo; I asked, unable to restrain a
      passion of pure-bred despair. &ldquo;Do they also so regard the obligation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; replied the maiden, with an honourable indication
      towards my emotion. &ldquo;But of course when a girl marries into the European
      aristocracy, she and all her folk worship her husband&rsquo;s ancestors, until
      every one about is fairly dizzy with the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is largely owing to the graceful and virtuous conversation of these
      lesser ones that this person&rsquo;s knowledge of the exact position which the
      ceremonial etiquette of the country demands on various occasions is
      becoming so proficiently enlarged. It is true that they of my own sex do
      not hesitate to inquire with penetrating assiduousness into certain of the
      manners and customs of our land, but these for the most part do not lead
      to a conversation in any way profitable to my discreeter understanding.
      Those of the inner chamber, on the other hand, while not scrupling to
      question me on the details of dress, the braiding and gumming of the hair,
      the style and variety of the stalls of merchants, the wearing of jade,
      gold, and crystal ornaments and flowers about the head, smoking, and other
      matters affecting our lesser ones, very magnanimously lead my
      contemplation back to a more custom-established topic if by any hap in my
      ambitious ignorance I outstep it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a manner it chanced on a former occasion that I sat side by side
      with a certain maiden awaiting the return of others who had withdrawn for
      a period. The season was that of white rains, and the fire being lavishly
      extended about the grate we had harmoniously arranged ourselves before it,
      while this person, at the repeated and explicit encouragement of the
      maiden, spoke openly of such details of the inner chamber as he has
      already indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, Mr. Ho&rdquo; (thus the maiden, being unacquainted with the actual
      facts, consistently addressed me), &ldquo;that ladies&rsquo; feet are relentlessly
      compressed until they finally assume the proportions and appearance of two
      bulbs?&rdquo; and as she spoke she absent-mindedly regarded her own slippers,
      which were out-thrust somewhat to receive the action of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a matter which cannot reasonably be denied,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and it is
      doubtless owing to this effect that they are designated &lsquo;Golden Lilies.&rsquo; 
      Yet when this observance has been slowly and painfully accomplished, the
      extremities in question are not less small but infinitely less graceful
      than the select and naturally-formed pair which this person sees before
      him.&rdquo; And at the ingeniously-devised compliment (which, not to become
      large-headed in self-imagination, it must be admitted was revealed to me
      as available for practically all occasions by the really invaluable
      Quang-Tsun), I bowed unremittingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Mr. Ho!&rdquo; exclaimed the maiden, and paused abruptly at the sound of her
      words, as though they were inept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In many other ways a comparison equally irreproachable to the exalted
      being at my side might be sought out,&rdquo; I continued, suddenly forming the
      ill-destined judgment that I was no less competent than the more
      experienced Quang-Tsun to contrive delicate offerings of speech. &ldquo;Their
      hair is rope like in its lack of spontaneous curve, their eyes as
      deficient in lustre as a half-shuttered window; their hands are
      exceedingly inferior in colour, and both on the left side, as it may be
      expressed; their legs&mdash;&rdquo; but at this point the maiden drew herself so
      hastily into herself that I had no alternative but to conclude that unless
      I reverted in some way the enterprise was in peril of being inharmoniously
      conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ho,&rdquo; said the maiden, after contemplating her inward thoughts for a
      moment, &ldquo;you are a foreigner, and you cannot be expected to know by
      instinct what may and what may not be openly expressed in this country.
      Therefore, although the obligation is not alluring, I think it kinder to
      tell you that the matters which formed the subject of your last words are
      never to be referred to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this rebuke I again bowed persistently, for it did not appear
      reasonable to me that I could in any other way declare myself without
      violating the imposed command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only are they never openly referred to,&rdquo; continued the maiden, who in
      spite of the declared no allurement of the subject did not seem disposed
      to abandon it at once, &ldquo;but among the most select they are, by unspoken
      agreement, regarded as &lsquo;having no actual existence,&rsquo; as you yourself would
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; protested this person, somewhat puzzled, &ldquo;to one who has witnessed
      the highly-achieved attitudes of those within your Halls of Harmony, and
      in an unyielding search for knowledge has addressed himself even to the
      advertisement pages of the ladies&rsquo; papers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maiden waved her hand magnanimously. &ldquo;In your land, as you have told
      me, there are many things, not really existing, which for politeness you
      assume to be. In a like but converse manner this is to be so regarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her voluminously. &ldquo;The etiquette of this country is as involved
      as the spoken tongue,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for both are composed chiefly of
      exceptions to a given rule. It was formerly impressed upon this person, as
      a guiding principle, that that which is unseen is not to be discussed; yet
      it is not held in disrepute to allude to so intimate and secluded an organ
      as the heart, for no further removed than yesterday he heard the
      deservedly popular sea-lieutenant in the act of declaring to you, upon his
      knees, that you were utterly devoid of such a possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this inoffensively-conveyed suggestion, the fire opposite had all the
      appearance of suddenly reflecting itself into the maiden&rsquo;s face with a
      most engaging concentration, while at the same time she stamped her foot
      in ill-concealed rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been listening at the door!&rdquo; she cried impetuously, &ldquo;and I shall
      never forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To no extent,&rdquo; I declared hastily (for although I had indeed been
      listening at the door, it appeared, after the weight which she set upon
      the incident, more honourable that I should deny it in order to conciliate
      her mind). &ldquo;It so chanced that for the moment this person had forgotten
      whether the handle he was grasping was of the push-out or turn-in variety,
      and in the involvement a few words of no particular or enduring
      significance settled lightly upon his perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; she replied in high-souled liberality, while her eyes
      scintillated towards me with a really all-overpowering radiance, &ldquo;I will
      forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have an old but very appropriate saying, &lsquo;To every man the voice of
      one maiden carries further than the rolling of thunder,&rsquo;&rdquo; I remarked in a
      significantly restrained tone; for, although conscious that the
      circumstance was becoming more menace-laden than I had any previous
      intention, I found myself to be incapable of extrication. &ldquo;Florence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she exclaimed quickly, raising her polished hand with an undeniable
      gesture of reproof, &ldquo;you must not call me by my christian name, Mr. Ho.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; replied this person, with a confessedly stubborn inelegance, &ldquo;you
      call me by the name of Ho.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes became ox-like in an utter absence of almond outline. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
      said gazing, &ldquo;but that&mdash;that is not your christian name, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a position of speaking&mdash;this one being as a matter of fact a
      discreditable follower of the sublime Confucius&mdash;it may be so
      regarded,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;inasmuch as it is the milk-name of childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you always put it last,&rdquo; she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Being irrevocably born with the family name of
      Kong, it is thought more reasonable that that should stand first. After
      that, others are attached as the various contingencies demand it, as Ho
      upon participating in the month-age feast, the book-name of Tsin at a
      later period, Paik upon taking a degree, and so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, Mr. Kong,&rdquo; said the maiden, adding, with what at the
      time certainly struck this person as shallow-witted prejudice. &ldquo;Of course
      it is really quite your own fault for being so tospy-turvily arranged in
      every way. But, to return to the subject, why should not one speak of
      one&rsquo;s heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied this person, colouring deeply, and scarcely able to
      control his unbearable offence that so irreproachably-moulded a creature
      should openly refer to the detail, &ldquo;because it is a gross and unrefined
      particular, much more internal and much less pleasantly-outlined than
      those extremities whose spoken equivalent shall henceforth be an abandoned
      word from my lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, in any case, it is not the actual organ that one infers,&rdquo; protested
      the maiden. &ldquo;As the seat of the affections, passions, virtues, and will,
      it is the conventional emblem of every thought and emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I cried, forgetting in the face of so heterodox an
      assertion that it would be well to walk warily at every point. &ldquo;That is
      the stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the maiden, burying her face in a gracefully-perfumed
      remnant of lace, to so overwhelming a degree that for the moment I feared
      she might become involved in the dizzy falling. &ldquo;Never, by any mischance,
      use that word again the society of the presentable, Mr. Kong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ceremonial usage of my own land of the Heavenly Dynasty is
      proverbially elaborate,&rdquo; I said, with a gesture of self-abasement, &ldquo;but in
      comparison with yours it may be regarded as an undeviating walk when
      opposed to a stately and many-figured dance. Among the company of the
      really excessively select (in which must ever be included the one whom I
      am now addressing), it becomes difficult for an outcast of my illimitable
      obtuseness to move to one side or the other without putting his foot into
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; exclaimed the maiden, in fragrant encouragement, &ldquo;I think you are
      getting on very nicely, Mr. Kong, and one does not look for absolute
      conformance from a foreigner&mdash;especially one who is so extremely
      foreign. If I can help you with anything&mdash;of course I could not even
      speak as I have done to an ordinary stranger, but with one of a distant
      race it seems different&mdash;if I can tell you anything that will save
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all-exalted,&rdquo; I replied, with seemly humility, &ldquo;and virtue and
      wisdom press out your temples on either side. Certainly, since I have
      learned that the heart is so poetically regarded, I have been assailed by
      a fear lest other organs which I have hitherto despised might be used in a
      similar way. Now, as regards liver&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only used with bacon,&rdquo; replied the maiden, rising abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kidneys?&rdquo; suggested this person diffidently, really anxious to detain her
      footsteps, although from her expression it did not rest assured that the
      incident was taking an actually auspicious movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need speak of those except at breakfast,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;but I hear the others returning, and I must really go to dress for
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among the barbarians many keep books wherein to inscribe their deep and
      beautiful thoughts. This person had therefore provided himself with one
      also, and, drawing it forth, he now added to a page of many other
      interesting compositions: &ldquo;Maidens of immaculate refinement do not
      hesitate to admit before a person of a different sex that they are on the
      point of changing their robes. The liver is in some intricate way an
      emblem representing bacon, or together with it the two stand for a widely
      differing analogy. Among those of the highest exclusiveness kidneys are
      never alluded to after the tenth gong-stroke of the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sincerely ingrained trust that the scenes of dignity, opulence, and
      wisdom, set forth in these superficial letters, are not unsettling your
      intellect and causing you to yearn for a fuller existence.

    <h2>
      LETTER VI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning this person&rsquo;s well-sustained efforts to discover
 further demons. The behaviour of those invoked on two
 occasions.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;In an early letter I made some reference to a
      variety of demon invoked by certain of the barbarians. As this matter
      aroused your congenial interest, I have since privately bent my mind
      incessantly to the discovery of others; but this has been by no means
      easy, for, touching the more intimate details of the subject, the
      barbarians frequently maintain a narrow-minded suspicion. Many whom I have
      approached feign to become amused or have evaded a deliberate answer under
      the subterfuge of a jest; yet, whenever I would have lurked by night in
      their temples or among the enclosed spaces of their tombs to learn more,
      at a given signal one in authority has approached me with anxiety and
      mistrust engraved upon his features, and, disregarding my unassuming
      protest that I would remain alone in a contemplative reverie, has
      signified that so devout an exercise is contrary to their written law.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion only did this person seem to hold himself poised on the
      very edge of a fuller enlightenment. This was when, in the venerable
      company of several benevolent persons, he was being taken from place to
      place to see the more important buildings, and to observe the societies of
      artificers labouring at their crafts. The greater part of the day had
      already been spent in visiting temples, open spaces reserved to children
      and those whose speech, appearance, and general manner of behaving make it
      desirable that they should be set apart from the contact of the
      impressionable, halls containing relics and emblems of the past, places of
      no particular size or attraction but described as being of unparalleled
      historic interest, and the stalls of the more reputable venders of
      merchandise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless, with observing so many details of a conflicting nature, this
      person&rsquo;s discriminating faculties had become obscured, but towards evening
      he certainly understood that we sought the company of an assembly of those
      who had been selected from all the Empire to pronounce definitely upon
      matters of supreme import. The building before which our chariot stopped
      had every appearance of being worthy of so exceptional a gathering, and
      with a most affluent joy that I should at last be able to glean a decisive
      pronouncement, I evaded those who had accompanied me, and, mingling
      self-reliantly with the throng inside, I quickly surrounded myself with
      many of the wisest-looking, and begged that they would open their heads
      freely and express their innermost opinions upon the subject of demons of
      all kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I had admittedly hoped that these persons would not conceal
      themselves behind the wings of epigram or intangible prevarication, I was
      far from being prepared for the candour with which they greeted me, and
      although by long usage I am reasonably unconcerned at the proximity of any
      of our own recognised genii, it is not to be denied that my organs of
      ferocity grew small and unstable at the revelations.
    </p>
    <p>
      From their words it appeared that the spot on which we stood had long been
      the recognised centre and meeting-place for every class of abandoned and
      objectionable spirit of the universe. Not only this, but several of the
      persons who had gathered around were confidently pointed out as the
      earthly embodiment of various diabolical Forces, while others cheerfully
      admitted that they themselves were the shadows of certain illustrious ones
      who had long Passed Above, and all united in declaring that those who
      moved among them wearing the distinction of a dark blue uniform were Evil
      Beings of a most ghoulish and repulsive type. Indeed, as I looked more
      closely, I could see that not only those pointed out, but all standing
      around, had expressions immeasurably more in keeping with a band of
      outcast spirits than suggestive of an assembly representing wisdom and
      dignified ease. At that moment, however, a most inelegant movement was
      caused by one suddenly declaring that he had recognised this one who is
      inscribing his experiences to be the apparition of a certain great
      reformer who during the period of his ordinary existence had received the
      name of Guy Fawkes, and amid a tumult of overwhelming acclamation a
      proposal was raised that I should be carried around in triumph and
      afterwards initiated into the observance of a time-honoured custom.
      Although it had now become doubtful to what end the adventure was really
      tending, this person would have submitted himself agreeably to the
      participation had not the blue-apparelled band cleft their way into the
      throng just as I was about to be borne off in triumph, and forming
      themselves into a ringed barrier around me they presently succeeded in
      rearranging the contending elements and in restoring me to the society of
      my friends. To these persons they complained with somewhat unreasoning
      acrimony that I had been exciting the inmates into a state of rebellion
      with wild imaginings, and for the first time I then began to understand
      that an important error had been perpetrated by some one, and that instead
      of being a meeting-place for those upholding the wisdom and authority of
      the country, the building was in reality an establishment for the mentally
      defective and those of treacherous instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time after this occurrence I failed to regard the subject of
      demons and allied Forces in any but a spirit of complete no enthusiasm,
      but more recently my interest and research have been enlarged by the zeal
      and supernatural conversation of a liberal-minded person who sought my
      prosaic society with indefatigable persistence. When we had progressed to
      such a length that the one might speak of affairs without the other at
      once interposing that he himself had also unfortunately come out quite
      destitute of money, this stranger, who revealed to me that his name was
      Glidder, but that in the company of a certain chosen few he was known
      intimately as the Keeper of the Salograma, approached me confidentially,
      and inquired whether we of our Central Kingdom were in the habit of
      receiving manifestations from the spirits of those who had Passed Beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the unassumed ingenuousness of this remark I suffered my impassiveness
      to relax, as I replied with well-established pride that although a country
      which neglected its ancestors might doubtless be able to produce more of
      the ordinary or graveyard spectres, we were unapproachable for the diverse
      forms and malignant enmity of our apparitions. Of invisible beings alone,
      I continued tolerantly, we had the distinction of being harassed by
      upwards of seven hundred clearly-defined varieties, while the commoner
      inflictions of demons, shades, visions, warlocks, phantoms, sprites, imps,
      phenomena, ghosts, and reflections passed almost without comment; and
      touching our admitted national speciality of dragons, the honour of
      supremacy had never been questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, the agreeable person said that the pleasure he derived from
      meeting me was all-excelling, and that I must certainly accompany him to a
      meeting-place of this same chosen few the following evening, when, by the
      means of sacred expedients, they hoped to invoke the presence of some
      departed spirits, and perchance successfully raise a tangible vision or
      two. To so fair-minded a proposal I held myself acquiescently, and then
      inquired where the meeting-place in question was destined to be&mdash;whether
      in a ruined and abandoned sanctuary, or upon some precipitous spot of
      desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inquiry was gracefully intended, but a passing cloud of unworthy
      annoyance revealed itself upon the upper part of the other&rsquo;s expression as
      he replied, &ldquo;We, the true seekers, despise theatrical accessories, and, as
      a matter of act, I couldn&rsquo;t well get away from the office in time to go
      anywhere far. To-morrow we meet at my place in the Camden Road. It&rsquo;s only
      a three-half-penny tram stage from the Euston and Tottenham Court corner,
      so it couldn&rsquo;t be much more convenient for you.&rdquo; He thereupon gave me an
      inscribed fragment of paper and mentioned the appointed hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why I am particularly anxious for you to come to-morrow,&rdquo;
       he said as we were each departing from one another. &ldquo;Pash&mdash;he&rsquo;s the
      Reader of the Veda among us&mdash;and his people have got hold of a Greek
      woman (they SAY she is a princess, of course), who can do a lot of things
      with flowers and plate glass. They are bringing her for the first time
      to-morrow, and it struck me that if I have YOU there already when they
      arrive&mdash;you&rsquo;ll come in your national costume by the way?&mdash;it
      will be a considerable set-off. Since his daughter was presented to the
      duchess at the opening of a bazaar, there has been no holding Pash; why he
      was ever elected Reader of the Books, I don&rsquo;t know. Er&mdash;we have had
      scoffers sometimes, but I trust I may rely upon you not to laugh at
      anything you may not happen to agree with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With conscientious dignity I replied that I had only really laughed seven
      times in my life, and therefore the entertainment was one which I was not
      likely to embark upon hastily or with inadequate cause. He immediately
      expressed a seemly regret that the detail had been spoken, and again
      assuring him that at the stated hour I would present myself at the house
      bearing the symbol engraved upon the card, we definitely parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, as a matter of fact, I did not so present myself at the exact hour,
      chiefly concerns the uncouth and arbitrary-minded charioteer who
      controlled the movements of the vehicle to which the one whom I was
      seeking had explicitly referred; for at an angle in the road he suffered
      the horses to draw us aside into a path which did not correspond to the
      engraved signs upon the card, nor by any word of persuasion could he be
      prevailed upon to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, without any possible reproach upon the manner in which I was
      conducting the enterprise, it came about that by the time I reached the
      spot indicated, all those persons who had been spoken of as constituting a
      chosen band were assembled, and with them the barbarian princess.
      Nevertheless, this person was irreproachably greeted, and the maiden
      indicated even spoke a few words to him in an outside tongue. Being
      necessarily unacquainted with the import of the remark I spread out my
      hands with a sign of harmonious sympathy and smiled agreeably, whereat she
      appeared to receive an added esteem from the faces of those around
      (excluding those directly of the House of Glidder), and was thereby
      encouraged to speak similarly at intervals, this person each time replying
      in a like fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he then a Guide of the Way, also, princess?&rdquo; said the one Pash, who
      had noted the occurrence; to which the maiden replied, &ldquo;To a degree, yet
      lacking the Innermost Mysteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently it was announced that all things were fittingly prepared in
      another chamber. Here, upon a table of polished wood, stood on the one
      side a round stone with certain markings, a group of inscribed books, and
      various other emblems; and on the other side a bowl of water, a sphere of
      crystal, pieces of unwritten parchment, and behind all, and at a distance
      away, a sheet of transparent glass, greater in height than an ordinary
      person and as wide. When all were seated&mdash;the one who had enticed me
      among them placing himself before the stone, the person Pash guarding the
      books, the barbarian princess being surrounded by her symbols and alone in
      a self-imposed solitude, and the others at various points&mdash;the lights
      were subdued and the appearances awaited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would scarcely be respectful, O my enlightened father, to take up your
      well-spent leisure by a too prolific account of the matters which
      followed, they being in no way dissimilar from the manifestations by which
      the uninitiated little ones of Yuen-ping are wont to amuse themselves and
      pass the winter evenings. From time to time harmonious sounds could be
      plainly detected, flowers and branches of wood were scattered sparsely
      here and there, persons claimed that passing objects had touched their
      faces, and misshapen forms of smoke-like density (which some confidently
      recognised as the outlines of departed ones whom they had known), revealed
      themselves against the glass. When this had been accomplished, the lights
      were recalled, and the barbarian maiden, sinking into a condition of
      languor, announced and foretold events and happenings upon which she was
      consulted, sometimes replying by spoken words, at others suffering her
      hand to trace them lightly upon the parchment sheets. Thus, to an inquirer
      it was announced that one, Aunt Mary, in the Upper Air, was well and
      happy, though undeniably pained at the action of Cousin William in the
      matter of the freehold houses, and more than sceptical how his marriage
      would turn out. Another was advised that although the interest on Consols
      was admittedly lower than that anticipated by those controlling the
      destines of a new venture entitled, The Great Rosy Dawn Gold Mine
      Development Syndicate, and the name certainly less poetically inspiring,
      the advising spirits were of the opinion that the former enterprise would
      prove the more stable of the two, and, in any case, they recommended the
      person in question to begin by placing not more than half of her life&rsquo;s
      savings into the mine. The family of the House of Pash was assured that
      beneficent spirits surrounded them at every turn, and that their good
      deeds were not suffered to fall unfruitfully to the ground; while many
      bearing the name of Glidder, on the other hand, were reproved by one who
      had known them in infancy for the offences of jealousy, ostentation, vain
      thoughts, shallowness of character, and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, revered, as there seemed to be no reasonable indication of any
      barbarian phantom of weight or authority appearing&mdash;nothing, indeed,
      beyond what a person in our country, of no admitted skill, would
      accomplish in the penetrating light of day with two others holding his
      hands, and a third reposing upon his head, I formed the perhaps immature
      judgment that the one to whom I was indebted for the entertainment would
      be suffering a grievous frustration of his hopes and a diminution of his
      outward authority. Therefore, without sufficient consideration of the
      restricted surroundings, as it afterwards appeared, I threw myself into a
      retrospective vision, and floating unencumbered through space, I sought
      for Kwan Kiang-ti, the Demon of the Waters, upon whom I might fittingly
      call, as I was given into his keeping by the ceremony of spirit-adoption
      at an early age. Meeting an influence which I recognised to be an
      indication of his presence, in the vicinity of the Eighth Region, I
      obsequiously entreated that he would reveal himself without delay, and
      then, convinced of his sympathetic intervention, I suffered my spirit to
      recall itself, and revived into the condition of an ordinary existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have among us this evening, my friends,&rdquo; the one Pash was saying, &ldquo;a
      very remarkable lady&mdash;if I may use so democratic a term in the
      connection&mdash;to whom the limits of Time and Space are empty words, and
      before whose supreme Will the most portentous Forces of Occult Nature
      mutely confess themselves her attending slaves&mdash;&rdquo; But at that moment
      the rolling drums of Kiang-ti&rsquo;s thunder drowned his words, although he
      subsequently raised his voice above it to entreat that any knives or other
      articles of a bright and attractive kind should at once be removed to a
      place of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heralded by these continuous sounds, and accompanied by innumerable
      flashes of lightning, the genius presently manifested himself, leisurely
      developing out of the air around. He appeared in his favourite guise of an
      upright dragon, his scales being arranged in rows of nine each way, a
      pearl showing within his throat, and upon his head the wooden bar. The
      lights were extinguished incapably by the rain which fell continually in
      his presence, but from his body there proceeded a luminous breath which
      sufficiently revealed the various incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kong Ho,&rdquo; said this opportune vision, speaking with a voice like the
      beating of a brass gong, &ldquo;the course you have adopted is an unusual one,
      but the weight and regularity of your offerings have merit in my eyes.
      Nevertheless, if your invocation is only the outcome of a shallow vanity
      or a profane love of display, nothing can save you from a painful death.
      Speak now, fully and without evasion, and fear nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amiable Being,&rdquo; said this person, kow-towing profoundly, &ldquo;the matter was
      designed to the end only that your incomparable versatility might be
      fittingly displayed. These barbarians sought vainly to raise phantoms
      capable of any useful purpose, whereupon I, jealous of your superior
      omnipotence, judged it would be an unseemly neglect not to inform you of
      the opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the demon affably. &ldquo;All doubt in the matter shall now
      be set at rest. Could any more convincing act be found than that I should
      breath upon these barbarians and reduce them instantly to a scattering of
      thin white ashes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly it would be a conclusive testimony,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;yet in that
      case consider how inadequate a witness could be borne to your enlightened
      condescension, when none would be left but one to whom the spoken language
      of this Island is more in the nature of a trap than a comfortable
      vehicle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reasoning is profound, Kong Ho,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;yet abundant proof
      shall not be wanting.&rdquo; With these words he raised his hand, and
      immediately the air became filled with an overwhelming shower of those
      productions with which Kwan Kiang-ti&rsquo;s name is chiefly associated&mdash;shells
      and pebbles of all kinds, lotus and other roots from the river banks,
      weeds from seas of greater depths, fish of interminable variety from both
      fresh and bitter waters, all falling in really embarrassing abundance, and
      mingled with an incessant rain of sand and water. In the midst of this the
      demon suddenly passed away, striking the table as he went, so that it was
      scarred with the brand of a five-clawed hand, shattering all the objects
      upon it (excepting the stone and the books, which he doubtless regarded as
      sacred to some extent), and leaving the room involved in a profound
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love av the saints&mdash;for the love av the saints, save us from
      the yellow devils!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice from the spot where last the
      barbarian princess had reclined, and upon this person going to her
      assistance with lights it was presently revealed that she alone had
      remained seated, the others having all assembled themselves beneath the
      table in spite of the incapability of the space at their disposal. Most of
      the weightier evidences of Kwan Kiang-ti&rsquo;s majestic presence had faded
      away, though the table retained the print of his impressive hand, many
      objects remained irretrievably torn apart, and in a distant corner of the
      room an insignificant heap of shells and seaweed still lingered. From the
      floor covering a sprinkling of the purest Fuh-chow sand rose at every
      step, the salt dew of the Tung-Hai still dropped from the surroundings,
      and, at a later period, a shore crab was found endeavouring to make its
      escape undetected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Convinced that the success of the manifestation would have enlarged the
      one Glidder&rsquo;s esteem towards me to an inexpressible degree, I now
      approached him with words of self-deprecation ready on my tongue, but
      before he spoke I became aware, from the nature of his glance, that the
      provision had been unnecessary, for already his face had begun to assume,
      to a most distended amount, the expression which I had long recognised as
      a synonym that some detail had been regarded at a different angle from
      that anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; he began in a somewhat heavily-laden voice, after he had
      assured himself that the person who was speaking was himself, and his
      external attributes unchanged, &ldquo;May I ask, sir&rdquo; (and at this title, which
      is untranslatable in its many-sided significance when technically
      employed, I recognised that all complimentary intercourse might be
      regarded as having closed), &ldquo;whether you accept the responsibility of
      these proceedings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touching the appearance which has so essentially contributed to the
      success of the occasion, it is undeniably due to this one&rsquo;s foresight,&rdquo; I
      replied modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me tell you, sir, that I consider it an outrage&mdash;a
      dastardly outrage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; protested this person with retiring assertiveness, &ldquo;the expressed
      object of the ceremony, as it stood before my intelligence, was for the
      set purpose of invoking spirits and raising certain visions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spirits!&rdquo; exclaimed the one before me with an accent of concentrated
      aversion; &ldquo;yes, spirits; impalpable, civilised, genuine spirits, who
      manifest themselves through recognised media, and are conformable to the
      usages of the best drawing-room society&mdash;yes. But not demons, sir;
      not Chinese devils in the Camden Road&mdash;no. Truth and Light at any
      cost, not paganism. It&rsquo;s perfectly scandalous. Look at the mahogany table&mdash;ruined;
      look at the wall-paper&mdash;conventional mackerels with a fishing-net
      background, new this spring&mdash;soused; look at the Brussels carpet,
      seventeen six by twenty-five&mdash;saturated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you, Mr. Glidder,&rdquo; here interposed the individual
      Pash. &ldquo;I was watching you, sir, closely the whole time, and I have my
      suspicions about how it was done. I don&rsquo;t know whether Mr. Glidder has any
      legal redress, but I should certainly advise him to see his solicitors
      to-morrow, and in the meantime&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my guest,&rdquo; exclaimed the one whose hospitality I was enjoying, &ldquo;and
      while he is beneath my roof he is sacred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not think that it would be kind to detain him any longer in his
      wet things,&rdquo; said another of the household, with pointed malignity, and
      accepting this as an omen of departure, I withdrew myself, bowing
      repeatedly, but offering no closer cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through a torn sleeve one drops a purse of gold,&rdquo; it is well said; and as
      if to prove to a deeper end that misfortune is ever double-handed, this
      incapable being, involved in thoughts of funereal density, bent his
      footsteps to an inaccurate turning, and after much wandering was compelled
      to pass the night upon a desolate heath&mdash;but that would be the matter
      of another narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an insidious doubt whether, after all, the far-seeing Kwan Kiang-ti&rsquo;s
      first impulse would not have been the most satisfactory conclusion to the
      enterprise.

      LETTER VII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning warfare, both as waged by ourselves and by a
 nation devoid of true civilisation. The aged man and the
 meeting and the parting of our ways. The instance of the one
 who expressed emotion by leaping.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;You are omniscient, but I cannot regard the fear
      which you express in your beautifully-written letter, bearing the sign of
      the eleventh day of the seventh moon, as anything more than the imaginings
      prompted by a too-lavish supper of your favourite shark&rsquo;s fin and peanut
      oil. Unless the dexterously-elusive attributes of the genial-spoken
      persons high in office at Pekin have deteriorated contemptibly since this
      one&rsquo;s departure, it is quite impossible for our great and enlightened
      Empire to be drawn into a conflict with the northern barbarians whom you
      indicate, against our will. When the matter becomes urgent, doubtless a
      prince of the Imperial line will loyally suffer himself to Pass Above, and
      during the period of ceremonial mourning for so pure and exalted an
      official it would indeed be an unseemly desecration to engage in any
      public business. If this failed, and an ultimatum were pressed with truly
      savage contempt for all that is sacred and refined, it might be well next
      to consider the health even of the sublime Emperor himself (or, perhaps
      better, that of the select and ever-present Dowager Empress); but should
      the barbarians still advance, and, setting the usages of civilised warfare
      at defiance, threaten an engagement in the midst of this unparalleled
      calamity, there will be no alternative but to have a formidable rebellion
      in the Capital. All the barbarian powers will then assemble as usual, and
      in the general involvement none dare move alone, and everything will have
      to be regarded as being put back to where it was before. It is well said,
      &ldquo;The broken vessel can never be made whole, but it may be delicately
      arranged so that another shall displace it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These barbarians, less resourceful in device, have only recently emerged
      from a conflict into which they do not hesitate to admit they were drawn
      despite their protests. Such incompetence is characteristic of their
      methods throughout. Not in any way disguising their purpose, they at once
      sent out an army of those whom could be the readiest seized, certainly
      furnishing them with weapons, charms to use in case of emergency, and
      three-coloured standards (their adversaries adopting a white banner to
      symbolise the conciliation of their attitude, and displaying both freely
      in every extremity), but utterly neglecting to teach them the arts of
      painting their bodies with awe-inspiring forms, of imitating the cries of
      wild animals as they attacked, of clashing their weapons together with
      menacing vigour, or any of the recognised artifices by which terror may be
      struck into the ranks of an awaiting foeman. The result was that which the
      prudent must have foreseen. The more accomplished enemy, without exposing
      themselves to any unnecessary inconvenience, gained many advantages by
      their intrepid power of dissimulation&mdash;arranging their garments and
      positions in such a way that they had the appearance of attacking when in
      reality they were effecting a prudent retreat; rapidly concealing
      themselves among the earth on the approach of an overwhelming force;
      becoming openly possessed with the prophetic vision of an assured final
      victory whenever it could be no longer concealed that matters were
      becoming very desperate indeed; and gaining an effective respite when all
      other ways of extrication were barred against them by the stratagem of
      feigning that they were other than those whom they had at first appeared
      to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the adventure was not progressing pleasantly for those
      chiefly concerned at home. With the earliest tidings of repulse it was
      discovered that in the haste of embarkation the wrong persons had been
      sent, all those who were really the fittest to command remaining behind,
      and many of these did not hesitate to write to the printed papers,
      resolutely admitting that they themselves were in every way better
      qualified to bring the expedition to a successful end, at the same time
      skilfully pointing out how the disasters which those in the field had
      incurred could easily have been avoided by acting in a precisely contrary
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the emergency the most far-seeing recommended a more unbending policy
      of extermination. Among these, one in particular, a statesman bearing an
      illustrious name of two-edged import, distinguished himself by the liberal
      broad-mindedness of his opinions, and for the time he even did not flinch
      from making himself excessively unpopular by the wide and sweeping variety
      of his censure. &ldquo;We are confessedly a barbarian nation,&rdquo; fearlessly
      declared this unprejudiced person (who, although entitled by hereditary
      right to carry a banner on the field of battle, with patriotic
      self-effacement preferred to remain at home and encourage those who were
      fighting by pointing out their inadequacy to the task and the extreme
      unlikelihood of their ever accomplishing it), &ldquo;and in order to achieve our
      purpose speedily it is necessary to resort to the methods of barbarism.&rdquo;
       The most effective measure, as he proceeded to explain with
      well-thought-out detail, would be to capture all those least capable of
      resistance, concentrate them into a given camp, and then at an agreed
      signal reduce the entire assembly to what he termed, in a passage of
      high-minded eloquence, &ldquo;a smoking hecatomb of women and children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His advice was pointed with a crafty insight, for not only would such a
      course have brought the stubborn enemy to a realisation of the weakness of
      their position and thus paved the way to a dignified peace, but by the act
      itself few would have been left to hand down the tradition of a relentless
      antagonism. Yet with incredible obtuseness his advice was ignored and he
      himself was referred to at the time by those who regarded the matter from
      a different angle, with a scarcely-veiled dislike, which towards many of
      his followers took the form of building materials and other dissentient
      messages whenever they attempted to raise their voices publicly. As an
      inevitable result the conquest of the country took years, where it would
      have been moons had the more truly humane policy been adopted, commerce
      and the arts languished, and in the end so little spoil was taken that it
      was more common to meet six mendicants wearing the honourable
      embellishment of the campaign than to see one captured slave maiden
      offered for sale in the market places&mdash;indeed, even to this day the
      deficiency is clearly admitted and openly referred to as The Great
      &ldquo;Domestic&rdquo; Problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      At various times during my residence here I have been filled with a most
      acute gratification when the words of those around have seemed to indicate
      that they recognised the undoubted superiority of the laws and
      institutions of our enlightened country. Sometimes, it is true, upon a
      more detailed investigation of the incident, it has presently appeared
      that either I had misunderstood the exact nature of their sentiments or
      they had slow-wittedly failed to grasp the precise operation of the
      enactment I had described; but these exceptions are clearly the outcome of
      their superficial training, and do not affect the fact my feeble and
      frequently even eccentric arguments are at length certainly moving the
      more intelligent into an admission of what constitutes true justice and
      refinement. It is not to be denied that here and there exists a prejudice
      against our customs even in the minds of the studious; but as this is
      invariably the shadow of misconception, it has frequently been my
      sympathetic privilege to promote harmony by means of the inexorable logic
      of fact and reason. &ldquo;But are not your officials uncompromisingly opposed
      to the freedom of the Press?&rdquo; said one who conversed with me on the
      varying phases of the two countries, and knowing that in his eyes this
      would constitute an unendurable offence, I at once appeased his mind. &ldquo;By
      no means,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;if anything, the exact contrary is the case. As a
      matter of reality, of course, there is no Press now, the all-seeing Board
      of Censors having wisely determined that it was not stimulating to the
      public welfare; but if such an institution was permitted to exist you may
      rest genially assured that nothing could exceed the lenient toleration
      which all in office would extend towards it.&rdquo; A similar instance of
      malicious inaccuracy is widely spoken of regarding our lesser ones. &ldquo;Is it
      really a fact, Mr. Kong,&rdquo; exclaimed a maiden of magnanimous condescension,
      to this person recently, &ldquo;that we poor women are despised in your country,
      and that among the working-classes female children are even systematically
      abandoned as soon as they are born?&rdquo; Suffering my features to express
      amusement at this unending calumny, I indicated my violent contempt
      towards the one who had first uttered it. &ldquo;So far from despising them,&rdquo; I
      continued, with ingratiating gallantry, &ldquo;we recognise that they are quite
      necessary for the purposes of preparing our food, carrying weighty
      burdens, and the like; and how grotesque an action would it be for poor
      but affectionate parents to abandon one who in a few years&rsquo; time could be
      sold at a really remunerative profit, this, indeed, being the principal
      means of sustenance in many frugal families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion I had seated myself upon a wooden couch in one of the
      open spaces about the outskirts of the city, when an aged man chanced to
      pass by. Him I saluted with ceremonious politeness, on account of his
      years and the venerable dignity of his beard. Thereupon he approached
      near, and remarking affably that the afternoon was good (though, to use no
      subtle evasion, it was very evil), he congenially sat by my side and
      entered into familiar discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that in your part of the world we old grandfathers are
      worshipped,&rdquo; he said, after recounting to my ears all the most intimate
      details of his existence from his youth upwards; &ldquo;now, might that be
      right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It is the unchanging foundation of our system of
      morality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; he admitted pleasantly. &ldquo;We are a long way behind them
      foreigners in everything. At the rate we&rsquo;re going there won&rsquo;t be any trade
      nor work nor religion left in this country in another twenty years. I
      often wish I had gone abroad when I was younger. And if I had chanced upon
      your parts I should be worshipped, eh?&rdquo; and at the agreeable thought the
      aged man laughed in his throat with simple humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;&mdash;after you were dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; exclaimed the venerable person, checking the fountain of his mirth
      abruptly at the word. &ldquo;Dead! not before? Doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t that seem a
      bit of a waste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such has been the observance from the time of unrecorded antiquity,&rdquo; I
      replied. &ldquo;&lsquo;Obey parents, respect the old, loyally uphold the sovereign,
      and worship ancestors.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; remarked the one beside me, &ldquo;obedience and respect&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      something nowadays. And you make them do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our laws are unflinching in their application,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;No crime is held
      to be more detestable than disrespect of those to whom we owe our
      existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pleasure to hear it. It must be a great
      country, yours; a country with a future, I should say. Now, about that
      youngest lad of my son Henry&rsquo;s&mdash;the one that drops pet lizards down
      my neck, and threatened to put rat poison into his mother&rsquo;s tea when she
      wouldn&rsquo;t take him to the Military Turneyment; what would they do to him by
      your laws?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the assertion were well sustained by competent witnesses,&rdquo; I replied,
      &ldquo;it would probably be judged so execrable an offence, that a new
      punishment would have to be contrived. Failing that, he would certainly be
      wrapped round from head to foot in red-hot chains, and thus exposed to
      public derision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, red-hot chains!&rdquo; said the aged person, as though the words formed a
      pleasurable taste upon his palate. &ldquo;The young beggar! Well, he&rsquo;d deserve
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; I continued, gratified at having found one who so
      intelligently appreciated the deficiencies of his own country and the
      unblemished perfection of ours, &ldquo;his parents and immediate descendants, if
      any should exist, would be submitted to a fate as inevitable but slightly
      less contemptuous&mdash;slow compression, perchance; his parents once
      removed (thus enclosing your venerable personality), and remoter
      offsprings would be merely put to the sword without further ignominy, and
      those of less kinship to about the fourth degree would doubtless escape
      with branding and a reprimand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordelpus!&rdquo; exclaimed the patriarchal one, hastily leaping to the extreme
      limit of the wooden couch, and grasping his staff into a significant
      attitude of defence; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our system of justice is all-embracing,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;It is reasonably
      held that in such a case either that there is an inherent strain of
      criminality which must be eradicated at all hazard, or else that those who
      are responsible for the virtuous instruction of the young have been
      grossly neglectful of their duty. Whichever is the true cause, by this
      unfailing method we reach the desired end, for, as our proverb aptly says,
      &lsquo;Do the wise pluck the weed and leave the roots to spread?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s butchery, nothing short of Smithfield,&rdquo; said the ancient person
      definitely, rising and moving to a more remote distance as he spoke the
      words, yet never for a moment relaxing the aggressive angle at which he
      thrust out his staff before him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bloodthirsty race in my
      opinion, and when they get this door open in China that there&rsquo;s so much
      talk about, out you go through it, my lad, or old England will know why.&rdquo;
       With this narrow-minded imprecation on his lips he left me, not even
      permitting me to continue expounding what would be the most likely
      sentences meted out to the witnesses in the case, the dwellers of the same
      street, and the members of the household with whom the youth in question
      had contemplated forming an alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the many contradictions which really almost seem purposely arranged
      to entrap the unwary in this strangely under-side-up country, is the fact
      that while the ennobled and those of high official rank are courteous in
      their attitude and urbane&mdash;frequently even to the extent of refusing
      money from those whom they have obliged, no matter how privately pressed
      upon them&mdash;the low-caste and slavish are not only deficient in
      obsequiousness, but are permitted to retort openly to those who address
      them with fitting dignity. Here such a state of things is too general to
      excite remark, but as instances are well called the flowers of the tree of
      assertion, this person will set forth the manner in which he was
      contumaciously opposed by an oblique-eyed outcast who attended within the
      stall of one selling wrought gold, jewels, and merchandise of the finer
      sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being desirous of procuring a gift wherewith to propitiate a certain
      maiden&rsquo;s esteem, and seeing above a shop of varied attraction a suspended
      sign emblematic of three times repeated gild abundance I drew near, not
      doubting to find beneath so auspicious a token the fulfilment of an
      honourable accommodation. Inside the window was displayed one of the
      implements by which the various details of a garment are joined together
      upon turning a wheel, hung about with an inscription setting forth that it
      was esteemed at the price of two units of gold, nineteen pieces of silver,
      and eleven and three-quarters of the brass cash of the land, and judging
      that no more suitable object could be procured for the purpose, I entered
      the shop, and desired the attending slave to submit it to my closer
      scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; I exclaimed, when I had made a feint of setting the device into
      motion (for it need not be concealed from you, O discreet one, that I was
      really inadequate to the attempt, and, indeed, narrowly escaped impaling
      myself upon its sudden and unexpected protrusions), &ldquo;the highly-burnished
      surface of your dexterously arranged window gave to this engine a rich
      attractiveness which is altogether lacking at a closer examination.
      Nevertheless, this person will not recede from a perhaps too impulsive
      offer of one unit of gold, three pieces of silver, and four and a half
      brass cash,&rdquo; my object, of course, being that after the mutual
      recrimination of disparagement and over-praise we should in the length of
      an hour or two reach a becoming compromise in the middle distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; responded the menial one, regarding me with an expression in which
      he did not even attempt to subdue the baser emotions, &ldquo;you HAVE come a
      long way for nothing&rdquo;; and he made a pretence of wishing to replace the
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;observe with calm impartiality how insidiously the
      rust has assailed the outer polish of the lacquer; perceive here upon the
      beneath part of wood the ineffaceable depression of a deeply-pointed blow;
      note well the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good enough for you to want me to muck up out of the window,
      wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; demanded the obstinate barbarian, becoming passionate in his
      bearing rather than reluctantly, but with courteous grace, lessening the
      price to a trifling degree, as we regard the proper way of carrying on the
      enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well said,&rdquo; I admitted, hoping that he might yet learn wisdom from
      my attitude of unruffled urbanity, though I feared that his angle of
      negotiating was unconquerably opposed to mine, &ldquo;but now its many
      imperfections are revealed. The inelegance of its outline, the grossness
      of the applied colours, the unlucky combination of numbers engraved upon
      this plate, the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damme!&rdquo; cried the utterly perverse rebel standing opposite, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t
      you keep on your Compound, you Yellow Peril? Who asked you to come into my
      shop to blackguard the things? Come now, who did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly it is your place of commerce,&rdquo; I replied cheerfully, preparing
      to bring forward an argument, which in our country never fails to shake
      the most stubborn, &ldquo;yet bend your eyes to the fact that at no great
      distance away there stands another and a more alluring stall of
      merchandise where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to it then!&rdquo; screamed the abandoned outcast, leaping over his counter
      and shouting aloud in a frenzy of uncontrollable rage. &ldquo;Clear out, or I&rsquo;ll
      bend my feet&mdash;&rdquo; but concluding at this point that some private
      calumny from which he was doubtless suffering was disturbing his mind to
      so great an extent that there was little likelihood of our bringing the
      transaction to a profitable end, I left the shop immediately but with
      befitting dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a fell-founded assurance that you will now be acquiring a really
      precise and bird&rsquo;s-eye-like insight into practically all phases of this

      LETTER VIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the wisdom of the sublime Wei Chung and its
 application to the ordinary problems of existence. The
 meeting of three, hitherto unknown to each other, about a
 wayside inn, and their various manners of conducting the
 enterprise.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;You will doubtless remember the behaviour of the
      aged philosopher Wei Chung, when commanded by the broad-minded emperor of
      his time to reveal the hidden sources of his illimitable knowledge, so
      that all might freely acquire, and the race thereby become raised to a
      position of unparalleled excellence. Taking the well-disposed sovereign
      familiarly by the arm, Wei Chung led him to the mouth of his cave in the
      forest, and, standing by his side, bade him reflect with open eyes for a
      short space of time, and then express aloud what he had seen. &ldquo;Nothing of
      grave import,&rdquo; declared the emperor when the period was accomplished;
      &ldquo;only the trees shaken by the breeze.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; replied Wei Chung.
      &ldquo;What, to the adroitly-balanced mind, does such a sight reveal?&rdquo; &ldquo;That it
      is certainly a windy day,&rdquo; exclaimed the omnipotent triumphantly, for
      although admittedly divine, he yet lacked the philosopher&rsquo;s
      discrimination. &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied the sage coldly, &ldquo;that is the
      natural pronouncement of the rankly superficial. To the highly-trained
      intellect it conveys the more subtle truth that the wind affects the
      trees, and not the trees affect the wind. For upwards of seventy years
      this one has daily stood at the door of his cave for a brief period, and
      regularly garnering a single detail of like brilliance, has made it the
      well-spring for a day&rsquo;s reflection. As the result he now has by heart
      upwards of twenty-five thousand useful facts, all serviceable for original
      proverbs, and an encyclopaedic mind which would enable him to take a high
      place in a popular competition unassisted by a single work of reference.&rdquo;
       Much impressed by the adventure the charitably-inclined emperor presented
      Wei Chung with an onyx crown (which the philosopher at once threw into an
      adjacent well), and returning to his capital published a decree that each
      day at sunrise every person should stand at the door of his dwelling, and
      after observing for a period, compare among themselves the details of
      their thoughts. By this means he hoped to achieve his imperial purpose,
      but although the literal part of the enactment is scrupulously maintained,
      especially by the slothful and defamatory, who may be seen standing at
      their doors and conversing together even to this day, from some unforeseen
      imperfection the intellectual capacity of the race has remained exactly as
      it was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless it is not to be questioned that the system of the versatile
      Wei Chung was, in itself, grounded upon a far-seeing accuracy, and as the
      need of such a rational observation is deepened among the inconsistencies
      and fantastic customs of a barbarian race, I have made it a useful habit
      to accept as a guide for the day&rsquo;s behaviour the reflections engendered by
      the first noteworthy incident of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the day with which this letter concerns itself I had set forth, in
      accordance with an ever-present desire, to explore some of the hidden
      places of the city. At the time a tempest of great ferocity was raging,
      and bending my head before it I had the distinction of coming into contact
      with a person of ill-endowed exterior at an angle where two reads met.
      This amiable wayfarer exchanged civilities with me after the politeness
      characteristic of the labouring classes towards those who differ from them
      in speech, dress, or colour: that is to say, he filled his pipe from my
      proffered store, and after lighting it threw the match into my face, and
      passed on with an appropriate remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless this insignificant occurrence would have faded without internal
      comment if the penetrating Wei Chung had never existed, but now, guided by
      his sublime precedent, I arranged the incident for the day&rsquo;s conduct under
      three reflective heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while I was meditating on the second of these that an exclamation
      caused me to turn, when I observed a prosperously-outlined person in the
      act of picking up a scrip which had the appearance of being lavishly
      distended with pieces of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had not seen you pass it, I should have opined that this hyer wallet
      belonged to you,&rdquo; remarked the justice-loving stranger (for the incident
      had irresistibly retarded my own footsteps), speaking the language of this
      land, but with an accent of penetrating harmony hitherto unknown to my
      ears. With these auspicious words he turned over the object upon his hand
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So entrancing a possibility is, as you gracefully suggest, of unavoidable
      denial,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Nevertheless, this person will not hesitate to join
      his acclamation with yours; for, as the Book of Verses wisely says, &lsquo;Even
      the blind, if truly polite, will extol the prospect from your house-top.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; admitted the one by my side. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know that there is
      any call for a special thanksgiving. As I happen to have more money of my
      own than I can reasonably spend I shall drop this in at a convenient
      police station. I dare say some poor critter is pining away for it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pleasantly impressed by the resolute benevolence of the one who had a
      greater store of wealth than he could, by his own unaided efforts, dispose
      of, I arranged myself unobtrusively at his side, and maintaining an
      exhibition of my most polished and genial conversation, I sought to
      penetrate deeply into his esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaze in this direction, Kong,&rdquo; he said at length, calling me by name with
      auspicious familiarity; &ldquo;I am a benighted stranger in this hyer city, and
      so are you, I rek&rsquo;n. Suppose we liquor up, and then take a few of the side
      shows together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The suggestion is one against which I will erect no ill-disposed
      barrier,&rdquo; I at once replied, so inflexibly determined not to lose sight of
      a person possessing such engaging attributes as to be cheerfully prepared
      even to consume my rice spirit in the inverted position which his words
      implied if the display was persisted in. &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; I added, with a
      resourceful prudence, &ldquo;although by no means undistinguished among the
      highest literary and competitive circles of his native Yuen-ping, the one
      before you is incapable of walking in the footsteps of a person whose
      accumulations are greater than he himself can appreciably diminish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Kong,&rdquo; exclaimed the one whom my last words fittingly
      described, striking the recess of his lower garment with a gesture of
      graceful significance. &ldquo;When I take a fancy to any one it isn&rsquo;t a matter
      of dollars. I usually carry a trifle of five hundred or a thousand pounds
      in my pocket-book, and if we can get through that&mdash;why, there&rsquo;s
      plenty more waiting at the bank. Say, though, I hope you don&rsquo;t keep much
      about you; it isn&rsquo;t really safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The temptation to do so is one which this person has hitherto
      successfully evaded,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The contents of this reptile-skin case&rdquo;&mdash;and
      not to be outshone in mutual confidence I here displayed it openly&mdash;&ldquo;do
      not exceed nine or ten pieces of gold and a like number of printed
      obligations promising to pay five pieces each.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it away, Kong,&rdquo; he said resolutely. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need that so long as
      you&rsquo;re with me. Well, now, what sort of a saloon have we here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As far as the opinion might be superficially expressed it had every
      indication of being one of noteworthy antiquity, and to the innately
      modest mind its unassuming diffidence might have lent an added charm.
      Nevertheless, on most occasions this person would have maintained an
      unshaken dexterity in avoiding its open door, but as the choice admittedly
      lay in the hands of one who carried five hundred or a thousand pieces of
      gold we went in together and passed through to a compartment of retiring
      seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our own land, O my orthodox-minded father, where the unfailing
      resources of innumerable bands of dragons, spirits, vampires, ghouls,
      shadows, omens, and thunderstorms are daily enlisted to carry into effect
      the pronouncements of an appointed destiny, we have many historical
      examples of the inexorably converging legs of coincidence, but none, I
      think, more impressively arranged than the one now descending this
      person&rsquo;s brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had scarcely reposed ourselves, and taken from the hands of an awaiting
      slave the vessels of thrice-potent liquid which in this Island is regarded
      as the indispensable accompaniment to every movement of existence, when a
      third person entered the room, and seating himself at a table some
      slightly removed distance away, lowered his head and abandoned himself to
      a display of most lavish dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor cuss doesn&rsquo;t appear to be holiday-making,&rdquo; remarked the
      sincerely-compassionate person at my side, after closely observing the
      other for a period; and then, moved by the overpowering munificence of his
      inward nature, he called aloud, &ldquo;Say, stranger, you seem to have got it
      thickly in the neck. Is it family affliction or the whisky of the
      establishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these affably-intentioned words the stranger raised his eyes quickly,
      with an indication of not having up to that time been aware of our
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed, approaching to a spot where he could converse with a
      more enhanced facility, &ldquo;when I loosened the restraint of an overpowering
      if unmanly grief, I imagined that I was alone, for I would have shunned
      even the most flattering sympathy, but your charitably-modulated voice
      invites confidence. The one before you is the most contemptible,
      left-handed, and disqualified outcast in creation, and he is now making
      his way towards the river, while his widow will be left to take in
      washing, his infant son to vend evening printed leaves, and his graceful
      and hitherto highly secluded daughters to go upon the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, stranger,&rdquo; interposed this person, by no means unwilling to engrave
      upon his memory this newly-acquired form of greeting, &ldquo;the emotion is
      doubtless all-pressing, but in my ornate and flower-laden tongue we have a
      salutation, &lsquo;Slowly, slowly; walk slowly,&rsquo; which seems to be of far-seeing
      application.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; remarked the one by my side. &ldquo;Separate it with the teeth,
      inch by inch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be calm, then,&rdquo; continued the other (who, to avoid the
      complication of the intermingling circumstances, may be described as the
      more stranger of the two), and he took of his neckcloth. &ldquo;I am a merchant
      in tea, yellow fat, and mixed spices, in a small but hitherto satisfactory
      way.&rdquo; Thus revealing himself, he continued to set forth how at an earlier
      hour he had started on a journey to deposit his wealth (doubtless as a
      propitiation of outraged deities) upon a certain bank, and how, upon
      reaching the specified point, he discovered that what he carried had
      eluded his vigilance. &ldquo;All gone: notes, gold, and pocket-book&mdash;the
      savings of a lifetime,&rdquo; concluded the ill-omened one, and at the
      recollection a sudden and even more highly-sustained frenzy of
      self-unpopularity involving him, without a pause he addressed himself by
      seven and twenty insulting expressions, many of which were quite new to my
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the earliest mention of the details affecting the loss, the elbow of
      the person who had made himself responsible for the financial obligation
      of the day propelled itself against my middle part, and unseen by the
      other he indicated to me by means of his features that the entertainment
      was becoming one of agreeable prepossession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, touching this hyer wallet,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;How might you
      describe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In colour it was red, and within were two compartments, the one
      containing three score notes each of ten pounds, the other fifty pounds of
      gold. But what&rsquo;s the use of describing it? Some lucky demon will pick it
      up and pocket the lot, and I shall never see a cent of it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better consult one who reburnishes the eyes,&rdquo; declared the
      magnanimous one with a laugh, and drawing forth the article referred to he
      cast it towards the merchant in a small way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point of the narrative my thoroughly incompetent brush confesses
      the proportions of the requirement to be beyond its most extended limit,
      and many very honourable details are necessarily left without expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known men of all sorts, good, bad, and bothwise,&rdquo; exclaimed the one
      who had recovered his possessions; &ldquo;but I never thought to meet a gent as
      would hand over six hundred and fifty pounds as if it was a toothpick.
      Sir, it overbalances me; it does, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more about it,&rdquo; urged the first person, and to suggest gracefully
      that the incident had reached its furthest extremity, he began to set out
      the melody of an unspoken verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say no more, then,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but you cannot reasonably prevent
      my doing something to express my gratitude. If you are not too proud you
      will come and partake of food and wine with me beneath the sign of the
      Funereal Male Cow, and to show my confidence in you I shall insist upon
      you carrying my pocket-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person whom I had first encountered suffered his face to become
      excessively amused. &ldquo;Say, stranger, do you take me for a pack-mule?&rdquo; he
      replied good-naturedly. &ldquo;I already have about as much as I want to handle.
      Never mind; we&rsquo;ll come along with you, and Mr. Kong shall carry your
      bullion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this delicate and high-minded proposal a rapid change, in no way
      complimentary to my explicit habit of adequately conducting any venture
      upon which I may be engaged, came over the face of the second person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I have nothing to say against this gentleman, but I
      am under no obligation to him, and I don&rsquo;t see why I should trust him with
      everything I possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; exclaimed the other rising to his feet (and from this point it
      must be understood that the various details succeeded one another with a
      really agile dexterity), &ldquo;let me tell you that Mr. Kong is my friend, and
      that ought to be enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. If you say this gentleman is your friend, and that you have known
      him long and intimately enough to be able to answer for him, that&rsquo;s good
      enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted the first person, and I could not conceal from myself
      that his tone was inauspiciously reluctant, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t exactly say that I&rsquo;ve
      known him long; in fact I only met him half an hour ago. But I have the
      fullest confidence in his integrity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I expected. Well, sir, you&rsquo;re good-natured enough for
      anything, but if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I must say that you&rsquo;re a small piece of
      an earthenware vessel after all&rdquo;&mdash;the veiled allusion doubtlessly
      being that the vessel of necessity being broken, the contents inevitably
      escape&mdash;&ldquo;and I hope you&rsquo;re not being had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, and I&rsquo;ll prove it before we go out together,&rdquo; retorted the
      engaging one, who had in the meantime become so actively impetuous on my
      account, that he did not remain content with the spoken words, but threw
      the various belongings about as he mentioned them in a really profuse
      display of inimitable vehemence. &ldquo;Here, Kong, take this hyer pocket-book
      whatever he says. Now on the top of that take everything I&rsquo;ve got, and you
      know what THAT figures up to. Now give this gentleman your little lot to
      keep him quiet; I don&rsquo;t ask for anything. Now, stranger, I&rsquo;m ready. You
      and I will take a stroll round the block and back again, and if Mr. Kong
      isn&rsquo;t waiting here for us when we return with everything intact and O.K.,
      I&rsquo;ll double your deposit and never trust a durned soul again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nodding genially over his shoulder with a harmonious understanding,
      expressive of the fact that we were embarking upon an undeniably diverting
      episode, the benevolent-souled person who had accumulated more riches than
      he was competent to melt away himself, passed out, urging the doubtful and
      still protesting one before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus abandoned to my own reflections, I pondered for a short time
      profitably on the third head of the day&rsquo;s meditation (Touching the match
      and this person&rsquo;s unattractively-lined face. The revealed truth: the
      inexperienced sheep cannot pass through the hedge without leaving portions
      of his wool), and then finding the philosophy of Wei Chung very good, I
      determined to remove the superfluous apprehensions of the vender of
      food-stuffs with less delay by setting out and meeting them on their
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few paces distant from the door, one of the ever-present watchers of the
      street was standing, watching the street with unremitting vigilance, while
      from the well-guarded expression of his face it might nevertheless be
      gathered that he stood as though in expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prosperity,&rdquo; I said, with seasonable greeting. (For no excess of
      consideration is too great to be lavished upon these, who unite within
      themselves the courage of a high warrior, the expertness of a three-handed
      magician, and the courtesy of a genial mandarin.) &ldquo;I seek two, apparelled
      thus and thus. Did you, by any chance, mark the direction of their
      footsteps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, regarding this person with a most flattering application,
      &ldquo;YOU seek them, do you? Well, they&rsquo;ve just gone off in a hansom, and
      they&rsquo;ll want a lot of seeking for the next week or two. You let them carry
      your purse, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;As a mark of confidence; this person, for his
      part, receiving a like token at their hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the official watcher, conveying into his voice a subtle
      indication that he had become excessively fatigued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a nursery
      tale&mdash;never too old to take with the kids. Well, come along, poor
      lamb, the station isn&rsquo;t far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So great had become the reliance which by this time I habitually reposed
      in these men, that I never sought to oppose their pronouncements (such a
      course being not only useless but undignified), and we therefore together
      reached the place which the one by my side had described as a station.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the outside the building was in no way imposing, but upon reaching an
      inner dungeon it at once became plain that no matter with what crime a
      person might be charged, even the most stubborn resistance would be
      unavailing. Before a fiercely-burning fire were arranged metal pincers,
      massive skewers, ornamental branding irons, and the usual accessories of
      the grill, one tool being already thrust into the heart of the flame to
      indicate the nature of its use, and its immediate readiness for the
      purpose. Pegs from which the accused could be hung by the thumbs with
      weights attached to the feet, covered an entire wall; chains,
      shackling-irons, fetters, steel rings for compressing the throat, and
      belts for tightening the chest, all had their appointed places, while the
      Chair, the Boot, the Heavy Hat, and many other appliances quite unknown to
      our system of administering justice were scattered about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without pausing to select any of these, the one who led me approached a
      raised desk at which was seated a less warlike official, whose sympathetic
      appearance inspired confidence. &ldquo;Kong Ho,&rdquo; exclaimed to himself the person
      who is inscribing these words, &ldquo;here is an individual into whose
      discriminating ear it would be well to pour the exact happening without
      evasion. Then even if the accusation against you be that of resembling
      another or trafficking with unlawful Forces, he will doubtless arrange the
      matter so that the expiation shall be as light and inexpensive as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time certain other officials had drawn near. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I heard
      one demand, and another replied, &ldquo;Brooklyn Ben and Jimmie the Butterman
      again. Ah, they aren&rsquo;t artful, are they!&rdquo; but at this moment the two into
      whose power I had chiefly fallen having conversed together, I was
      commanded to advance towards them and reveal my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kong,&rdquo; I replied freely; and I had formed a design to explain somewhat of
      the many illustrious ancestors of the House, when the one at the desk,
      pausing to inscribe my answer in a book, spoke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kong?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is that the christian or surname?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir-name?&rdquo; replied this person between two thoughts. &ldquo;Undoubtedly the one
      before you is entitled by public examination to the degree &lsquo;Recognised
      Talent,&rsquo; which may, as a meritorious distinction, be held equal to your
      title of a warrior clad in armour. Yet, if it is so held, that would
      rightly be this person&rsquo;s official name of Paik.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it would, would it?&rdquo; said the one seated upon the high chair. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      quite clear. Are there any other names as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; I explained, pained inwardly that one of official rank should
      so slightly esteem my appearance as to judge that I was so meagrely
      endowed. &ldquo;The milk name of Ho; Tsin upon entering the Classes; as a Great
      Name Cheng; another style in Quank; the official title already expressed,
      and T&rsquo;chun, Li, Yuen and Nung as the various emergencies of life arise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the high-chair official courteously. &ldquo;Now, just the name
      in full, please, without any velvet trimmings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kong,&rdquo; began this person, desirous above all things of putting the matter
      competently, yet secretly perturbed as to what might be considered
      superfluous and what deemed a perfidious suppression, &ldquo;Ho Tsin Cheng Quank&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold hard,&rdquo; cried this same one, restraining me with an uplifted pen.
      &ldquo;Did you say &lsquo;Quack&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quack?&rdquo; repeated this person, beginning to become involved within
      himself, and not grasping the detail in the right position. &ldquo;In a manner
      of setting the expression forth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him down, &lsquo;Quack Duck,&rsquo; sir,&rdquo; exclaimed one of dog-like dejection who
      stood by. &ldquo;Most of these Lascars haven&rsquo;t got any real names&mdash;they
      just go by what any one happens to call them at the time, like &lsquo;Burmese
      Ike&rsquo; down at the Mint,&rdquo; and this person unfortunately chancing to smile
      and bow acquiescently at that moment (not with any set intention, but as a
      general principle of courteous urbanity), in place of his really
      distinguished titles he will henceforth appear among the historical
      records of this dynasty under what he cannot disguise from his inner
      misgivings to be the low-caste appellation of Quack Duck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the address, please,&rdquo; continued the high one, again preparing to
      inscribe the word, and being determined that by no mischance should this
      particular be offensively reported, I unhesitatingly replied, &ldquo;Beneath the
      Sign of the Lead Tortoise, on the northern course from the Lotus Pools
      outside the walls of Yuen-ping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer the one with the book did not immediately record. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say
      it isn&rsquo;t all right when you know the parts,&rdquo; he remarked broad-mindedly,
      &ldquo;but it does sound a trifle irregular. Can&rsquo;t you give it a number and a
      street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy it must be a pub, sir,&rdquo; observed another. &ldquo;He said that it had a
      sign&mdash;the Red Tortoise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, haven&rsquo;t you got a London address?&rdquo; said the high one, and this
      person being able to supply a street and a number as desired, this part of
      the undertaking was disposed of, to his cordial satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let me see the articles which these men left with you,&rdquo; commanded the
      chieftain of the band, and without any misleading discrepancies I at once
      drew forth from an inner sleeve the two scrips, of which adequate mention
      has already been made, another hitherto undescribed, two instruments for
      measuring the passing hours of the day, together with a chain of fine gold
      ingeniously wrought into the semblance of a cable, an ornament for the
      breast, set about with a jewel, two neck-cloths of a kind usually carried
      in the pocket, a book for recording happenings of any moment, pieces of
      money to the value of about eleven taels, a silver flagon, a sheathed
      weapon and a few lesser objects of insignificant value. These various
      details I laid obsequiously before the one who had commanded it, while the
      others stood around either in explicit silence or speaking softly beneath
      their breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand that the two persons left all these things with you,
      while they took your purse in exchange?&rdquo; said the high official, after
      examining certain obscure signs upon the metals, the contents of the third
      scrip, and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot reasonably be denied,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;inasmuch as they departed
      without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spontaneously?&rdquo; he demanded, and in spite of the unevadible severity of
      his voice the expression of his nearer eye deviated somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spoken and conclusive word of the first was that it was his intention
      to commit to this one&rsquo;s keeping everything which he had; the assertion of
      the second being that with this scrip I received all that he possessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While of yours, what did they get, Mr. Quack?&rdquo; and the tone of the one
      who spoke had a much more gratifying modulation than before, while the
      attitudes of those who stood around had favourably changed, until they now
      conveyed a message of deliberate esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A serpent-skin case of two enclosures,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;On the one side was a
      handcount of the small copper-pieces of this Island, which I had caused to
      be burnished and gilt for the purpose of taking back to amuse those of
      Yuen-ping. On the other side were two or three pages from a
      gravity-removing printed leaf entitled &lsquo;Bits of Tits,&rsquo; with which this
      person weekly instructs himself in the simpler rudiments of the language.
      For the rest the case was controlled by a hidden spring, and inscribed
      about with a charm against loss, consumption by fire, or being secretly
      acquired by the unworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you stand in much need of that charm, Mr. Quack,&rdquo; remarked
      another of more than ordinary rank, who was also present. &ldquo;Then they
      really got practically no money from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;It was never literally stipulated, and
      whatever of wealth he possesses this person carries in a concealed spot
      beneath his waistbelt.&rdquo; (For even to these, virtuous sire, I did not deem
      it expedient to reveal the fact that in reality it is hidden within the
      sole of my left sandal.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; he said with lavish refinement. &ldquo;Ben and the
      Butterman can be very bland and persuasive. Could you tell me, as a matter
      of professional curiosity, what first put you on your guard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this person&rsquo;s country,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;there is an apt saying, &lsquo;The
      sagacious bird does not build his nest twice in the empty soup-toureen,&rsquo; 
      and by observing closely what has gone before one may accurately
      conjecture much that will follow after.&rdquo; It may be, that out of my
      insufferable shortcomings of style and expression, this answer did not
      convey to his mind the logical sequence of the warning; yet it would have
      been more difficult to show him how everything arose from the
      faultlessly-balanced system of the heroic Wei Chung, or the exact parallel
      lying between the ill-clad outcast who demanded a portion of tobacco and
      the cheerfully unassuming stranger who had in his possession a larger
      accumulation of money than he could conveniently disperse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a manner I took leave of the station and those connected with it,
      after directing that the share of the spoil which fell by the law of this
      Island to my lot should be sold and the money of exchange faithfully
      divided among the virtuous and necessitous of both sexes. The higher
      officials each waved me pleasantly by the hand, according to the striking
      and picturesque custom of the land, while the lesser ones stood around and
      spoke flattering words as I departed, as &ldquo;honourable,&rdquo; &ldquo;a small piece of
      all-right,&rdquo; &ldquo;astute ancient male fowl,&rdquo; &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      With repeated assurances that however ineptly the adventure may at the
      time appear to be tending, as regards the essentials of true dignity and
      an undeviating grasp upon articles of negotiable value, nothing of a
      regrettable incident need be feared.

      LETTER IX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the proverb of the highly-accomplished horse. The
 various perils to be encountered in the Beneath Parts. The
 inexplicable journey performed by this one, and concerning
 the obscurity of the witchcraft employed.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;Among these islanders there is a proverb, &ldquo;Do not
      place the carte&rdquo; (or card, the two words having an identical purport, and
      both signifying the inscribed tablet of viands prepared for a banquet,)
      &ldquo;before the horse.&rdquo; Doubtless the saying first arose as a timely rebuke to
      a certain barbarian emperor who announced his contempt for the
      intelligence of his subjects by conferring high mandarin rank upon a
      favourite steed and ceremoniously appointing it to be his chancellor; but
      from the narrower moral that an unreasoning animal is out of place, and
      even unseemly, in the entertaining hall or council chamber, the expression
      has in the course of time taken a wider application and is now freely used
      as an insidious thrust at one who may be suspected of contrariness of
      character, of confusing issues, or of acting in a vain or illogical
      manner. I had already preserved the saying among other instances of
      foreign thought and expression which I am collecting for your dignified
      amusement, as it is very characteristic of the wisdom and humour of these
      Outer Lands. The imagination is essentially barbaric. A horse&mdash;doubtless
      well-groomed, richly-caparisoned, and as intellectual as the circumstances
      will permit, but inevitably an animal of degraded attributes and
      untraceable ancestry&mdash;a horse reclining before a lavishly set-out
      table and considering well of what dish it shall next partake! Could
      anything, it appears, be more diverting! Truly to our more refined outlook
      the analogy is lacking both in delicacy of wit and in exactitude of
      balance, but to the grosser barbarian conception of what is
      gravity-removing it is irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am, however, reminded of the saying by perceiving that I was on the
      point of recording certain details of recent occurrence without first
      unrolling to your mind the incidents from which it has arisen that the
      person who is now communicating with you is no longer reposing in the
      Capital, but spending a period profitably in observing the habits of those
      who dwell in the more secluded recesses on the outskirts of the Island.
      This reversal of the proper sequence of affairs would doubtless strike
      those around as an instance of setting the banquet before the horse.
      Without delay, then, to pursue the allusion to its appropriate end, I will
      return, as it may be said, to my nosebag.
    </p>
    <p>
      At various points about the streets of the Capital there are certain
      caverns artificially let into the bowels of the earth, to which any person
      may betake himself upon purchasing a printed sign which he must display to
      the guardian of the gate. Once within the underneathmost parts he is free
      to be carried from place to place by means of the trains of carriages
      which I have already described to you, until he would return to the outer
      surface, when he must again display his talisman before he is permitted to
      pass forth. Nor is this an empty form, for upon an occasion this person
      himself witnessed a very bitter contention between a keeper of the barrier
      and one whose token had through some cause lost its potency.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the company of the experienced I had previously gone through the trial
      without mischance, so that recently when I expressed a wish to visit a
      certain Palace, and was informed that the most convenient manner would be
      to descend into the nearest cavern, I had no reasonable device for
      avoiding the encounter. Nevertheless, enlightened sire, I will not attempt
      to conceal from your omniscience that I was by no means impetuous towards
      the adventure. Owing to the pugnacious and unworthy suspicions of those
      who direct their destinies, I have not yet been able to penetrate the
      exact connection between the movements of these hot-smoke chariots and the
      Unseen Forces. To a person whose chief object in life is to avoid giving
      offence to any of the innumerable demons which are ever on the watch to
      revenge themselves upon our slightest indiscretion, this uncertainty opens
      an unending vista of intolerable possibilities. As if to emphasise the
      perils of this overhanging doubt the surroundings are ingeniously arranged
      so as to represent as nearly as practicable the terrors of the Beneath
      World. Both by day and night a funereal gloom envelops the caverns, the
      pathways and resting-places are meagre and so constructed as to be devoid
      of attraction or repose, and by a skilful contrivance the natural
      atmosphere is secretly withdrawn and a very acrimonious sulphurous haze
      driven in to replace it. In sudden and unforeseen places eyes of fire open
      and close with disconcerting rapidity, and even change colour in
      vindictive significance; wooden hands are outstretched as in unrelenting
      rigidity against supplication, or, divining the unexpressed thoughts,
      inexorably point, as one gazes, still deeper into the recesses of the
      earth; while the air is never free from the sounds of groans, shrieks, the
      rattling of chains, dull, hopeless noises beneath one&rsquo;s feet or overhead,
      and the hoarse wordless cries of despair with which the attending slaves
      of the caverns greet the distant clamour of every approaching
      fire-chariot. Admittedly the intention of the device is benevolently
      conceived, and it is strenuously asserted that many persons of corrupt
      habits and ill-balanced lives, upon waking unexpectedly while passing
      through these Beneath Parts, have abandoned the remainder of their
      journey, and, escaping hastily to the outer air, have from that time
      onwards led a pure and consistent existence; but, on the other foot, those
      who are compelled to use the caverns daily, freely confess that the
      surroundings to not in any material degree purify their lives of
      tranquillise the nature of their inner thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this emergency I did not neglect to write out a diversity of charms
      against every possible variety of evil influence, and concealing them
      lavishly about my head and body, I presented myself with the outer
      confidence of a person who is inured to the exploit. Doubtless thereby
      being mistaken for one of themselves in the obscurity, I received the
      inscribed safeguard without opposition, and even an added sum in copper
      pieces, which I discreetly returned to the one behind the shutter, with
      the request that he would honourably burn a few joss sticks or sacrifice
      to a trivial amount, to the success of my journey. In such a manner I
      reached an awaiting train, and, taking up within it a position of retiring
      modesty, I definitely committed myself to the undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next tarrying place there entered a barbarian of high-class
      appearance, and being by this time less assured of my competence in the
      matter unaided, both on account of the multiplicity of evil omens on every
      side, and the perverse impulses of the guiding demon, whereby at sudden
      angles certain of my organs had the emotion of being left irrevocably
      behind and others of being snatched relentlessly forward, I approached him
      courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;many thousand li of water, both fresh and bitter, flow
      between the one who is addressing you and his native town of Yuen-ping,
      where the tablets at the street corners are as familiar to him as the
      lines of his own unshapely hands; for, as it is truly said, &lsquo;Does the
      starling know the lotus roots, or the pomfret read its way by the signs
      among the upper branches of the pines?&rsquo; Out of the necessities of his
      ignorance and your own overwhelming condescension enlighten him,
      therefore, whether the destination of this fire-chariot by any chance
      corresponds with the inscribed name upon his talisman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, the stranger benevolently turned himself to the detail, and
      upon consulting a book of symbols he expressed himself to this wise: that
      after a sufficient interval I should come into a certain station, called
      in part after the title of the enlightened ruler of this Island, and there
      abandoning the train which was carrying us, I should enter another which
      would bring me out of the Beneath Parts and presently into the midst of
      that Palace which I sought. This advice seemed good, for a reasonable
      connection might be supposed to exist between a station so auspiciously
      called and a Palace bearing the harmonious name of the gracious and
      universally-revered sovereign-consort. Accordingly I thanked him
      ceremoniously, not only on my own part, but also on behalf of eleven
      generations of immediate ancestors, and in the name of seven generations
      who should come after, and he on his side agreeably replied that he was
      sure his grandmother would have done as much for mine, and he sincerely
      hoped that none of his great-great-grandchildren would prove less
      obliging. In this intellectual manner, varied with the entertainment of
      profuse bows, the time passed cordially between us until the barbarian
      reached his own alighting stage, when he again repeated the various
      details of the strategy for my observance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point let it be set forth deliberately that there existed no
      treachery in the advice, still less that this person is incapable of
      competently achieving the destined end of any hazard upon which he may
      embark when once the guiding signs have been made clear to his
      understanding. Whatever entanglement arose was due merely to the
      conflicting manners of expression used by two widely-varying races, even
      as our own proverb says, &ldquo;What is only sauce for the cod is serious for
      the oyster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the station indicated as bearing the sign of the ruler of the country
      (which even a person of little discernment could have recognised by the
      highly-illuminated representation bearing the elusively-worded
      inscription, &ldquo;In packets only&rdquo;), I left this fire-chariot, and at once
      perceiving another in an attitude of departure, I entered it, as the
      casual barbarian had definitely instructed, and began to assure myself
      that I had already become expertly proficient in the art of journeying
      among these Beneath Regions and to foresee the time, not far distant, when
      others would confidently address themselves to me in their extremities. So
      entrancing did this contemplation grow, that this outrageous person began
      to compose the actual words with which he would instruct them as the
      occasion arose, as thus, &ldquo;Undoubtedly, O virtuous and not unattractive
      maiden, this fire-engine will ultimately lead your refined footsteps into
      the street called Those who Bake Food. Do not hesitate, therefore, to
      occupy the vacant place by this insignificant one&rsquo;s side&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;By no
      means, honourable sir; the Cross of Charing is in the precisely opposite
      direction to that selected by this self-opinionated machine for its
      inopportune destination. Do not rebuke this person for his immoderate loss
      of mental gravity, for your mistake, though pardonable in a stranger, is
      really excessively diverting. Your most prudent course now will assuredly
      be to cast yourself from the carriage without delay and rely upon the
      benevolent intervention of a fire-chariot proceeding backwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas, it is truly said, &ldquo;None but sword-swallowers should endeavour to
      swallow swords,&rdquo; thereby signifying the vast chasm that lies between those
      who are really adroit in an undertaking and those who only think that they
      may easily become so. Presently it began to become deeply impressed upon
      my discrimination that the journey was taking a more lengthy duration than
      I had been given to understand would be the case, while at the same time a
      permanent deliverance from the terrors of the Beneath Parts seemed to be
      insidiously lengthening out into a funereal unattainableness. The point of
      this person&rsquo;s destination, he had been assured on all hands, was a spot
      beyond which even the most aggressively assertive engine could not
      proceed, so that he had no fears of being incapably drawn into more remote
      places, yet when hour after hour passed and the ill-destined machine never
      failed in its malicious endeavours to leave each successive tarrying
      station, it is not to be denied that my imagination dwelt regretfully upon
      the true civilisation of our own enlightened country, where, by the
      considerate intervention of an all-wise government, the possibilities of
      so distressing an experience are sympathetically removed from one&rsquo;s path.
      Thus the greater part of the day had faded, and I was conjecturing that by
      this time we must inevitably be approaching the barren and inhospitable
      country which forms the northern limit of the Island, when the door
      suddenly opened and the barbarian stranger whom I had left many hundred li
      behind entered the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this manifestation all uncertainty departed, and I now understood that
      to some obscure end witchcraft of a very powerful and high-caste kind was
      being employed around me; for in no other way was it credible to one&rsquo;s
      intelligence that a person could propel himself through the air with a
      speed greater than that of one of these fire-chariots, and overtake it.
      Doubtless it was a part of this same scheme which made it seem expedient
      to the stranger that he should feign a part, for he at once greeted me as
      though the occasion were a matter of everyday happening, exclaiming
      genially&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Kong, returning? And what do you think of the Palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fitly observed, &lsquo;To the earthworm the rice stalk is as high as the
      pagoda,&rsquo;&rdquo; I replied with adroit evasion, clearly understanding from his
      manner that for some reason, not yet revealed to me, a course of
      dissimulation was expedient in order to mislead the surrounding demons
      concerning my movements, and by a subtle indication of the face conveying
      to the stranger an assurance that I had tactfully grasped the requirement,
      and would endeavour to walk well upon his heels, &ldquo;and therefore it would
      be unseemly for a person of my insignificant attainments to engage in the
      doubtful flattery of comparing it with the many other residences of the
      pure and exalted which embellish your Capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the one whom I may now suitably describe by the name of Sir
      Philip, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s rather a useful proverb sometimes. Many people there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this inquiry I could not disguise from myself an emotion that the
      person seated opposite was not diplomatically inspired in so persistently
      clinging to the one subject upon which he must assuredly know that I
      experienced an all-pervading deficiency. Nevertheless, being by this more
      fully convinced that the disguise was one of critical necessity, and not
      deeming that the essential ceremonies of one Palace would differ from
      those of another, no matter in what land they stood (while through all I
      read a clear design on Sir Philip&rsquo;s part that the opportunity was craftily
      arranged so that I might impress upon any vindictively-intentioned spirits
      within hearing an assumption of high protection), I replied that the
      gathering had been one of unparalleled splendour, both by reason of the
      multitude of exalted nobles present and also owing to the jewelled
      magnificence lavished on every detail. Furthermore, I continued, now
      definitely abandoning all the promptings of a wise reserve, and
      reflecting, as we say, that one may as well be drowned in the ocean as in
      a wooden bucket, not only did the sublime and unapproachable sovereign
      graciously permit me to kow-tow respectfully before him, but subsequently
      calling me to his side beneath a canopy of golden radiance, he conversed
      genially with me and benevolently assured me of his sympathetic favour on
      all occasions (this, I conjectured, would certainly overawe any Evil Force
      not among the very highest circles), while the no less magnanimous Prince
      of the Imperial Line questioned me with flattering assiduousness
      concerning a method of communicating with persons at a distance by means
      of blows or stamps upon a post (as far as the outer meaning conveyed
      itself to me), the houses which we build, and whether they contained an
      adequate provision of enclosed spaces in the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless I could have continued in this praiseworthy spirit of delicate
      cordiality to an indefinite amount had I not chanced to observe at this
      point that the expression of Sir Philip&rsquo;s urbanity had become entangled in
      a variety of other emotions, not all propitious to the scheme, so that in
      order to retire imperceptibly within myself I smiled broad-mindedly,
      remarking that it was well said that the moon was only bright while the
      sun was hid, and that I had lately been dazzled with the sight of so much
      brilliance and virtuous condescension that there were occasions when I
      questioned inwardly how much I had really witnessed, and how much had been
      conveyed to me in the nature of an introspective vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will already have been made plain to you, O my courtly-mannered father,
      that these barbarians are totally deficient in the polite art whereby two
      persons may carry on a flattering and highly-attuned conversation,
      mutually advantageous to the esteem of each, without it being necessary in
      any way that their statements should have more than an ornamental
      actuality. So wanting in this, the most concentrated form of truly
      well-bred entertainment, are even their high officials, that after a few
      more remarks, to which I made answer in a spirit of skilfully-sustained
      elusiveness, the utterly obtuse Sir Philip said at length, &ldquo;Excuse my
      asking, Mr. Kong, but have you really been to the Alexandra Palace at
      all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Admittedly there are few occasions in life on which it is not possible to
      fail to see the inopportune or low-class by a dignified impassiveness of
      features, an adroitly-directed jest, or a remark of baffling
      inconsequence, but in the face of so distressingly straightforward a
      demand what can be advanced by a person of susceptible refinement when
      opposed to one of incomparably larger dimensions, imprisoned by his side
      in the recess of a fire-chariot which is leaping forward with uncurbed
      velocity, and surrounded by demons with whose habits and partialities he
      is unfamiliar?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a manner of expressing the circumstance,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it is not to be
      denied that this person&rsquo;s actual footsteps may have imperceptibly been
      drawn somewhat aside from the path of his former design. Yet inasmuch as
      it is truly said that the body is in all things subservient to the mind,
      and is led withersoever it is willed, and as your engaging directions were
      scrupulously observed with undeviating fidelity, it would be impertinently
      self-opinionated on this person&rsquo;s part to imply that they failed to guide
      him to his destination. Thus, for all ceremonial purposes, it is
      permissible conscientiously to assume that he HAS been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that I must not have been sufficiently clear,&rdquo; said Sir
      Philip. &ldquo;Did you miss the train at King&rsquo;s Cross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I replied firmly, pained inwardly that he should cast the
      shadow of such narrow incompetence upon me. &ldquo;Seeing this machine on the
      point of setting forth on a journey, even as your overwhelming sagacity
      had enabled you to predict would be the case, I embarked with self-reliant
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good lord!&rdquo; murmured the person opposite, beginning to manifest an excess
      of emotion for which I was quite unable to account. &ldquo;Then you have been in
      this train&mdash;your actual footsteps I mean, Mr. Kong; not your
      ceremonial abstract subliminal ego&mdash;ever since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this I replied that his words shone like the moon at midnight with
      scintillating points of truth; adding, however, as the courtesies of the
      occasion required, that I had been so impressed with the many-sided
      brilliance of his conversation earlier in the day as to render the flight
      of time practically unnoticed by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did it never occur to you to ask at one of the stations?&rdquo; he
      demanded, still continuing to wave his hands incapably from side to side.
      &ldquo;Any of the porters would have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kong Li Heng, the founder of our line, who was really great, has been
      dead eleven centuries, and no single fact or incident connected with his
      life has been preserved to influence mankind,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;How much less
      will it matter, then, even in so limited a space of time as a hundred
      years, in what fashion so insignificant a person as the one before you
      acted on any occasion, and why, therefore, should he distress himself
      unnecessarily to any precise end?&rdquo; In this manner I sought to place before
      him the dignified example of an imperturbability which can be maintained
      in every emergency, and at the same time to administer a plain yet
      scrupulously-sheathed rebuke; for the inauspicious manner in which he had
      first drawn me on to speak confidently of the ceremonies of the Royal
      Palace and then held up my inadequacy to undeserved contempt had not
      rejoiced my imagination, and I was still uncertain how much to claim, and
      whether, perchance, even yet a more subtle craft lay under all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in any case, when you go back you can claim the distinction of
      having been taken seven times round London, although you can&rsquo;t really have
      seen much of it,&rdquo; said Sir Philip. &ldquo;This is a Circle train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this assertion I looked up. Though admittedly curved a little about the
      roof the chariot was in every essential degree what we should pronounce to
      be a square one; whereupon, feeling at length that the involvement had
      definitely passed to a point beyond my contemptible discernment, I spread
      out my hands acquiescently and affably remarked that the days were
      lengthening out pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a manner I became acquainted with the one Sir Philip, and thereby,
      in a somewhat circuitous line, the original purpose which possessed my
      brush when I began this inept and commonplace letter is reached; for the
      person in question not only lay upon himself the obligation of leading me
      &ldquo;by the strings of his apron-garment&rdquo;&mdash;in the characteristic and
      fanciful turn of the barbarian language&mdash;to that same Palace on the
      following day, but thenceforth gracefully affecting to discern certain
      agreeable virtues in my conversation and custom of habit he frequently
      sought me out. More recently, on the double plea that they of his
      household had a desire to meet me, and that if I spent all my time within
      the Capital my impressions of the Island would necessarily be ill-balanced
      and deformed, he advanced a project that I should accompany him to a spot
      where, as far as I was competent to grasp the idiom, he was in the habit
      of sitting (doubtless in an abstruse reverie), in the country; and having
      assured myself by means of discreet innuendo that the seat referred to
      would be adequate for this person also, and that the occasion did not in
      any way involve a payment of money, I at once expressed my willingness
      towards the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      With numerous expressions of unfeigned regret (from a filial point of
      view) that the voice of one of the maidens of the household, lifted in the
      nature of a defiance against this one to engage with her in a two-handed
      conflict of hong pong, obliges him to bring this immature composition to a
      hasty close.

    <h2>
      LETTER X
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the authority of this high official, Sir Philip.
 The side-slipperyness of barbarian etiquette. The hurl-
 headlong sportiveness and that achieving its end by means of
 curved mallets.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;If this person&rsquo;s memory is accurately poised on the
      detail, he was compelled to abandon his former letter (when on the point
      of describing the customs of these outer places), in order to take part in
      a philosophical discussion with some of the venerable sages of the
      neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resuming the narration where it had reached this remote province of the
      Empire, it is a suitable opportunity to explain that this same Sir Philip
      is here greeted on every side with marks of deferential submission, and is
      undoubtedly an official of high button, for whenever the inclination
      seizes him he causes prisoners to be sought out, and then proceeds to
      administer justice impartially upon them. In the case of the wealthy and
      those who have face to lose, the matter is generally arranged, to his
      profit and to the satisfaction of all, by the payment of an adequate sum
      of money, after the invariable custom of our own mandarincy. When this
      incentive to leniency is absent it is usual to condemn the captive to
      imprisonment in a cell (it is denied officially, but there is no reason to
      doubt that a large earthenware vessel is occasionally used for this
      purpose,) for varying periods, though it is notorious that in the case of
      the very necessitous they are sometimes set freely at liberty, and those
      who took them publicly reprimanded for accusing persons from whose
      condition on possible profit could arise. This confinement is seldom
      inflicted for a longer period than seven, fourteen, or twenty-one days
      (these being lucky numbers,) except in the case of those who have been
      held guilty of ensnaring certain birds and beasts which appear to be
      regarded as sacred, for they have their duly appointed attendants who wear
      a garb and are trained in the dexterous use of arms, lurking with loaded
      weapons in secret places to catch the unwary, both by night and day.
      Upheld by the high nature of their office these persons shrink from no
      encounter and even suffer themselves to be killed with resolute unconcern;
      but when successful they are not denied an efficient triumph, for it is
      admitted that those whom they capture are marked men from that time
      (doubtless being branded upon the body with the name of their captor), and
      no future defence is availing. The third punishment, that of torture, is
      reserved for a class of solitary mendicants who travel from place to
      place, doubtless spreading the germs of an inflammatory doctrine of
      rebellion, for, owing to my own degraded obtuseness, the actual nature of
      their crimes could never be made clear to me. Of the tortures employed
      that known in their language as the &ldquo;bath&rdquo; (for which we have no real
      equivalent,) is the most dreaded, and this person has himself beheld men
      of gigantic proportions, whose bodies bore the stain of a voluntary
      endurance to every privation, abandon themselves to a most ignoble despair
      upon hearing the ill-destined word. Unquestionably the infliction is
      closely connected with our own ordeal of boiling water, but from other
      indications it is only reasonable to admit that there is an added
      ingredient, of which we probably have no knowledge, whereby the effect is
      enhanced in every degree, and the outer surface of the victim rendered
      more vulnerable. There is also another and milder form of torture, known
      as the &ldquo;task&rdquo;, consisting either of sharp-edged stones being broken upon
      the body, or else the body broken upon sharp-edged stones, but precisely
      which is the official etiquette of the case this person&rsquo;s insatiable
      passion for accuracy and his short-sighted limitations among the more
      technical outlines of the language, prevent him from stating definitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it here be openly confessed that the intricately-arranged titles used
      among these islanders, and the widely-varying dignities which they convey,
      have never ceased to embarrass my greetings on all occasions, and even
      yet, when a more crystal insight into their strangely illogical manners
      enables me not only to understand them clearly myself, but also to expound
      their significance to others, a necessary reticence is blended with my
      most profuse cordiality, and my salutations to one whom I am for the first
      time encountering are now so irreproachably balanced, that I can
      imperceptibly develop them into an engaging effusion, or, without actual
      offence, draw back into a condition of unapproachable exclusiveness as the
      necessity may arise. With us, O my immaculate sire, a yellow silk umbrella
      has for three thousand years denoted a fixed and recognisable title. A
      mandarin of the sixth degree need not hesitate to mingle on terms of
      assured equality with other mandarins of the sixth degree, and without any
      guide beyond a seemly instinct he perceives the reasonableness of assuming
      a deferential obsequiousness before a mandarin of the fifth rank, and a
      counterbalancing arrogance when in the society of an official who has only
      risen to the seventh degree, thus conforming to that essential principle
      of harmonious intercourse, &ldquo;Remember that Chang Chow&rsquo;s ceiling is Tong
      Wi&rsquo;s floor&rdquo;; but who shall walk with even footsteps in a land where the
      most degraded may legally bear the same distinguished name as that of the
      enlightened sovereign himself, where the admittedly difficult but even
      more purposeless achievement of causing a gold mine to float is held to be
      more praiseworthy than to pass a competitive examination or to compose a
      poem of inimitable brilliance, and where one wearing gilt buttons and an
      emblem in his hat proves upon ingratiating approach not to be a powerful
      official but a covetous and illiterate slave of inferior rank? Thus,
      through their own narrow-minded inconsistencies, even the most
      ceremoniously-proficient may at times present an ill-balanced attitude.
      This, without reproach to himself, concerns the inward cause whereby the
      one who is placed to you in the relation of an affectionate and
      ever-resourceful son found unexpectedly that he had lost the benignant
      full face of a lady of exalted title.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time I had formed the acquaintance, in an obscure quarter of the
      city, of one who wore a uniform, and was addressed on all sides as the
      commander of a band, while the gold letters upon the neck part of his
      outer garment inevitably suggested that he had borne an honourable share
      in the recent campaign in a distant land. As I had frequently met many of
      similar rank drinking tea at the house of the engaging countess to whom I
      have alluded, I did not hesitate to prevail upon this Captain Miggs to
      accompany me there upon an occasion also, assuring him of equality and a
      sympathetic reception; but from the moment of our arrival the attitudes of
      those around pointed to the existence of some unpropitious barrier
      invisible to me, and when the one with whom I was associated took up an
      unassailable position upon the central table, and began to speak
      authoritatively upon the subject of The Virtues, the unenviable condition
      of the proud and affluent, and the myriads of fire-demons certainly laying
      in wait for those who partook of spiced tea and rich foods in the
      afternoon, and did not wear a uniform similar to his own, I began to
      recognise that the selection had been inauspiciously arranged. Upon taxing
      some around with the discrepancy (as there seemed to be no more dignified
      way of evading the responsibility), they were unable to contend against me
      that there were, indeed, two, if not more, distinct varieties of those
      bearing the rank of captain, and that they themselves belonged to an
      entirely different camp, wearing another dress, and possessing no
      authority to display the symbol of the letters S.A. upon their necks. With
      this admission I was content to leave the matter, in no way accusing them
      of actual duplicity, yet so withdrawing that any of unprejudiced standing
      could not fail to carry away the impression that I had been the victim of
      an unworthy artifice, and had been lured into their society by the pretext
      that they were other than what they really were.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the bitter-flavoured memory of this, and other in no way dissimilar
      episodes, lingering in my throat, it need not be a matter of conjecture
      that for a time I greeted warily all who bore a title, a mark of rank, or
      any similar appendage; who wore a uniform, weapon, brass helmet, jewelled
      crown, coat of distinctive colour, or any excessive superfluity of pearl
      or metal buttons; who went forth surrounded by a retinue, sat publicly in
      a chair or allegorical chariot, spoke loudly in the highways and places in
      a tone of official pronouncement, displayed any feather, emblem, inscribed
      badge, or printed announcement upon a pole, or in any way conducted
      themselves in what we should esteem to be fitting to a position of high
      dignity. From this arose the absence of outward enthusiasm with which I at
      first received Sir Philip&rsquo;s extended favour; for although I had come to
      distrust all the reasonable signs of established power, I distrusted, to a
      much more enhanced degree, their complete absence; and when I observed
      that the one in question was never accompanied by a band of musicians or
      flower-strewers, that he mingled as though on terms of familiar
      intercourse with the ordinary passers-by in the streets, and never struck
      aside those who chanced to impede his progress, and that he actually
      preferred those of low condition to approach him on their feet, rather
      than in the more becoming attitude of unconditional prostration, I
      reasoned with myself whether indeed he could consistently be a person of
      well-established authority, or whether I was not being again led away from
      my self-satisfaction by another obliquity of barbarian logic. It was for
      this reason that I now welcomed the admitted power which he has of
      incriminating persons in a variety of punishable offences, and I perceived
      with an added satisfaction that here, where this privilege is more fully
      understood, few meet him without raising their hands to the upper part of
      their heads in token of unquestioning submission; or, as one would
      interpret the symbolism into actual words, meaning, &ldquo;Thus, from this point
      to the underneath part of our sandals, all between lies in the hollow of
      your comprehensive hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a written jest among another barbarian nation that these among
      whom I am tarrying, being by nature a people who take their pleasures
      tragically, when they rise in the morning say, one to another, &ldquo;Come,
      behold; it is raining again as usual; let us go out and kill somebody.&rdquo;
       Undoubtedly the pointed end of this adroit-witted saying may be found in
      the circumstance that it is, indeed, as the proverb aptly claims, raining
      on practically every occasion in life; while, to complete the comparison,
      for many dynasties past this nation has been successfully engaged in
      killing people (in order to promote their ultimate benefit through a
      momentary inconvenience,) in every part of the world. Thus the lines of
      parallel thought maintain a harmonious balance beyond the general analogy
      of their sayings; but beneath this may be found an even subtler edge, for
      in order to inure themselves to the requirement of a high destiny their
      various games and manners of disportment are, with a set purpose, so
      rigorously contested that in their progress most of the weak and
      inefficient are opportunely exterminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a favourite and well-attended display wherein two opposing bands,
      each clad in robes of a distinctive colour, stand in extended lines of
      mutual defiance, and at a signal impetuously engage. The design of each is
      by force or guile to draw their opponents into an unfavourable position
      before an arch of upright posts, and then surging irresistibly forward, to
      carry them beyond the limit and hurl them to the ground. Those who
      successfully inflict this humiliation upon their adversaries until they
      are incapable of further resistance are hailed victorious, and sinking
      into a graceful attitude receive each a golden cup from the magnanimous
      hands of a maiden chose to the service, either on account of her peerless
      outline, the dignified position of her House, or (should these incentives
      be obviously wanting,) because the chief ones of her family are in the
      habit of contributing unstintingly to the equipment of the triumphal band.
      There is also another kind of strife, differing in its essentials only so
      far that all who engage therein are provided with a curved staff, with
      which they may dexterously draw their antagonists beyond the limits, or,
      should they fail to defend themselves adequately, break the smaller bones
      of their ankles. But this form of encounter, despite the use of these
      weapons, is really less fatal than the other, for it is not a permissible
      act to club an antagonist resentfully about the head with the staff, nor
      yet even to thrust it rigidly against his middle body. From this
      moderation the public countenance extended to the curved-pole game is
      contemptibly meagre when viewed by the side of the overwhelming multitudes
      which pour along every channel in order to witness a more than usually
      desperate trial of the hurl-headlong variety (the sight, indeed, being as
      attractive to these pale, blood-thirsty foreigners as an unusually large
      execution is with us), and as a consequence the former is little reputed
      save among maidens, the feeble, and those of timorous instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus positioned, regarding a knowledge of their outside amusements, it has
      always been one of the most prominent ambitions of this person&rsquo;s strategy
      to avoid being drawn into any encounter. At the same time, the thought
      that the maidens of the household here (of whom there are several, all so
      attractively proportioned that to compare them in a spirit of definite
      preference would be distastefully presumptuous to this person,) should
      regard me as one lacking in a sufficient display of violence was not
      fragrant to my sense of refinement; so that when Sir Philip, a little time
      after our arrival, related to me that on the following day he and a chosen
      band were to be engaged in the match of a cricket game against adversaries
      from the village, and asked whether I cared to bear a part in the strife,
      I grasped the muscles of the upper part of my left arm with my right hand&mdash;as
      I had frequently seen the hardy and virile do when the subject of their
      powers had been raised questioningly&mdash;and replied that I had long
      concealed an insatiable wish to take such a part at a point where the
      conflict would be the most revengefully contested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being thus inflexibly committed it became very necessary to arrange a
      well-timed intervention (whether in the nature of bodily disorder, fire,
      or demoniacal upheaval, a warning omen, or the death of some of our chief
      antagonists), but before doing so I was desirous of understanding how this
      contest, which had hitherto remained outside my experience, was waged.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is here one of benevolent rotundity in whose authority lie the
      cavernous stores beneath the house and the vessels of gold and silver; of
      menial rank admittedly, yet exacting a seemly deference from all by the
      rich urbanity of his voice and the dignity of his massive proportions. In
      the affable condescension of his tone, and the discriminating
      encouragement of his attitude towards me on all occasions, I have read a
      sympathetic concern over my welfare. Him I now approached, and taking him
      aside, I first questioned him flatteringly about his age and the extent of
      his yearly recompense, and then casually inquired what in his language he
      would describe the nature of a cricket to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cricket?&rdquo; repeated the obliging person readily; &ldquo;a cricket, sir, is a
      hinsect. Something, I take it, after the manner of a grass-&rsquo;opper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;It is aptly likened. And, to continue the simile, a
      game cricket&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A game cricket?&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;well, sir, naturally a game one would be
      more gamier than the others, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inference is unflinching,&rdquo; I admitted, and after successfully luring
      away his mind from any significance in the inquiry by asking him whether
      the gift of a lacquered coffin or an embroidered shroud would be the more
      regarded on parting, I left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His words, esteemed, for a definite reason were as the jade-clappered
      melody of a silver bell. This trial of sportiveness, it became clear,&mdash;less
      of a massacre than most of their amusements&mdash;is really a rivalry of
      leapings and dexterity of the feet: a conflict of game crickets or
      grass-hoppers, in the somewhat wide-angled obscurity of their language,
      or, as we would more appropriately call it doubtless, a festive
      competition in the similitude of high-spirited locusts. To whatever degree
      the surrounding conditions might vary, there could no longer be a doubt
      that the power of leaping high into the air was the essential constituent
      of success in this barbarian match of crickets&mdash;and in such an
      accomplishment this person excelled from the time of his youth with a
      truly incredible proficiency. Can it be a reproach, then, that when I
      considered this, and saw in a vision the contempt of inferiority which I
      should certainly be able to inflict upon these native crickets before the
      eyes of their maidens, even the accumulated impassiveness of thirty-seven
      generations of Kong fore-fathers broke down for the moment, and unable to
      restrain every vestige of emotion I crept unperceived to the ancestral
      hall of Sir Philip and there shook hands affectionately with myself before
      each of the nine ironclad warriors about its walls before I could revert
      to a becoming state of trustworthy unconcern. That night in my own upper
      chamber I spent many hours in testing my powers and studying more
      remarkable attitudes of locust flight, and I even found to be within
      myself some new attainments of life-like agility, such as feigning the
      continuous note of defiance with which the insect meets his adversary, as
      remaining poised in the air for an appreciable moment at the summit of
      each leap, and of conveying to the body a sudden and disconcerting sideway
      movement in the course of its ascent. So immersed did I become in the
      achievement of a high perfection that, to my never-ending self-reproach, I
      failed to notice a supernatural visitation of undoubted authenticity; for
      the next morning it was widely admitted that a certain familiar demon of
      the house, which only manifests its presence on occasions of tragic omen,
      had been heard throughout the night in warning, not only beating its head
      and body against the walls and doors in despair, but raising from time to
      time a wailing cry of soul-benumbing bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      With every assurance that the next letter, though equally distorted in
      style and immature in expression, will contain the record of a
      deteriorated but ever upward-striving son&rsquo;s ultimate triumph.

      LETTER XI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the game which we should call &ldquo;Locusts,&rdquo; and the
 deeper significance of its acts. The solicitous warning of
 one passing inwards and the complication occasioned by his
 ill-chosen words. Concerning that victory already dimly
 foreshadowed.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;This barbarian game of agile grass-hoppers is not
      conducted in the best spirit of a really well-balanced display, and
      although the one now inscribing his emotions certainly achieved a wide
      popularity, and wore his fig leaves with becoming modesty, he has never
      since been quite free from an overhanging doubt that the compliments and
      genial remarks with which he was assailed owed their modulation to an
      unsubstantial atmosphere of two-edged significance which for a period
      enveloped all whom he approached; as in the faces of maidens concealed
      behind fans when he passed, the down-drawn lips and up-raised eyes of
      those of fuller maturity, the practice in most of his own kind of turning
      aside, pressing their hands about their middle parts, and bending forward
      into a swollen attitude devoid of grace, on the spur of a sudden
      remembrance, and in the auspicious but undeniably embarrassing manner in
      which all the unfledged ones of the village clustered about his retiring
      footsteps, saluting him continually as one &ldquo;James,&rdquo; upon whom had been
      conferred the gratifying title of &ldquo;Sunny.&rdquo; Thus may the outline of the
      combat be recounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      From each opposing group eleven were chosen as a band, and we of our
      company putting on a robe of distinctive green (while they elected to be
      regarded as an assemblage of brown crickets), we presently came to a
      suitable spot where the trial was to be decided. So far this person had
      reasonably assumed that at a preconcerted signal the contest would begin,
      all rising into the air together, uttering cries of menace, bounding
      unceasingly and in every way displaying the dexterity of our proportions.
      Indeed, in the reasonableness of this expectation it cannot be a matter
      for reproach to one of the green grass-hoppers&mdash;who need not be
      further indicated&mdash;that he had already begun a well-simulated note of
      challenge to those around clad in brown, and to leap upwards in a
      preparatory essay, when the ever-alert Sir Philip took him affectionately
      by the arm, on the plea that the seclusion of a neighbouring pavilion
      afforded a desirable shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that point it is difficult to convey an accurately grouped and
      fully spread-out design of the encounter. In itself the scheme and
      intention of counterfeiting the domestic life and rivalries of two
      opposing bands of insects was pleasantly conceived, and might have been
      carried out with harmonious precision, but, after the manner of these
      remote tribes, the original project had been overshadowed and the purity
      of the imagination lost beneath a mass of inconsistent detail. To this
      imperfection must it be laid that when at length this person was recalled
      from the obscurity of the pagoda and the alluring society of a maiden of
      the village, to whom he was endeavouring to expound the strategy of the
      game, and called upon to engage actively in it, he courteously admitted to
      those who led him forth that he had not the most shadowy-outlined idea of
      what was required of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless they bound about his legs a frilled armour, ingeniously
      fashioned to represent the ribbed leanness of the insect&rsquo;s shank, encased
      his hands and feet in covers to a like purpose, and pressing upon him a
      wooden club indicated that the time had come for him to prove his merit by
      venturing alone into the midst of the eleven brown adversaries who stood
      at a distance in poised and expectant attitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly, benignant one, this sport of contending locusts began, as one
      approached nearer to it, to wear no more pacific a face than if it had
      been a carnage of the hurl-headlong or the curved-hook varieties. In such
      a competition, it occurred to him, how little deference would be paid to
      this one&rsquo;s title of &ldquo;Established Genius,&rdquo; or how inadequately would he be
      protected by his undoubted capacity of leaping upwards, and even in a
      sideway direction, for no matter how vigorously he might propel himself,
      or how successfully he might endeavour to remain self-sustained in the
      air, the ill-destined moment could not be long deferred when he must come
      down again into the midst of the eleven&mdash;all doubtless concealing
      weapons as massive and fatally-destructive as his own. This prospect, to a
      person of quiescent taste, whose chief delight lay in contemplating the
      philosophical subtleties of the higher Classics, was in itself devoid of
      glamour, but with what funereal pigments shall he describe his sinking
      emotions when one of his own band, approaching him as he went, whispered
      in his ear, &ldquo;Look out at this end; they kick up like the very devil. And
      their man behind the wicket is really smart; if you give him half a chance
      he&rsquo;ll have your stumps down before you can say &lsquo;knife.&rsquo;&rdquo; Shorn of its
      uncouth familiarity, this was a charitable warning that they into whose
      stronghold I was turning my footsteps&mdash;perhaps first deceiving my
      alertness with a proffered friendship&mdash;would kick with the ferocity
      of untamed demons, and that one in particular, whose description, to my
      added despair, I was unable to retain, was known to possess a formidable
      knife, with which it was his intention to cut off this person&rsquo;s legs at
      the first opportunity, before he could be accused of the act. Truly, &ldquo;To
      one whom he would utterly destroy Buddha sends a lucky dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind lay the pagoda (though the fact that this one did admittedly turn
      round for a period need not be too critically dwelt upon), with three
      tiers of maidens, some already waving their hands as an encouraging token;
      on each side a barrier of prickly growth inopportunely presented itself,
      while in front the eleven kicking crickets stood waiting, and among them
      lurked the one grasping a doubly-edged blade of a highly proficient
      keenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are occasional moments in the life of a person when he as the inward
      perception of retiring for a few paces and looking back in order to
      consider his general appearance and to judge how he is situated with
      regard to himself, to review his past life in a spirit of judicial
      severity, to arrange definitely upon a future composed entirely of acts of
      benevolence, and to examine the working of destiny at large. In such a
      scrutiny I now began to understand that it would perhaps have been more
      harmonious to my love of contemplative repose if I had considered the
      disadvantages closer before venturing into this barbarian region, or, at
      least, if I had used the occasion profitably to advance an argument
      tending towards a somewhat fuller allowance of taels from your benevolent
      sleeve. Our own virtuous and flower-strewn land, it is true, does not
      possess an immunity from every trifling drawback. The Hoang Ho&mdash;to
      concede specifically the existence of some of these&mdash;frequently
      bursts through its restraining barriers and indiscriminately sweeps away
      all those who are so ill-advised as to dwell within reach of its malignant
      influence. From time to time wars and insurrections are found to be
      necessary, and no matter how morally-intentioned and humanely conducted,
      they necessarily result in the violation, dismemberment or extirpation of
      many thousand polite and dispassionate persons who have no concern with
      either side. Towns are repeatedly consumed by fire, districts scourged by
      leprosy, and provinces swept by famine. The storms are admittedly more
      fatal than elsewhere, the thunderbolts larger, more numerous, and all
      unerringly directed, while the extremities of heat and cold render life
      really uncongenial for the greater part of each year. The poor, having no
      money to secure justice, are evilly used, whereas the wealthy, having too
      much, are assailed legally by the gross and powerful for the purpose of
      extorting their riches. Robbers and assassins lurk in every cave; vast
      hoards of pirates blacken the surface of every river; and mandarins of the
      nine degrees must make a livelihood by some means or other. By day,
      therefore, it is inadvisable to go forth and encounter human beings, while
      none but the shallow-headed would risk a meeting with the countless demons
      and vampires which move by night. To one who has spent many moons among
      these foreign apparitions the absence of drains, roads, illustrated
      message-parchments, maidens whose voices may be heard protesting upon
      ringing a wire, loaves of conflicting dimensions, persons who strive to
      put their faces upon every advertisement, pens which emit fountains when
      carried in the pocket, a profusion of make-strong foods, and an
      Encyclopaedia Mongolia, may undoubtedly be mentioned as constituting a
      material deficiency. Affairs are not being altogether reputably conducted
      during the crisis; it can never be quite definitely asserted what the next
      action of the versatile and high-spirited Dowager Empress will be; and
      here it is freely contended that the Pure and Immortal Empire is incapable
      of remaining in one piece for much longer. These, and other inconveniences
      of a like nature, which the fastidious might distort into actual
      hardships, have never been denied, yet at no period of the nine thousand
      years of our civilisation has it been the custom to lure out the unwary,
      on the plea of an agreeable entertainment, and then to abandon him into
      the society of eleven club-bearing adversaries, one of whom may be
      depicted as in the act of imparting an unnecessary polish to the edge of
      his already preternaturally acute weapon, while those of his own band
      offer no protection, and three tiers of very richly-dressed maidens
      encourage him to his fate by refined gestures of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless this person had unconsciously allowed his inner meditations to
      carry him away, as it may be expressed, for when he emerged from this
      strain of reverie it was to discover himself in the chariot-road and&mdash;so
      incongruously may be the actions when the controlling intelligence is
      withdrawn&mdash;even proceeding at a somewhat undignified pace in a
      direction immediately opposed to an encounter with the brown locusts. From
      this mortifying position he was happily saved by emerging from these
      thought-dreams before it was too late to return, and, also, if the detail
      is not too insignificant to be related, by the fact that certain chosen
      runners from his own company had reached a point in the road before him,
      and now stood joining their outstretched arms across the passage and
      raising gravity-dispelling cries. Smiling acquiescently, therefore, this
      person returned in their midst, and receiving a new weapon, his own club
      having been absent-mindedly mislaid, he again set forth warily to the
      encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in this he did not altogether neglect a discreet prudence. The
      sympathetic person to whom he was indebted for the pointed allusion had
      specifically declared that they who used their feet with the desperate
      savagery of baffled spectres guarded the nearer limits of their position,
      the intention of his timely hint assuredly being that I should seek to
      approach from the opposite end, where, doubtless, the more humane and
      conciliatory grass-hoppers were assembled. Thus guided I now set forth in
      a widely-circuitous direction, having the point where I meant to open an
      attack clearly before my eyes, yet seeking to deliver a more effective
      onslaught by reaching it to some extent unperceived and to this end
      creeping forward in the protecting shadow of the long grass and untrimmed
      herbage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the one already referred to had incapably failed to express his
      real meaning, or whether he was tremulous by nature and inordinately
      self-deficient, concerns the narration less than the fact that he had
      admittedly produced a state of things largely in excess of the actual.
      There is no longer any serviceable pretext for maintaining that those
      guarding any point of their position were other than mild and benevolent,
      while the only edged weapon displayed was one courteously produced to aid
      this person&rsquo;s ineffectual struggles to extricate himself when, by some
      obscure movement, he had most ignobly entangled his pigtail about the
      claws of his sandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorant of this, the true state of things, I was still advancing subtly
      when one wearing the emblems of our band appeared from among the brown
      insects and came towards me. &ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; I exclaimed in a guarded tone,
      raising my head cautiously and rejoiced to find that I should not be
      alone. &ldquo;Here is one clad in green bearing succour, who will, moreover,
      obstinately defend his stumps to the last extremity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; replied the opportune person agreeably; &ldquo;we need a few
      like that. But do get up on your hind legs and come along, there&rsquo;s a good
      fellow. You can play at bears in the nursery when we get back, if you
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly one can simulate the movements of wild animals in a
      market-garden if the impersonation is thought to be desirable, yet the
      reasonable analogy of the saying is elusive in the extreme, and I followed
      the ally who had thus betrayed my presence with a deep-set misgiving
      although in the absence of a more trustworthy guide, and in the suspicion
      that some point of my every ordinary strategy had been inept, I was
      compelled to mould myself identically into his advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he left me, and I was endeavouring to dispel any idea of
      treachery towards those about by actions of graceful courtesy, when one&mdash;unworthy
      of burial&mdash;standing a score of paces distant, (to whom, indeed, this
      person was at the moment bowing with almost passionate vehemence, inspired
      by the conviction that he, for his part, was engaged in a like attention,)
      suddenly cast a missile&mdash;which, somewhat double-facedly, he had
      hitherto held concealed in his closed hand&mdash;with undeviating force
      and accuracy. So unexpected was the movement, so painfully-impressed the
      vindictive contact, that I should have instinctively seized the
      offensively-directed object and contemptuously hurled it back again, if
      the consequence of the blow had not deprived my mind of all retaliatory
      ambitions. In this emergency was manifested a magnanimous act worthy of
      the incense of a poem, for a person standing immediately by, seeing how
      this one was balanced in his emotions, picked up the missile, and although
      one of the foremost of the opposing band, very obligingly flung it back at
      the assailant. Even an outcast would not have passed this without a
      suitable tribute, and turning to him, I was remarking appreciatively that
      men were not divided by seas and wooden barriers, but by the unchecked and
      conflicting lusts of the mind, when the unclean and weed-nurtured traitor
      twenty paces distant, taking a degraded advantage from this person&rsquo;s
      attitude, again propelled his weapon with an even more concentrated
      perfidy than before. At this new outrage every brown cricket shrank from
      the attitude of alert vigour which hitherto he had maintained, and as
      though to disassociate themselves from the stain of complicity all crossed
      over and took up new positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this point, majestic head, in order to represent the adventure in
      its proper sequence, it has been advisable to present the details as they
      arose before the eyes of a reliable and dispassionate gazer. Now, however,
      it is no less seemly to declare that this barbarian sport of leaping
      insects is not so discreditably shallow as it had at first appeared, while
      in every action there may be found an apt but hidden symbol. Thus the
      presence of the two green locusts in the midst of others of a dissimilar
      nature represents the unending strife by which even the most pacific are
      ever surrounded. The fragile erection of sticks (behind which this person
      at first sought to defend himself until led into a more exposed position
      by one garbed in white,) may be regarded as the home and altar, and
      adequately depicts the hollowness of the protection it affords and the
      necessity of reliantly emerging to defy an invader rather than lurking
      discreditably among its recesses. The missile is the equivalent of a
      precise and immediate danger, the wooden club the natural instinct for
      defence with which all living creatures are endowed, so that when the
      peril is for the time driven away the opportunity is at hand for the
      display of virtuous amusements, the exchanging of hospitality, and the
      beating of professional drums as we would say. Thus, at the next attack
      the one sharing the enterprise with me struck the missile so proficiently
      that its recovery engaged the attention of all our adversaries, and then
      began to exhibit his powers by running and leaping towards me. Recognising
      that the actual moment of the display had arrived, this person at once
      emitted a penetrating cry of concentrated challenge, and also began to
      leap upwards and about, and with so much energy that the highly achieved
      limits of his flight surprised even himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the bystanders, esteemed, those who opposed us, and the members of
      our own band, although this leaping sportiveness is a competition more
      regarded and practised among all orders than the pursuit of commercial
      eminence, or even than the allurements of the sublimest Classics, it may
      be truly imagined that never before had they witnessed so remarkable a
      game cricket. From the pagoda a loud cry of wonder acclaimed the dexterity
      of this person&rsquo;s efforts; the three tiers of maidens climbed one upon
      another in their anxiety to lose no detail of the adventure, and
      outstanders from distant points began to assemble. The brown enemy at once
      abandoned themselves to a panic, and for the most part cast themselves
      incapably to the ground, rolling from side to side in an access of
      emotion; the two arbiters clad in white conferred together, doubtless on
      the uselessness of further contest, while the ally who had summoned me to
      take a part instead of being encouraged to display his agility in a like
      manner continued to run slavishly from point to point, while I overcame
      the distances in a series of inspired bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the sounds of encouragement from the ever-increasing
      multitude grew like the falling of a sudden coast storm among the ripe
      leaves of a tea-plantation, and with them the voices of many calling upon
      my name and inciting me to further and even higher achievements reached my
      ears. Not to grow small in the eyes of these estimable persons I continued
      in my flight, and abandoning all set movements and limits, I began to
      traverse the field in every direction, becoming more proficient with each
      effort, imparting to myself a sideway and even backward motion while yet
      in the upper spaces, remaining poised for an appreciable period, and
      lightly, yet with graceful ease, avoiding the embraces of those who would
      have detained me. Undoubtedly I could have maintained this supremacy until
      our band might justly have claimed the reward, had not the flattering
      cries of approval caused an indiscreet mistake, for the alarm being spread
      in the village that a conflagration of imposing ferocity was raging, an
      ornamental chariot conveying a band of warriors clad in brass armour
      presently entered into the strife, and discovering no fire to occupy their
      charitable energies they misguidedly honoured this offensive person by
      propelling a solid column of the purest and most refreshing water against
      his ignoble body when at the point of his highest flight. This
      introduction of a thunderbolt into the everyday life of an insect must be
      of questionable authenticity, yet not feeling sufficiently instructed in
      the lesser details of the sportiveness to challenge the device, I suffered
      myself to be led towards the pavilion with no more struggling than enough
      to remove the ignominy of an unresisting surrender, pleasantly remarking
      to those who bore me along that to a person of philosophical poise the
      written destiny was as apparent in the falling leaf as in the rising sun,
      pointing the saying thus: &ldquo;Although the Desert of Shan-tz is boundless,
      and mankind number a million million, yet in it Li-hing encountered his
      mother-in-law.&rdquo; Changing to meet another of our company setting forth with
      a club to make the venture, I was permitted for a moment to engage him;
      whereupon thrusting into his hand a leather charm against ill-directed
      efforts, and instructing him to bind it about his head, I encouraged him
      with the imperishable watch-word of the Emperor Tsin Su, &ldquo;The stars are
      indeed small, but their light carries as far as that of the full moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the steps of the pagoda so great was the throng of those who would have
      overwhelmed me with their gracious attention, that had not this person&rsquo;s
      neck become practically automatic by ceaseless use of late, he would have
      been utterly unequal to the emergency. As it was, he could only bestow a
      superficial hand-wave upon a company of gold-embroidered musicians who
      greeted his return with appropriate melody, and a glance of well-indicated
      regret that he had no fuller means of conveying his complicated emotions,
      in the direction of the uppermost tier of maidens. Then the awaiting Sir
      Philip took him firmly towards the inner part of the pavilion, and
      announced, so adroitly and with such high-spirited vigour had this one
      maintained the conflict, that it had been resolutely agreed on all sides
      not to make a test of his competence any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon a band of very sumptuously arrayed nymphs drew near with
      offerings of liquid fat and a variety of crimson fruit, which it is
      customary to grind together on the platter&mdash;unapproachable in the
      result, certainly, yet incredibly elusive to the unwary in the manner of
      bruising, and practically ineradicable upon the more delicate shades of
      silk garment. In such a situation the one who is now relating the various
      incidents of the day may be imagined by a broad-minded and affectionate
      sire: partaking of this native fruit and oil, and from time to time
      expressing his insatiable anguish that he continually fails to become more
      proficient in controlling the oblique movements of the viands, while the
      less successful crickets are constrained to persevere in the combat, and
      the ever-present note of evasive purport is raised by a voice from behind
      a screen exclaiming, &ldquo;Out afore? That he may have been, but do he think we
      was a-going to give he out afore? No, maaster, us doant a-have a circus
      every day hereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus may this imagination of competitive locusts be set forth to the end.
      If a fuller proof of what an unostentatious self-effacement hesitates to
      enlarge upon were required, it might be found in the barbarian printed
      leaf, for the next day this person saw a public record of the strife, in
      which his own name was followed by a numerical emblem signifying that he
      had not stumbled or proved incompetent in any one particular. Sir Philip,
      I beheld with pained surprise, had obtusely suffered himself to be caught
      out in the committal of fifty-nine set offences.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a not unnatural anticipation that, as a result of this painstaking
      description, this person will find two well-equipped camps of contending
      locusts in Yuen-ping on his return.

      LETTER XII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning the obvious misunderstanding which has entwined
 itself about a revered parent&rsquo;s faculties of passionless
 discrimination. The all-water disportment and the two, of
 different sexes, who after regarding me conflictingly from
 the beginning, ended in a like but inverted manner.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;Your gem-adorned letter containing a thousand
      burnished words of profuse reproach has entered my diminished soul in the
      form of an equal number of rusty barbs. Can it be that the incapable
      person whom, as you truly say, you sent, &ldquo;to observe the philosophical
      subtleties of the barbarians, to study their dynastical records and to
      associate liberally with the venerable and dignified,&rdquo; has, in your own
      unapproachable felicity of ceremonial expression, &ldquo;according to a discreet
      whisper from many sources, chiefly affected the society of tea-house
      maidens, the immature of both sexes, doubtful characters of all classes,
      and criminals awaiting trial; has evinced an unswerving affinity towards
      light amusement and entertainments of a no-class kind; and in place of a
      wise aloofness, befitting a wearer of the third Gold Button and the Horn
      Belt-clasp, in situations of critical perplexity, seems by his own
      ingenuous showing to have maintained an unparalleled aptitude for behaving
      either with the crystalline simplicity of a Kan-su earth-tiller, or the
      misplaced buffoonery of a seventh-grade body-writher taking the least
      significant part in an ill-equipped Swatow one-cash Hall of Varied
      Melodies.&rdquo; Assuredly, if your striking and well-chosen metaphors were not
      more unbalanced than the ungainly attitude of a one-legged hunchback
      crossing a raging torrent by means of a slippery plank on a stormy night,
      they would cause the very acutest bitterness to the throat of a dutiful
      and always high-stepping son. There is an apt saying, however, &ldquo;A quarrel
      between two soldiers in the market-place becomes a rebellion in the
      outskirts,&rdquo; and when this person remembers that many thousand li of mixed
      elements flow between him and his usually correct and dispassionate sire,
      he is impelled to take a mild and tolerant attitude towards the momentary
      injustice brought about by the weakness of approaching old age, the
      vile-intentioned mendacity of outcasts envious of the House of Kong, and,
      perchance, the irritation brought on by a too lavish indulgence in your
      favourite dish of stewed mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus re-established himself in the clear-sighted affection of an
      ever mild and perfect father, and cleansed the ground of all possible
      misunderstandings in the future, this person will concede the fact that,
      not to stand beneath the faintest shadow of an implied blemish in your
      sympathetic eyes, he had no sooner understood the attitude in which he had
      been presented than he at once plunged into the virtuous society of a band
      of the sombre and benevolent.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, so far as his intelligence enables him to grasp the position, may
      be reasonably accepted as the barbarian equivalent of those very
      high-minded persons who in our land devote their whole lives secretly to
      killing others whom they consider the chief deities do not really approve
      of; for although they are not permitted here, either by written law or by
      accepted custom, to perform these meritorious actions, they are so
      intimately initiated into the minds and councils of the Upper Ones that
      they are able to pronounce very severe judgments of torture&mdash;a much
      heavier penalty than merely being assassinated&mdash;upon all who remain
      outside their league. As some of the most objurgatory of these alliances
      do not number more than a score of persons, it is inevitable that the
      ultimate condition of the whole barbarian people must be hazardous in the
      extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having associated myself with this class sufficiently to escape their
      vindictive pronouncements, and freely professed an unswerving adherence to
      their rites, I next sought out the priests of other altars, intending by a
      seemly avowal to each in turn to safeguard my future existence
      effectually. This I soon discovered to be beyond the capacity of an
      ordinary lifetime, for whereas we, with four hundred million subjects find
      three religions to be sufficient to meet every emergency, these irresolute
      island children, although numbering us only as one to ten, vacillate among
      three hundred; and even amid this profusion it is asserted that most of
      the barbarians are unable to find any temple exactly conforming to their
      requirements, and after writing to the paper to announce the fact, abandon
      the search in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while I was becoming proficient in the inner subtleties of one of
      these orders&mdash;they who drink water on all occasions and wear a badge&mdash;that
      a maiden of some authority among them besought my aid for the purpose of
      amusing a band which she was desirous of propitiating into the adoption of
      this badge. It is possible that in the immature confidence of former
      letters this person may already have alluded to certain maidens with words
      of courteous esteem, but it is now necessary to admit finally that in the
      presence of this same Helena they would all appear as an uninviting growth
      of stunted and deformed poppies surrounding a luxuriant chrysanthemum. At
      the presumptuous thought of describing her illimitable excellences my
      fingers become claw-like in their confessed inadequacy to hold a
      sufficiently upright brush; yet without undue confidence it may be set
      down that her hands resembled the two wings of a mandarin drake in their
      symmetrical and changing motion, her hair as light and radiant-pointed as
      the translucent incense cloud floating before the golden Buddha of
      Shan-Si, thin white satin stretched tightly upon polished agate only
      faintly comparable to her jade cheeks, while her eyes were more
      unfathomable than the crystal waters of the Keng-kiang, and within their
      depths her pure and magnanimous thoughts could be dimly seen to glide like
      the gold and silver carp beneath the sacred river.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this insurpassable being approached me with the flattering petition
      already alluded to, my gratified emotions clashed together uncontrollably
      with the internal feeling of many volcanoes in movement, and my organs of
      expression became so entangled at the condescension of her melodious voice
      being directly addressed to one so degraded, that for several minutes I
      was incapable of further acquiescence than that conveyed by an adoring
      silence and an unchanging smile. No formality appeared worthy to greet her
      by, no expression of self-contempt sufficiently offensive to convey to her
      enlightenment my own sense of a manifold inferiority, and doubtless I
      should have remained in a transfixed attitude until she had at length
      turned aside, had not your seasonable reference to a Swatow limb-contorter
      struck me heavily and abruptly turned off the source of my agreement.
      Might not this all-water entertainment, it occurred to this one, consist
      in enticing him to drink a potion made unsuspectedly hot, in projecting
      him backwards into a vat of the same liquid, or some similar device for
      the pleasurable amusement of those around, which would come within the
      boundaries of your refined disapproval? As one by himself there was no
      indignity that this person would not cheerfully have submitted to, but the
      inexorable cords of an ingrained filial regard suddenly pulled him
      sideways and into another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Kong,&rdquo; exclaimed the bee-lipped maiden, when I had explained (as
      being less involved to her imagination,) that I was under a vow, &ldquo;we have
      been relying upon you. Could you not&rdquo;&mdash;and here she dropped her eyes
      and picked them up again with a fluttering motion which our lesser ones
      are, to an all-wise end, quite unacquainted with&mdash;&ldquo;could you not
      unvow yourself for one night, just to please ME?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the illuminated proficiency of her glance, and her
      honourable resolution to implicate me in the display by head or feet, the
      ever-revered image of a just and obedience-loving father ceased to have
      any further tangible influence. Let it be remembered that there is a deep
      saying, &ldquo;A virtuous woman will cause more evil than ten river pirates.&rdquo; As
      for the person who is recording his incompetence, the room and all those
      about began to engulf him in an ever-increasing circular motion, his knees
      vibrated together with unrestrained pliancy, and concentrating his voice
      to indicate by the allegory some faint measure of his emotion, he replied
      passionately, &ldquo;Let the amusement referred to take the form of sitting in a
      boiling cauldron exposed to the derision of all beholders, this one will
      now enter it wearing yellow silk trousers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is characteristic of these illogical out-countries that the all-water
      diversion did not, as a matter to record, concern itself with that liquid
      in any detail, beyond the contents of a glass vessel from which a
      venerable person, who occupied a raised chair, continually partook. This
      discriminating individual spoke so confidently of the beneficial action of
      the fluid, and so unswervingly described my own feelings at the moment&mdash;as
      of head giddiness, an inexactitude of speech, and no clear definition of
      where the next step would be arrived at&mdash;as the common lot of all who
      did not consume regularly, that when that same Helena had passed on to
      speak to another, I left the hall unobserved and drank successive
      portions, in each case, as the night was cold, prudently adding a measure
      of the native rice spirit. His advice had been well-directed, for with the
      fourth portion I suddenly found all doubtful and oppressive visions
      withdrawn, and a new and exhilarating self-confidence raised in their
      place. In this agreeable temper I returned to the place of meeting to find
      a priest of one of the lesser orders relating a circumstance whereby he
      had encountered a wild maiden in the woods, who had steadfastly persisted
      that she was one of a band of seven (this being the luckiest protective
      number among the superstitious). Though unable to cause their appearance,
      she had gone through a most precise examination at his hands without
      deviating in the slightest particular, whereupon distrusting the outcome
      of the strife, the person who was relating the adventure had withdrawn
      breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this versatile lesser priest had finished the narration, and the
      applause, which clearly showed that those present approved of the solitary
      maiden&rsquo;s discreet stratagem, had ceased, the one who occupied the central
      platform, rising, exclaimed loudly, &ldquo;Mr. Kong will next favour us with a
      contribution, which will consist, I am informed, of a Chinese tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now there chanced to be present a certain one who had already become
      offensive to me by the systematic dexterity with which he had planted his
      inopportune shadow between the sublime-souled Helena and any other who
      made a movement to approach her heaven-dowered outline. When this
      presumptuous and ill-nurtured outcast, who was, indeed, then seated by the
      side of the enchanting maiden last referred to, heard the announcement he
      said in a voice feigned to reach her peach-skin ear alone, yet
      intentionally so modulated as to penetrate the furthest limit of the room,
      &ldquo;A Chinese tale! Why, assuredly, that must be a pig-tail.&rdquo; At this
      unseemly shaft many of those present allowed themselves to become
      immoderately amused, and even the goat-like sage who had called upon my
      name concealed his face behind an open hand, but the amiably-disposed
      Helena, after looking at the undiscriminating youth coldly for a moment,
      deliberately rose and moved to a vacant spot at a distance. Encouraged by
      this fragrant act of sympathy I replied with a polite bow to indicate the
      position, &ldquo;On the contrary, the story which it is now my presumptuous
      intention to relate will contain no reference whatever to the
      carefully-got-up one occupying two empty seats in the front row,&rdquo; and
      without further introduction began the history of Kao and his three
      brothers, to which I had added the title, &ldquo;The Three Gifts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of this classical example of the snares ever lying
      around the footsteps of the impious, I perceived that the jocular
      stripling, whom I had so delicately reproved, was no longer present.
      Doubtless he had been unable to remain in the same room with the
      commanding Helena&rsquo;s high-spirited indignation, and anticipating that in
      consequence there would now be no obstacle to her full-faced benignity, I
      drew near with an appropriate smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhere officially recorded, &ldquo;There is only one man who knew with
      accurate certainty what a maiden&rsquo;s next attitude would be, and he died
      young of surprise.&rdquo; As I approached I had the sensation of passing into so
      severe an atmosphere of rigid disfavour, that the ingratiating lines upon
      my face became frozen in its intensity, despite the ineptness of their
      expression. Unable to penetrate the cause of my offence, I made a variety
      of agreeable remarks, until finding that nothing tended towards a becoming
      reconciliation, I gradually withdrew in despair, and again turned my face
      in the direction of that same accommodation which I had already found
      beneath the sign of an Encompassed Goat. Here, by the sarcasm of destiny,
      I encountered the person who had drawn the slighting analogy between this
      one&rsquo;s pig-tail and his ability as a story-teller. For a brief space of
      time the ultimate development of the venture was doubtfully poised, but
      recognising in each other&rsquo;s features the overhanging cloud of an allied
      pang, the one before me expressed a becoming contrition for the jest,
      together with a proffered cup. Not to appear out-classed I replied in a
      suitable vein, involving the supply of more vessels; whereupon there
      succeeded many more vessels, called for both singly and in harmonious
      unison, and the reappearance of numerous bright images, accompanied by a
      universal scintillation of meteor-like iridescence. In this genial and
      greatly-enlarged spirit we returned affably together to the hall, and
      entered unperceived at the moment when the one who made the announcements
      was crying aloud, &ldquo;According to the programme the next item should have
      been a Chinese poem, but as Mr. Kong Ho appears to have left the building,
      we shall pass him over&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Ho?&rdquo; exclaimed the somewhat impetuous one by my side, stepping
      forward indignantly and mounting the platform in his affectionate zeal.
      &ldquo;No one shall pass over my old and valued friend&mdash;this Ho&mdash;while
      I have a paw to raise. Step forward, Mandarin, and let them behold the
      inventor and sole user of the justly far-famed G. R. Ko-Ho hair restorer&mdash;sent
      in five guinea bottles to any address on receipt of four penny stamps&mdash;as
      he appeared in his celebrated impersonation of the human-faced Swan at
      Doll and Edgar&rsquo;s. Come on, oh, Ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; I replied, striving to follow him, &ldquo;yet with the wary
      greeting, &lsquo;Slowly, slowly; walk slowly,&rsquo; engraved upon my mind, for the
      barrier of these convoluted stairs&mdash;&rdquo; but at this word a band of
      maidens passed out hastily, and in the tumult I reached the dais and began
      Weng Chi&rsquo;s immortal verses, entitled &ldquo;The Meandering Flight,&rdquo; which had
      occupied me three complete days and nights in the detail of rendering the
      allusions into well-balanced similitudes and at the same time preserving
      the skilful evasion of all conventional rules which raises the original to
      so sublime a height.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 The voice of one singing at the dawn;
 The seven harmonious colours in the sky;
 The meeting by the fountain;
 The exchange of gifts, and the sound of the processional drum;
 The emotion of satisfaction in each created being;
 This is the all-prominent indication of the Spring.

 The general disinclination to engage in laborious tasks;
 The general readiness to consume voluminous potions on any
 pretext.
 The deserted appearance of the city and the absence of the
 come-in motion at every door;
 The sportiveness of maidens, and even those of maturer age,
 ethereally clad, upon the shore.
 The avowed willingness of merchants to dispose of their wares
 for half the original sum.
 This undoubtedly is the Summer.

 The yellow tea leaf circling as it falls;
 The futile wheeling of the storm-tossed swan;
 The note of the marble lute at evening by the pool;
 The immobile cypress seen against the sun.
 The unnecessarily difficult examination paper.
 All these things are suggestive of the Autumn.

 The growing attraction of a well-lined couch.
 The obsequious demeanour of message-bearers, charioteers, and
 the club-armed keepers of peace.
 The explosion of innumerable fire-crackers round the convivial
 shines,
 The gathering together of relations who at all other times
 shun each other markedly.
 The obtrusive recollection of a great many things contrary to
 a spoken vow, and the inflexible purpose to be more
 resolute in future.
 These in turn invariably attend each Winter.
</pre>
    <p>
      It certainly had not presented itself to me before that the words
      &ldquo;invariably attend&rdquo; are ill-chosen, but as I would have uttered them their
      inelegance became plain, and this person made eight conscientious attempts
      to soften down their harsh modulation by various interchanges. He was
      still persevering hopefully when he of chief authority approached and
      requested that the one who was thus employed and that same other would
      leave the hall tranquilly, as the all-water entertainment was at an end,
      and an attending slave was in readiness to extinguish the lanterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; I protested unassumingly, &ldquo;that which has so far been expressed is
      only in the semblance of an introductory ode. There follow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not argue with the Chair,&rdquo; exclaimed another interposing his
      voice. &ldquo;Whatever the Chair rules must be accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The innuendo is flat-witted,&rdquo; I replied with imperturbable dignity, but
      still retaining my hold upon the rail. &ldquo;When this person so far loses his
      sense of proportion as to contend with an irrational object, devoid of
      faculties, let the barb be cast. After that introduction dealing with the
      four seasons, the twelve gong-strokes of the day are reviewed in a like
      fashion. These in turn give place to the days of the month, then the moons
      of the year, and finally the years of the cycle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; exclaimed the perverse though well-meaning youth, whom I
      was beginning to recognise as the cause of some misunderstanding among us.
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want any more of his poem&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t blame you&mdash;my
      pal Ho, who is one of the popular Flip-Flap Troupe, offers to do some
      trick cycle-riding on his ears. What more can you expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We expect a policeman very soon,&rdquo; replied another severely. &ldquo;He has
      already been sent for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the one who had so persistently claimed me as an
      ally, &ldquo;perhaps I can do you a service by directing him here&rdquo;; and leaving
      this person to extricate himself by means of a reassuring silence and some
      of the larger silver pieces of the Island, he vanished hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      With some doubt whether or not this deviation into the society of the
      professedly virtuous, ending as it admittedly does in an involvement, may
      not be deemed ill-starred; yet hopeful.

      KONG HO.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 THE THREE GIFTS

 Related by Kong Ho on the occasion of the all-water
 disportment, under the circumstances previously set forth.
</pre>
    <p>
      BEYOND the limits of the township of Yang-chow there dwelt a rich
      astrologer named Wei. Reading by his skilful interpretation of the planets
      that he would shortly Pass Above, he called his sons Chu, Shan, and Hing
      to his side and distributed his wealth impartially among them. To Chu he
      gave his house containing a gold couch; to Shan a river with a boat; to
      Hing a field in which grew a prolific orange-tree. &ldquo;Thus provided for,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;you will be able to live together in comfort, the resources of
      each supplying the wants of the others in addition to his own
      requirements. Therefore when I have departed let it be your first care to
      sacrifice everything else I leave, so that I also, in the Upper Air, may
      not be left destitute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now in addition to these three sons Wei also had another, the youngest,
      but one of so docile, respectful, and self-effacing a disposition that he
      was frequently overlooked to the advantage of his subtle, ambitious, and
      ingratiating brothers. This youth, Kao, thinking that the occasion
      certainly called for a momentary relaxation of his usual diffidence, now
      approached his father modestly, and begged that he also might be included
      to some trivial degree in his bounty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reasonable petition involved Wei in an embarrassing perplexity.
      Although he had forgotten Kao completely in the division, he had now
      definitely concluded the arrangement; nor, to his failing powers, did it
      appear possible to make a just allotment on any other lines. &ldquo;How can a
      person profitably cut up an orange-tree, a boat, an inlaid couch, or a
      house?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Who can divide a flowing river, or what but unending
      strife can arise from regarding an open field in anything but its
      entirety? Assuredly six cohesive objects cannot be apportioned between
      four persons.&rdquo; Yet he could not evade the justice of Kao&rsquo;s implied rebuke,
      so drawing to his side a jade cabinet he opened it, and from among the
      contents he selected an ebony staff, a paper umbrella, and a fan inscribed
      with a mystical sentence. These three objects he placed in Kao&rsquo;s hands,
      and with his last breath signified that he should use them discreetly as
      the necessity arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the funeral ceremonies were over, Chu, Shan, and Hing came together,
      and soon moulded their covetous thoughts into an agreed conspiracy. &ldquo;Of
      what avail would be a boat or a river if this person sacrificed the nets
      and appliances by which the fish are ensnared?&rdquo; asked Shan. &ldquo;How little
      profit would lie in an orange-tree and a field without cattle and the
      implements of husbandry!&rdquo; cried Hing. &ldquo;One cannot occupy a gold couch in
      an empty house both by day and night,&rdquo; remarked Chu stubbornly. &ldquo;How
      inadequate, therefore, would such a provision be for three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Kao understood that his three brothers had resolved to act in this
      outrageous manner he did not hesitate to reproach them; but not being able
      to contend against him honourably, they met him with ridicule. &ldquo;Do not
      attempt to rule us with your wooden staff,&rdquo; they cried contemptuously.
      &ldquo;Sacrifice IT if your inside is really sincere. And, in the meanwhile, go
      and sit under your paper umbrella and wield your inscribed fan, while we
      attend to our couch, our boat, and our orange-tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; thought Kao to himself when they had departed, &ldquo;their words were
      irrationally offensive, but among them there may stand out a pointed edge.
      Our magnanimous father is now bereft of both comforts and necessities, and
      although an ebony rod is certainly not much in the circumstances, if this
      person is really humanely-intentioned he will not withhold it.&rdquo; With this
      charitable design Kao build a fire before the couch (being desirous, out
      of his forgiving nature, to associate his eldest brother in the offering),
      and without hesitation sacrificed the most substantial of his three
      possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It here becomes necessary to explain that in addition to being an expert
      astrologer, Wei was a far-seeing magician. The rod of unimpressionable
      solidity was in reality a charm against decay, and its hidden virtues
      being thus destroyed, a contrary state of things naturally arose, so that
      the next morning it was found that during the night the gold couch had
      crumbled away into a worthless dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this manifestation did not move the three brothers, although the
      geniality of Shan and Hing&rsquo;s countenances froze somewhat towards Chu.
      Nevertheless Chu still possessed a house, and by pointing out that they
      could live as luxuriantly as before on the resources of the river and the
      field and the tree, he succeeded in maintaining his position among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After seven days Kao reflected again. &ldquo;This avaricious person still has
      two objects, both of which he owes to his revered father&rsquo;s imperishable
      influence,&rdquo; he admitted conscience-stricken, &ldquo;while the being in question
      has only one.&rdquo; Without delay he took the paper umbrella and ceremoniously
      burned it, scattering the ashes this time upon Shan&rsquo;s river. Like the rod
      the umbrella also possessed secret virtues, its particular excellence
      being a curse against clouds, wind demons, thunderbolts and the like, so
      that during the night a great storm raged, and by the morning Shan&rsquo;s boat
      had been washed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new calamity found the three brothers more obstinately perverse than
      ever. It cannot be denied that Hing would have withdrawn from the guilty
      confederacy, but they were as two to one, and prevailed, pointing out that
      the house still afforded shelter, the river yielded some of the simpler
      and inferior fish which could be captured from the banks, and the
      fruitfulness of the orange-tree was undiminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of seven more days Kao became afflicted with doubt. &ldquo;There is
      no such thing as a fixed proportion or a set reckoning between a dutiful
      son and an embarrassed sire,&rdquo; he confessed penitently. &ldquo;How incredibly
      profane has been this person&rsquo;s behaviour in not seeing the obligation in
      its unswerving necessity before.&rdquo; With this scrupulous resolve Kao took
      his last possession, and carrying it into the field he consumed it with
      fire beneath Hing&rsquo;s orange-tree. The fan, in turn, also had hidden
      properties, its written sentence being a spell against drought, hot winds,
      and the demons which suck the nourishment from all crops. In consequence
      of the act these forces were called into action, and before another day
      Hing&rsquo;s tree had withered away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said with reason, &ldquo;During the earthquake men speak the truth.&rdquo; At
      this last disaster the impious fortitude of the three brothers suddenly
      gave way, and cheerfully admitting their mistake, each committed suicide,
      Chu disembowelling himself among the ashes of his couch, Shan sinking
      beneath the waters of his river, and Hing hanging by a rope among the
      branches of his own effete orange-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had thus fittingly atoned for their faults the imprecation was
      lifted from off their possessions. The couch was restored by magic art to
      its former condition, the boat was returned by a justice-loving person
      into whose hands it had fallen lower down the river, and the orange-tree
      put out new branches. Kao therefore passed into an undiminished
      inheritance. He married three wives, to commemorate the number of his
      brothers, and had three sons, whom he called Chu, Shan, and Hing, for a
      like purpose. These three all attained to high office in the State, and by
      their enlightened morals succeeded in wiping all the discreditable
      references to others bearing the same names from off the domestic tablets.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this story it will be seen that by acting virtuously, yet with an
      observing discretion, on all occasions, it is generally possible not only
      to rise to an assured position, but at the same time unsuspectedly to
      involve those who stand in our way in a just destruction.

      LETTER XIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning a state of necessity; the arisings engendered
 thereby, and the turned-away face of those ruling the
 literary quarter of the city towards one possessing a style.
 This foreign manner of feigning representations, and
 concerning my dignified portrayal of two.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;It is now more than three thousand years ago that
      the sublime moralist Tcheng How, on being condemned by a resentful
      official to a lengthy imprisonment in a very inadequate oil jar,
      imperturbably replied, &ldquo;As the snail fits his impliant shell, so can the
      wise adapt themselves to any necessity,&rdquo; and at once coiled himself up in
      the restricted space with unsuspected agility. In times of adversity this
      incomparable reply has often shone as a steadfast lantern before my feet,
      but recently it struck my senses with a heavier force, for upon presenting
      myself on the last occasion at the place of exchange frequented by those
      who hitherto have carried out your spoken promise with obliging
      exactitude, and at certain stated intervals freely granted to this person
      a sufficiency of pieces of gold, merely requiring in return an inscribed
      and signet-bearing record of the fact, I was received with no diminution
      of sympathetic urbanity, indeed, but with hands quite devoid of
      outstretched fulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small inner chamber, to which I was led upon uttering courteous
      protests, one of solitary authority explained how the deficiency had
      arisen, but owing to the skill with which he entwined the most intricate
      terms in unbroken fluency, the only impression left upon my superficial
      mind was, that the person before me was imputing the scheme for my
      despoilment less to any mercenary instinct on the part of his
      confederates, than to a want of timely precision maintained by one who
      seemed to bear an agreeable-sounding name somewhat similar to your own,
      and who, from the difficulty of reaching his immediate ear, might be
      regarded as dwelling in a distant land. Encouraged by this conciliatory
      profession (and seeing no likelihood of gaining my end otherwise), I
      thereupon declared my willingness that the difference lying between us
      should be submitted to the pronouncement of dispassionate omens, either
      passing birds, flat and round sticks, the seeds of two oranges, wood and
      fire, water poured out upon the ground or any equally reliable sign as he
      himself might decide. However, in spite of his honourable assurances, he
      was doubtless more deeply implicated in the adventure than he would admit,
      for at this scrupulous proposal the benignant mask of his expression
      receded abruptly, and, striking a hidden bell, he waved his hands and
      stood up to signify that further justice was denied me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner a state of destitution calling for the fullest acceptance
      of Tcheng How&rsquo;s impassive philosophy was created, nor had many hours faded
      before the first insidious temptation to depart from his uncompromising
      acquiescence presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time there was no one in whom I reposed a larger-sized piece of
      confidence (in no way involving sums of money,) than one officially styled
      William Beveledge Greyson, although, profiting by our own custom, it is
      unusual for those really intimate with his society to address him fully,
      unless the occasion should be one of marked ceremony. Forming a
      resolution, I now approached this obliging person, and revealing to him
      the cause of the emergency, I prayed that he would advise me, as one
      abandoned on a strange Island, by what handicraft or exercise of skill I
      might the readiest secure for the time a frugal competence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look here, aged man,&rdquo; at once replied the lavish William Greyson,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry yourself about that. I can easily let you have a few pounds
      to tide you over. You will probably hear from the bank in the course of a
      few days or weeks, and it&rsquo;s hardly worth while doing anything eccentric in
      the meantime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this delicately-worded proposal I was about to shake hands with myself
      in agreement, when the memory of Tcheng How&rsquo;s resolute submission again
      possessed me, and seeing that this would be an unworthy betrayal of
      destiny I turned aside the action, and replying evasively that the world
      was too small to hold himself and another equally magnanimous, I again
      sought his advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what silly upside-down idea is it that you&rsquo;ve got into that Chinese
      puzzle you call your head, Kong?&rdquo; he replied; for this same William was
      one who habitually gilded unpalatable truths into the semblance of a
      flattering jest. &ldquo;Whenever you turn off what you are saying into a
      willow-pattern compliment and bow seventeen times like an animated
      mandarin, I know that you are keeping something back. Be a man and a
      brother, and out with it,&rdquo; and he struck me heavily upon the left
      shoulder, which among the barbarians is a proof of cordiality to be
      esteemed much above the mere wagging of each other&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the matter of guidance,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;this person is ready to sit
      unreservedly on your well-polished feet. But touching the borrowing of
      money, obligations to restore with an added sum after a certain period,
      initial-bearing papers of doubtful import, and the like, I have read too
      deeply the pointed records of your own printed sheets not to prefer an
      existence devoted to the scraping together of dust at the street corners,
      rather than a momentary affluence which in the end would betray me into
      the tiger-like voracity of a native money-lender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you do me proud, Kong,&rdquo; said William Beveledge, after regarding me
      fixedly for a moment. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t remember that you are a flat-faced,
      slant-eyed, top-side-under, pig-tailed old heathen, I should be really
      annoyed at your unwarrantable personalities. Do you take ME for what you
      call a &lsquo;native money-lender&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pronouncements of destiny are written in iron,&rdquo; I replied
      inoffensively, &ldquo;and it is as truly said that one fated to end his life in
      a cave cannot live for ever on the top of a pagoda. Undoubtedly as one
      born and residing here you are native, and as inexorably it succeeds that
      if you lend me pieces of gold you become a money-lender. Therefore, though
      honourably inspired at the first, you would equally be drawn into the
      entanglement of circumstance, and the unevadible end must inevitably be
      that against which your printed papers consistently warn one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; asked Beveledge Greyson, still regarding me closely,
      as though I were a creature of another part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;there would be an alluring snare of graceful
      words, tea, and the consuming of paper-rolled herbs, and the matter would
      be lightly spoken of as capable of an easy adjustment; which, indeed, it
      cannot be denied, is how the detail stands at present. The next position
      would be that this person, finding himself unable to gather together the
      equivalent of return within the stated time, would greet you with a very
      supple neck and pray for a further extension, which would be permitted on
      the understanding that in the event of failure his garments and personal
      charms should be held in bondage. To escape so humiliating a necessity, as
      the time drew near I would address myself to another, one calling himself
      William, perchance, and dwelling in a northern province, to whom I would
      be compelled to assign my peach-orchard at Yuen-ping. Then by varying
      degrees of infamy I would in turn be driven to visit a certain Bevel of
      the Middle Lands, a person Edge carrying on his insatiable traffic on the
      southern coast, one Grey elsewhere, and a Mr. Son, of the west, who might
      make an honourable profession of lending money without any security
      whatever, but who in the end would possess himself of my ancestral
      tablets, wives, and inlaid coffin, and probably also obtain a lien upon my
      services and prosperity in the Upper Air. Then, when I had parted from all
      comfort in this life, and every hope of affluence in the Beyond, it would
      presently be disclosed that all these were in reality as one person who
      had unceasingly plotted to my destruction, and William Beveledge Greyson
      would stand revealed in the guise of a malevolent vampire. Truly that
      development has at this moment an appearance of unreality, and worthy even
      of pooh-pooh, but thus is the warning spread by your own printed papers
      and the records of your Halls of Justice, and it would be an unseemly
      presumption for one of my immature experience to ignore the outstretched
      and warning finger of authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Kong,&rdquo; he said at length, after considering my words attentively,
      &ldquo;I always thought that your mental outlook was a hash of Black Art, paper
      lanterns, blank verse, twilight, and delirium tremens, but hang me if you
      aren&rsquo;t sound on finance, and I only wish that you&rsquo;d get some of my friends
      to look at the matter of borrowing in your own reasonable, broad-minded
      light. The question is, what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I leaned heavily against his sagacious insight, adding,
      however, that even among a nation of barbarians one who could repeat the
      three hundred and eleven poems comprising the Book of Odes from beginning
      to end, and claim the degree &ldquo;Assured Genius&rdquo; would ever be certain of a
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied William Greyson,&mdash;&ldquo;in the workhouse. Put your degree
      in your inside pocket, Kong, and don&rsquo;t mention it. You&rsquo;ll have far more
      chance as a distressed mariner. The casual wards are full of B.A.&lsquo;s, but
      the navy can&rsquo;t get enough A.B.&lsquo;s at any price. What do you say to an
      organ, by the way? Mysterious musicians generally go down well, and I dare
      say there&rsquo;s room for a change from veiled ladies, persecuted captains and
      indigent earls. You ought to make a sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it in the nature of melodious sounds upon winding a handle?&rdquo; I asked,
      not at the moment grasping with certainty to what organ he referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some call them that,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;others don&rsquo;t. I suppose, now,
      you wouldn&rsquo;t care to walk to Brighton with your feet tied together, or
      your hair in curl papers, and then get on at a music hall? Or would there
      be any chance of your Legation kidnapping you if it was properly worked?
      &lsquo;Kong Ho, the great Chinese Reformer, tells the Story of his Life,&rsquo;&mdash;there
      ought to be money in it. Are you a reformer or the leader of a secret
      society, Kong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;we of our Line have ever been unflinching
      in our loyalty to the dynasty of Tsing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have known better, then. It&rsquo;s a poor business being that in
      your country nowadays. Pity there are no bye-elections on the African
      Labour Question, or you&rsquo;d be snapped up for a procession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this I replied that although the idea of moving in a processional
      triumph would readily ensnare the minds of the light and fantastic, I
      should prefer some more literary occupation, submissively adding that in
      such a case I would not stiffen my joints against the most menial lot,
      even that of blending my voice in a laudatory chorus, or of carrying
      official pronouncements about the walls of the city, for it is said with
      justice, &ldquo;The starving man does not peel his melon, nor do the parched
      first wipe round the edges of the proffered cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve set your mind on something literary,&rdquo; said Beveledge
      confidently, &ldquo;you have every chance of finishing up in a chorus or
      carrying printed placards about the streets, certainly. When it comes to
      that, look me up in Eastcheap.&rdquo; With this encouraging assurance of my
      ultimate success he left me, and rejoicing that I had not fallen into the
      snare of opposing a written destiny, I sought the literary quarters of the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this person has been able to write of any custom or facet of
      existence here in a strain of conscientious esteem, he has not hesitated
      to dip his brush deeply into the inkpot. Reverting backwards, this
      barbarian enactment of not permitting those who from any cause have
      decided upon spending the night in a philosophical abstraction to repose
      upon the public seats about the swards and open spaces is not conceived in
      a mood of affable toleration. Nevertheless there are deserted places
      beyond the furthest limits of the city where a more amiable full-face is
      shown. On the eleventh day of this one&rsquo;s determination to sustain himself
      by the exercise of his literary style, he was journeying about sunset
      towards one of these spots, subduing the grosser instincts of mankind by
      reviewing the wisdom of the sublime Lao Ch&rsquo;un, who decided that heat and
      cold, pain and fatigue, and mental distress, have no real existence, and
      are therefore amenable to logical disproof, while the cravings of hunger
      and thirst are merely the superfluous attributes of a former and lower
      state of existence, when a passer-by, who for some distance had been
      alternately advancing before and remaining behind, matched his footsteps
      into mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whichee way walk-go, John, eh?&rdquo; said this unfortunate being, who appeared
      to be suffering from a laborious deformity of speech. &ldquo;Allee samee load
      me. Chin-chin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Filled with compassion for one who evidently found himself alone in a
      strange land, in the absence of his more highly-accomplished companion,
      unable to indicate his wants and requirements to those about him, I
      regretfully admitted that I had not chanced to encounter that John whose
      wandering footsteps he sought; and to indicate, by not leaving him
      abruptly, that I maintained a sympathetic concern over his welfare, I
      pointed out to him the exceptional brilliance of the approaching night,
      adding that I myself was then directing a course towards a certain
      spacious Heath, a few li distant in the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing-dance tomollow, then?&rdquo; he said, with a condensed air of general
      disappointment. &ldquo;Chop-chop in a pay look-see show on Ham&mdash;Hamstl&mdash;oh
      damme! on &lsquo;Ampstead &lsquo;Eath? Booked up, eh, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gradually convinced that it was becoming necessary to readjust the
      significance of the incident, I replied that I had no intention of
      partaking of chops or food of any variety in an erected tent, but merely
      of passing the night in an intellectual seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the one who was walking by my side, regarding my garments with
      engaging attention, and at the same time appearing to regain an unruffled
      speech as though the other had been an assumed device, &ldquo;I understand&mdash;the
      Blue Sky Hotel. Well, I&rsquo;ve stayed there once or twice myself. A bit down
      on your uppers, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly this person may perchance lay his upper parts down for a short
      space of time,&rdquo; I admitted, when I had traced out the symbolism of the
      words. &ldquo;As it is humanely written in The Books, &lsquo;Sleep and suicide are the
      free refuges equally of the innocent and the guilty.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; exclaimed the energetic person, striking himself
      together by means of his two hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sinful to talk about suicide the
      day before bank holiday. Why, my only Somali warrior has vamoosed with his
      full make-up, and the Magnetic Girl too, and I never thought of suicide&mdash;only
      whether to turn my old woman into a Veiled Beauty of the Harem or a Hairy
      Lama from Tibet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not absolutely grasping the emergency, yet in a spirit of inoffensive
      cordiality I remarked that the alternative was insufferably perplexing,
      while he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I spotted you, and in a flash I got an idea that ought to take and
      turn out really great if you&rsquo;ll come in. Now follow this: Missionary&rsquo;s
      tent in the wilds of Pekin. Domestic interior by lamp-light. Missionary
      (me) reading evening paper; missionary&rsquo;s wife (the missus) making tea, and
      between times singing to keep the small pet goat quiet (small goat, a
      pillow, horsecloth, and pocket-handkerchief). Breaks down singing, sobs,
      and says she feels a strange all-over presentiment. Missionary admits
      being a bit fluffed himself, and lets out about a notice signed in blood
      that he&rsquo;s seen in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carried upon a pole?&rdquo; this person demanded, feeling that something of a
      literary nature might yet be wrested into the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a flagstaff if you like,&rdquo; conceded the other one magnanimously. &ldquo;A
      notice to the effect that it is the duty of every jack mother&rsquo;s son of
      them to douse the foreign devils, man, woman, and child, and especially
      the talk-book pass-hat-round men. Also that he has had several brick-ends
      heaved at him on his way back. Then stops suddenly, hits his upper crust,
      and says that it&rsquo;s like his blamed fat-headedness to frighten her; while
      she clutches at herself three times and faints away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amid the voluminous burning of blue lights?&rdquo; suggested this person
      resourcefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By rights there should be,&rdquo; admitted the one who was devising the
      representation; &ldquo;but it will hardly run to it. Anyway, it costs nothing to
      turn the lamp down&mdash;saves a bit in fact, and gives an effect. Then
      outside, in the distance at first you understand, you begin to work up the
      sound of the advancing mob&mdash;rattles, shouts, tum-tums, groans, tin
      plates and all that one mortal man can do with hands, feet and mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the interspersal of an occasional cracker and the stirring notes
      produced by striking a hollow wooden fish repeatedly?&rdquo; I cried; for let it
      be confessed that amid the portrayal of the scene my imagination had taken
      an allotted part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like to provide them, and don&rsquo;t set the bally show on fire,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;Anyhow, these two aren&rsquo;t supposed to notice anything even when
      the row gets louder. Then it drops and you are heard outside talking in
      whispers to the others&mdash;words of command and telling them to keep
      back half-a-mo, and so on. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless introducing a spoken charm and repeating the words of an
      incantation against omens, treachery, and other matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next a flap of the tent down on the floor is raised, and you reconnoitre,
      looking your very worst and holding a knife between your teeth and another
      in each hand. Wave a hand to your followers to keep back&mdash;or come on:
      it makes no difference. Then you crawl in on your stomach, give a terrific
      howl, and stab me in the back. That rolls me under the curtain, and so
      lets me out. The missus ups with the wood-chopper and stands before the
      cradle, while you yell and dance round with the knives. That ought to be
      made &lsquo;the moment&rsquo; of the whole piece. The great thing is to make enough
      noise. If you can yell louder than the talking-machine outfit on the next
      pitch we ought to turn money away. While you are at it I start a fresh row
      outside&mdash;shouts, cheers, groans, words of command and a paper bag or
      two. Seeing that the game is up you make a rush at the old woman; she
      downs you with the chopper, turns the lamp up full, shakes out a Union
      Jack over the sleeping infant, and finally stands in her finest attitude
      with one hand pointing impressively upwards and the other contemptuously
      downwards just as Rule Britannia is played on the cornet outside and I
      appear at the door in a general&rsquo;s full uniform and let down the curtain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For acting in the manner designated&mdash;as touching the noises both
      inside and out, the set dance with upraised knives, the casting to earth
      of himself, and being myself in turn vanquished by the aged female, with
      an added compact that from time to time I should be led by a chain and
      shown to the people from a raised platform&mdash;we agreed upon a daily
      reward of two pieces of silver, an adequacy of food, and a certain
      ambiguously-referred-to share of the gain. It need not be denied that with
      so favourable an opportunity of introducing passages from the Classics a
      much less sum would have been accepted, but having obtained this without a
      struggle, the one now recounting the facts raised the opportune suggestion
      of an inscribed placard, in order to fulfil the portent foreshadowed by
      William Greyson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll star you, never fear,&rdquo; assented the accommodating personage,
      and having by this time reached that spot upon the Heath where his
      Domestic Altar had been raised, we entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the most distinguished actors in this country take another name,&rdquo; he
      said reflectively, when he had drawn forth a parchment of praiseworthy
      dimensions and ink of three colours, &ldquo;and though I have nothing to say
      against Kong Ho Tsin Cheng Quank Paik T&rsquo;chun Li Yuen Nung for quiet
      unostentatious dignity, it doesn&rsquo;t have just the grip and shudder that we
      want. Now how does &lsquo;Fang&rsquo; strike you?&rdquo; and upon my courteous acquiescence
      that this indeed united within it those qualities which he required, he
      traced its characters in red ink upon a lavish scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fang Hung Sin&rsquo; about fits the idea of snap and bloodthirstiness, I
      should say,&rdquo; he continued, and using the brush and all the colours with an
      expert proficiency which would infallibly gain him an early recognition at
      any of our competitive examinations, he presently laid before me the
      following gracefully-composed notice, which was suspended from a
      conspicuous pole about the door of the tent on the following day.

</pre>
    <p>
      I will not upon this occasion, esteemed one, delay myself with an account
      of this barbarian Festival of Lanterns; or, as their language would convey
      it, Feast of Cocoa-nuts, beyond admitting that with the possible exception
      of an important provincial capital during the triennial examinations I
      doubt whether our own unapproachable Empire could show a more
      impressively-extended gathering, either in the diverse and ornamental
      efflorescence of head garb, in the affectionate display openly lavished by
      persons of one sex towards those of the other, or even one more successful
      in our own pre-eminent art of producing the multitudinous harmony of
      conflicting sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour this person submitted himself to be heavily
      shackled, and being led out before the assembled crowd, endeavoured by a
      smiling benignity of manner and by reassuring signs of welcome, to produce
      a favourable impression upon their sympathies and to allure them within.
      This pacific face was undoubtedly successful, however offensively the
      ill-conditioned one who stood by was inspired to express himself behind
      his teeth, for the space of the tent was very quickly occupied and the
      actions of simulation were to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without doubt it might have been better if this person had first made
      himself more fully acquainted with the barbarian manner of acting. The
      fact that this imagined play, which even in one of our inferior theatres
      would have filled the time pleasantly for two or three months, was to be
      compressed into the narrow limits of seven minutes and a half, should
      reasonably have warned him that amid the ensuing rapidity of word and
      action, most of the leisurely courtesies and all the subtle range of
      concealed emotion which embellish our own wood pavement must be ignored.
      But it is well and suggestively written, &ldquo;The person who deliberates
      sufficiently before taking every step will spend his life standing upon
      one leg.&rdquo; In the past this one had not found himself to be grossly
      inadequate on any arising emergency, and he now drew aside the hanging
      drapery and prepared to carry out a preconcerted part with intrepid
      self-reliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has already been expressed, that the reason and incentive urging me to
      a ready agreement lay in the opportunities by which suitable passages from
      the high Classics could be discreetly woven into the fabric of the plot,
      and the occupation thereby permeated with an honourable literary flavour.
      In accordance with this resolve I blended together many imperishable
      sayings of the wisest philosophers to present the cries and turmoil of the
      approaching mob, but it was not until I protruded my head beneath the
      hanging canopy in the guise of one observing that an opportunity arose of
      a really well-sustained effort. In this position I recited Yung Ki&rsquo;s
      stimulating address to his troops when in sight of an overwhelming foe,
      and, in spite of the continually back-thrust foot of the undiscriminating
      one before me, I successfully accomplished the seventy-five lines of the
      poem without a stumble. Then entering fully, with many deprecatory bows
      and expressions of self-abasement at taking part in so seemingly
      detestable an action, I treacherously, yet with inoffensive tact, struck
      the one wearing an all-round collar delicately upon the back. Not
      recognising the movement, or being in some other way obtuse, the person in
      question instead of sinking to the ground turned hastily to me in the form
      of an inquiry, leaving me no other reasonable course than to display the
      knife openly to him, and to assure him that the fatal blow had already
      been inflicted. Undoubtedly his immoderate retorts were inept at such a
      moment, nor was his ensuing strategy of turning completely round three
      times, striking himself about the head and body, and uttering ceremonious
      curses before he fell devoid of life&mdash;as though the earlier remarks
      had been part of the ordained scheme&mdash;to any degree convincing, and
      the cries of disapproval from the onlookers proved that they also regarded
      this one as the victim of an unworthy rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if the benches were filled at half a guinea a head would I take on
      another performance like that,&rdquo; exclaimed the one with whom I was
      associated, when it was over. &ldquo;Besides the dead loss of lasting three
      quarters of an hour it&rsquo;s tempting providence when the seats are movable. I
      suppose it isn&rsquo;t your fault, Kong, you poor creature, but you haven&rsquo;t got
      no glare and glitter. There&rsquo;s only one thing for it: you must be the Rev.
      Mr. Walker and I&rsquo;ll take Fang.&rdquo; He then robed himself in my attire, guided
      me among the intricacies of the all-round collar and outer garments in
      exchange, hung a slender rope about his back, and after completing the
      artifice by a skilful device of massing coloured inks upon our faces, he
      commanded me to lead him out by a chain and observe intelligently how a
      captive Boxer chief should disport himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had we reached the platform than the one whom I controlled leapt
      high into the air, dragged me to the edge of the erection, showed his
      teeth towards the assembly and waved his arms menacingly at them; then
      turning upon this person, he inflamed his face with passion, rattled his
      chain furiously, and uttered such vengeance-laden cries that, unable to
      subdue the emotion of fear, I abandoned all pretence, and dropping the
      chain, fled to the furthest recess of the tent, followed by the still
      threatening Fang.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an expression among us, &ldquo;Cheng-hu was too considerate: he tried
      to drive nails with a cucumber.&rdquo; Cheng-hu would certainly have quickly
      found the necessity of a weapon of three-times hardened steel if he had
      lived among these barbarians, who are insensible to the higher forms of
      politeness, in addition to acting in a contrary and illogical manner on
      all occasions. Instead of being repelled and discouraged by Fang&rsquo;s
      outrageous behaviour, they clamoured to be admitted into the tent more
      vehemently than before, and so successfully established the venture that
      the one to whom I must now allude throughout as Fang signified to me his
      covetous intention of reducing the performance by a further two and a half
      minutes in order to reap an added profit and to garner all his rice before
      the Hoang Ho rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for myself, revered, it would be immature to hold the gauze screen of
      prevarication between your all-discerning mind and my own trepidation.
      From the moment when I first saw the expression of utterly depraved
      malignity and deep-seared hate which he had cunningly engraved upon his
      face by means of the coloured inks, I was far from being comfortably
      settled within myself. Even the society of the not inelegant being of the
      inner chamber, whom it was now my part to console with alluring words and
      movements, could not for some time retain my face from a back-way instinct
      at every sound; but when the detail was reached that she sank into my
      grasp bereft of all energy, and for the first time I was just succeeding
      in forgetting the unpropitious surroundings, the one Fang, who had entered
      with unseemly stealth, suddenly hurled his soul-freezing battle-cry upon
      my ear and leapt forward with uplifted knife. Perceiving the action from
      an angle of my eye even as he propelled himself through the air, I could
      not restrain an ignoble wail of despair, and not scrupling to forsake the
      maiden, I would have taken refuge beneath a couch had he not seized my
      outer robe and hurled me to the ground. From this point to the close of
      the entertainment the vigorous person in question did not cease from
      raising cries and challenges in an unfaltering and many-fathomed stream,
      while at the same time he continued to spring from one extremity of the
      stage to the other surrounded by every external attribute of an insatiable
      tiger-like rage. It is circumstantially related that the one near at hand,
      who has been referred to as possessing a voiced machine, became demented,
      and bearing the contrivance to a certain tent erected by the charitable,
      entreated them to remove the impediment from its speech so that it might
      be heard again and his livelihood restored. When the action of brandishing
      a profusion of knives before the lesser one&rsquo;s eyes was reached, so
      nerve-shattering was the impression which Fang created that the back of
      the tent had to be removed in order to let out those who no longer had
      possession of themselves, and to let in those&mdash;to a ten-fold degree&mdash;who
      strove for admission on the rumour spreading that something exceptionally
      repellent was progressing within.
    </p>
    <p>
      With what attenuated organs of repose this person would have reached the
      end of so strenuous an occupation had he been compelled to twelve
      enactments each hour throughout the gong-strokes of the day without any
      literary relief, it is not enticing to dwell upon. This evil was averted
      by a timely intervention, for upon proceeding to the outer air for the
      third time I at once perceived among the foremost throng the engaging
      full-face of William Beveledge Greyson. This really painstaking individual
      had learned, as he afterwards explained, that the chiefs of exchange
      (those who in the first case had opposed me resolutely,) had received a
      written omen, and now in contrition were expressing their willingness to
      hold out a full restitution. With this assurance he had set forth in an
      unremitting search, and guided by street-watchers, removers of superfluous
      earth, families propelling themselves forward upon one foot, astrologers,
      two-wheeled charioteers, and others who move early and secretly by night,
      he had traced my description to this same Heath. Here he had been
      attracted by the displayed placard (remembering my honourable boast), and
      approaching nearer, he had plainly recognised my voice within. But in
      spite of this the successful disentanglement was by no means yet
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not expecting so involved a reversal of things, and being short-eyed by
      nature, William Greyson did not wait for a fuller assurance than to be
      satisfied that the one before him wore my robes and conformed in a general
      outline, before he addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kong Ho,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, &ldquo;what the Chief Evil Spirit are you doing
      up there?&rdquo; adding persuasively, &ldquo;Come down, there&rsquo;s a good fellow. I have
      something important to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus appealed to, the one Fang hesitated in doubt, seeing on the one hand
      a certain loss of face if he declined the conversation, and on the other
      hand having no clear perception of what was required from him. Therefore
      he entered upon a course of evasion and somewhat incapably replied, &ldquo;Chow
      Chop Wei Hai Wei Lung Tung Togo Kuroki Jim Jam Beri Beri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act the horned sheep,&rdquo; said Beveledge, who was both resolute and
      one easily set into violent motion by an opposing stream. &ldquo;Come down, or
      I&rsquo;ll come up and fetch you.&rdquo; And not being satisfied with Fang&rsquo;s
      ill-advised attempt to express himself equivocally, those around took up
      the apt similitude of a self-opinionated animal, and began to suggest a
      comparison to other creatures no less degraded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats yourselves!&rdquo; exclaimed the easily-inflamed person at my side, losing
      the inefficient cords of his prudence beneath the sting. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a rabbit?
      For two guinea-pigs I&rsquo;d mow all the grass between here and the Spaniards
      with your own left ears,&rdquo; and not permitting me sufficient preparation to
      withhold the chain more firmly, he abruptly cast himself down among them,
      amid a scene of the most untamed confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, affectionately-disposed brethren,&rdquo; I exclaimed, moving forward and
      raising my hand in refined disapproval, &ldquo;the sublime Confucius, in the
      twenty-third chapter of the book called &lsquo;The Great Learning,&rsquo; warns us
      against&mdash;&rdquo; but before I could formulate the allusion Beveledge
      Greyson, who at the sound of my conciliatory words had gazed first in
      astonishment and then in a self-convulsed position, drew himself up to my
      side, and taking a firm grasp upon the all-round collar, projected me
      without a pause through the tent, and only halting for a moment to point
      significantly back to the varied and animated scene behind, where, amid a
      very profuse display of contending passions, the erected stage was already
      being dragged to the ground, and a band of the official watch was in the
      act of converging from every side, he led me through more deserted paths
      to the scene of a final extrication.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a well-gratified sense of having held an unswerving course along the
      convoluted outline of Destiny&rsquo;s decree, to whatever tending.

    <h2>
      LETTER XIV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Concerning a pressing invitation from an ever benevolently-
 disposed father to a prosaic but dutifully-inclined son. The
 recording of certain matters of no particular moment.
 Concerning that ultimate end which is symbolic of the
 inexorable wheels of a larger Destiny.
</pre>
    <p>
      VENERATED SIRE,&mdash;It is not for the earthworm to say when and in what
      exact position the iron-shod boot shall descend, and this person, being an
      even inferior creature for the purpose of the comparison, bows an
      acquiescent neck to your very explicit command that he shall return to
      Yuen-ping without delay. He cannot put away from his mind a clinging
      suspicion that this arising is the result of some imperfection in his
      deplorable style of correspondence, whereby you have formed an impression
      quite opposed to that which it had been the intention to convey, and that,
      perchance, you even have a secret doubt whether upon some specified
      occasion he may not have conducted the enterprise to an ignoble, or at
      least not markedly successful, end. However, the saying runs, &ldquo;The
      stone-cutter always has the last word,&rdquo; and you equally, by intimating
      with your usual unanswerable and clear-sighted gift of logic that no
      further allowance of taels will be sent for this one&rsquo;s dispersal,
      diplomatically impose upon an ever-yearning son the most feverish anxiety
      once more to behold your large and open-handed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing thus poised, as it may be said, for a returning flight across the
      elements of separation, it is not inopportune for this person to let
      himself dwell gracefully upon those lighter points of recollection which
      have engraved themselves from time to time upon his mind without leading
      to any more substantial adventure worthy to record. Many of the things
      which seemed strange and incomprehensible when he first came among this
      powerful though admittedly barbarian people, are now revealed at a proper
      angle; others, to which he formerly imagined he had found the disclosing
      key, are, on the other hand, plunged into a distorting haze; while between
      these lie a multitude of details in every possible stage of
      disentanglement and doubt. As a final and painstaking pronouncement, this
      person has no hesitation in declaring that this country is not&mdash;as
      practically all our former travellers have declared&mdash;completely
      down-side-up as compared with our own manners and customs, but at the same
      time it is very materially sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, instead of white, black robes are the indication of mourning; but
      as, for the generality, the same colour is also used for occasions of
      commerce, ceremony, religion, and the ordinary affairs of life, the matter
      remains exactly as it was before. Yet with obtuse inconsistency the
      garments usually white&mdash;in which a change would be really noticeable&mdash;remain
      white throughout the most poignant grief. How much more markedly expressed
      would be the symbolism if during such a period they wore white outer robes
      and black body garments. Nevertheless it cannot be said that they are
      unmindful of the emblematic influence of colour, for, unlike the
      reasonable conviction that red is red and blue is blue, which has
      satisfied our great nation from the days of the legendary Shun, these
      pale-eyed foreigners have diverged into countless trifling imaginings, so
      that when the one who is now expressing his contempt for the development
      required a robe of a certain hue, he had to bend his mouth, before he
      could be exactly understood, to the degrading necessity of asking for
      &ldquo;Drowned-rat brown,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sunstroke magenta,&rdquo; &ldquo;Billingsgate purple,&rdquo; &ldquo;London
      milk azure,&rdquo; &ldquo;Settling-day green,&rdquo; or the like. In the other signs of
      mourning they do not come within measurable distance of our pure and
      uncomfortable standard. &ldquo;If you are really sincere in your regret for the
      one who has Passed Beyond, why do you not sit upon the floor for seven
      days and nights, take up all food with your fingers, and allow your nails
      to grow untrimmed for three years?&rdquo; was a question which I at first
      instinctively put to lesser ones in their affliction. In every case save
      one I received answers of evasive purport, and even the one stated reason,
      &ldquo;Because although I am a poor widder I ain&rsquo;t a pig,&rdquo; I deemed shallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already dipped a revealing brush into the subject of names. Were
      the practice of applying names in a wrong and illogical sequence
      maintained throughout it might indeed raise a dignified smile, but it
      would not appear contemptible; but what can be urged when upon an occasion
      one name appears first, upon another occasion last? A dignity is conferred
      in old age, and it is placed before the family designation borne by an
      honoured father and a direct line of seventeen revered ancestors. Another
      title is bestowed, and eats up the former like a revengeful dragon. New
      distinctions follow, some at one end, others at another, until a very
      successful person may be suitably compared to the ringed oleander snake,
      which has the power of growing equally from either the head or the tail.
      To express the matter by a definite allusion, how much more graceful and
      orchideous, even in a condensed fashion, would appear the designation of
      this selected one, if instead of the usual form of the country it was
      habitually set forth in the following logical and thoroughly Chinese
      style:&mdash;Chamberlain Joseph, Master, Mr., Thrice Wearer of the Robes
      and Golden Collar, One of the Just Peacemakers, Esquire, Member of the
      House of Law-givers, Leader in the Council of Commerce, Presider over the
      Tables of Provincial Government, Uprightly Honourable Secretary of the
      Outlying Parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the notes which at various times I have inscribed in a book for
      future guidance I find it written on an early page, &ldquo;They do not hesitate
      to express their fathers&rsquo; names openly,&rdquo; but to this assertion there
      stands a warning sign which was added after the following incident. &ldquo;Is it
      true, Mr. Kong,&rdquo; asked a lesser one, who is spoken of as vastly rich but
      discontented with her previous lot, of this person upon an occasion, &ldquo;is
      it really true that your countrymen to not consider it right to speak of
      their fathers&rsquo; names, even in this enlightened age?&rdquo; To this I replied
      that the matter was as she had eloquently expressed it, and, encouraged by
      her amiable condescension, I asked after the memory of her paternal
      grandsire, whose name I had frequently heard whispered in connection with
      her own. To my inelegant confusion she regarded me for a period as though
      I had the virtue of having become transparent, and then passed on in a
      most overwhelming excess of disconcertingly-arranged silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it now, Kong,&rdquo; said one who stood by (or, as we would express
      the same thought, &ldquo;You have succeeded in accomplishing the undesirable&rdquo;);
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that the old man was in the tripe and trotter line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To no degree,&rdquo; I replied truly. &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; I continued, matching his idiom
      with another equally facile, &ldquo;wherein was this person&rsquo;s screw loose? Are
      they not openly referred to&mdash;those of the Line of Tripe and Trotter&mdash;by
      their descendants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in most cases,&rdquo; he said, with a concentration that indicated a
      lurking sting among his words. &ldquo;Generally speaking, they aren&rsquo;t mentioned
      or taken into any account whatever. While they are alive they are kept in
      the background and invited to treat themselves to the Tower when nice
      people are expected; when dead they are fastened up in the family back
      cupboard by a score of ten-inch nails and three-trick Yale locks, so to
      speak. And in the meantime all the splash is being made on their muddy
      oof. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded agreeably, though, had the opportunity been more favourable, I
      would have made the feint to learn somewhat more of this secret practice
      of burying in the enclosed space beneath the stairs. Thus is it set forth
      why, after the statement, &ldquo;They do not hesitate to express their fathers&rsquo; 
      names openly,&rdquo; it is further written, &ldquo;Walk slowly! Engrave well upon your
      discreet remembrance the unmentionable Line of Tripe and Trotter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another point of comparison which the superficial have failed to record is
      to be found in the frequent encouragements to regard The Virtues which are
      to be seen, like our own Confucian extracts, freely inscribed on every
      wall and suitable place about the city. These for the most part counsel
      moderation in taking false oaths, in stepping heedlessly upon the unknown
      ground, in following paths which lead to doubtful ends, and other timely
      warnings. &ldquo;Beware a smoke-breathing demon,&rdquo; is frequently cast across
      one&rsquo;s path upon a barrier, and this person has never failed to accept the
      omen and to retrace his steps hastily without looking to the right or the
      left. Even our own national caution is not forgotten, although to conform
      to barbarian indolence it is written, &ldquo;Slowly, slowly; drive slowly.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Keep to the Right&rdquo; (or, &ldquo;Abandon that which is evil,&rdquo; as the analogy
      holds,) is perhaps the most frequently displayed of all, and doubtless
      many charitable persons obtain an ever-accruing merit by hanging the sign
      bearing these words upon every available post. Others are of a stern and
      threatening nature, designed to make the most hardened ill-doer pause, as&mdash;in
      their own tongue&mdash;&ldquo;Rubbish may be shot here&rdquo;; which we should render,
      &ldquo;At any moment, and in such a place as this, a just doom and extinction
      may overtake the worthless.&rdquo; This inscription is never to be seen except
      in waste expanses, where it points its significance with a multiplied
      force. There is another definite threat which is lavishly set out, and so
      thoroughly that it may be encountered in the least frequented and almost
      inaccessible spots. This, as it may be translated, reads, &ldquo;Trespass not
      the forbidden. The profligate may flourish like the gourd for a season,
      but in the end assuredly they will be detected, and justice meted out with
      the relentless fury of the written law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a converse position, the wide difference in the ceremonial forms of
      retaliatory invective has practically disarmed this usually eloquent
      person, and he long since abandoned every hope of expressing himself with
      any satisfaction in encounters of however acrimonious a trend. At first,
      with an urbane smile and gestures of dignified contempt, he impugned the
      authenticity of the Ancestral Tablets of those with whom he strove, in an
      unbroken stream of most bitter contumely. Finding them silent under this
      reproach, he next lightly traced their origin back through generations of
      afflicted lepers, deformed ape-beings, and Nameless Things, to a race of
      primitive ghouls, and then went on in relentless fluency to predict an
      early return in their descendants to the condition of a similar state. For
      some time he had a well-gratified assurance that those whom he assailed
      were so overwhelmed as to be incapable of retort, and in this belief he
      never failed to call upon passers-by to witness his triumph; but on the
      fourth occasion a young man whom I had thus publicly denounced for a
      sufficient though forgotten reason, after listening courteously to my
      venomous accusations, bestowed a two-cash piece upon me and passed on,
      remarking that it was hard, and those around, also, would have added from
      their stores had it been permitted. From this time onward I did not
      attempt to make myself disagreeable either in public or to those whom I
      esteemed privately. On the other hand, the barbarian manner of retort did
      not find me endowed by nature to parry it successfully. Quite lacking in
      measured periods, it aims, by an extreme rapidity of thrust and an
      insincerity of sequence, to entangle the one who is assailed in a
      complication of arising doubts and emotions. &ldquo;Who are you,&mdash;no one
      but yourself,&rdquo; exclaimed a hireling of hung-dog expression who claimed to
      have exchanged pledging gifts with a certain maiden who stood, as it were,
      between us, and falling into the snare, I protested warmly against the
      insult, and strove to disprove the inference before the paralogism lay
      revealed. Throughout the whole range of the Odes, the Histories, the
      Analects, and the Rites what recognised formula of rejoinder is there to
      the taunt, &ldquo;Oh, go and put your feet in mustard and cress&rdquo;; or how can
      one, however skilled in the highest Classics, parry the subtle
      inconsistencies of the reproach, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice bit of orl right, aren&rsquo;t
      you? Not arf, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among the arts of this country that of painting upon canvas is held in
      repute, but to a person associated with the masterpieces of the Ma epoch
      these native attempts would be gravity-dispelling if they were not too
      reminiscent of the torture chamber. It is rarely, indeed, that even the
      most highly-esteemed picture-makers succeed in depicting every portion of
      a human body submitted to their brush, and not infrequently half of the
      face is left out. Once, when asked by a paint-applier who was entitled to
      append two signs of exceptional distinction behind his name, to express an
      opinion upon a finished work, I diffidently called his attention to the
      fact that he had forgotten to introduce a certain exalted one&rsquo;s left ear.
      &ldquo;Not at all, Mr. Kong,&rdquo; he replied, with an expression of ill-merited
      self-satisfaction, &ldquo;but it is hidden by the face.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet it exists,&rdquo; I
      contended; &ldquo;why not, therefore, press it to the front at all hazard,
      rather than send so great a statesman down into the annals of posterity as
      deformed to that extent?&rdquo; &ldquo;It certainly exists,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;and one
      takes that for granted; but in my picture it cannot be seen.&rdquo; I bowed
      complaisantly, content to let so damaging an admission point its own
      despair. A moment later I continued, &ldquo;In the great Circular Hall of the
      Palace of Envoys there is a picture of two camels, foot-tethered, as it
      fortunately chanced, to iron rings. Formerly there were a drove of eight&mdash;the
      others being free&mdash;so exquisitely outlined in all their parts that
      one night, when the door had been left incautiously open, they stepped
      down from the wall and escaped to the woods. How deplorable would have
      been the plight of these unfortunate beings, if upon passing into the
      state of a living existence they had found that as a result of the limited
      vision of their creator they only possessed twelve legs and three whole
      bodies among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perchance this tactfully-related story, so applicable to his own
      deficiencies, may sink into the imagination of the one for whom it was
      inoffensively unfolded. Yet doubt remains. Our own picture-judgers take up
      a position at the side of work when they with to examine its qualities,
      retiring to an ever-diminishing angle in order to bring out the more
      delicate effects, until a very expert and conscientious critic will not
      infrequently stand really behind the picture he is considering before he
      delivers a final pronouncement. Not until these native artists are able to
      regard their crude attempts from the other side of the canvas can they
      hope to become equally proficient. To this fatal shortcoming must be added
      that of insatiable ambition, which prompts the young to the portrayal of
      widely differing subjects. Into the picture-room of one who might thus be
      described this person was recently conducted, to pass an opinion upon a
      scene in which were depicted seven men of varying nationalities and
      appropriately garbed, one of the opposing sex carrying a lighted torch, an
      elephant reclining beneath a fruitful vine, and the President of a
      Republic. For a period this person resisted the efforts of those who would
      have questioned him, withdrawing their attention to the harmonious lights
      upon the river mist floating far below, but presently, being definitely
      called upon, he replied as follows: &ldquo;Mih Ying, who was perhaps the
      greatest of his time, spent his whole life in painting green and yellow
      beetles in the act of concealing themselves beneath dead maple leaves upon
      the approach of day. At the age of seventy-five he burst into tears, and
      upon being approached for a cause he exclaimed, &lsquo;Alas, if only this person
      had resisted the temptation to be diffuse, and had confined himself to
      green beetles alone, he might now, instead of contemplating a misspent
      career, have been really great.&rsquo; How much less,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;can a
      person of immature moustaches hope to depict two such conflicting objects
      as a recumbent elephant and the President of a Republic standing beneath a
      banner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the temptation to deal critically with the religious instincts of the
      islanders this person draws an obliterating brush. As practically every
      traveller who has honoured our unattractive land with his effusive
      presence has subsequently left it in a printed record that our ceremonies
      are grotesque, our priesthood ignorant and depraved, our monasteries and
      sacred places spots of plague upon an otherwise flower-adorned landscape,
      and our beliefs and sacrifices only worthy to exist for the purpose of
      being made into jest-origins by more refined communities, the omission on
      this one&rsquo;s part may appear uncivil and perhaps even intentionally
      discourteous. To this, as a burner of joss-sticks and an irregular person,
      he can only reply by a deprecatory waving of both hands and a reassuring
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the two-sided memories of many other details hanging thickly around
      his brush, it would not be an achievement to continue to a practically
      inexhaustible amount. As of the set days when certain things are observed,
      among which fall the first of the fourth month (but that would disclose
      another involvement), another when flat cakes are partaken of without due
      caution, another when rounder cakes are even more incautiously consumed,
      and that most brightly-illuminated of all when it is permissible to
      embrace maidens openly, and if discreetly accomplished with no overhanging
      fear of ensuing forms of law, beneath the emblem of a suspended branch, in
      memory of the wisdom of certain venerable sages who were doubtless expert
      in the practice. As of the inconvenient custom when two persons are
      walking together that they should arrange themselves side by side, to the
      obvious discomfort of others, the sweeping away of all opportunities for
      agreeable politeness, and the utter disregard of the time-honoured example
      of the sagacious water-fowl. As of the inconsistency of refusing, even
      with contempt, to receive our most intimate form of regard and use this
      person&rsquo;s lip-cloth after a feast, yet the mulish eagerness in that same
      youth to drink from a cup previously used by a lesser one. As of the
      precision (which still remains a cloud of doubt,) with which creatures so
      intractable as the bull are successfully trained to roar aloud at certain
      gong-strokes of the day as an agreed signal. As of the streets in
      movement, the lights at evening, and the voices of those unseen. As of
      these and as of other matters, so multitudinous that they crowd about this
      person&rsquo;s mind like the assembling swallows, circling above the deserted
      millet fields before they turn their beaks to the sea, and dropping his
      brush (perchance with an acquiescent sigh), he, also, kow-tows
      submissively to a blind but appointed destiny, and prepares to seek a
      passage from an alien land of sojourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the impetuous craving of an affectionate son to behold a revered
      sire, intensified by the fact that he has reached the innermost lining of
      his sleeve; with affectionate greetings towards Ning, Hia-Fa, and T&rsquo;ian
      Yen, and an assurance that they have never been really absent from his
      thoughts.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Ernest Bramah, of whom in his lifetime Who&rsquo;s Who had so
 little to say, was born in Manchester. At seventeen he chose
 farming as a profession, but after three years of losing
 money gave it up to go into journalism. He started as
 correspondent on a typical provincial paper, then went to
 London as secretary to Jerome K. Jerome, and worked himself
 into the editorial side of Jerome&rsquo;s magazine, To-day, where
 he got the opportunity of meeting the most important
 literary figures of the day. But he soon left To-day to
 join a new publishing firm, as editor of a publication
 called The Minister; finally, after two years of this, he
 turned to writing as his full-time occupation. He was
 intensely interested in coins and published a book on the
 English regal copper coinage. He is, however, best known as
 the creator of the charming character Kai Lung who appears
 in Kai Lung Unrolls His Mat, Kai Lung&rsquo;s Golden Hours, The
 Wallet of Kai Lung, Kai Lung Beneath the Mulberry Tree, The
 Mirror of Kong Ho, and The Moon of Much Gladness; he also
 wrote two one-act plays which are often performed at London
 variety theatres, and many stories and articles in leading
 periodicals. He died in 1942.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
