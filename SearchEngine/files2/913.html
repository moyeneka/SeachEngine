<h3>ORIGIN OF A WELL-KNOWN PASSAGE IN HUDIBRAS.</h3>


<p>The often-quoted lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
 <p>"For he that fights and runs away</p>
 <p> May live to fight another day,"</p></div>

<p>generally supposed to form a part of <i>Hudibras</i>, are
to be found (as Mr. Cunningham points out, at
p. 602. of his <i>Handbook for London</i>), in the <i>Musarum
Delici&aelig;</i>, 12mo. 1656; a clever collection of
"witty trifles," by Sir John Mennis and Dr. James
Smith.</p>

<p>The passage, as it really stands in <i>Hudibras</i>
(book iii. canto iii. verse 243.), is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
 <p>"For those that fly may fight again,</p>
  <p>Which he can never do that's slain."</p></div>

<p>But there is a much earlier authority for these
lines than the <i>Musarum Delici&aelig;;</i> a fact which I
learn from a volume now open before me, the great
rarity of which will excuse my transcribing the
title-page in full:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote> "Apophthegmes, that is to saie, prompte, quicke,
  wittie, and sentencious saiynges, of certain Emperours,
  Kynges, Capitaines, Philosophiers, and Oratours, as
  well Grekes as Romaines, bothe veraye pleasaunt and
  profitable to reade, partely for all maner of persones,
  and especially Gentlemen. First gathered and compiled
  in Latine by the right famous clerke, Maister
  Erasmus, of Roteradame. And now translated into
  Englyshe by Nicolas Udall. <i>Excusam typis Ricardi
  Grafton</i>, 1542. 8vo."</blockquote>

<p>A second edition was printed by John Kingston,
in 1564, with no other variation, I believe,
than in the orthography. Haslewood, in a note
on the fly-leaf of my copy, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
 "Notwithstanding the fame of Erasmus, and the
  reputation of his translator, this volume has not
  obtained that notice which, either from its date or value,
  might be justly expected. Were its claim only founded
  on the colloquial notes of Udall, it is entitled to
  consideration, as therein may be traced several of the
  familiar phrases and common-place idioms, which have
  occasioned many conjectural speculations among the
  annotators upon our early drama."</blockquote>

<p>The work consists of only two books of the
original, comprising the apophthegms of Socrates,
Aristippus, Diogenes, Philippus, Alexander, Antigonus,
Augustus C&aelig;sar, Julius C&aelig;sar, Pompey,
Phocion, Cicero, and Demosthenes.</p>

<p>On folio 239. occurs the following apophthegm,
which is the one relating to the subject before
us:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
 <p>"That same man, that renneth awaie,</p>
  <p>May again fight, on other daie.</p></div>
<blockquote>
"&para; Judgeyng that it is more for the benefite of
one's countree to renne awaie in battaile, then to lese
his life. For a ded man can fight no more; but who
hath saved hymself alive, by rennyng awaie, may, in
many battailles mo, doe good service to his countree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"&sect; At lest wise, if it be a poinet of good service, to
renne awaie at all times, when the countree hath most
neede of his helpe to sticke to it."</blockquote>

<p>Thus we are enabled to throw back more than
a century these famous Hudibrastic lines, which
have occasioned so many inquiries for their origin.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of noticing a mistake
which has frequently been made concerning the
<i>French</i> translation of Butler's <i>Hudibras</i>. Tytler,
in his <i>Essay on Translation</i>; Nichols, in his
<i>Biographical Anecdotes of Hogarth</i>; and Ray, in his
 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>{178}</span><i>History of the Rebellion</i>, attributes it to Colonel
Francis Towneley; whereas it was the work of
<i>John</i> Towneley, uncle to the celebrated Charles
Towneley, the collector of the Marbles.</p>

<h3>FIELD OF THE BROTHERS' FOOTSTEPS.</h3>

<p>I do not think that Mr. Cunningham, in his
valuable work, has given any account of a piece
of ground of which a strange story is recorded by
Southey, in his <i>Common-Place Book</i> (Second Series,
p. 21.). After quoting a letter received from
a friend, recommending him to "take a view of
those wonderful marks of the Lord's hatred to
<i>duelling</i>, called <i>The Brothers' Steps</i>," and giving
him the description of the locality, Mr. Southey
gives an account of his own visit to the spot (a
field supposed to bear ineffaceable marks of the
footsteps of two brothers, who fought a fatal duel
about a love affair) in these words:&mdash;"We sought
for near half an hour in vain. We could find no
steps at all, within a quarter of a mile, no nor half
a mile, of Montague House. We were almost out
of hope, when an honest man who was at work
directed us to the next ground adjoining to a
pond. There we found what we sought, about
three quarters of a mile north of Montague House,
and about 500 yards east of Tottenham Court
Road. The steps answer Mr. Walsh's description.
They are of the size of a large human foot, about
three inches deep, and lie nearly from north-east
to south-west. We counted only seventy-six, but
we were not exact in counting. The place where
one or both the brothers are supposed to have
fallen, is still bare of grass. The labourer also
showed us the bank where (the tradition is) the
wretched woman sat to see the combat."</p>

<p>Mr. Southey then goes on the speak of his full
confidence in the tradition of their indestructibility,
even after ploughing up, and of the conclusions to
be drawn from the circumstance.</p>

<p>To this long note, I beg to append a query, as
to the latest account of these footsteps, previous
to the ground being built over, as it evidently
now must be.</p>

<h3>ON AUTHORS AND BOOKS, NO. 4.</h3>

<p>Verse may picture the feelings of the author,
or it may only picture his fancy. To assume the
former position, is not always safe; and in two
memorable instances a series of sonnets has been
used to construct a <i>baseless fabric</i> of biography.</p>

<p>In the accompanying sonnet, there is no such
uncertainty. It was communicated to me by
John Adamson, Esq., M.R.S.L., &amp;c., honourably
known by a translation of the tragedy of <i>Dona
Ignez de Castro</i>, from the Portuguese of Nicola
Luiz, and by a <i>Memoir of the life and writings
of Camoens</i>, &amp;c. It was not intended for publication,
but now appears, at my request.</p>

<p>Mr. Adamson, it should be stated, is a
corresponding member of the Royal Academy of
Sciences of Lisbon, and has received diplomas of
the orders of Christ and the Tower-and-Sword.
The <i>coming storm</i> alludes to the menace of invasion
by France.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i8">"SONNET.</p>
<p>"O Portugal! whene'er I see thy name</p>
<p class="i2">  What proud emotions rise within my breast!</p>
<p>To <i>thee</i> I owe&mdash;from <i>thee</i> derive that fame</p>
<p class="i2">  Which here may linger when I lie at rest.</p>
<p>When as a youth I landed on thy shore,</p>
<p class="i2">  How little did I think I e'er could be</p>
<p class="i2">  Worthy the honours thou has giv'n to me;</p>
<p>And when the coming storm I did deplore,</p>
<p>Drove me far from thee by its hostile threat&mdash;</p>
<p>With feelings which can never be effaced,</p>
<p class="i2">  I learn'd to commune with those writers old</p>
<p class="i2">  Who had the deeds of they great chieftains told;</p>
<p>Departed bards in converse sweet I met,</p>
<p>I'd seen where they had liv'd&mdash;the land Camoens grac'd."</p>
</div>
<p>I venture to add the titles of two interesting
volumes which have been printed subsequently to
the publications of Lowndes and Martin. It may
be a useful hint to students and collectors:&mdash;</p>

<p>"BIBLIOTHECA LUSITANA, or catalogue of books and
tracts, relating to the history, literature, and poetry, of
Portugal: forming part of the library of John Adamson,
M.R.S.L. etc. <i>Newcastle on Tyne</i>, 1836. 8vo.</p>

<p>"LUSITANIA ILLUSTRATA; notices on the history,
antiquities, literature, etc. of Portugal. Literary
department. Part I. Selection of sonnets, with biographical
Sketches of the author, by John Adamson,
M.R.S.L. etc. <i>Newcastle upon Tyne</i>, 1842. 8vo."</p>

<h3>RECEIPTS TO THE BEGGAR'S OPERA ON ITS
PRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Every body is aware of the prodigious and
unexpected success of Gay's <i>Beggar's Opera</i> on its
first production; it was offered to Colley Cibber
at Drury Lane, and refused, and the author took
it to Rich, at the Lincoln's-Inn-Fields theatre,
by whom it was accepted, but not without
hesitation. It ran for 62 nights (not 63 nights,
as has been stated in some authorities) in the
season of 1727&ndash;1728; of these, 32 nights were
in succession; and, from the original Account-book
of the manager, C.M. Rich, I am enabled
to give an exact statement of the money taken at
the doors on each night, distinguishing such
performances as were for the benefit of the author,
viz. the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 15th nights, which put
exactly 693<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. into Gay's pocket. This is
a new circumstance in the biography of one of our
most fascinating English writers, whether in prose
or verse. Rich records that the king, queen, and  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>{179}</span>
princesses were present on the 21st repetition, but
that was by no means one of the fullest houses.
The very bill sold at the doors on the occasion
has been preserved, and hereafter may be furnished
for the amusement of your readers. It
appears, that when the run of the <i>Beggar's
Opera</i> was somewhat abruptly terminated by
the advance of the season and the benefits of the
actors, the "takings," as they were and still are
called, were larger than ever. The performances
commenced on 29th January, 1728, and that
some striking novelty was required at the
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields theatre, to improve the prospects
of the manager, may be judged from the fact that
the new tragedy of <i>Sesostris</i>, brought out on the
17th January, was played for the benefit of its
author (John Sturm) on its 6th night to only
58<i>l</i>. 19<i>s</i>., while the house was capable of holding
at least 200<i>l</i>.</p>

<p>In the following statement of the receipts to
the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>, I have not thought it necessary
to insert the days of the months:&mdash;</p>

<p>Therefore, when the run was interrupted, the
attraction of the opera was greater than it
had been on any previous night, excepting the
6th, which was one of those set apart for the
remuneration of the author, when the receipt
was 189<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>. The total sum realised by the
32 successive performances was 5351<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>., of
which, as we have already shown, Gay obtained
693<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i>. To him it was all clear profit; but
from the sum obtained by Rich are, of course, to
be deducted the expenses of the company, lights,
house-rent, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The successful career of the piece was checked,
as I have said, by the intervention of benefits,
and the manager would not allow it to be repeated
even for Walker's and Miss Fenton's nights, the
Macheath and Polly of the opera; but, in order to
connect the latter with it, when Miss Fenton
issued her bill for <i>The Beaux's Stratagem</i>, on
29th April, it was headed that it was "for the
benefit of Polly." An exception was, however,
made in favour of John Rich, the brother of the
manager, for whose benefit the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>
was played on 26th February, when the receipt
was 184<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>. Miss Fenton was allowed a second
benefit, on the 4th May, in consequence, we may
suppose, of her great claims in connection with
the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>, and then it was performed to
a house containing 155<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>. The greatest recorded
receipt, in its first season, was on the 13th April,
when, for some unexplained cause the audience
was so numerous that 198<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>. were taken at
the doors.</p>

<p>After this date there appears to have been considerable
fluctuation in the profits derived from
repetitions of the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>. On the 5th
May, the day after Polly Fenton's (her real name
was Lavinia) second benefit, the proceeds fell to
78<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>., the 50th night produced 69<i>l</i>. 12<i>s</i>., and
the 51st only 26<i>l</i>. 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The next night the
receipt suddenly rose again to 134<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., and
it continued to range between 53<i>l</i>. and 105<i>l</i>.
until the 62nd and last night (19th June), when
the sum taken was 98<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Fenton left the stage at the end of the
season, to be made Duchess of Bolton, and in the
next season her place, as regards the <i>Beggar's
Opera</i>, was taken by Miss Warren, and on 20th
September it attracted 75<i>l</i>. 7<i>s</i>.; at the end of
November it drew only 23<i>l</i>., yet, on the 11th
December, for some reason not stated by the
manager, the takings amounted to 112<i>l</i>. 9<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
On January 1st a new experiment was tried with
the opera, for it was represented by children, and
the Prince of Wales commanded it on one or more
of the eight successive performances it thus underwent.
On 5th May we find Miss Cantrell taking
Miss Warren's character, and in the whole, the
<i>Beggar's Opera</i> was acted more than forty times
in its second year, 1728&ndash;9, including the performances
by "Lilliputians" as well as comedians.
This is, perhaps, as much of its early history as
your readers will care about.</p>

<h3>SEWERAGE IN ETRURIA.</h3>

<p>I have been particularly struck, in reading <i>The
Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria</i>, of George Dennis,
by the great disparity there appears between
the ancient population of this country and the
present.</p>

<p>The ancient population appears, moreover, to
have been located in circumstances not by any
means favourable to the health of the people.
Those cities surrounded by high walls, and
entered by singularly small gateways, must have
been very badly ventilated, and very unfavourable
to health; and yet it is not reasonable to suppose
they could have been so unhealthy then as the
author describes the country at present to be.
It is hardly possible to imagine so great a people
as the Etruscans, the wretched fever-stricken
objects the present inhabitants of the Maremna
are described to be.</p>

<p>To what, then, can this great difference be
ascribed? The Etruscans appear to have taken
very great pains with the drainage of their cities;
on many sites the cloaca are the only remains of
their former industry and greatness which remain.
They were also careful to bury their dead outside
their city walls; and it is, no doubt, to these two
circumstances, principally, that their increase and
greatness, as a people, are to be ascribed. But
why do not the present inhabitants avail themselves
of the same means to health? Is it that
they are idle, or are they too broken spirited
and poverty-stricken to unite in any public work?
Or has the climate changed?</p>

<p>Perhaps it was owing to some defect in their
civil polity that the ancients were comparatively
so easily put down by the Roman power, which
might have been the superior civilisation.
Possibly the great majority of the people may have
been dissatisfied with their rulers, and gladly
removed to another place and another form of
government. It is even possible, and indeed
likely, that these great public works may have
been carried on by the forced labour of the
poorest and, consequently, the most numerous
class of the population, and that, consequently,
they had no particular tie to their native city, as
being only a hardship to them; and they may
even have had a dislike to sewers in themselves,
as reminding them of their bondage, and which
dislike their descendants have inherited, and for
which they are now suffering. At any rate, it is
an instructive example to our present citizens of
the value of drainage and sanitary arrangements,
and shows that the importance of these things was
recognised and appreciated in the earliest times.

<h3>ANDREW FRUSIUS&mdash;ANDR&Eacute; DES FREUX.</h3>

<p>Many of your readers, as well as "ROTERODAMUS,"
will be ready to acknowledge their obligation
to Mr. Bruce for his prompt identification of
the author of the epigram against Erasmus
(pp. 27, 28.). I have just referred to the catalogue of
the library of this university, and I regret to say
that we have no copy of any of the works of
Frusius. Mr. Bruce says he knows nothing of
Frusius as an author. I believe there is no
mention of him in any English bibliographical or
biographical work. There is, however, a notice
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>{181}</span>of him in the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>, vol. xvi.
(Paris), and in the <i>Biografia Universale</i>, vol. xxi.
(Venezia). As these works have, perhaps, found
their way into very few private English libraries,
I send you the following sketch, which will probably
be acceptable to your readers. It is much
to be lamented that sufficient encouragement
cannot be given in this country for the production
of a <i>Universal Biography</i>. Roses's work, which
promised to be a giant, dwindled down to a
miserable pigmy; and that under "The Society
for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge" was
strangled in its birth.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; des Freux, better known by his Latin
name, Frusius, was born at Chartres, in the beginning
of the sixteenth century. He embraced
the life of an ecclesiastic, and obtained the cure
of Thiverval, which he held many years with
great credit to himself. The high reputation of
Ignatius Loyola, who was then at Rome, with
authority from the Holy See to found the Society
of the Jesuits, led Frusius to that city, where he
was admitted a member of the new order in 1541,
and shortly after became secretary to Loyola.
He contributed to the establishment of the Society
at Parma, Venice, and many towns of Italy and
Sicily. He was the first Jesuit who taught the
Greek language at Messina; he also gave public
lectures on the Holy Scriptures in Rome. He
was appointed Rector of the German College at
Rome, shortly before his death, which occurred
on the 25th of October, 1556, three months and
six days after the death of Loyola. Frusius had
studied, with equal success, theology, medicine,
and law: he was a good mathematician, an excellent
musician, and made Latin verses with such
facility, that he composed them, on the instant, on
all sorts of subjects. But these verses were neither
so elegant nor so harmonious, as Alegambe asserts
<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>,
since he adds, that it requires close attention to
distinguish them from prose. Frusius translated,
from Spanish into Latin, the <i>Spiritual Exercises</i>
of Loyola. He was the author of the following
works:&mdash;Two small pieces, in verse, <i>De Verborum
et Rerum Copia</i>, and <i>Summa Latin&aelig; Syntaxeos</i>:
these were published in several different places;
<i>Theses Collect&aelig; ex Interpretatione Geneseos; Assertiones
Theologic&aelig;</i>, Rome, 1554; <i>Poemata</i>, Cologne,
1558&mdash;this collection often reprinted at
Lyons, Antwerp and Tournon, contains 255<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
epigrams against the heretics, amongst whom he
places Erasmus;&mdash;a poem <i>De Agno Dei</i>; and,
lastly, another poem, entitled <i>Echo de Presenti
Christian&aelig; Religionis Calamitate</i>, which has been
sometimes cited as an example of a great <i>difficult&egrave;
vaincue</i>. The edition of Tournon contains also a
poem, <i>De Simplicitate</i>, of which Alegambe speaks
with praise. To Frusius was also owing an edition
of Martial's <i>Epigrams</i>, divested of their obscenities.</p>

<h3>OPINIONS RESPECTING BURNET</h3>

<p>A small <i>catena patrum</i> has been given respecting
Burnet, as a historian, in No. 3. pp. 40, 41., to
which two more <i>scriptorum judicia</i> have been appended
in No. 8. p. 120., by "I.H.M.". As a
sadly disparaging opinion had been quoted, at
p. 40., from Lord Dartmouth, I hope you will
allow the following remarks on the testimony of
that nobleman to appear in your columns:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
"No person has contradicted Burnet more frequently,
or with more asperity, than Dartmouth. Yet
Dartmouth wrote, 'I do not think he designedly published
anything he believed to be false.' At a later
period, Dartmouth, provoked by some remarks on
himself in the second volume of the Bishop's history,
retracted this praise; but to such a retraction little
importance can be attached. Even Swift has the justice
to say, 'After all he was a man of generosity and
good nature.'"&mdash;<i>Short Remarks on Bishop Burnet's
History</i>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It is usual to censure Burnet as a singularly inaccurate
historian; but I believe the charge to be
altogether unjust. He appears to be singularly
inaccurate only because his narrative has been subjected to
a scrutiny singularly severe and unfriendly. If any
Whig thought it worth while to subject Reresby's
<i>Memoirs</i>, North's <i>Examen</i>, Mulgrave's <i>Account of the
Revolution</i>, or the <i>Life of James the Second</i>, edited by
Clarke, to a similar scrutiny, it would soon appear that
Burnet was far indeed from being the most inexact
writer of his time."&mdash;Macaulay, <i>Hist. England</i>, vol. ii.
p.177, 3rd. Ed.</blockquote>

<h2>QUERIES</h2>
<h3>SAINT THOMAS OF LANCASTER.</h3>
<p>Sir,&mdash;I am desirous of information respecting
the religious veneration paid to the memory of
Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, cousin-german to King
Edward the Second. He was taken in open
rebellion against the King on the 16th of March,
1322, condemned by a court-martial, and
executed, with circumstances of great indignity, on
the rising ground above the castle of Pomfret,
which at the time was in his possession. His
body was probably given to the monks of the adjacent
priory; and soon after his death miracles
were said to be performed at his tomb, and at the
 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>{182}</span>place of execution; a curious record of which is
preserved in the library of Corpus Christi College,
at Cambridge, and introduced by Brady into his
history of the period. About the same time, a
picture or image of him seems to have been exhibited
in St. Paul's Church, in London, and to
have been the object of many offerings. A special
proclamation was issued, denouncing this
veneration of the memory of a traitor, and threatening
punishment on those who encouraged it; and
a statement is given by Brady of the opinions of
an ecclesiastic, who thought it very doubtful how
far this devotion should be encouraged by the
Church, the Earl of Lancaster, besides his political
offences, having been a notorious evil-liver.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as the King's party was subdued,
and the unhappy sovereign, whose acts and
habits had excited so much animosity, cruelly put
to death, we find not only the political character
of the Earl of Lancaster vindicated, his attainder
reversed, his estates restored to his family, and his
adherents re-established in all their rights and
liberties, but within five weeks of the accession of
Edward the Third, a special mission was sent to
the Pope from the King, imploring the appointment
of a commission to institute the proper
canonical investigation for his admission into the
family of saints. His character and his cause are
described, in florid language, as having been those
of a Christian hero; and the numberless miracles
wrought in his name, and the confluence of pilgrims
to his tomb, are presumed to justify his
invocation.</p>

<p>In June of the same year (1327), a "king's
letter" is given to Robert de Weryngton, authorising
him and his agents to collect alms throughout
the kingdom for the purpose of building a
chapel on the hill where the Earl was beheaded,
and praying all prelates and authorities to give
him aid and heed. This sanction gave rise to
imposture; and in December a proclamation appeared,
ordering the arrest and punishment of
unauthorised persons collecting money under this
pretence, and taking it for their own use.</p>

<p>In 1330, the same clerical personages were sent
again to the Pope, to advance the affair of the
canonization of the Earl, and were bearers of
letters on the same subject from the King to five
of the cardinals, all urging the attention of the
Papal court to a subject that so much interested
the Church and people of England.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that some powerful
opposition to this request was at work at the
Roman see. For in the April of the following
year another commission, composed of a professor
of theology, a military personage, and a magistrate
of the name of John de Newton, was sent with
letters to the Pope, to nine cardinals, to the
referendary of the Papal court, and to three nephews
of his Holiness, entreating them not to give
ear to the invectives of malignant men ("commenta
fictitia maliloquorum"), who here asserted
that the Earl of Lancaster consented to, or connived
at, some injury or insult offered to certain
cardinals at Durham in the late king's reign. So
far from this being true, the letters assert that
the earl defended these prelates to the utmost of
his power, protected them from enemies who had
designs on their lives, and placed them in security
at his own great peril. The main point of the
canonization is again urged, and allusion made to
former repeated supplications, and the sacred
promise, "Knock, and it shall be opened unto
you," appealed to. The vindication of the Earl
from the malicious charge against him is omitted
in the letters to two of the cardinals and the lay
personages. Were these the two cardinals who
fancied themselves injured?</p>

<p>This, then, is all I can discover in the ordinary
historical channels respecting this object of ancient
public reverence in England. The chapel
was constructed and officiated in till the dissolution
of the monasteries; the image in St. Paul's
was always regarded with special affection; and
the cognomen of <i>Saint</i> Thomas of Lancaster was
generally accepted and understood.</p>

<p>Five hundred years after the execution of the
Earl of Lancaster, a large stone coffin, massive
and roughly hewn, was found in a field that belonged
of old to the Priory of Pomfret, but at
least a quarter of a mile distant from the hill
where the chapel stood. Within was the skeleton
of a full-grown man, partially preserved; the skull
lay between the thighs. There is no record of
the decapitation of any person at Pomfret of
sufficient dignity to have been interred in a manner
showing so much care for the preservation of
the body, except the Earl of Lancaster. The
coffin may have been removed here at the time the
opposite party forbade its veneration, from motives
of precaution for its safety.</p>

<p>Now, I shall be much obliged for information
on the following points:&mdash;</p>

<p>Is any thing known, beyond what I have stated,
as to the communications with Rome on the subject
of his canonization, or as to the means by
which he was permitted by the English church to
become a fit object for invocation and veneration?</p>

<p>What are the chief historical grounds that endeared
his memory to the Church or the people?
The compassion for his signal fall can hardly
account for this, although a similar motive was
sufficient to bring to the tomb of Edward II., in
Gloucester Cathedral, an amount of offerings that
added considerably to the splendour of the
edifice.</p>

<p>Are any anecdotes or circumstances recorded,
respecting the worship of this saint in later times,
than I have referred to?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>{183}</span>
<p>What is the historic probability that the stone coffin,
discovered in 1822, contained the remains of
this remarkable man?</p>
<p>I have no doubt that much curious and valuable
matter might be discovered, by pursuing into the
remote receptacles of historical knowledge the
lives and characters of persons who have become,
in Catholic times, the unauthorised objects of
popular religious reverence after death.</p>

<h3>SHIELD OF THE BLACK PRINCE&mdash;SWORD OF
CHARLES I.</h3>

<p>In Bolton's <i>Elements of Armories</i>, 1610, p. 67.,
is an engraving of a very interesting shield, of the
kind called "Pavoise," which at that period hung
over the tomb of Edward the Black Prince, at
Canterbury, in addition to the shield still remaining
there. Bolton says, "The sayd victorious
Princes tombe is in the goodly Cathedral Church
erected to the honour of Christ, in Canterburie;
there (beside his quilted coat-armour, with half-sleeves,
Taberd fashion, and his triangular shield,
both of them painted with the royall armories of
our kings, and differenced with silver labels)
hangs this kind of Pavis or Target, curiously (for
those times) embost and painted, and the Scutcheon
in the bosse being worne out, and the Armes
(which, it seemes, were the same with his coate
armour, and not any particular devise) defaced, and
is altogether of the same kinde with that upon
which (Froissard reports) the dead body of the
Lord Robert of Dvras, and nephew to the Cardinall
of Pierregoort, was laid, and sent unto that
Cardinale, from the Battell of Poictiers, where the
Blacke Prince obtained a Victorie, the renowne
whereof is immortale."</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents inform me
when this most interesting relic disappeared?
Sandford, whose <i>Genealogical History</i> was published
some sixty or seventy years later, says, "On
an iron barr over the Tombe are placed the
Healme and Crest, Coat of Maile, and Gantlets,
and, on a pillar near thereunto, his shield of
Armes, richly diapred with gold, all which he is
said to have used in Battel;" but he neither
mentions the missing "Pavoise," engraved in Bolton,
or the scabbard of the sword which yet remains,
the sword itself having been taken away,
according to report, by Oliver Cromwell. Did
that unscrupulous Protector(?) take away the
"Pavoise" at the same time, or order his Ironsides
to "remove that bauble?"&mdash;and how came
he to spare the helmet, jupon, gauntlets, shield,
and <i>scabbard</i>? I have strong doubts of his being
the purloiner of the sword. The late Mr. Stothard,
who mentions the report, does not quote
his authority. I will add another query, on a
similar subject:&mdash;When did the <i>real</i> sword of
Charles the First's time, which, but a few years
back, hung at the side of that monarch's equestrian
figure at Charing Cross, disappear?&mdash;and
what has become of it? The question was put,
at my suggestion, to the official authorities, by the
secretary of the British Arch&aelig;ological Association;
but no information could be obtained on the subject.
That the sword <i>was</i> a real one of that
period, I state upon the authority of my lamented
friend, the late Sir Samuel Meyrick, who had
ascertained the fact, and pointed out to me its
loss.</p>

<h3>FRATERNITYE OF VAGABONDES&mdash;REV. MR.
GENESSE&mdash;RED MAIDS.</h3>

<p class="note">[We have for some time past been obliged, by want
of space, to omit all the kind expressions towards ourselves,
in which friendly correspondents are apt to indulge;
but there is something so unusual in the way
in which the following letter begins, that we have done
violence to our modesty, in order to admit the comments
of our kind-hearted correspondent. We have
no doubt that all his questions will be answered in due
course.]</p>

<p>Never, during my life (more than half a century),
do I remember hailing the appearance of
any new publication with such unfeigned delight.
I had hugged myself on having the friendship of
a certain "BOOKWORM," possessing a curious library,
of some three or four thousand volumes;
how much must I have rejoiced, therefore, at
finding that, through the medium of your invaluable
journal, my literary friends were likely to
be increased one hundred-fold; and that, for the
small sum of three pence weekly, I could command
the cordial co-operation, when at a loss, of all the
first scholars, antiquaries, and literary men of the
country; that without the trouble of attending
meetings, &amp;c., I could freely become a member of
the "Society of Societies;" that the four thousand
volumes, to which I had, previously, access,
were increased more than ten thousand-fold. It
is one of the peculiar advantages of literary accumulation,
that it is only by diffusing the knowledge
of the materials amassed, and the information
gained, that their value is felt. Unlike the miser,
the scholar and antiquary, by expending, add to
the value of their riches.</p>

<p>Permit me to avail myself of the "good the
bounteous gods have sent me," and make one or
two inquiries through the medium of your columns.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>{184}</span>In the first place, can any of your readers inform
me by whom a pamphlet, of the Elizabethan period,
noticed in the <i>Censura Literaria</i>, and entitled
<i>The Fraternitye of Vagabondes</i>, was reprinted,
some years since?&mdash;Was it by Machelle Stace, of
Scotland Yard, who died a brother of the Charter-House?</p>

<p>In the second place, can any of your clerical
readers tell me where I can find any account of
the late Rev. Mr. Genesse, of Bath, author of a
<i>History of the Stage</i>, in ten volumes, one of the
most elaborate and entertaining works ever published,
which must have been a labour of love, and
the labour of a life?</p>

<p>And, in the third and last place, I find, in the
<i>Bristol Gazette</i> of the early part of last month, the
following paragraph:&mdash;"THE RED MAIDS, 120
in number, enjoyed their annual dinner in honour
of the birthday of their great benefactor, Alderman
Whitson. The dinner consisted of joints of
<i>veal</i> (which they only have on this occasion), and
some dozens of plum puddings. The mayor and
Mayoress attended, and were much pleased to
witness the happy faces of the girls, to whom the
Mayoress distributed one shilling each."</p>

<p>Can any of your curious contributors give me
any account of these <i>Red Maids</i>?&mdash;why they
are so called, &amp;c., &amp;c.?&mdash;and, in fact, of the
charity in general?</p>

<p>It will not be one of the least of many benefits
of your publication, that, in noticing from
time to time the real intention of many ancient
charitable bequests, the purposes of the original
benevolent founder may be restored to their integrity,
and the charity devoted to the use of
those for whom it was intended, and who will
receive it as a charity, and not, as is too often the
case, be swallowed up as a mere place,&mdash;or worse,
a sinecure.</p>

<h3>THE NAME OF SHYLOCK.</h3>

<p>Dr. Farmer has stated that Shakspere took the
name which he has given to one of the leading
characters in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> from a pamphlet
entitled <i>Caleb Shilloche, or the Jew's
Prediction</i>. The date of the pamphlet, however, being
some years posterior to that of the play, renders
this origin impossible. Mr. C. Knight, who points
out this error, adds&mdash;"<i>Scialac</i> was the name of
a Marionite of Mount Libanus."</p>

<p>But "query," Was not <i>Shylock</i> a proper name
among the Jews, derived from the designation
employed by the patriarch Jacob in predicting
the advent of the Messiah&mdash;"until <i>Shiloh</i> come"?
(Gen. xlix. 10.) The objection, which might be
urged, that so sacred a name would not have been
applied by an ancient Jew to his child, has not
much weight, when we recollect that some Christians
have not shrunk from the blasphemous imposition
of the name <i>Emanuel</i> ("God with us")
upon their offspring. St. Jerome manifestly reads
SHILOACH, for he translates it by <i>Qui mittendus
est. (Lond. Encyc</i>. in voc. "Shiloh.") Now the
difference between <i>Shiloach</i> and <i>Shylock</i> is very
trivial indeed. I shall be very glad to have the
opinion of some of your numerous and able contributors
on this point.</p>

<p>But, after all, Shylock may have been a <i>family
name</i> familiar to the great dramatist. In all my
researches on the subject of <i>English surnames,</i>
however, I have but once met with it as a generic
distinction. In the <i>Battel Abbey Deeds</i> (penes
Sir T. Phillipps, Bart.) occurs a power of attorney
from John Pesemershe, Esq., to <i>Richard
Shylok</i>, of Hoo, co. Sussex, and others, to deliver
seizin of all his lands in Sussex to certain persons
therein named. The date of this document is
July 4, 1435.</p>

<h3>TRANSPOSITION OF LETTERS.</h3>

<p>I should be obliged if any of your readers would
give me the reason for the transposition of certain
letters, chiefly, but not exclusively, in proper
names, which has been effected in the course of
time.</p>

<p>The name of our Queen Bertha was, in the
seventh century, written Beorhte.</p>

<p>The Duke Brythnoth's name was frequently
written Byrthnoth, in the tenth century.</p>

<p>In Eardweard, we have dropped the <i>a</i>; in
Ealdredesgate, the <i>e</i>. In Aedwini, we have dropped
the first letter (or have sometimes transposed it),
although, I think, we are wrong; for the given
name Adwin has existed in my own family for
several centuries.</p>

<p>John was always written Jhon till about the
end of the sixteenth century; and in Chaucer's
time, the word <i>third</i>, as every body knows, was
written <i>thridde</i>, or <i>thrydde</i>. I believe that the <i>h</i>
in Jhon was introduced, as it was in other words
in German, to give force to the following vowel.
Certain letters were formerly used in old French
in like manner, which were dropped upon the
introduction of the accents.</p>

<h3>PICTURES OF QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CHARLES I. IN
CHURCHES.</h3>

<p>Your correspondent "R.O." will find two
pictures of Charles I. of the same allegorical character
as that described by him in his note (<i>ant&egrave;</i>,
p. 137.), one on the wall of the stairs leading to
the north gallery of the church of St. Botolph,
Bishopsgate, and the other in the hall of the
law courts in Guildhall Yard. I know nothing
of the history of the first-mentioned picture; the
latter, until within a few years, hung on the wall,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>{185}</span>above the gallery, in the church of St. Olave,
Jewry, when, upon the church undergoing repair,
it was taken down, and, by the parishioners,
presented to the corporation of London, who
placed it in its present position. In the church of
St. Olave there were two other pictures hung in
the gallery, one representing the tomb of Queen
Elizabeth, copied from the original at Westminster,
the other of Time on the Wing, inscribed with
various texts from Scripture. Both these pictures
were presented at the same time with the picture
of Charles I. to the corporation, and are now in
the hall in Guildhall Yard. The representation
of Queen Elizabeth's tomb is to be met with, I
believe, in some other of the London churches.
The picture in Bishopsgate Church is fully described
in the 1st vol. of Malcolm's <i>Londinium
Redivivum</i>, p. 243., and the St. Olave's pictures
are mentioned in the 4th vol. of the same work,
p. 563. Malcolm states he was not able to find
any account of the Bishopsgate painting in the
parish books. Hitherto I have not been able to
discover anything connected with the history of
the St. Olave's pictures, which, as the old church
was destroyed in the great fire of 1666, were
doubtless placed there subsequently to that year.
I shall be glad if any of your readers can throw
any light as to the time when, and the circumstances
under which, such pictures as I have
mentioned, referring to Queen Elizabeth and
Charles I., were placed in our churches.</p>

<h3>FLAYING IN PUNISHMENT OF SACRILEGE.</h3>

<p>In the <i>Journal of the Arch&aelig;ological Institute</i>, for
September, 1848, there are some most interesting
notes on the subject of "Flaying in Punishment
of Sacrilege," by Mr. Way. Since then I have
felt peculiar interest in the facts and traditions
recorded by Mr. Way. Can any of your correspondents,
or Mr. Way himself, give any further
references to authors by whom the subject is mentioned,
besides those named in the paper to which
I allude? A few weeks ago I received a piece of
skin, stated to be human, and taken from the door
of the parish church of Hadstock, in Essex.
Together with this I received a short written
paper, apparently written some fifty years ago,
which ascribes the fact of human skin being found
on the door of that church, to the punishment, <i>not</i>
of <i>sacrilege</i>, but of a somewhat different crime.
The piece of skin has been pronounced to be
human by the highest authority. As the above
query might lead to some lengthy "notes," I
desire only to be informed of the titles of any
works, ancient or modern, in which distinct mention,
or allusion, is made of the punishment of
flaying.</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

<p><i>Pokership or Parkership</i>.&mdash;In Collins' <i>Peerage</i>,
vol. iv. p. 242., 5th edition, 1779, we are told
that Sir Robert Harley, of Wigmore Castle, in
1604, was made Forester of Boringwood, alias
Bringwood Forest, in com. Hereford, <i>with the
office of the 'Pokership</i>,' and custody of the forest
or chase of Prestwood for life. The same word
occurs in the edition (the 3rd) of 1741, and in
that edited by Sir Egerton Brydges in 1812
(vol. iv. p. 57.).</p>

<p>If <i>Pokership</i> be not a misprint or misreading of
the original authority, viz. <i>Pat. 2. Jac. I.</i> p. 21.,
for <i>Parkership</i>, can any of your readers tell me
the meaning of "the <i>Pokership</i>," which is not to be
found in any book of reference within my reach?
I like the "NOTES AND QUERIES" very much.</p>

<p><i>Boduc or Boduoc on British Coins.</i>&mdash;I observe
there is a prevailing opinion that the inscription
on the British coin, "Boduc or Boduoc," must be
intended for the name of our magnanimous Queen
Boadicea. I am sorry to cast a cloud over so
pleasant a vision, but your little book of QUERIES
tempts me to throw in a doubt.</p>

<p>Although the name Budic is not met with in the
pedigrees of England, commonly given by Welsh
heralds, yet it is often found among the families
of the Welsh in Brittany, and as they are reported
to be early descendants of the Welsh of England,
there can be little doubt that the name was once
common in England. I beg leave, therefore, to
<i>query</i>, Whether the inscription is not intended for
a Regulus of Britain of that name?</p>

<p><i>The Origin of the word Snob.</i>&mdash;Can any of your
valuable correspondents give me the origin or
derivation of the word Snob?</p>

<p>When, and under what peculiar circumstances,
was it first introduced into our language?</p>

<p>In the town in which I reside, in the north of
England, the word Snob was formerly applied to
a <i>cobbler</i>, and the phrase was in use, "<i>Snip</i> the
<i>tailor</i>, and <i>Snob</i> the <i>cobbler</i>."</p>

<p>I cannot discover how and why the word Snob
was enlarged into its present comprehensive meaning.</p>

<p>Explanations of many of the slang phrases met
with in the dramatic works of the last century,
such as, "Thank you, sir, I owe you one," "A
Rowland for an Oliver," "Keep moving, dad,"
&amp;c. &amp;c. would perhaps give much light upon the
manners of the times, and an interesting history
might be compiled of the progress of slang phrases
to the present day.</p>

<p><i>Mertens, Martins, or Martini, the Printer.</i>&mdash;Can

really the surname of Theodoric Mertens, Martins,
or Martini, the printer of Louvain, and who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>{186}</span>was a friend of Erasmus? In a small volume of
his, now before me, printed in 1517, the colophon
gives: "Lovanii apud Theodoricum Martinum
anno MDXVII mense April;" while, on the reverse
of <i>the same leaf</i>, is a wooden block, of his device,
occupying the whole page, and beneath it are
inscribed the words "Theodoricus Martini." This
appears to put <i>Mertens</i> out of the question.</p>

that I have read of their origin is a brief notice in
Knight's <i>London</i>, No. 131. p. 91; but doubtless
there exists, did I know what works to consult,
many more voluminous a history of their origin
and proceedings than the short summary given in
the work of Mr. Knight. In whose reign were
they first created? and by whom were they appointed?

<p><i>The Reconciliation</i>, 1554.&mdash;In 1554, Cardinal
Pole directed a register to be kept in every parish
of all the parishioners who, on a certain day, were
to be reconciled to the Church of Rome and absolved.
(Burnet's <i>Ref</i>. vol. iii. p. 245.)</p>

<p>The Bishop of London's Declaration thereon
(Feb. 19. 1554) runs thus:&mdash;</p>

 <blockquote>"And they not so reconciled, every one of them
  shall have process made agaynst him accordyng to
  the canons, as the case shall requyre; for which purpose
  the pastours and curates of every paryshe shall be
  commanded by their archedeacon to certyfye me in
  writinge of every man and woman's name that is not
  so reconciled."</blockquote>

<p>Have any of your readers at any time seen and
made a <i>note</i> of such a register?</p>

<p>The most probable place of deposit would be
the Bishop's Registry, but I have never yet been
fortunate enough to meet with one of these
curious returns. </p>

<h2>MISCELLANIES.</h2>

<p><i>Darkness at the Crucifixion</i>.&mdash;The following
passage, in a volume of Lectures by the Rev. H.
Blunt, has fallen under my notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"It was this Dionysius (the Areopagite) of whom
the earliest Christian historians relate that, being at
Heliopolis, in Egypt, at the time of our Lord's crucifixion,
when he beheld the mid-day darkness which
attended that awful event, he exclaimed, 'Either the
God of Nature suffers, or the frame of the world will
be dissolved.'"</blockquote>

<p>Having very limited opportunity of studying the
ancient historians, I should be greatly obliged if
you would inform me from what work this account
is derived; or refer me to any authors, <i>not</i>
having embraced Christianity, who give a description
of the crucifixion of our Saviour; and especially
with reference to the "darkness over all the
earth" at the time of that event, mentioned by
St. Luke, who also adds, that "the sun was darkened."
Your kindly consenting, as you did in

<p><i>Wife of Robert de Bruce</i>.&mdash;In the Surrenden

<p>It is, as its title imports, the release to the
keeper of the wardrobe, for one year's accounts,
aa&ordm;. 7 E. 2.</p>

<p>I shall probably be able to send you therefrom
a few "notes" illustrative of the history of that
time.</p>

<p>As a commencement, I think that the subjoined
"note" will interest your historical readers.</p>

<p>It appears that the unfortunate wife of Robert
Bruce was then consigned to the care of the
Abbess of Barking, with an allowance of 20<i>s</i>. per
week for the same. She was, I believe, the daughter
of Henry de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, and died
in 1328. In the above roll there is the following
entry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
 "Cs liberati Anne de Veer Abbatisse de Berkyng,
  per manus domini Roberti de Wakfeld clerici, super
  expensis domine Elizabethe uxoris Roberti de Brus,
  percipientis per ebdomadum xxs., et ibidem perhendinantis."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 "Cs liberati Johanni de Stystede valletto Abbatisse
  de Berkyng, per manus proprias, super expensis
  Domine de Brus in Abbathia de Berkyng perhendinantis."
</blockquote>

<p>It does not appear, in the above roll, how long
the hapless queen remained in the abbey.</p>

<p><i>The Talisman of Charlemagne</i>.&mdash;I beg to refer
your correspondent, on the subject of Charlemagne's
Talisman, to what professes to be a correct
representation of this antique relic, in <i>The
Illustrated London News</i>, of March 8th, 1845; but
it is not there described as "a small nut, in a gold
filigree envelopment," and gives the idea of an
ornament much too large for the finger or even
wrist of any lady: that paper says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"This curious object of virtu is described in the
Parisian journals as, 'la plus belle relique de
l'Europe;' and it has, certainly, excited considerable
interest in the arch&aelig;ological and religious circles of
the continent. The talisman is of fine gold, of round
form, as our illustration shows, set with gems, and in
the centre are two rough sapphires, and a portion of
the Holy Cross; besides other relics brought from the
Holy Land."</blockquote>

<p>The rest of the description much resembles your

that time the property of Prince Louis Napoleon,
then a prisoner in the ch&acirc;teau of Ham.</p>

<p class="author">MELANION.</p>

<p class="note">[Our correspondent will find much curious illustration
of this now obsolete custom in Strutt's <i>Sports

passage from the <i>Spectator</i> is quoted; and we are told
"these decorations of silver cups, tankards, &amp;c. were
borrowed for the purpose, and hung round the milk
pails (with the addition of flowers and ribands), which
the maidens <i>carried upon their heads</i> when they went
to the houses of their customers, and danced in order
to obtain a small gratuity from each of them." In

heard of the anxiety of Queen Mary I., for the

but many may not be aware that among the Royal
Letters in the State Paper Office, are letters in
French, prepared in expectation of the event,
addressed by Queen Mary, without date, except
"Hampton Court, 1555" (probably about May),
to her father-in-law, the Emperor Charles V., to
Henry II., King of France, to Eleonora, Queen
Dowager of France, to Ferdinand I., King of Bohemia,
to Mary, the Queen Dowager of Bohemia,
to the Doge of Venice, to the King of Hungary, and
to the Queen Dowager of Hungary, announcing to
each the birth of her child, the word being so
written <i>fil</i>, as to admit of being made <i>filz</i>, or of
an easy alteration to the feminine <i>fille</i>, if necessary.</p>

<p><i>Ken's Morning and Evening Hymns</i>.&mdash;I saw it
mentioned in a review in the <i>Guardian</i> some few
weeks ago, as one merit of the last edition of the
Book of Common Prayer, published by Eyre and
Spottiswoode, that it had restored Bishop Ken's
Morning and Evening Hymns to their original
purity.</p>

<p>I have no means of accurately testing this assertion
by reference to any undoubted version of the
date of the original publication, but I have no
doubt that this might easily be done through the
medium of your paper; and I think you will agree
with me that, if it should be substantiated, not
only is credit due to the Queen's printers, but also
that it is an example which ought to be followed,
without exception, in all future editions of the
Prayer Book.</p>

<p>The variations, which I have noted in the ordinary
version of the Hymns, as given in other
Prayer Books, are too numberous to be inserted
here, not to mention the omission of several
stanzas, three in the Morning Hymn, together
with the Doxology, and one in the Evening
Hymn.</p>

<p>If they be false readings, no doubt they have
been allowed to creep in inadvertently, and need
only pointing out to be corrected. It occurred
to me that this might be done more effectually in
your columns, and I venture to hope that you will
not consider it a task unworthy the high aim
which you have in view in your admirable publication.</p>

<br />
<p class="note">[Bishop Ken's Morning and Evening Hymns have
been restored in Messrs. Eyre and Spottiswoode's last
rubricated edition of the Common Prayer, as far as
was practicable; they were carefully collated with the
original, and all variations corrected, except those
which would materially affect immemorial use. The
entire hymns are of great length, but all those verses
which have been at all generally sung in churches are
to be found in the edition to which we refer.</p>

<p class="note">We may take this opportunity of noticing that the
Queen's printers have lately restored the lesser Saints'
Days to the kalendar in their smaller editions of the

<p><i>Etymology of "Daysman</i>."&mdash;What is the etymology

<p class="note">[NARES defines <i>Daysman</i>, an umpire or arbitrator,

person chosen to determine an affair in dispute, who is
called a <i>Dies-man</i> or <i>Days-man</i>." Jacob's definition
may be again illustrated from NARES:&mdash;"In Switzerland
(as we are informed by Simlerus) they had some
common arbitrators, or <i>dayesmen</i>, in every towne, that
made a friendly composition betwixt man and man."&mdash;Burton, <i>Anat</i>.]</p>

<br />
<p><i>Roland Monoux</i>.&mdash;In answer to your correspondent
"M", p. 137., the monumental brass in
his possession is, no doubt, from the church at
<i>Edmonton</i>, Middlesex. Lysons (<i>Environs of London</i>,
vol. ii. p. 263.), in his description of Edmonton
Church, says, "Near the door is a brass plate,
with some English verses to the memory of ROLAND
MONOUX (no date)." He subjoins, in a <i>note</i>,
"arms&mdash;on a chevron betw. 3 oak-leaves as many
bezants, on a chief 2 anchors, a market for difference.
On the brass plate are some English verses,
nowise remarkable."</p>

<p>These arms (omitting the <i>chief</i>) are those borne
by the Baronet Monnoux of Sandy in Bedfordshire
(extinct in 1814), who was descended from
Sir George Monox, of Walthamstow, Lord Mayor
of London, who died in 1543, to whom and his
lady there are brasses in Walthamstow Church.
ROLAND of Edmonton was doubtless of the same
family. I am not able to give an opinion of the <i>date</i>
of the brass in question; but it might be readily
conjected from the style of its execution.</p>

<p>Your readers will, I am sure, all unite with me
in commendation of your correspondent "M's"
correct feeling in offering to restore this monument
to its original site. I hope "M's" example
will find many followers. There are hundreds of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>{189}</span>
these pillaged brasses in the hands of "collectors," and your
admirable publication will have effected
a great public good, if it shall have been instrumental
in promoting their restoration.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Motto</i>.&mdash;In reference to a query (No. 6.
p. 93.), and a reply (No. 7. p. 104.), permit me to
remark, that St. Augustine, the celebrated Bishop
of Hippo, was the person who caused to be engraved
on his table the distich against detractors.
Possidius, in his Life of that Father (S. Augustini,
<i>Opera Omnia</i>, Paris, 1690, vol. x. part ii. p. 272.),
gives the verses&mdash;no doubt an adaptation of
Horace&mdash;thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p> "Quisquis amat dictis absentum rodere vitam</p>
   <p> Hanc mensam indignam noverit esse sibi."</p>
</div>
<p>The Benedictine editors subjoin two readings
of the pentameter:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
 <p> "Hac mensa indignam noverit esse suam."</p>
  <p>"Hanc mensam vetitam noverit esse sibi."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cresswell and Miss Warneford</i>.&mdash;At p. 157.
of the "NOTES AND QUERIES," your correspondent
"B." inquires about a pamphlet relating to the
marriage, many years ago, of Mr. Cresswell
and Miss Warneford. "P.C.S.S." cannot give the
precise title of that pamphlet in question; but he
is enabled to state, on the authority of Watts
(<i>Biblioth. Brit.</i>), and on that of his old friend
Sylvanus Urban (<i>Gent. Mag.</i> vol. xvii. p. 543.),
that it was published in London, towards the end
of the year 1747, and that the very remarkable
and very disgraceful transactions to which it refers
were afterwards (in 1749) made the subject of a
novel, called <i>Dalinda</i>, or <i>The Double Marriage</i>.
Lond. 12mo. Price threepence.</p>

<p>The gentleman who was the hero of this scandalous
affair was Mr. Thomas Estcourt Cresswell,
of Pinkney Park, Wilts, M.P. for Wootton Bassett.
He married Anne, the sole and very wealthy
heiress of Edward Warneford, Esq. As it cannot
be the object of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" to
revive a tale of antiquated scandal, "P.C.S.S."
will not place upon its pages the details of this
painful affair&mdash;the cruel injury inflicted upon
Miss Scrope (the lady to whom Mr. Cresswell
was said to have been secretly married before his
union with Miss Warneford)&mdash;and the base and
unmanly contrivance by which, it was stated, that
he endeavoured to keep possession of both wives
at the same time. Miss Scrope appears to have
retained, for a considerable time, a deep sense of
her injuries; for in 1749 she published a pamphlet,
in her own name, called <i>Miss Scrope's Answer to
Mr. Cresswell's Narrative</i>. (Lond. Baldwin. Price
2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.)</p>

<p>If "B." should be desirous of further information,
he is referred, by "P.C.S.S.," to the <i>General
Evening Post</i> of Oct. 3. and 31. 1747, to the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> for that month and year, and to
the same work, vol. xix. pp. 192. 288.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

<p>Little as public attention has of late years been
devoted to commentating upon Pope, his writings
and literary history, there are no doubt many able
and zealous illustrators of them among lovers of
literature for its own sake: and many a curious
note upon the Bard of Twickenham and his works
will probably be evoked by the announcement,
that now is the moment when they may be produced
with most advantage, when Mr. Murray is
about to bring forth a new edition of Pope, under
the able and experienced editorship of Mr. Croker.
Besides numerous original inedited letters, Mr.
Croker's edition will have the advantage of some
curious books bought at the Brockley Hall sale,
including four volumes of Libels upon Pope, and a
copy of Ruffhead's Life of him, with Warburton's
manuscript notes.</p>

<p>No one has rendered better service to the study
of Gothic architecture in this country than Mr.
J.H. Parker, of Oxford. The value of his admirable
<i>Glossary of Terms used in Architecture</i>, is
attested by the fact, that it has already reached a
fourth edition, and that another will soon be called
for. But we doubt whether he has done any
thing better calculated to promote this interesting
branch of Arch&aelig;ology than by the production of
his <i>Introduction to the Study of Gothic Architecture</i>,
which&mdash;originally written as part of a series of
elementary lectures recommended by the Committee
of the Oxford Architectural Society to be
delivered to the junior members, and considered
useful and interesting by those who heard them&mdash;
is now published at the request of the Society. A
more interesting volume on the subject, or one
better calculated to give such a knowledge of it, as
is essential to any thing like a just appreciation of
the peculiar characteristics of our church
architecture, could scarcely have been produced, while
its compact size and numerous illustrations fit it
to become a tourist's travelling companion.</p>

<p>We have great pleasure in directing attention
to the advertisement inserted in another column
respecting some improvements about to be introduced
into the GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE. This
venerable periodical has maintained its station
uninterruptedly in our literature from the year 1731.
From the times of Johnson and Cowper it has been
the medium by which many men of the greatest
eminence have communicated with the public. At
all times it has been the sole depository of much
valuable information of a great variety of kinds.
We are confident that under the new management
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>{190}</span>
it will put forth fresh claims to the favour of the public.
Many writers of high reputation in historical
and antiquarian literature are henceforth
to be enlisted in its service. We shall look for the
forthcoming number with great interest.</p>

<p>Scheible, of Stuttgart, who is doubtless known
to our readers as the publisher of some very
curious works illustrative of the popular literature
of Germany of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
has just commenced a new Library of
Magic, &amp;c., or <i>Bibliothek der Zanber-Geheimnisse-und
Offenbarungs-Bucher</i>. The first volume of it
is devoted to a work ascribed to that prince of
magicians, our old familiar, Dr. Faustus, and bears
the imposing title <i>Doktor Johannes Faust's Magia
Naturalis et Innaturalis, oder Dreifacher H&ouml;llenzwang,
leiztes Testament und Siegelkunst</i>. It is taken
from a MS. of the last century, filled with magical
drawings and devices enough to summon back
again from the Red Sea all the spirits that ever
were laid in it. It is certainly a curious book to
publish in the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell the extensive
and valuable Collection of MSS. in all languages
formed by the late Mr. Rodd, on Monday the 4th
of February, and five following days. The catalogue
deserves the attention of all collectors of
manuscripts, as it is, as far as circumstances will
admit, a classified one. There are upwards of one
thousand lots in the sale&mdash;many of a very curious
and interesting character. There are Greek and
Latin versions of the Scriptures, manuscripts of
the 13th century, Ruding's original collections for
his <i>History of the Coinage of Great Britain</i>; which
work, it is stated, contains only a very small portion
of the materials he had brought together.
One lot consists of a mass of documents and papers
contained in eight large packing cases, and weighing
from ten to fifteen hundred weight, of the
families of Eyre, of Derbyshire and Berkshire, and
their intermarriages from the reign of Henry II.
to the present time. Well may Mr. Sotheby talk
of their proving a source of amusement to any
person having room to sort them, and time to devote
to their arrangement.</p>

<p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson, of Piccadilly,
commence their sales on Monday next, with a four
days' miscellaneous sale of works on theology,
history, classics, voyages and travels, and standard
works in foreign and English general literature.
They have some important sales coming on, of
which our readers shall have due notice.</p>

<p>We have received the following new Catalogues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Catalogue of valuable second-hand Books in Divinity,
the Classics, Law, and Miscellaneous, on sale
by William Heath, 29 1/2. Lincoln's Inn Fields."</p>

<p>"Catalogue of curious and rare Books, all recently

High Holborn."</p>

<p>"Catalogue of Choice, Useful and Interesting
Books, in fine condition, on sale at the low Prices
affixed, by W. Waller and Son, 188. Fleet Street."</p>

<p>Messrs. Waller have also forwarded to us a
Catalogue recently published by them, which contains
some curious "Manuscripts, Historical
Documents, and Autograph Letters."</p>

<h3>THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE AND HISTORICAL REVIEW.</h3>

<hr />
<p>The next number of the "Gentleman's Magazine" (which
will be published on the 1st of February, 1850), will exhibit several
alterations in the character and arrangement of its contents,
which have been determined upon after due consideration of the
present state of our literature.</p>

<p>Time was when the whole field of English Literature was before
us, and we were its only reapers. At that time the harvest was
scarcely rich enough to supply materials for our monthly
comment. One hundred and twenty years have produced a marvelous
revolution. Our literature has grown and expanded, and
been divided and subdivided, and has still gone on growing and
increasing, until&mdash;such is its wonderful extent and fertility&mdash;every
separate branch maintains its independent organ, and we
ourselves, overpowered by a growth which we were the first to
foster, have gradually been compelled, by our limited space, to
allow one subject after another to drop from under our notice.</p>

<p>Still, amidst many minor alterations, we have kept an
unweakened hold upon certain main subjects. HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY,
and ARCH&AElig;OLOGY have never been neglected, and our OBITUARY
has grown into a record which, even we ourselves may say, has
become a permanent and important portion of the literature of
our country.</p>

<p>The changes we are now about to introduce have for their
design a more strict adherence to what we look upon as our peculiar
path. We shall henceforth devote ourselves more particularly&mdash;we
may say almost exclusively&mdash;to the great subjects we have
mentioned. Space that has been given to other matters will be
curtailed, variations in type and arrangement will afford additional
room, and all that can in any way be gained will be devoted to
our main and peculiar purpose.</p>

<p>We have made arrangements to secure for our pages, by a
liberal outlay, contributions from gentlemen most competent to
write upon their respective subjects of study, and shall strive,
more than ever, to be a worthy organ and representative of that
most valuable and peculiarly interesting branch of literature
which has for its object the instruction of mankind by the study
and the perpetuation of whatever is now doing, or whatever has
been done in times past, which is worthy of being kept in
remembrance. We shall endeavour to put forth a miscellany which will
be attractive from its variety, and from the skill with which its
several subjects are treated, and will be permanently valuable
from the importance of the matters to which it relates.</p>

<p>In principles and general tone of management we have nothing
to retract, nothing to alter. History is Truth, or it is a mere
delusion. The discovery and the establishment of Historical Truth,
in all its branches, are our objects, and we shall continue to
pursue them, as we have done in times past, faithfully and honestly,
but, as we purpose and intend, more diligently and more undividedly.</p>

<p>Contributions should be addressed, post paid, To the Editor of
the "Gentleman's Magazine" to the care of Messrs. Nichols and
Son, 25. Parliament Street, Westminster.</p>

<p>The "Gentleman's Magazine" is published by Messrs. J.B.
Nichols and Son, 25. Parliament Street, Westminster, on the
first day of every month, price 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and may be obtained of all
booksellers.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
https://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg

     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
