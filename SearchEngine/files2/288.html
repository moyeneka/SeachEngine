<h2>Coming to the King.</h2>



<p>I came from very far to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Salem, for I had been told<br />
Of glory and of wisdom manyfold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And condescension infinite and free.<br />
Now could I rest, when I had heard his fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that dark lonely land of death, from whence I came?</p>

<p>I came (but not like Sheba's queen), alone!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No stately train, no costly gifts to bring;<br />
No friend at court, save One the King!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had requests to spread before His throne,<br />
And I had questions none could solve for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of import deep, and full of mystery.</p>

<p><img src="illus/illus02.png" alt="illustration" /></p>

<p>I came and communed with that mighty King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told Him all my heart, I cannot say<br />
In mortal ear what communings were they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But wouldst thou know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too, and meekly bring<br />
All that is in thine heart and thou shalt hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice of love and power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His answers sweet and clear</p>

<p>O happy end of every weary guest!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told me all I needed graciously:--<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough for guidance, and for victory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er doubts and fears enough for quiet rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when some veiled response<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not hid from Him, this was enough indeed</p>

<p><img src="illus/illus03.png" alt="illustration" /></p>

<p><img src="illus/illus04.png" alt="illustration" /></p>

<p>His wisdom and His glories passed before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My wondering eyes in gradual revelation<br />
The house that He had built its strong foundation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its living stones and, brightening more and more<br />
For glimpses of that palace far away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all his loyal ones<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall dwell with Him for aye.</p>

<p><img src="illus/illus05.png" alt="illustration" /></p>

<p>True the report that reached my far-off land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all His wisdom and transcendent fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I believed not until I came<br />
Bowed to the dust till raised by royal hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half was never told by mortal word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My King exceeded all the fame that I had heard</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh happy are His servants! happy they<br />
Who stand continually before His face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to do His will of wisest grace!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My King! is mine such blessedness to-day?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I too hear Thy wisdom line by line,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy ever brightening words in holy radiance shine</p>

<p><img src="illus/illus06.png" alt="illustration" /></p>

<p><img src="illus/illus07.png" alt="illustration" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, blessed be the Lord they God who sat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our King upon His throne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Beloved crowning Thee with might<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour and majesty supreme and yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange and Godlike secret opening thus--<br />
The Kingship of His Christ ordained through love to us!</p>

<p><img src="illus/illus08.png" alt="illustration" /></p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall I render to my glorious King?<br />
I have but that which I receive from Thee<br />
And what I give, Thou givest back to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmuted by Thy touch, each worthless thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to the preciousness of gem or gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by thy blessing multiplied a thousand fold</p>

<p><img src="illus/illus09.png" alt="illustration" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;All my desire Thou grantest whatsoer I ask!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ever mythic tale or dream so bold as this reality,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This stream of boundless blessings flowing full and free?<br />
Yet more than I have thought or asked of Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Thy royal bounty still Thou givest me.</p>

<p>Now--I will turn to my own land and tell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;What I myself have seen and heard of Thee,<br />
And give Thine own sweet message, "Come and see"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet in heart and mind for ever dwell<br />
With Thee, my King of Peace, in loyal rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the fair pavilion of Thy presence blest.</p>


<p>J R HAVERGAL</p>




<h2>Our King</h2>



<p>O Saviour, precious Saviour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom yet unseen we love,<br />
O Name of might and favour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other names above!<br />
We worship Thee, we bless Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Thee alone we sing<br />
We praise Thee, and confess Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our holy Lord and King</p>

<p>In Thee all fulness dwelleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All grace and power divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory that excelleth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Son of God, is Thine!<br />
We worship Thee, we bless Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Thee alone we sing,<br />
We praise Thee and confess Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our glorious Lord and King</p>




<p><img src="illus/illus10.png" alt="illustration" /></p>



<h2>Led in Peace.</h2>



<p>"<i>Ye shall go out with joy and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be led forth with peace.</i>"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is. IV. 12.</p>

<p>
With joy thou shalt be girded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With peace thou shalt be led;<br />
And everlasting glory shall rest upon thy head;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills break forth in singing;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shadows flee away:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is thy King and Saviour--<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not say thee "Nay!"</p>




<p><img src="illus/illus11.png" alt="illustration" /></p>




<h2>His Presence</h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Saviour if Thy presence here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can such bright joy impart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What must it be in that sweet home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Thou its glory art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here through faith's vision small and fine<br />
One glimpse of Thy dear face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindles a glow in lonely hearts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;No cloud can e'er efface.</p>

<p>Cecilia Havergal</p>



<p><img src="illus/illus12.png" alt="illustration" /></p>



<h2>Springs of Peace</h2>



<p>Springs of peace, when conflict heightens<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine uplifted eye shall see,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace that strengthens calms, and brightens,<br />
Peace itself a victory. </p>

<p>Springs of comfort strangely springing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the bitter wells of woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Founts of hidden gladness, bringing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy that earth can ne'er bestow </p>




<p><img src="illus/illus13.png" alt="illustration" /></p>



<h2>The Welcome to the King</h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst the darkness, storm, and sorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One bright gleam I see,<br />
Well I know the blessed morrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ will come for me</p>

<p>Midst the light and peace and glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Fathers home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ for me is watching, waiting--<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting till I come</p>

<p>Long the blessed Guide has led me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the desert road;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I see the golden towers--<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City of my God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There amidst the love and glory,<br />
He is waiting yet;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On His hands a name is graven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He can ne'er forget.</p>

<p>There amidst the songs of heaven--<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter to His ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the footfall through the desert,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever drawing near.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, made ready are the mansions,<br />
Glorious, bright and fair;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bride the Father gave Him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still is wanting there.</p>

<p>Who is this who comes to meet me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the desert way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Morning Star foretelling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's unclouded day?</p>

<p>He it is who came to win me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cross of shame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In His glory well I know Him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evermore the same</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! the blessed joy of meeting,<br />
All the desert past!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! the wondrous words of greeting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall speak at last! </p>

<p>He and I together entering<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those bright courts above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He and I together sharing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Fathers love. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where no shade nor stain can enter<br />
Nor the gold be dim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that holiness unsullied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall walk with Him</p>

<p>Meet companion then for Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Him, for Him made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory of Gods grace for ever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in me displayed </p>

<p><img src="illus/illus14.png" alt="illustration" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who in His hour of sorrow<br />
Bore the curse alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I who through the lonely desert<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trod where He had gone</p>

<p>He and I in that bright glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One deep joy shall share<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine to be for ever with Him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His that I am there</p>




<h2>The King of Love.</h2>



<p>The King of Love my Shepherd is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose goodness faileth never,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nothing lack if I am His<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And He is mine for ever.</p>

<p>Where streams of living waters flow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ransomed soul He leadeth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where the verdant pastures grow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With food celestial feedeth</p>



<p><img src="illus/illus15.png" alt="illustration" /></p>



<p><img src="illus/illus16.png" alt="illustration" /></p>




<h2>God is Love and God is Light</h2>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;God is Love, His mercy brightens<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the path in which we rove,<br />
Bliss He forms, and woe He lightens,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is Light and God is Love</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chance and change are busy ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worlds decay and ages move,<br />
But His mercy waneth never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is Light and God is Love.</p>




<h2>Thine eyes shall see the King</h2>



<p>Thine eyes shall see! Yes, thine, who, blind erewhile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now trembling towards the new-found light dost flee,<br />
Leave doubting, and look up with trustful smile.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine eyes shall see!</p>

<p>Thine eyes shall see the King! The very same<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose love shone forth upon the curseful tree,<br />
Who bore thy guilt, who calleth thee by name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine eyes shall see!</p>

<p>Thine eyes shall see the King, the Mighty One,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many crowned, the light-enrobed, and He<br />
Shall bid thee share the kingdom He hath won<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine eyes shall see!</p>


<p><img src="illus/illus17.png" alt="illustration" /></p>


<p><img src="illus/illus18.png" alt="illustration" /></p>




<h2>I am Thine.                   </h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus Master!<br />
I am Thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep me faithful keep me near,<br />
Let Thy presence in me shine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my homeward way to cheer,<br />
Jesus! at Thy feet I fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, be Thou my all in all</p>


<p><img src="illus/illus19.png" alt="illustration" /></p>




<h2>Is it for Me?</h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it for me, dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saviour Thy Glory and Thy rest?<br />
For me, so weak and sinful oh, shall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thus be blessed?<br />
Is it for me to see Thee in all Thy glorious grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gaze in endless rapture on Thy beloved face?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold Thee in Thy beauty, behold Thee face to face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold Thee in Thy glory and reap Thy smile of grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be with Thee for ever, and never grieve Thee more!<br />
Dear Saviour I must praise Thee and lovingly adore.</p>




<p><img src="illus/illus20.png" alt="illustration" /></p>



<h2>Going to Christ</h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I go to Christ my Saviour<br />
With every little need<br />
The help He always gives me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wonderful indeed</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I go when I am mourning<br />
The loss of loved ones near<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaketh words of comfort sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He doth my spirit cheer</p>

<p>I go when I am fearing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruse of oil will fail<br />
He sendeth me the needful means<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus doth prayer prevent</p>


<p>Cecilia Havergal</p>


<p><img src="illus/illus21.png" alt="illustration" /></p>




<h2>My King and Master.</h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ my King, my Master, let my whole life be,<br />
Spent in blessed service only until Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me serve Thee gladly, That the world may know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a happy privilege, Thee to serve below.</p>

<p>Let me serve Thee humbly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine be all the praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis Thy love alone which tunes my feeble lays;<br />
Let me serve Thee quickly--Time will soon be o'er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would fain lead many to heaven's peaceful shore.</p>

<p>Let me serve Thee ever,  from morning until eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My earliest and my latest breath, my King, Thou shall receive.<br />
And oh when service here is spent, and Heaven is won<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant that I too, dear Master, may hear Thy sweet "Well done!"</p>

<p>Cevilia Havergal</p>




<h2>Under His Shadow</h2>



<p>"Under His shadow," with Christ alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, love He whispers in tenderest tone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasures unfolding, riches of grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus for life's battle my soul doth He brace.</p>

<p>"Under His shadow," a near page of life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens before me, apart from the strife<br />
Oh! will Thou show me Master and King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I may glory unto Thee bring!</p>

<p>"Under His shadow" may life be passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily and hourly on till the last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then no more shadows, all shall have fled<br />
When we awake like Jesus our Head.</p>

<p>M A Spiller</p>



<p><img src="illus/illus22.png" alt="illustration" /></p>



<p>I sat down under His shadow with great delight.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
