<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And shippes by the brinke comen and gon,<br
/>
And in swich forme endure a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>The Frankeleyn&rsquo;s
Tale</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Landfall</span> and Departure mark the
rhythmical swing of a seaman&rsquo;s life and of a ship&rsquo;s
career.&nbsp; From land to land is the most concise definition of
a ship&rsquo;s earthly fate.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Departure&rdquo; is not what a vain people of
landsmen may think.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;Landfall&rdquo; is more
easily understood; you fall in with the land, and it is a matter
of a quick eye and of a clear atmosphere.&nbsp; The Departure is
not the ship&rsquo;s going away from her port any more than the
Landfall can be looked upon as the synonym of arrival.&nbsp; But
there is this difference in the Departure: that the term does not
imply so much a sea event as a definite act entailing a
process&mdash;the precise observation of certain landmarks by
means of the compass card.</p>
<p>Your Landfall, be it a peculiarly-shaped mountain, a rocky
headland, or a stretch of sand-dunes, you meet at first with a
single glance.&nbsp; Further recognition will follow in due
course; but essentially a Landfall, good or bad, is made and done
with at the first cry of &ldquo;Land ho!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Departure is distinctly a ceremony of navigation.&nbsp; A ship
may have left her port some time before; she may have been at
sea, in the fullest sense of the phrase, for days; but, for all
that, as long as the coast she was about to leave remained in
sight, a southern-going ship of yesterday had not in the
sailor&rsquo;s sense begun the enterprise of a passage.</p>
<p>The taking of Departure, if not the last sight of the land,
is, perhaps, the last professional recognition of the land on the
part of a sailor.&nbsp; It is the technical, as distinguished
from the sentimental, &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henceforth he
has done with the coast astern of his ship.&nbsp; It is a matter
personal to the man.&nbsp; It is not the ship that takes her
departure; the seaman takes his Departure by means of
cross-bearings which fix the place of the first tiny pencil-cross
on the white expanse of the track-chart, where the ship&rsquo;s
position at noon shall be marked by just such another tiny pencil
cross for every day of her passage.&nbsp; And there may be sixty,
eighty, any number of these crosses on the ship&rsquo;s track
from land to land.&nbsp; The greatest number in my experience was
a hundred and thirty of such crosses from the pilot station at
the Sand Heads in the Bay of Bengal to the Scilly&rsquo;s
light.&nbsp; A bad passage. . .</p>
<p>A Departure, the last professional sight of land, is always
good, or at least good enough.&nbsp; For, even if the weather be
thick, it does not matter much to a ship having all the open sea
before her bows.&nbsp; A Landfall may be good or bad.&nbsp; You
encompass the earth with one particular spot of it in your
eye.&nbsp; In all the devious tracings the course of a
sailing-ship leaves upon the white paper of a chart she is always
aiming for that one little spot&mdash;maybe a small island in the
ocean, a single headland upon the long coast of a continent, a
lighthouse on a bluff, or simply the peaked form of a mountain
like an ant-heap afloat upon the waters.&nbsp; But if you have
sighted it on the expected bearing, then that Landfall is
good.&nbsp; Fogs, snowstorms, gales thick with clouds and
rain&mdash;those are the enemies of good Landfalls.</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>Some commanders of ships take their Departure from the home
coast sadly, in a spirit of grief and discontent.&nbsp; They have
a wife, children perhaps, some affection at any rate, or perhaps
only some pet vice, that must be left behind for a year or
more.&nbsp; I remember only one man who walked his deck with a
springy step, and gave the first course of the passage in an
elated voice.&nbsp; But he, as I learned afterwards, was leaving
nothing behind him, except a welter of debts and threats of legal
proceedings.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have known many captains who, directly
their ship had left the narrow waters of the Channel, would
disappear from the sight of their ship&rsquo;s company altogether
for some three days or more.&nbsp; They would take a long dive,
as it were, into their state-room, only to emerge a few days
afterwards with a more or less serene brow.&nbsp; Those were the
men easy to get on with.&nbsp; Besides, such a complete
retirement seemed to imply a satisfactory amount of trust in
their officers, and to be trusted displeases no seaman worthy of
the name.</p>
<p>On my first voyage as chief mate with good Captain MacW&mdash;
I remember that I felt quite flattered, and went blithely about
my duties, myself a commander for all practical purposes.&nbsp;
Still, whatever the greatness of my illusion, the fact remained
that the real commander was there, backing up my self-confidence,
though invisible to my eyes behind a maple-wood veneered
cabin-door with a white china handle.</p>
<p>That is the time, after your Departure is taken, when the
spirit of your commander communes with you in a muffled voice, as
if from the sanctum sanctorum of a temple; because, call her a
temple or a &ldquo;hell afloat&rdquo;&mdash;as some ships have
been called&mdash;the captain&rsquo;s state-room is surely the
august place in every vessel.</p>
<p>The good MacW&mdash; would not even come out to his meals, and
fed solitarily in his holy of holies from a tray covered with a
white napkin.&nbsp; Our steward used to bend an ironic glance at
the perfectly empty plates he was bringing out from there.&nbsp;
This grief for his home, which overcomes so many married seamen,
did not deprive Captain MacW&mdash; of his legitimate
appetite.&nbsp; In fact, the steward would almost invariably come
up to me, sitting in the captain&rsquo;s chair at the head of the
table, to say in a grave murmur, &ldquo;The captain asks for one
more slice of meat and two potatoes.&rdquo;&nbsp; We, his
officers, could hear him moving about in his berth, or lightly
snoring, or fetching deep sighs, or splashing and blowing in his
bath-room; and we made our reports to him through the keyhole, as
it were.&nbsp; It was the crowning achievement of his amiable
character that the answers we got were given in a quite mild and
friendly tone.&nbsp; Some commanders in their periods of
seclusion are constantly grumpy, and seem to resent the mere
sound of your voice as an injury and an insult.</p>
<p>But a grumpy recluse cannot worry his subordinates: whereas
the man in whom the sense of duty is strong (or, perhaps, only
the sense of self-importance), and who persists in airing on deck
his moroseness all day&mdash;and perhaps half the
night&mdash;becomes a grievous infliction.&nbsp; He walks the
poop darting gloomy glances, as though he wished to poison the
sea, and snaps your head off savagely whenever you happen to
blunder within earshot.&nbsp; And these vagaries are the harder
to bear patiently, as becomes a man and an officer, because no
sailor is really good-tempered during the first few days of a
voyage.&nbsp; There are regrets, memories, the instinctive
longing for the departed idleness, the instinctive hate of all
work.&nbsp; Besides, things have a knack of going wrong at the
start, especially in the matter of irritating trifles.&nbsp; And
there is the abiding thought of a whole year of more or less hard
life before one, because there was hardly a southern-going voyage
in the yesterday of the sea which meant anything less than a
twelvemonth.&nbsp; Yes; it needed a few days after the taking of
your departure for a ship&rsquo;s company to shake down into
their places, and for the soothing deep-water ship routine to
establish its beneficent sway.</p>
<p>It is a great doctor for sore hearts and sore heads, too, your
ship&rsquo;s routine, which I have seen soothe&mdash;at least for
a time&mdash;the most turbulent of spirits.&nbsp; There is health
in it, and peace, and satisfaction of the accomplished round; for
each day of the ship&rsquo;s life seems to close a circle within
the wide ring of the sea horizon.&nbsp; It borrows a certain
dignity of sameness from the majestic monotony of the sea.&nbsp;
He who loves the sea loves also the ship&rsquo;s routine.</p>
<p>Nowhere else than upon the sea do the days, weeks and months
fall away quicker into the past.&nbsp; They seem to be left
astern as easily as the light air-bubbles in the swirls of the
ship&rsquo;s wake, and vanish into a great silence in which your
ship moves on with a sort of magical effect.&nbsp; They pass
away, the days, the weeks, the months.&nbsp; Nothing but a gale
can disturb the orderly life of the ship; and the spell of
unshaken monotony that seems to have fallen upon the very voices
of her men is broken only by the near prospect of a Landfall.</p>
<p>Then is the spirit of the ship&rsquo;s commander stirred
strongly again.&nbsp; But it is not moved to seek seclusion, and
to remain, hidden and inert, shut up in a small cabin with the
solace of a good bodily appetite.&nbsp; When about to make the
land, the spirit of the ship&rsquo;s commander is tormented by an
unconquerable restlessness.&nbsp; It seems unable to abide for
many seconds together in the holy of holies of the
captain&rsquo;s state-room; it will out on deck and gaze ahead,
through straining eyes, as the appointed moment comes
nearer.&nbsp; It is kept vigorously upon the stretch of excessive
vigilance.&nbsp; Meantime the body of the ship&rsquo;s commander
is being enfeebled by want of appetite; at least, such is my
experience, though &ldquo;enfeebled&rdquo; is perhaps not exactly
the word.&nbsp; I might say, rather, that it is spiritualized by
a disregard for food, sleep, and all the ordinary comforts, such
as they are, of sea life.&nbsp; In one or two cases I have known
that detachment from the grosser needs of existence remain
regrettably incomplete in the matter of drink.</p>
<p>But these two cases were, properly speaking, pathological
cases, and the only two in all my sea experience.&nbsp; In one of
these two instances of a craving for stimulants, developed from
sheer anxiety, I cannot assert that the man&rsquo;s seamanlike
qualities were impaired in the least.&nbsp; It was a very anxious
case, too, the land being made suddenly, close-to, on a wrong
bearing, in thick weather, and during a fresh onshore gale.&nbsp;
Going below to speak to him soon after, I was unlucky enough to
catch my captain in the very act of hasty cork-drawing.&nbsp; The
sight, I may say, gave me an awful scare.&nbsp; I was well aware
of the morbidly sensitive nature of the man.&nbsp; Fortunately, I
managed to draw back unseen, and, taking care to stamp heavily
with my sea-boots at the foot of the cabin stairs, I made my
second entry.&nbsp; But for this unexpected glimpse, no act of
his during the next twenty-four hours could have given me the
slightest suspicion that all was not well with his nerve.</p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>Quite another case, and having nothing to do with drink, was
that of poor Captain B&mdash;.&nbsp; He used to suffer from sick
headaches, in his young days, every time he was approaching a
coast.&nbsp; Well over fifty years of age when I knew him, short,
stout, dignified, perhaps a little pompous, he was a man of a
singularly well-informed mind, the least sailor-like in outward
aspect, but certainly one of the best seamen whom it has been my
good luck to serve under.&nbsp; He was a Plymouth man, I think,
the son of a country doctor, and both his elder boys were
studying medicine.&nbsp; He commanded a big London ship, fairly
well known in her day.&nbsp; I thought no end of him, and that is
why I remember with a peculiar satisfaction the last words he
spoke to me on board his ship after an eighteen months&rsquo;
voyage.&nbsp; It was in the dock in Dundee, where we had brought
a full cargo of jute from Calcutta.&nbsp; We had been paid off
that morning, and I had come on board to take my sea-chest away
and to say good-bye.&nbsp; In his slightly lofty but courteous
way he inquired what were my plans.&nbsp; I replied that I
intended leaving for London by the afternoon train, and thought
of going up for examination to get my master&rsquo;s
certificate.&nbsp; I had just enough service for that.&nbsp; He
commended me for not wasting my time, with such an evident
interest in my case that I was quite surprised; then, rising from
his chair, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a ship in view after you have
passed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered that I had nothing whatever in view.</p>
<p>He shook hands with me, and pronounced the memorable
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you happen to be in want of employment, remember
that as long as I have a ship you have a ship, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the way of compliment there is nothing to beat this from a
ship&rsquo;s captain to his second mate at the end of a voyage,
when the work is over and the subordinate is done with.&nbsp; And
there is a pathos in that memory, for the poor fellow never went
to sea again after all.&nbsp; He was already ailing when we
passed St. Helena; was laid up for a time when we were off the
Western Islands, but got out of bed to make his Landfall.&nbsp;
He managed to keep up on deck as far as the Downs, where, giving
his orders in an exhausted voice, he anchored for a few hours to
send a wire to his wife and take aboard a North Sea pilot to help
him sail the ship up the east coast.&nbsp; He had not felt equal
to the task by himself, for it is the sort of thing that keeps a
deep-water man on his feet pretty well night and day.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Dundee, Mrs. B&mdash; was already there,
waiting to take him home.&nbsp; We travelled up to London by the
same train; but by the time I had managed to get through with my
examination the ship had sailed on her next voyage without him,
and, instead of joining her again, I went by request to see my
old commander in his home.&nbsp; This is the only one of my
captains I have ever visited in that way.&nbsp; He was out of bed
by then, &ldquo;quite convalescent,&rdquo; as he declared, making
a few tottering steps to meet me at the sitting-room door.&nbsp;
Evidently he was reluctant to take his final cross-bearings of
this earth for a Departure on the only voyage to an unknown
destination a sailor ever undertakes.&nbsp; And it was all very
nice&mdash;the large, sunny room; his deep, easy-chair in a bow
window, with pillows and a footstool; the quiet, watchful care of
the elderly, gentle woman who had borne him five children, and
had not, perhaps, lived with him more than five full years out of
the thirty or so of their married life.&nbsp; There was also
another woman there in a plain black dress, quite gray-haired,
sitting very erect on her chair with some sewing, from which she
snatched side-glances in his direction, and uttering not a single
word during all the time of my call.&nbsp; Even when, in due
course, I carried over to her a cup of tea, she only nodded at me
silently, with the faintest ghost of a smile on her tight-set
lips.&nbsp; I imagine she must have been a maiden sister of Mrs.
B&mdash; come to help nurse her brother-in-law.&nbsp; His
youngest boy, a late-comer, a great cricketer it seemed, twelve
years old or thereabouts, chattered enthusiastically of the
exploits of W. G. Grace.&nbsp; And I remember his eldest son,
too, a newly-fledged doctor, who took me out to smoke in the
garden, and, shaking his head with professional gravity, but with
genuine concern, muttered: &ldquo;Yes, but he doesn&rsquo;t get
back his appetite.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like that&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t like that at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last sight of
Captain B&mdash; I had was as he nodded his head to me out of the
bow window when I turned round to close the front gate.</p>
<p>It was a distinct and complete impression, something that I
don&rsquo;t know whether to call a Landfall or a Departure.&nbsp;
Certainly he had gazed at times very fixedly before him with the
Landfall&rsquo;s vigilant look, this sea-captain seated
incongruously in a deep-backed chair.&nbsp; He had not then
talked to me of employment, of ships, of being ready to take
another command; but he had discoursed of his early days, in the
abundant but thin flow of a wilful invalid&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp;
The women looked worried, but sat still, and I learned more of
him in that interview than in the whole eighteen months we had
sailed together.&nbsp; It appeared he had &ldquo;served his
time&rdquo; in the copper-ore trade, the famous copper-ore trade
of old days between Swansea and the Chilian coast, coal out and
ore in, deep-loaded both ways, as if in wanton defiance of the
great Cape Horn seas&mdash;a work, this, for staunch ships, and a
great school of staunchness for West-Country seamen.&nbsp; A
whole fleet of copper-bottomed barques, as strong in rib and
planking, as well-found in gear, as ever was sent upon the seas,
manned by hardy crews and commanded by young masters, was engaged
in that now long defunct trade.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was the school
I was trained in,&rdquo; he said to me almost boastfully, lying
back amongst his pillows with a rug over his legs.&nbsp; And it
was in that trade that he obtained his first command at a very
early age.&nbsp; It was then that he mentioned to me how, as a
young commander, he was always ill for a few days before making
land after a long passage.&nbsp; But this sort of sickness used
to pass off with the first sight of a familiar landmark.&nbsp;
Afterwards, he added, as he grew older, all that nervousness wore
off completely; and I observed his weary eyes gaze steadily
ahead, as if there had been nothing between him and the straight
line of sea and sky, where whatever a seaman is looking for is
first bound to appear.&nbsp; But I have also seen his eyes rest
fondly upon the faces in the room, upon the pictures on the wall,
upon all the familiar objects of that home, whose abiding and
clear image must have flashed often on his memory in times of
stress and anxiety at sea.&nbsp; Was he looking out for a strange
Landfall, or taking with an untroubled mind the bearings for his
last Departure?</p>
<p>It is hard to say; for in that voyage from which no man
returns Landfall and Departure are instantaneous, merging
together into one moment of supreme and final attention.&nbsp;
Certainly I do not remember observing any sign of faltering in
the set expression of his wasted face, no hint of the nervous
anxiety of a young commander about to make land on an uncharted
shore.&nbsp; He had had too much experience of Departures and
Landfalls!&nbsp; And had he not &ldquo;served his time&rdquo; in
the famous copper-ore trade out of the Bristol Channel, the work
of the staunchest ships afloat, and the school of staunch
seamen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> an anchor can ever be
raised, it must be let go; and this perfectly obvious truism
brings me at once to the subject of the degradation of the sea
language in the daily press of this country.</p>
<p>Your journalist, whether he takes charge of a ship or a fleet,
almost invariably &ldquo;casts&rdquo; his anchor.&nbsp; Now, an
anchor is never cast, and to take a liberty with technical
language is a crime against the clearness, precision, and beauty
of perfected speech.</p>
<p>An anchor is a forged piece of iron, admirably adapted to its
end, and technical language is an instrument wrought into
perfection by ages of experience, a flawless thing for its
purpose.&nbsp; An anchor of yesterday (because nowadays there are
contrivances like mushrooms and things like claws, of no
particular expression or shape&mdash;just hooks)&mdash;an anchor
of yesterday is in its way a most efficient instrument.&nbsp; To
its perfection its size bears witness, for there is no other
appliance so small for the great work it has to do.&nbsp; Look at
the anchors hanging from the cat-heads of a big ship!&nbsp; How
tiny they are in proportion to the great size of the hull!&nbsp;
Were they made of gold they would look like trinkets, like
ornamental toys, no bigger in proportion than a jewelled drop in
a woman&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; And yet upon them will depend, more
than once, the very life of the ship.</p>
<p>An anchor is forged and fashioned for faithfulness; give it
ground that it can bite, and it will hold till the cable parts,
and then, whatever may afterwards befall its ship, that anchor is
&ldquo;lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; The honest, rough piece of iron, so
simple in appearance, has more parts than the human body has
limbs: the ring, the stock, the crown, the flukes, the palms, the
shank.&nbsp; All this, according to the journalist, is
&ldquo;cast&rdquo; when a ship arriving at an anchorage is
brought up.</p>
<p>This insistence in using the odious word arises from the fact
that a particularly benighted landsman must imagine the act of
anchoring as a process of throwing something overboard, whereas
the anchor ready for its work is already overboard, and is not
thrown over, but simply allowed to fall.&nbsp; It hangs from the
ship&rsquo;s side at the end of a heavy, projecting timber called
the cat-head, in the bight of a short, thick chain whose end link
is suddenly released by a blow from a top-maul or the pull of a
lever when the order is given.&nbsp; And the order is not
&ldquo;Heave over!&rdquo; as the paragraphist seems to imagine,
but &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, nothing is ever cast in that sense on
board ship but the lead, of which a cast is taken to search the
depth of water on which she floats.&nbsp; A lashed boat, a spare
spar, a cask or what not secured about the decks, is &ldquo;cast
adrift&rdquo; when it is untied.&nbsp; Also the ship herself is
&ldquo;cast to port or starboard&rdquo; when getting under
way.&nbsp; She, however, never &ldquo;casts&rdquo; her
anchor.</p>
<p>To speak with severe technicality, a ship or a fleet is
&ldquo;brought up&rdquo;&mdash;the complementary words
unpronounced and unwritten being, of course, &ldquo;to an
anchor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Less technically, but not less correctly,
the word &ldquo;anchored,&rdquo; with its characteristic
appearance and resolute sound, ought to be good enough for the
newspapers of the greatest maritime country in the world.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The fleet anchored at Spithead&rdquo;: can anyone want a
better sentence for brevity and seamanlike ring?&nbsp; But the
&ldquo;cast-anchor&rdquo; trick, with its affectation of being a
sea-phrase&mdash;for why not write just as well &ldquo;threw
anchor,&rdquo; &ldquo;flung anchor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;shied
anchor&rdquo;?&mdash;is intolerably odious to a sailor&rsquo;s
ear.&nbsp; I remember a coasting pilot of my early acquaintance
(he used to read the papers assiduously) who, to define the
utmost degree of lubberliness in a landsman, used to say,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of them poor, miserable
&lsquo;cast-anchor&rsquo; devils.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>V.</h2>
<p>From first to last the seaman&rsquo;s thoughts are very much
concerned with his anchors.&nbsp; It is not so much that the
anchor is a symbol of hope as that it is the heaviest object that
he has to handle on board his ship at sea in the usual routine of
his duties.&nbsp; The beginning and the end of every passage are
marked distinctly by work about the ship&rsquo;s anchors.&nbsp; A
vessel in the Channel has her anchors always ready, her cables
shackled on, and the land almost always in sight.&nbsp; The
anchor and the land are indissolubly connected in a
sailor&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; But directly she is clear of the
narrow seas, heading out into the world with nothing solid to
speak of between her and the South Pole, the anchors are got in
and the cables disappear from the deck.&nbsp; But the anchors do
not disappear.&nbsp; Technically speaking, they are
&ldquo;secured in-board&rdquo;; and, on the forecastle head,
lashed down to ring-bolts with ropes and chains, under the
straining sheets of the head-sails, they look very idle and as if
asleep.&nbsp; Thus bound, but carefully looked after, inert and
powerful, those emblems of hope make company for the look-out man
in the night watches; and so the days glide by, with a long rest
for those characteristically shaped pieces of iron, reposing
forward, visible from almost every part of the ship&rsquo;s deck,
waiting for their work on the other side of the world somewhere,
while the ship carries them on with a great rush and splutter of
foam underneath, and the sprays of the open sea rust their heavy
limbs.</p>
<p>The first approach to the land, as yet invisible to the
crew&rsquo;s eyes, is announced by the brisk order of the chief
mate to the boatswain: &ldquo;We will get the anchors over this
afternoon&rdquo; or &ldquo;first thing to-morrow morning,&rdquo;
as the case may be.&nbsp; For the chief mate is the keeper of the
ship&rsquo;s anchors and the guardian of her cable.&nbsp; There
are good ships and bad ships, comfortable ships and ships where,
from first day to last of the voyage, there is no rest for a
chief mate&rsquo;s body and soul.&nbsp; And ships are what men
make them: this is a pronouncement of sailor wisdom, and, no
doubt, in the main it is true.</p>
<p>However, there are ships where, as an old grizzled mate once
told me, &ldquo;nothing ever seems to go right!&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
looking from the poop where we both stood (I had paid him a
neighbourly call in dock), he added: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He glanced up at my face, which expressed a
proper professional sympathy, and set me right in my natural
surmise: &ldquo;Oh no; the old man&rsquo;s right enough.&nbsp; He
never interferes.&nbsp; Anything that&rsquo;s done in a
seamanlike way is good enough for him.&nbsp; And yet, somehow,
nothing ever seems to go right in this ship.&nbsp; I tell you
what: she is naturally unhandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;old man,&rdquo; of course, was his captain, who
just then came on deck in a silk hat and brown overcoat, and,
with a civil nod to us, went ashore.&nbsp; He was certainly not
more than thirty, and the elderly mate, with a murmur to me of
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my old man,&rdquo; proceeded to give
instances of the natural unhandiness of the ship in a sort of
deprecatory tone, as if to say, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think I
bear a grudge against her for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The instances do not matter.&nbsp; The point is that there are
ships where things <i>do</i> go wrong; but whatever the
ship&mdash;good or bad, lucky or unlucky&mdash;it is in the
forepart of her that her chief mate feels most at home.&nbsp; It
is emphatically <i>his</i> end of the ship, though, of course, he
is the executive supervisor of the whole.&nbsp; There are
<i>his</i> anchors, <i>his</i> headgear, his foremast, his
station for manoeuvring when the captain is in charge.&nbsp; And
there, too, live the men, the ship&rsquo;s hands, whom it is his
duty to keep employed, fair weather or foul, for the ship&rsquo;s
welfare.&nbsp; It is the chief mate, the only figure of the
ship&rsquo;s afterguard, who comes bustling forward at the cry of
&ldquo;All hands on deck!&rdquo;&nbsp; He is the satrap of that
province in the autocratic realm of the ship, and more personally
responsible for anything that may happen there.</p>
<p>There, too, on the approach to the land, assisted by the
boatswain and the carpenter, he &ldquo;gets the anchors
over&rdquo; with the men of his own watch, whom he knows better
than the others.&nbsp; There he sees the cable ranged, the
windlass disconnected, the compressors opened; and there, after
giving his own last order, &ldquo;Stand clear of the
cable!&rdquo; he waits attentive, in a silent ship that forges
slowly ahead towards her picked-out berth, for the sharp shout
from aft, &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;&nbsp; Instantly bending over, he
sees the trusty iron fall with a heavy plunge under his eyes,
which watch and note whether it has gone clear.</p>
<p>For the anchor &ldquo;to go clear&rdquo; means to go clear of
its own chain.&nbsp; Your anchor must drop from the bow of your
ship with no turn of cable on any of its limbs, else you would be
riding to a foul anchor.&nbsp; Unless the pull of the cable is
fair on the ring, no anchor can be trusted even on the best of
holding ground.&nbsp; In time of stress it is bound to drag, for
implements and men must be treated fairly to give you the
&ldquo;virtue&rdquo; which is in them.&nbsp; The anchor is an
emblem of hope, but a foul anchor is worse than the most
fallacious of false hopes that ever lured men or nations into a
sense of security.&nbsp; And the sense of security, even the most
warranted, is a bad councillor.&nbsp; It is the sense which, like
that exaggerated feeling of well-being ominous of the coming on
of madness, precedes the swift fall of disaster.&nbsp; A seaman
labouring under an undue sense of security becomes at once worth
hardly half his salt.&nbsp; Therefore, of all my chief officers,
the one I trusted most was a man called B&mdash;.&nbsp; He had a
red moustache, a lean face, also red, and an uneasy eye.&nbsp; He
was worth all his salt.</p>
<p>On examining now, after many years, the residue of the feeling
which was the outcome of the contact of our personalities, I
discover, without much surprise, a certain flavour of
dislike.&nbsp; Upon the whole, I think he was one of the most
uncomfortable shipmates possible for a young commander.&nbsp; If
it is permissible to criticise the absent, I should say he had a
little too much of the sense of insecurity which is so invaluable
in a seaman.&nbsp; He had an extremely disturbing air of being
everlastingly ready (even when seated at table at my right hand
before a plate of salt beef) to grapple with some impending
calamity.&nbsp; I must hasten to add that he had also the other
qualification necessary to make a trustworthy seaman&mdash;that
of an absolute confidence in himself.&nbsp; What was really wrong
with him was that he had these qualities in an unrestful
degree.&nbsp; His eternally watchful demeanour, his jerky,
nervous talk, even his, as it were, determined silences, seemed
to imply&mdash;and, I believe, they did imply&mdash;that to his
mind the ship was never safe in my hands.&nbsp; Such was the man
who looked after the anchors of a less than five-hundred-ton
barque, my first command, now gone from the face of the earth,
but sure of a tenderly remembered existence as long as I
live.&nbsp; No anchor could have gone down foul under Mr.
B&mdash;&rsquo;s piercing eye.&nbsp; It was good for one to be
sure of that when, in an open roadstead, one heard in the cabin
the wind pipe up; but still, there were moments when I detested
Mr. B&mdash; exceedingly.&nbsp; From the way he used to glare
sometimes, I fancy that more than once he paid me back with
interest.&nbsp; It so happened that we both loved the little
barque very much.&nbsp; And it was just the defect of Mr.
B&mdash;&rsquo;s inestimable qualities that he would never
persuade himself to believe that the ship was safe in my
hands.&nbsp; To begin with, he was more than five years older
than myself at a time of life when five years really do count, I
being twenty-nine and he thirty-four; then, on our first leaving
port (I don&rsquo;t see why I should make a secret of the fact
that it was Bangkok), a bit of manoeuvring of mine amongst the
islands of the Gulf of Siam had given him an unforgettable
scare.&nbsp; Ever since then he had nursed in secret a bitter
idea of my utter recklessness.&nbsp; But upon the whole, and
unless the grip of a man&rsquo;s hand at parting means nothing
whatever, I conclude that we did like each other at the end of
two years and three months well enough.</p>
<p>The bond between us was the ship; and therein a ship, though
she has female attributes and is loved very unreasonably, is
different from a woman.&nbsp; That I should have been
tremendously smitten with my first command is nothing to wonder
at, but I suppose I must admit that Mr. B&mdash;&rsquo;s
sentiment was of a higher order.&nbsp; Each of us, of course, was
extremely anxious about the good appearance of the beloved
object; and, though I was the one to glean compliments ashore,
B&mdash; had the more intimate pride of feeling, resembling that
of a devoted handmaiden.&nbsp; And that sort of faithful and
proud devotion went so far as to make him go about flicking the
dust off the varnished teak-wood rail of the little craft with a
silk pocket-handkerchief&mdash;a present from Mrs. B&mdash;, I
believe.</p>
<p>That was the effect of his love for the barque.&nbsp; The
effect of his admirable lack of the sense of security once went
so far as to make him remark to me: &ldquo;Well, sir, you
<i>are</i> a lucky man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said in a tone full of significance, but not exactly
offensive, and it was, I suppose, my innate tact that prevented
my asking, &ldquo;What on earth do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on his meaning was illustrated more fully on a dark
night in a tight corner during a dead on-shore gale.&nbsp; I had
called him up on deck to help me consider our extremely
unpleasant situation.&nbsp; There was not much time for deep
thinking, and his summing-up was: &ldquo;It looks pretty bad,
whichever we try; but, then, sir, you always do get out of a mess
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>VI.</h2>
<p>It is difficult to disconnect the idea of ships&rsquo; anchors
from the idea of the ship&rsquo;s chief mate&mdash;the man who
sees them go down clear and come up sometimes foul; because not
even the most unremitting care can always prevent a ship,
swinging to winds and tide, from taking an awkward turn of the
cable round stock or fluke.&nbsp; Then the business of
&ldquo;getting the anchor&rdquo; and securing it afterwards is
unduly prolonged, and made a weariness to the chief mate.&nbsp;
He is the man who watches the growth of the cable&mdash;a
sailor&rsquo;s phrase which has all the force, precision, and
imagery of technical language that, created by simple men with
keen eyes for the real aspect of the things they see in their
trade, achieves the just expression seizing upon the essential,
which is the ambition of the artist in words.&nbsp; Therefore the
sailor will never say, &ldquo;cast anchor,&rdquo; and the
ship-master aft will hail his chief mate on the forecastle in
impressionistic phrase: &ldquo;How does the cable
grow?&rdquo;&nbsp; Because &ldquo;grow&rdquo; is the right word
for the long drift of a cable emerging aslant under the strain,
taut as a bow-string above the water.&nbsp; And it is the voice
of the keeper of the ship&rsquo;s anchors that will answer:
&ldquo;Grows right ahead, sir,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Broad on the
bow,&rdquo; or whatever concise and deferential shout will fit
the case.</p>
<p>There is no order more noisily given or taken up with lustier
shouts on board a homeward-bound merchant ship than the command,
&ldquo;Man the windlass!&rdquo;&nbsp; The rush of expectant men
out of the forecastle, the snatching of hand-spikes, the tramp of
feet, the clink of the pawls, make a stirring accompaniment to a
plaintive up-anchor song with a roaring chorus; and this burst of
noisy activity from a whole ship&rsquo;s crew seems like a
voiceful awakening of the ship herself, till then, in the
picturesque phrase of Dutch seamen, &ldquo;lying asleep upon her
iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a ship with her sails furled on her squared yards, and
reflected from truck to water-line in the smooth gleaming sheet
of a landlocked harbour, seems, indeed, to a seaman&rsquo;s eye
the most perfect picture of slumbering repose.&nbsp; The getting
of your anchor was a noisy operation on board a merchant ship of
yesterday&mdash;an inspiring, joyous noise, as if, with the
emblem of hope, the ship&rsquo;s company expected to drag up out
of the depths, each man all his personal hopes into the reach of
a securing hand&mdash;the hope of home, the hope of rest, of
liberty, of dissipation, of hard pleasure, following the hard
endurance of many days between sky and water.&nbsp; And this
noisiness, this exultation at the moment of the ship&rsquo;s
departure, make a tremendous contrast to the silent moments of
her arrival in a foreign roadstead&mdash;the silent moments when,
stripped of her sails, she forges ahead to her chosen berth, the
loose canvas fluttering softly in the gear above the heads of the
men standing still upon her decks, the master gazing intently
forward from the break of the poop.&nbsp; Gradually she loses her
way, hardly moving, with the three figures on her forecastle
waiting attentively about the cat-head for the last order of,
perhaps, full ninety days at sea: &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the final word of a ship&rsquo;s ended journey, the
closing word of her toil and of her achievement.&nbsp; In a life
whose worth is told out in passages from port to port, the splash
of the anchor&rsquo;s fall and the thunderous rumbling of the
chain are like the closing of a distinct period, of which she
seems conscious with a slight deep shudder of all her
frame.&nbsp; By so much is she nearer to her appointed death, for
neither years nor voyages can go on for ever.&nbsp; It is to her
like the striking of a clock, and in the pause which follows she
seems to take count of the passing time.</p>
<p>This is the last important order; the others are mere routine
directions.&nbsp; Once more the master is heard: &ldquo;Give her
forty-five fathom to the water&rsquo;s edge,&rdquo; and then he,
too, is done for a time.&nbsp; For days he leaves all the harbour
work to his chief mate, the keeper of the ship&rsquo;s anchor and
of the ship&rsquo;s routine.&nbsp; For days his voice will not be
heard raised about the decks, with that curt, austere accent of
the man in charge, till, again, when the hatches are on, and in a
silent and expectant ship, he shall speak up from aft in
commanding tones: &ldquo;Man the windlass!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> other year, looking through a
newspaper of sound principles, but whose staff <i>will</i>
persist in &ldquo;casting&rdquo; anchors and going to sea
&ldquo;on&rdquo; a ship (ough!), I came across an article upon
the season&rsquo;s yachting.&nbsp; And, behold! it was a good
article.&nbsp; To a man who had but little to do with pleasure
sailing (though all sailing is a pleasure), and certainly nothing
whatever with racing in open waters, the writer&rsquo;s
strictures upon the handicapping of yachts were just intelligible
and no more.&nbsp; And I do not pretend to any interest in the
enumeration of the great races of that year.&nbsp; As to the
52-foot linear raters, praised so much by the writer, I am warmed
up by his approval of their performances; but, as far as any
clear conception goes, the descriptive phrase, so precise to the
comprehension of a yachtsman, evokes no definite image in my
mind.</p>
<p>The writer praises that class of pleasure vessels, and I am
willing to endorse his words, as any man who loves every craft
afloat would be ready to do.&nbsp; I am disposed to admire and
respect the 52-foot linear raters on the word of a man who
regrets in such a sympathetic and understanding spirit the
threatened decay of yachting seamanship.</p>
<p>Of course, yacht racing is an organized pastime, a function of
social idleness ministering to the vanity of certain wealthy
inhabitants of these isles nearly as much as to their inborn love
of the sea.&nbsp; But the writer of the article in question goes
on to point out, with insight and justice, that for a great
number of people (20,000, I think he says) it is a means of
livelihood&mdash;that it is, in his own words, an industry.&nbsp;
Now, the moral side of an industry, productive or unproductive,
the redeeming and ideal aspect of this bread-winning, is the
attainment and preservation of the highest possible skill on the
part of the craftsmen.&nbsp; Such skill, the skill of technique,
is more than honesty; it is something wider, embracing honesty
and grace and rule in an elevated and clear sentiment, not
altogether utilitarian, which may be called the honour of
labour.&nbsp; It is made up of accumulated tradition, kept alive
by individual pride, rendered exact by professional opinion, and,
like the higher arts, it spurred on and sustained by
discriminating praise.</p>
<p>This is why the attainment of proficiency, the pushing of your
skill with attention to the most delicate shades of excellence,
is a matter of vital concern.&nbsp; Efficiency of a practically
flawless kind may be reached naturally in the struggle for
bread.&nbsp; But there is something beyond&mdash;a higher point,
a subtle and unmistakable touch of love and pride beyond mere
skill; almost an inspiration which gives to all work that finish
which is almost art&mdash;which <i>is</i> art.</p>
<p>As men of scrupulous honour set up a high standard of public
conscience above the dead-level of an honest community, so men of
that skill which passes into art by ceaseless striving raise the
dead-level of correct practice in the crafts of land and
sea.&nbsp; The conditions fostering the growth of that supreme,
alive excellence, as well in work as in play, ought to be
preserved with a most careful regard lest the industry or the
game should perish of an insidious and inward decay.&nbsp;
Therefore I have read with profound regret, in that article upon
the yachting season of a certain year, that the seamanship on
board racing yachts is not now what it used to be only a few,
very few, years ago.</p>
<p>For that was the gist of that article, written evidently by a
man who not only knows but <i>understands</i>&mdash;a thing (let
me remark in passing) much rarer than one would expect, because
the sort of understanding I mean is inspired by love; and love,
though in a sense it may be admitted to be stronger than death,
is by no means so universal and so sure.&nbsp; In fact, love is
rare&mdash;the love of men, of things, of ideas, the love of
perfected skill.&nbsp; For love is the enemy of haste; it takes
count of passing days, of men who pass away, of a fine art
matured slowly in the course of years and doomed in a short time
to pass away too, and be no more.&nbsp; Love and regret go hand
in hand in this world of changes swifter than the shifting of the
clouds reflected in the mirror of the sea.</p>
<p>To penalize a yacht in proportion to the fineness of her
performance is unfair to the craft and to her men.&nbsp; It is
unfair to the perfection of her form and to the skill of her
servants.&nbsp; For we men are, in fact, the servants of our
creations.&nbsp; We remain in everlasting bondage to the
productions of our brain and to the work of our hands.&nbsp; A
man is born to serve his time on this earth, and there is
something fine in the service being given on other grounds than
that of utility.&nbsp; The bondage of art is very exacting.&nbsp;
And, as the writer of the article which started this train of
thought says with lovable warmth, the sailing of yachts is a fine
art.</p>
<p>His contention is that racing, without time allowances for
anything else but tonnage&mdash;that is, for size&mdash;has
fostered the fine art of sailing to the pitch of
perfection.&nbsp; Every sort of demand is made upon the master of
a sailing-yacht, and to be penalized in proportion to your
success may be of advantage to the sport itself, but it has an
obviously deteriorating effect upon the seamanship.&nbsp; The
fine art is being lost.</p>
<h2>VIII.</h2>
<p>The sailing and racing of yachts has developed a class of
fore-and-aft sailors, men born and bred to the sea, fishing in
winter and yachting in summer; men to whom the handling of that
particular rig presents no mystery.&nbsp; It is their striving
for victory that has elevated the sailing of pleasure craft to
the dignity of a fine art in that special sense.&nbsp; As I have
said, I know nothing of racing and but little of fore-and-aft
rig; but the advantages of such a rig are obvious, especially for
purposes of pleasure, whether in cruising or racing.&nbsp; It
requires less effort in handling; the trimming of the sail-planes
to the wind can be done with speed and accuracy; the unbroken
spread of the sail-area is of infinite advantage; and the
greatest possible amount of canvas can be displayed upon the
least possible quantity of spars.&nbsp; Lightness and
concentrated power are the great qualities of fore-and-aft
rig.</p>
<p>A fleet of fore-and-afters at anchor has its own slender
graciousness.&nbsp; The setting of their sails resembles more
than anything else the unfolding of a bird&rsquo;s wings; the
facility of their evolutions is a pleasure to the eye.&nbsp; They
are birds of the sea, whose swimming is like flying, and
resembles more a natural function than the handling of
man-invented appliances.&nbsp; The fore-and-aft rig in its
simplicity and the beauty of its aspect under every angle of
vision is, I believe, unapproachable.&nbsp; A schooner, yawl, or
cutter in charge of a capable man seems to handle herself as if
endowed with the power of reasoning and the gift of swift
execution.&nbsp; One laughs with sheer pleasure at a smart piece
of manoeuvring, as at a manifestation of a living
creature&rsquo;s quick wit and graceful precision.</p>
<p>Of those three varieties of fore-and-aft rig, the
cutter&mdash;the racing rig <i>par excellence</i>&mdash;is of an
appearance the most imposing, from the fact that practically all
her canvas is in one piece.&nbsp; The enormous mainsail of a
cutter, as she draws slowly past a point of land or the end of a
jetty under your admiring gaze, invests her with an air of lofty
and silent majesty.&nbsp; At anchor a schooner looks better; she
has an aspect of greater efficiency and a better balance to the
eye, with her two masts distributed over the hull with a
swaggering rake aft.&nbsp; The yawl rig one comes in time to
love.&nbsp; It is, I should think, the easiest of all to
manage.</p>
<p>For racing, a cutter; for a long pleasure voyage, a schooner;
for cruising in home waters, the yawl; and the handling of them
all is indeed a fine art.&nbsp; It requires not only the
knowledge of the general principles of sailing, but a particular
acquaintance with the character of the craft.&nbsp; All vessels
are handled in the same way as far as theory goes, just as you
may deal with all men on broad and rigid principles.&nbsp; But if
you want that success in life which comes from the affection and
confidence of your fellows, then with no two men, however similar
they may appear in their nature, will you deal in the same
way.&nbsp; There may be a rule of conduct; there is no rule of
human fellowship.&nbsp; To deal with men is as fine an art as it
is to deal with ships.&nbsp; Both men and ships live in an
unstable element, are subject to subtle and powerful influences,
and want to have their merits understood rather than their faults
found out.</p>
<p>It is not what your ship will <i>not</i> do that you want to
know to get on terms of successful partnership with her; it is,
rather, that you ought to have a precise knowledge of what she
will do for you when called upon to put forth what is in her by a
sympathetic touch.&nbsp; At first sight the difference does not
seem great in either line of dealing with the difficult problem
of limitations.&nbsp; But the difference is great.&nbsp; The
difference lies in the spirit in which the problem is
approached.&nbsp; After all, the art of handling ships is finer,
perhaps, than the art of handling men.</p>
<p>And, like all fine arts, it must be based upon a broad, solid
sincerity, which, like a law of Nature, rules an infinity of
different phenomena.&nbsp; Your endeavour must be
single-minded.&nbsp; You would talk differently to a coal-heaver
and to a professor.&nbsp; But is this duplicity?&nbsp; I deny
it.&nbsp; The truth consists in the genuineness of the feeling,
in the genuine recognition of the two men, so similar and so
different, as your two partners in the hazard of life.&nbsp;
Obviously, a humbug, thinking only of winning his little race,
would stand a chance of profiting by his artifices.&nbsp; Men,
professors or coal-heavers, are easily deceived; they even have
an extraordinary knack of lending themselves to deception, a sort
of curious and inexplicable propensity to allow themselves to be
led by the nose with their eyes open.&nbsp; But a ship is a
creature which we have brought into the world, as it were on
purpose to keep us up to the mark.&nbsp; In her handling a ship
will not put up with a mere pretender, as, for instance, the
public will do with Mr. X, the popular statesman, Mr. Y, the
popular scientist, or Mr. Z, the popular&mdash;what shall we
say?&mdash;anything from a teacher of high morality to a
bagman&mdash;who have won their little race.&nbsp; But I would
like (though not accustomed to betting) to wager a large sum that
not one of the few first-rate skippers of racing yachts has ever
been a humbug.&nbsp; It would have been too difficult.&nbsp; The
difficulty arises from the fact that one does not deal with ships
in a mob, but with a ship as an individual.&nbsp; So we may have
to do with men.&nbsp; But in each of us there lurks some particle
of the mob spirit, of the mob temperament.&nbsp; No matter how
earnestly we strive against each other, we remain brothers on the
lowest side of our intellect and in the instability of our
feelings.&nbsp; With ships it is not so.&nbsp; Much as they are
to us, they are nothing to each other.&nbsp; Those sensitive
creatures have no ears for our blandishments.&nbsp; It takes
something more than words to cajole them to do our will, to cover
us with glory.&nbsp; Luckily, too, or else there would have been
more shoddy reputations for first-rate seamanship.&nbsp; Ships
have no ears, I repeat, though, indeed, I think I have known
ships who really seemed to have had eyes, or else I cannot
understand on what ground a certain 1,000-ton barque of my
acquaintance on one particular occasion refused to answer her
helm, thereby saving a frightful smash to two ships and to a very
good man&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp; I knew her intimately for two
years, and in no other instance either before or since have I
known her to do that thing.&nbsp; The man she had served so well
(guessing, perhaps, at the depths of his affection for her) I
have known much longer, and in bare justice to him I must say
that this confidence-shattering experience (though so fortunate)
only augmented his trust in her.&nbsp; Yes, our ships have no
ears, and thus they cannot be deceived.&nbsp; I would illustrate
my idea of fidelity as between man and ship, between the master
and his art, by a statement which, though it might appear
shockingly sophisticated, is really very simple.&nbsp; I would
say that a racing-yacht skipper who thought of nothing else but
the glory of winning the race would never attain to any eminence
of reputation.&nbsp; The genuine masters of their craft&mdash;I
say this confidently from my experience of ships&mdash;have
thought of nothing but of doing their very best by the vessel
under their charge.&nbsp; To forget one&rsquo;s self, to
surrender all personal feeling in the service of that fine art,
is the only way for a seaman to the faithful discharge of his
trust.</p>
<p>Such is the service of a fine art and of ships that sail the
sea.&nbsp; And therein I think I can lay my finger upon the
difference between the seamen of yesterday, who are still with
us, and the seamen of to-morrow, already entered upon the
possession of their inheritance.&nbsp; History repeats itself,
but the special call of an art which has passed away is never
reproduced.&nbsp; It is as utterly gone out of the world as the
song of a destroyed wild bird.&nbsp; Nothing will awaken the same
response of pleasurable emotion or conscientious endeavour.&nbsp;
And the sailing of any vessel afloat is an art whose fine form
seems already receding from us on its way to the overshadowed
Valley of Oblivion.&nbsp; The taking of a modern steamship about
the world (though one would not minimize its responsibilities)
has not the same quality of intimacy with nature, which, after
all, is an indispensable condition to the building up of an
art.&nbsp; It is less personal and a more exact calling; less
arduous, but also less gratifying in the lack of close communion
between the artist and the medium of his art.&nbsp; It is, in
short, less a matter of love.&nbsp; Its effects are measured
exactly in time and space as no effect of an art can be.&nbsp; It
is an occupation which a man not desperately subject to
sea-sickness can be imagined to follow with content, without
enthusiasm, with industry, without affection.&nbsp; Punctuality
is its watchword.&nbsp; The incertitude which attends closely
every artistic endeavour is absent from its regulated
enterprise.&nbsp; It has no great moments of self-confidence, or
moments not less great of doubt and heart-searching.&nbsp; It is
an industry which, like other industries, has its romance, its
honour and its rewards, its bitter anxieties and its hours of
ease.&nbsp; But such sea-going has not the artistic quality of a
single-handed struggle with something much greater than yourself;
it is not the laborious absorbing practice of an art whose
ultimate result remains on the knees of the gods.&nbsp; It is not
an individual, temperamental achievement, but simply the skilled
use of a captured force, merely another step forward upon the way
of universal conquest.</p>
<h2>IX.</h2>
<p>Every passage of a ship of yesterday, whose yards were braced
round eagerly the very moment the pilot, with his pockets full of
letters, had got over the side, was like a race&mdash;a race
against time, against an ideal standard of achievement
outstripping the expectations of common men.&nbsp; Like all true
art, the general conduct of a ship and her handling in particular
cases had a technique which could be discussed with delight and
pleasure by men who found in their work, not bread alone, but an
outlet for the peculiarities of their temperament.&nbsp; To get
the best and truest effect from the infinitely varying moods of
sky and sea, not pictorially, but in the spirit of their calling,
was their vocation, one and all; and they recognised this with as
much sincerity, and drew as much inspiration from this reality,
as any man who ever put brush to canvas.&nbsp; The diversity of
temperaments was immense amongst those masters of the fine
art.</p>
<p>Some of them were like Royal Academicians of a certain
kind.&nbsp; They never startled you by a touch of originality, by
a fresh audacity of inspiration.&nbsp; They were safe, very
safe.&nbsp; They went about solemnly in the assurance of their
consecrated and empty reputation.&nbsp; Names are odious, but I
remember one of them who might have been their very president,
the P.R.A. of the sea-craft.&nbsp; His weather-beaten and
handsome face, his portly presence, his shirt-fronts and broad
cuffs and gold links, his air of bluff distinction, impressed the
humble beholders (stevedores, tally clerks, tide-waiters) as he
walked ashore over the gangway of his ship lying at the Circular
Quay in Sydney.&nbsp; His voice was deep, hearty, and
authoritative&mdash;the voice of a very prince amongst
sailors.&nbsp; He did everything with an air which put your
attention on the alert and raised your expectations, but the
result somehow was always on stereotyped lines, unsuggestive,
empty of any lesson that one could lay to heart.&nbsp; He kept
his ship in apple-pie order, which would have been seamanlike
enough but for a finicking touch in its details.&nbsp; His
officers affected a superiority over the rest of us, but the
boredom of their souls appeared in their manner of dreary
submission to the fads of their commander.&nbsp; It was only his
apprenticed boys whose irrepressible spirits were not affected by
the solemn and respectable mediocrity of that artist.&nbsp; There
were four of these youngsters: one the son of a doctor, another
of a colonel, the third of a jeweller; the name of the fourth was
Twentyman, and this is all I remember of his parentage.&nbsp; But
not one of them seemed to possess the smallest spark of gratitude
in his composition.&nbsp; Though their commander was a kind man
in his way, and had made a point of introducing them to the best
people in the town in order that they should not fall into the
bad company of boys belonging to other ships, I regret to say
that they made faces at him behind his back, and imitated the
dignified carriage of his head without any concealment
whatever.</p>
<p>This master of the fine art was a personage and nothing more;
but, as I have said, there was an infinite diversity of
temperament amongst the masters of the fine art I have
known.&nbsp; Some were great impressionists.&nbsp; They impressed
upon you the fear of God and Immensity&mdash;or, in other words,
the fear of being drowned with every circumstance of terrific
grandeur.&nbsp; One may think that the locality of your passing
away by means of suffocation in water does not really matter very
much.&nbsp; I am not so sure of that.&nbsp; I am, perhaps, unduly
sensitive, but I confess that the idea of being suddenly spilt
into an infuriated ocean in the midst of darkness and uproar
affected me always with a sensation of shrinking distaste.&nbsp;
To be drowned in a pond, though it might be called an ignominious
fate by the ignorant, is yet a bright and peaceful ending in
comparison with some other endings to one&rsquo;s earthly career
which I have mentally quaked at in the intervals or even in the
midst of violent exertions.</p>
<p>But let that pass.&nbsp; Some of the masters whose influence
left a trace upon my character to this very day, combined a
fierceness of conception with a certitude of execution upon the
basis of just appreciation of means and ends which is the highest
quality of the man of action.&nbsp; And an artist is a man of
action, whether he creates a personality, invents an expedient,
or finds the issue of a complicated situation.</p>
<p>There were masters, too, I have known, whose very art
consisted in avoiding every conceivable situation.&nbsp; It is
needless to say that they never did great things in their craft;
but they were not to be despised for that.&nbsp; They were
modest; they understood their limitations.&nbsp; Their own
masters had not handed the sacred fire into the keeping of their
cold and skilful hands.&nbsp; One of those last I remember
specially, now gone to his rest from that sea which his
temperament must have made a scene of little more than a peaceful
pursuit.&nbsp; Once only did he attempt a stroke of audacity, one
early morning, with a steady breeze, entering a crowded
roadstead.&nbsp; But he was not genuine in this display which
might have been art.&nbsp; He was thinking of his own self; he
hankered after the meretricious glory of a showy performance.</p>
<p>As, rounding a dark, wooded point, bathed in fresh air and
sunshine, we opened to view a crowd of shipping at anchor lying
half a mile ahead of us perhaps, he called me aft from my station
on the forecastle head, and, turning over and over his binoculars
in his brown hands, said: &ldquo;Do you see that big, heavy ship
with white lower masts?&nbsp; I am going to take up a berth
between her and the shore.&nbsp; Now do you see to it that the
men jump smartly at the first order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; and verily believed
that this would be a fine performance.&nbsp; We dashed on through
the fleet in magnificent style.&nbsp; There must have been many
open mouths and following eyes on board those ships&mdash;Dutch,
English, with a sprinkling of Americans and a German or
two&mdash;who had all hoisted their flags at eight o&rsquo;clock
as if in honour of our arrival.&nbsp; It would have been a fine
performance if it had come off, but it did not.&nbsp; Through a
touch of self-seeking that modest artist of solid merit became
untrue to his temperament.&nbsp; It was not with him art for
art&rsquo;s sake: it was art for his own sake; and a dismal
failure was the penalty he paid for that greatest of sins.&nbsp;
It might have been even heavier, but, as it happened, we did not
run our ship ashore, nor did we knock a large hole in the big
ship whose lower masts were painted white.&nbsp; But it is a
wonder that we did not carry away the cables of both our anchors,
for, as may be imagined, I did not stand upon the order to
&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; that came to me in a quavering, quite
unknown voice from his trembling lips.&nbsp; I let them both go
with a celerity which to this day astonishes my memory.&nbsp; No
average merchantman&rsquo;s anchors have ever been let go with
such miraculous smartness.&nbsp; And they both held.&nbsp; I <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>could have
kissed their rough, cold iron palms in gratitude if they had not
been buried in slimy mud under ten fathoms of water.&nbsp;
Ultimately they brought us up with the jibboom of a Dutch brig
poking through our spanker&mdash;nothing worse.&nbsp; And a miss
is as good as a mile.</p>
<p>But not in art.&nbsp; Afterwards the master said to me in a
shy mumble, &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t luff up in time,
somehow.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
I made no answer.</p>
<p>Yet the answer was clear.&nbsp; The ship had found out the
momentary weakness of her man.&nbsp; Of all the living creatures
upon land and sea, it is ships alone that cannot be taken in by
barren pretences, that will not put up with bad art from their
masters.</p>
<h2>X.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the main truck of the average
tall ship the horizon describes a circle of many miles, in which
you can see another ship right down to her water-line; and these
very eyes which follow this writing have counted in their time
over a hundred sail becalmed, as if within a magic ring, not very
far from the Azores&mdash;ships more or less tall.&nbsp; There
were hardly two of them heading exactly the same way, as if each
had meditated breaking out of the enchanted circle at a different
point of the compass.&nbsp; But the spell of the calm is a strong
magic.&nbsp; The following day still saw them scattered within
sight of each other and heading different ways; but when, at
last, the breeze came with the darkling ripple that ran very blue
on a pale sea, they all went in the same direction
together.&nbsp; For this was the homeward-bound fleet from the
far-off ends of the earth, and a Falmouth fruit-schooner, the
smallest of them all, was heading the flight.&nbsp; One could
have imagined her very fair, if not divinely tall, leaving a
scent of lemons and oranges in her wake.</p>
<p>The next day there were very few ships in sight from our
mast-heads&mdash;seven at most, perhaps, with a few more distant
specks, hull down, beyond the magic ring of the horizon.&nbsp;
The spell of the fair wind has a subtle power to scatter a
white-winged company of ships looking all the same way, each with
its white fillet of tumbling foam under the bow.&nbsp; It is the
calm that brings ships mysteriously together; it is your wind
that is the great separator.</p>
<p>The taller the ship, the further she can be seen; and her
white tallness breathed upon by the wind first proclaims her
size.&nbsp; The tall masts holding aloft the white canvas, spread
out like a snare for catching the invisible power of the air,
emerge gradually from the water, sail after sail, yard after
yard, growing big, till, under the towering structure of her
machinery, you perceive the insignificant, tiny speck of her
hull.</p>
<p>The tall masts are the pillars supporting the balanced planes
that, motionless and silent, catch from the air the ship&rsquo;s
motive-power, as it were a gift from Heaven vouchsafed to the
audacity of man; and it is the ship&rsquo;s tall spars, stripped
and shorn of their white glory, that incline themselves before
the anger of the clouded heaven.</p>
<p>When they yield to a squall in a gaunt and naked submission,
their tallness is brought best home even to the mind of a
seaman.&nbsp; The man who has looked upon his ship going over too
far is made aware of the preposterous tallness of a ship&rsquo;s
spars.&nbsp; It seems impossible but that those gilt trucks which
one had to tilt one&rsquo;s head back to see, now falling into
the lower plane of vision, must perforce hit the very edge of the
horizon.&nbsp; Such an experience gives you a better impression
of the loftiness of your spars than any amount of running aloft
could do.&nbsp; And yet in my time the royal yards of an average
profitable ship were a good way up above her decks.</p>
<p>No doubt a fair amount of climbing up iron ladders can be
achieved by an active man in a ship&rsquo;s engine-room, but I
remember moments when even to my supple limbs and pride of
nimbleness the sailing-ship&rsquo;s machinery seemed to reach up
to the very stars.</p>
<p>For machinery it is, doing its work in perfect silence and
with a motionless grace, that seems to hide a capricious and not
always governable power, taking nothing away from the material
stores of the earth.&nbsp; Not for it the unerring precision of
steel moved by white steam and living by red fire and fed with
black coal.&nbsp; The other seems to draw its strength from the
very soul of the world, its formidable ally, held to obedience by
the frailest bonds, like a fierce ghost captured in a snare of
something even finer than spun silk.&nbsp; For what is the array
of the strongest ropes, the tallest spars and the stoutest canvas
against the mighty breath of the infinite, but thistle stalks,
cobwebs and gossamer?</p>
<h2>XI.</h2>
<p>Indeed, it is less than nothing, and I have seen, when the
great soul of the world turned over with a heavy sigh, a
perfectly new, extra-stout foresail vanish like a bit of some
airy stuff much lighter than gossamer.&nbsp; Then was the time
for the tall spars to stand fast in the great uproar.&nbsp; The
machinery must do its work even if the soul of the world has gone
mad.</p>
<p>The modern steamship advances upon a still and overshadowed
sea with a pulsating tremor of her frame, an occasional clang in
her depths, as if she had an iron heart in her iron body; with a
thudding rhythm in her progress and the regular beat of her
propeller, heard afar in the night with an august and plodding
sound as of the march of an inevitable future.&nbsp; But in a
gale, the silent machinery of a sailing-ship would catch not only
the power, but the wild and exulting voice of the world&rsquo;s
soul.&nbsp; Whether she ran with her tall spars swinging, or
breasted it with her tall spars lying over, there was always that
wild song, deep like a chant, for a bass to the shrill pipe of
the wind played on the sea-tops, with a punctuating crash, now
and then, of a breaking wave.&nbsp; At times the weird effects of
that invisible orchestra would get upon a man&rsquo;s nerves till
he wished himself deaf.</p>
<p>And this recollection of a personal wish, experienced upon
several oceans, where the soul of the world has plenty of room to
turn over with a mighty sigh, brings me to the remark that in
order to take a proper care of a ship&rsquo;s spars it is just as
well for a seaman to have nothing the matter with his ears.&nbsp;
Such is the intimacy with which a seaman had to live with his
ship of yesterday that his senses were like her senses, that the
stress upon his body made him judge of the strain upon the
ship&rsquo;s masts.</p>
<p>I had been some time at sea before I became aware of the fact
that hearing plays a perceptible part in gauging the force of the
wind.&nbsp; It was at night.&nbsp; The ship was one of those iron
wool-clippers that the Clyde had floated out in swarms upon the
world during the seventh decade of the last century.&nbsp; It was
a fine period in ship-building, and also, I might say, a period
of over-masting.&nbsp; The spars rigged up on the narrow hulls
were indeed tall then, and the ship of which I think, with her
coloured-glass skylight ends bearing the motto, &ldquo;Let
Glasgow Flourish,&rdquo; was certainly one of the most
heavily-sparred specimens.&nbsp; She was built for hard driving,
and unquestionably she got all the driving she could stand.&nbsp;
Our captain was a man famous for the quick passages he had been
used to make in the old <i>Tweed</i>, a ship famous the world
over for her speed.&nbsp; The <i>Tweed</i> had been a wooden
vessel, and he brought the tradition of quick passages with him
into the iron clipper.&nbsp; I was the junior in her, a third
mate, keeping watch with the chief officer; and it was just
during one of the night watches in a strong, freshening breeze
that I overheard two men in a sheltered nook of the main deck
exchanging these informing remarks.&nbsp; Said one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should think &rsquo;twas time some of them light sails
were coming off her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the other, an older man, uttered grumpily: &ldquo;No fear!
not while the chief mate&rsquo;s on deck.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s that
deaf he can&rsquo;t tell how much wind there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, indeed, poor P&mdash;, quite young, and a smart seaman,
was very hard of hearing.&nbsp; At the same time, he had the name
of being the very devil of a fellow for carrying on sail on a
ship.&nbsp; He was wonderfully clever at concealing his deafness,
and, as to carrying on heavily, though he was a fearless man, I
don&rsquo;t think that he ever meant to take undue risks.&nbsp; I
can never forget his na&iuml;ve sort of astonishment when
remonstrated with for what appeared a most dare-devil
performance.&nbsp; The only person, of course, that could
remonstrate with telling effect was our captain, himself a man of
dare-devil tradition; and really, for me, who knew under whom I
was serving, those were impressive scenes.&nbsp; Captain S&mdash;
had a great name for sailor-like qualities&mdash;the sort of name
that compelled my youthful admiration.&nbsp; To this day I
preserve his memory, for, indeed, it was he in a sense who
completed my training.&nbsp; It was often a stormy process, but
let that pass.&nbsp; I am sure he meant well, and I am certain
that never, not even at the time, could I bear him malice for his
extraordinary gift of incisive criticism.&nbsp; And to hear
<i>him</i> make a fuss about too much sail on the ship seemed one
of those incredible experiences that take place only in
one&rsquo;s dreams.</p>
<p>It generally happened in this way: Night, clouds racing
overhead, wind howling, royals set, and the ship rushing on in
the dark, an immense white sheet of foam level with the lee
rail.&nbsp; Mr. P&mdash;, in charge of the deck, hooked on to the
windward mizzen rigging in a state of perfect serenity; myself,
the third mate, also hooked on somewhere to windward of the
slanting poop, in a state of the utmost preparedness to jump at
the very first hint of some sort of order, but otherwise in a
perfectly acquiescent state of mind.&nbsp; Suddenly, out of the
companion would appear a tall, dark figure, bareheaded, with a
short white beard of a perpendicular cut, very visible in the
dark&mdash;Captain S&mdash;, disturbed in his reading down below
by the frightful bounding and lurching of the ship.&nbsp; Leaning
very much against the precipitous incline of the deck, he would
take a turn or two, perfectly silent, hang on by the compass for
a while, take another couple of turns, and suddenly burst
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you trying to do with the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mr. P&mdash;, who was not good at catching what was
shouted in the wind, would say interrogatively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in the increasing gale of the sea there would be a little
private ship&rsquo;s storm going on in which you could detect
strong language, pronounced in a tone of passion and exculpatory
protestations uttered with every possible inflection of injured
innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heavens, Mr. P-!&nbsp; I used to carry on sail in my
time, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the rest would be lost to me in a stormy gust of wind.</p>
<p>Then, in a lull, P&mdash;&rsquo;s protesting innocence would
become audible:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to stand it very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then another burst of an indignant voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any fool can carry sail on a ship&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on and so on, the ship meanwhile rushing on her way
with a heavier list, a noisier splutter, a more threatening hiss
of the white, almost blinding, sheet of foam to leeward.&nbsp;
For the best of it was that Captain S&mdash; seemed
constitutionally incapable of giving his officers a definite
order to shorten sail; and so that extraordinarily vague row
would go on till at last it dawned upon them both, in some
particularly alarming gust, that it was time to do
something.&nbsp; There is nothing like the fearful inclination of
your tall spars overloaded with canvas to bring a deaf man and an
angry one to their senses.</p>
<h2>XII.</h2>
<p>So sail did get shortened more or less in time even in that
ship, and her tall spars never went overboard while I served in
her.&nbsp; However, all the time I was with them, Captain
S&mdash; and Mr. P&mdash; did not get on very well
together.&nbsp; If P&mdash; carried on &ldquo;like the very
devil&rdquo; because he was too deaf to know how much wind there
was, Captain S&mdash; (who, as I have said, seemed
constitutionally incapable of ordering one of his officers to
shorten sail) resented the necessity forced upon him by Mr.
P&mdash;&rsquo;s desperate goings on.&nbsp; It was in Captain
S&mdash;&rsquo;s tradition rather to reprove his officers for not
carrying on quite enough&mdash;in his phrase &ldquo;for not
taking every ounce of advantage of a fair wind.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
there was also a psychological motive that made him extremely
difficult to deal with on board that iron clipper.&nbsp; He had
just come out of the marvellous <i>Tweed</i>, a ship, I have
heard, heavy to look at but of phenomenal speed.&nbsp; In the
middle sixties she had beaten by a day and a half the steam
mail-boat from Hong Kong to Singapore.&nbsp; There was something
peculiarly lucky, perhaps, in the placing of her masts&mdash;who
knows?&nbsp; Officers of men-of-war used to come on board to take
the exact dimensions of her sail-plan.&nbsp; Perhaps there had
been a touch of genius or the finger of good fortune in the
fashioning of her lines at bow and stern.&nbsp; It is impossible
to say.&nbsp; She was built in the East Indies somewhere, of
teak-wood throughout, except the deck.&nbsp; She had a great
sheer, high bows, and a clumsy stern.&nbsp; The men who had seen
her described her to me as &ldquo;nothing much to look
at.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in the great Indian famine of the seventies
that ship, already old then, made some wonderful dashes across
the Gulf of Bengal with cargoes of rice from Rangoon to
Madras.</p>
<p>She took the secret of her speed with her, and, unsightly as
she was, her image surely has its glorious place in the mirror of
the old sea.</p>
<p>The point, however, is that Captain S&mdash;, who used to say
frequently, &ldquo;She never made a decent passage after I left
her,&rdquo; seemed to think that the secret of her speed lay in
her famous commander.&nbsp; No doubt the secret of many a
ship&rsquo;s excellence does lie with the man on board, but it
was hopeless for Captain S&mdash; to try to make his new iron
clipper equal the feats which made the old <i>Tweed</i> a name of
praise upon the lips of English-speaking seamen.&nbsp; There was
something pathetic in it, as in the endeavour of an artist in his
old age to equal the masterpieces of his youth&mdash;for the
<i>Tweed&rsquo;s</i> famous passages were Captain
S&mdash;&rsquo;s masterpieces.&nbsp; It was pathetic, and perhaps
just the least bit dangerous.&nbsp; At any rate, I am glad that,
what between Captain S&mdash;&rsquo;s yearning for old triumphs
and Mr. P&mdash;&rsquo;s deafness, I have seen some memorable
carrying on to make a passage.&nbsp; And I have carried on myself
upon the tall spars of that Clyde shipbuilder&rsquo;s masterpiece
as I have never carried on in a ship before or since.</p>
<p>The second mate falling ill during the passage, I was promoted
to officer of the watch, alone in charge of the deck.&nbsp; Thus
the immense leverage of the ship&rsquo;s tall masts became a
matter very near my own heart.&nbsp; I suppose it was something
of a compliment for a young fellow to be trusted, apparently
without any supervision, by such a commander as Captain S&mdash;;
though, as far as I can remember, neither the tone, nor the
manner, nor yet the drift of Captain S&mdash;&rsquo;s remarks
addressed to myself did ever, by the most strained
interpretation, imply a favourable opinion of my abilities.&nbsp;
And he was, I must say, a most uncomfortable commander to get
your orders from at night.&nbsp; If I had the watch from eight
till midnight, he would leave the deck about nine with the words,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take any sail off her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, on
the point of disappearing down the companion-way, he would add
curtly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t carry anything away.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am
glad to say that I never did; one night, however, I was caught,
not quite prepared, by a sudden shift of wind.</p>
<p>There was, of course, a good deal of noise&mdash;running
about, the shouts of the sailors, the thrashing of the
sails&mdash;enough, in fact, to wake the dead.&nbsp; But S&mdash;
never came on deck.&nbsp; When I was relieved by the chief mate
an hour afterwards, he sent for me.&nbsp; I went into his
state-room; he was lying on his couch wrapped up in a rug, with a
pillow under his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the matter with you up there just now?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind flew round on the lee quarter, sir,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you see the shift coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I thought it wasn&rsquo;t very far
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you have your courses hauled up at
once, then?&rdquo; he asked in a tone that ought to have made my
blood run cold.</p>
<p>But this was my chance, and I did not let it slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; I said in an apologetic tone,
&ldquo;she was going eleven knots very nicely, and I thought she
would do for another half-hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed at me darkly out of his head, lying very still on the
white pillow, for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, another half-hour.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way
ships get dismasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all I got in the way of a wigging.&nbsp; I waited
a little while and then went out, shutting carefully the door of
the state-room after me.</p>
<p>Well, I have loved, lived with, and left the sea without ever
seeing a ship&rsquo;s tall fabric of sticks, cobwebs and gossamer
go by the board.&nbsp; Sheer good luck, no doubt.&nbsp; But as to
poor P&mdash;, I am sure that he would not have got off scot-free
like this but for the god of gales, who called him away early
from this earth, which is three parts ocean, and therefore a fit
abode for sailors.&nbsp; A few years afterwards I met in an
Indian port a man who had served in the ships of the same
company.&nbsp; Names came up in our talk, names of our colleagues
in the same employ, and, naturally enough, I asked after
P&mdash;.&nbsp; Had he got a command yet?&nbsp; And the other man
answered carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but he&rsquo;s provided for, anyhow.&nbsp; A heavy
sea took him off the poop in the run between New Zealand and the
Horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus P&mdash; passed away from amongst the tall spars of ships
that he had tried to their utmost in many a spell of boisterous
weather.&nbsp; He had shown me what carrying on meant, but he was
not a man to learn discretion from.&nbsp; He could not help his
deafness.&nbsp; One can only remember his cheery temper, his
admiration for the jokes in <i>Punch</i>, his little
oddities&mdash;like his strange passion for borrowing
looking-glasses, for instance.&nbsp; Each of our cabins had its
own looking-glass screwed to the bulkhead, and what he wanted
with more of them we never could fathom.&nbsp; He asked for the
loan in confidential tones.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Mystery.&nbsp; We
made various surmises.&nbsp; No one will ever know now.&nbsp; At
any rate, it was a harmless eccentricity, and may the god of
gales, who took him away so abruptly between New Zealand and the
Horn, let his soul rest in some Paradise of true seamen, where no
amount of carrying on will ever dismast a ship!</p>
<h2><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>XIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> has been a time when a
ship&rsquo;s chief mate, pocket-book in hand and pencil behind
his ear, kept one eye aloft upon his riggers and the other down
the hatchway on the stevedores, and watched the disposition of
his ship&rsquo;s cargo, knowing that even before she started he
was already doing his best to secure for her an easy and quick
passage.</p>
<p>The hurry of the times, the loading and discharging
organization of the docks, the use of hoisting machinery which
works quickly and will not wait, the cry for prompt despatch, the
very size of his ship, stand nowadays between the modern seaman
and the thorough knowledge of his craft.</p>
<p>There are profitable ships and unprofitable ships.&nbsp; The
profitable ship will carry a large load through all the hazards
of the weather, and, when at rest, will stand up in dock and
shift from berth to berth without ballast.&nbsp; There is a point
of perfection in a ship as a worker when she is spoken of as
being able to <i>sail</i> without ballast.&nbsp; I have never met
that sort of paragon myself, but I have seen these paragons
advertised amongst ships for sale.&nbsp; Such excess of virtue
and good-nature on the part of a ship always provoked my
mistrust.&nbsp; It is open to any man to say that his ship will
sail without ballast; and he will say it, too, with every mark of
profound conviction, especially if he is not going to sail in her
himself.&nbsp; The risk of advertising her as able to sail
without ballast is not great, since the statement does not imply
a warranty of her arriving anywhere.&nbsp; Moreover, it is
strictly true that most ships will sail without ballast for some
little time before they turn turtle upon the crew.</p>
<p>A shipowner loves a profitable ship; the seaman is proud of
her; a doubt of her good looks seldom exists in his mind; but if
he can boast of her more useful qualities it is an added
satisfaction for his self-love.</p>
<p>The loading of ships was once a matter of skill, judgment, and
knowledge.&nbsp; Thick books have been written about it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stevens on Stowage&rdquo; is a portly volume with the
renown and weight (in its own world) of Coke on Littleton.&nbsp;
Stevens is an agreeable writer, and, as is the case with men of
talent, his gifts adorn his sterling soundness.&nbsp; He gives
you the official teaching on the whole subject, is precise as to
rules, mentions illustrative events, quotes law cases where
verdicts turned upon a point of stowage.&nbsp; He is never
pedantic, and, for all his close adherence to broad principles,
he is ready to admit that no two ships can be treated exactly
alike.</p>
<p>Stevedoring, which had been a skilled labour, is fast becoming
a labour without the skill.&nbsp; The modern steamship with her
many holds is not loaded within the sailor-like meaning of the
word.&nbsp; She is filled up.&nbsp; Her cargo is not stowed in
any sense; it is simply dumped into her through six hatchways,
more or less, by twelve winches or so, with clatter and hurry and
racket and heat, in a cloud of steam and a mess of
coal-dust.&nbsp; As long as you keep her propeller under water
and take care, say, not to fling down barrels of oil on top of
bales of silk, or deposit an iron bridge-girder of five ton or so
upon a bed of coffee-bags, you have done about all in the way of
duty that the cry for prompt despatch will allow you to do.</p>
<h2>XIV.</h2>
<p>The sailing-ship, when I knew her in her days of perfection,
was a sensible creature.&nbsp; When I say her days of perfection,
I mean perfection of build, gear, seaworthy qualities and ease of
handling, not the perfection of speed.&nbsp; That quality has
departed with the change of building material.&nbsp; No iron ship
of yesterday ever attained the marvels of speed which the
seamanship of men famous in their time had obtained from their
wooden, copper-sheeted predecessors.&nbsp; Everything had been
done to make the iron ship perfect, but no wit of man had managed
to devise an efficient coating composition to keep her bottom
clean with the smooth cleanness of yellow metal sheeting.&nbsp;
After a spell of a few weeks at sea, an iron ship begins to lag
as if she had grown tired too soon.&nbsp; It is only her bottom
that is getting foul.&nbsp; A very little affects the speed of an
iron ship which is not driven on by a merciless propeller.&nbsp;
Often it is impossible to tell what inconsiderate trifle puts her
off her stride.&nbsp; A certain mysteriousness hangs around the
quality of speed as it was displayed by the old sailing-ships
commanded by a competent seaman.&nbsp; In those days the speed
depended upon the seaman; therefore, apart from the laws, rules,
and regulations for the good preservation of his cargo, he was
careful of his loading,&mdash;or what is technically called the
trim of his ship.&nbsp; Some ships sailed fast on an even keel,
others had to be trimmed quite one foot by the stern, and I have
heard of a ship that gave her best speed on a wind when so loaded
as to float a couple of inches by the head.</p>
<p>I call to mind a winter landscape in Amsterdam&mdash;a flat
foreground of waste land, with here and there stacks of timber,
like the huts of a camp of some very miserable tribe; the long
stretch of the Handelskade; cold, stone-faced quays, with the
snow-sprinkled ground and the hard, frozen water of the canal, in
which were set ships one behind another with their frosty
mooring-ropes hanging slack and their decks idle and deserted,
because, as the master stevedore (a gentle, pale person, with a
few golden hairs on his chin and a reddened nose) informed me,
their cargoes were frozen-in up-country on barges and
schuyts.&nbsp; In the distance, beyond the waste ground, and
running parallel with the line of ships, a line of brown,
warm-toned houses seemed bowed under snow-laden roofs.&nbsp; From
afar at the end of Tsar Peter Straat, issued in the frosty air
the tinkle of bells of the horse tramcars, appearing and
disappearing in the opening between the buildings, like little
toy carriages harnessed with toy horses and played with by people
that appeared no bigger than children.</p>
<p>I was, as the French say, biting my fists with impatience for
that cargo frozen up-country; with rage at that canal set fast,
at the wintry and deserted aspect of all those ships that seemed
to decay in grim depression for want of the open water.&nbsp; I
was chief mate, and very much alone.&nbsp; Directly I had joined
I received from my owners instructions to send all the
ship&rsquo;s apprentices away on leave together, because in such
weather there was nothing for anybody to do, unless to keep up a
fire in the cabin stove.&nbsp; That was attended to by a snuffy
and mop-headed, inconceivably dirty, and weirdly toothless Dutch
ship-keeper, who could hardly speak three words of English, but
who must have had some considerable knowledge of the language,
since he managed invariably to interpret in the contrary sense
everything that was said to him.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the little iron stove, the ink froze on the
swing-table in the cabin, and I found it more convenient to go
ashore stumbling over the arctic waste-land and shivering in
glazed tramcars in order to write my evening letter to my owners
in a gorgeous caf&eacute; in the centre of the town.&nbsp; It was
an immense place, lofty and gilt, upholstered in red plush, full
of electric lights and so thoroughly warmed that even the marble
tables felt tepid to the touch.&nbsp; The waiter who brought me
my cup of coffee bore, by comparison with my utter isolation, the
dear aspect of an intimate friend.&nbsp; There, alone in a noisy
crowd, I would write slowly a letter addressed to Glasgow, of
which the gist would be: There is no cargo, and no prospect of
any coming till late spring apparently.&nbsp; And all the time I
sat there the necessity of getting back to the ship bore heavily
on my already half-congealed spirits&mdash;the shivering in
glazed tramcars, the stumbling over the snow-sprinkled waste
ground, the vision of ships frozen in a row, appearing vaguely
like corpses of black vessels in a white world, so silent, so
lifeless, so soulless they seemed to be.</p>
<p>With precaution I would go up the side of my own particular
corpse, and would feel her as cold as ice itself and as slippery
under my feet.&nbsp; My cold berth would swallow up like a chilly
burial niche my bodily shivers and my mental excitement.&nbsp; It
was a cruel winter.&nbsp; The very air seemed as hard and
trenchant as steel; but it would have taken much more than this
to extinguish my sacred fire for the exercise of my craft.&nbsp;
No young man of twenty-four appointed chief mate for the first
time in his life would have let that Dutch tenacious winter
penetrate into his heart.&nbsp; I think that in those days I
never forgot the fact of my elevation for five consecutive
minutes.&nbsp; I fancy it kept me warm, even in my slumbers,
better than the high pile of blankets, which positively crackled
with frost as I threw them off in the morning.&nbsp; And I would
get up early for no reason whatever except that I was in sole
charge.&nbsp; The new captain had not been appointed yet.</p>
<p>Almost each morning a letter from my owners would arrive,
directing me to go to the charterers and clamour for the
ship&rsquo;s cargo; to threaten them with the heaviest penalties
of demurrage; to demand that this assortment of varied
merchandise, set fast in a landscape of ice and windmills
somewhere up-country, should be put on rail instantly, and fed up
to the ship in regular quantities every day.&nbsp; After drinking
some hot coffee, like an Arctic explorer setting off on a sledge
journey towards the North Pole, I would go ashore and roll
shivering in a tramcar into the very heart of the town, past
clean-faced houses, past thousands of brass knockers upon a
thousand painted doors glimmering behind rows of trees of the
pavement species, leafless, gaunt, seemingly dead for ever.</p>
<p>That part of the expedition was easy enough, though the horses
were painfully glistening with icicles, and the aspect of the
tram-conductors&rsquo; faces presented a repulsive blending of
crimson and purple.&nbsp; But as to frightening or bullying, or
even wheedling some sort of answer out of Mr. Hudig, that was
another matter altogether.&nbsp; He was a big, swarthy
Netherlander, with black moustaches and a bold glance.&nbsp; He
always began by shoving me into a chair before I had time to open
my mouth, gave me cordially a large cigar, and in excellent
English would start to talk everlastingly about the phenomenal
severity of the weather.&nbsp; It was impossible to threaten a
man who, though he possessed the language perfectly, seemed
incapable of understanding any phrase pronounced in a tone of
remonstrance or discontent.&nbsp; As to quarrelling with him, it
would have been stupid.&nbsp; The weather was too bitter for
that.&nbsp; His office was so warm, his fire so bright, his sides
shook so heartily with laughter, that I experienced always a
great difficulty in making up my mind to reach for my hat.</p>
<p>At last the cargo did come.&nbsp; At first it came dribbling
in by rail in trucks, till the thaw set in; and then fast, in a
multitude of barges, with a great rush of unbound waters.&nbsp;
The gentle master stevedore had his hands very full at last; and
the chief mate became worried in his mind as to the proper
distribution of the weight of his first cargo in a ship he did
not personally know before.</p>
<p>Ships do want humouring.&nbsp; They want humouring in
handling; and if you mean to handle them well, they must have
been humoured in the distribution of the weight which you ask
them to carry through the good and evil fortune of a
passage.&nbsp; Your ship is a tender creature, whose
idiosyncrasies must be attended to if you mean her to come with
credit to herself and you through the rough-and-tumble of her
life.</p>
<h2>XV.</h2>
<p>So seemed to think the new captain, who arrived the day after
we had finished loading, on the very eve of the day of
sailing.&nbsp; I first beheld him on the quay, a complete
stranger to me, obviously not a Hollander, in a black bowler and
a short drab overcoat, ridiculously out of tone with the winter
aspect of the waste-lands, bordered by the brown fronts of houses
with their roofs dripping with melting snow.</p>
<p>This stranger was walking up and down absorbed in the marked
contemplation of the ship&rsquo;s fore and aft trim; but when I
saw him squat on his heels in the slush at the very edge of the
quay to peer at the draught of water under her counter, I said to
myself, &ldquo;This is the captain.&rdquo;&nbsp; And presently I
descried his luggage coming along&mdash;a real sailor&rsquo;s
chest, carried by means of rope-beckets between two men, with a
couple of leather portmanteaus and a roll of charts sheeted in
canvas piled upon the lid.&nbsp; The sudden, spontaneous agility
with which he bounded aboard right off the rail afforded me the
first glimpse of his real character.&nbsp; Without further
preliminaries than a friendly nod, he addressed me: &ldquo;You
have got her pretty well in her fore and aft trim.&nbsp; Now,
what about your weights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him I had managed to keep the weight sufficiently well
up, as I thought, one-third of the whole being in the upper part
&ldquo;above the beams,&rdquo; as the technical expression has
it.&nbsp; He whistled &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; scrutinizing me from
head to foot.&nbsp; A sort of smiling vexation was visible on his
ruddy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall have a lively time of it this passage, I
bet,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He knew.&nbsp; It turned out he had been chief mate of her for
the two preceding voyages; and I was already familiar with his
handwriting in the old log-books I had been perusing in my cabin
with a natural curiosity, looking up the records of my new
ship&rsquo;s luck, of her behaviour, of the good times she had
had, and of the troubles she had escaped.</p>
<p>He was right in his prophecy.&nbsp; On our passage from
Amsterdam to Samarang with a general cargo, of which, alas! only
one-third in weight was stowed &ldquo;above the beams,&rdquo; we
had a lively time of it.&nbsp; It was lively, but not
joyful.&nbsp; There was not even a single moment of comfort in
it, because no seaman can feel comfortable in body or mind when
he has made his ship uneasy.</p>
<p>To travel along with a cranky ship for ninety days or so is no
doubt a nerve-trying experience; but in this case what was wrong
with our craft was this: that by my system of loading she had
been made much too stable.</p>
<p>Neither before nor since have I felt a ship roll so abruptly,
so violently, so heavily.&nbsp; Once she began, you felt that she
would never stop, and this hopeless sensation, characterizing the
motion of ships whose centre of gravity is brought down too low
in loading, made everyone on board weary of keeping on his
feet.&nbsp; I remember once over-hearing one of the hands say:
&ldquo;By Heavens, Jack!&nbsp; I feel as if I didn&rsquo;t mind
how soon I let myself go, and let the blamed hooker knock my
brains out if she likes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The captain used to remark
frequently: &ldquo;Ah, yes; I dare say one-third weight above
beams would have been quite enough for most ships.&nbsp; But
then, you see, there&rsquo;s no two of them alike on the seas,
and she&rsquo;s an uncommonly ticklish jade to load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down south, running before the gales of high latitudes, she
made our life a burden to us.&nbsp; There were days when nothing
would keep even on the swing-tables, when there was no position
where you could fix yourself so as not to feel a constant strain
upon all the muscles of your body.&nbsp; She rolled and rolled
with an awful dislodging jerk and that dizzily fast sweep of her
masts on every swing.&nbsp; It was a wonder that the men sent
aloft were not flung off the yards, the yards not flung off the
masts, the masts not flung overboard.&nbsp; The captain in his
armchair, holding on grimly at the head of the table, with the
soup-tureen rolling on one side of the cabin and the steward
sprawling on the other, would observe, looking at me:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your one-third above the beams.&nbsp; The
only thing that surprises me is that the sticks have stuck to her
all this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ultimately some of the minor spars did go&mdash;nothing
important: spanker-booms and such-like&mdash;because at times the
frightful impetus of her rolling would part a fourfold tackle of
new three-inch Manilla line as if it were weaker than
pack-thread.</p>
<p>It was only poetic justice that the chief mate who had made a
mistake&mdash;perhaps a half-excusable one&mdash;about the
distribution of his ship&rsquo;s cargo should pay the
penalty.&nbsp; A piece of one of the minor spars that did carry
away flew against the chief mate&rsquo;s back, and sent him
sliding on his face for quite a considerable distance along the
main deck.&nbsp; Thereupon followed various and unpleasant
consequences of a physical order&mdash;&ldquo;queer
symptoms,&rdquo; as the captain, who treated them, used to say;
inexplicable periods of powerlessness, sudden accesses of
mysterious pain; and the patient agreed fully with the regretful
mutters of his very attentive captain wishing that it had been a
straightforward broken leg.&nbsp; Even the Dutch doctor who took
the case up in Samarang offered no scientific explanation.&nbsp;
All he said was: &ldquo;Ah, friend, you are young yet; it may be
very serious for your whole life.&nbsp; You must leave your ship;
you must quite silent be for three months&mdash;quite
silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, he meant the chief mate to keep quiet&mdash;to lay
up, as a matter of fact.&nbsp; His manner was impressive enough,
if his English was childishly imperfect when compared with the
fluency of Mr. Hudig, the figure at the other end of that
passage, and memorable enough in its way.&nbsp; In a great airy
ward of a Far Eastern hospital, lying on my back, I had plenty of
leisure to remember the dreadful cold and snow of Amsterdam,
while looking at the fronds of the palm-trees tossing and
rustling at the height of the window.&nbsp; I could remember the
elated feeling and the soul-gripping cold of those tramway
journeys taken into town to put what in diplomatic language is
called pressure upon the good Hudig, with his warm fire, his
armchair, his big cigar, and the never-failing suggestion in his
good-natured voice: &ldquo;I suppose in the end it is you they
will appoint captain before the ship sails?&rdquo;&nbsp; It may
have been his extreme good-nature, the serious, unsmiling
good-nature of a fat, swarthy man with coal-black moustache and
steady eyes; but he might have been a bit of a diplomatist,
too.&nbsp; His enticing suggestions I used to repel modestly by
the assurance that it was extremely unlikely, as I had not enough
experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know very well how to go about
business matters,&rdquo; he used to say, with a sort of affected
moodiness clouding his serene round face.&nbsp; I wonder whether
he ever laughed to himself after I had left the office.&nbsp; I
dare say he never did, because I understand that diplomatists, in
and out of the career, take themselves and their tricks with an
exemplary seriousness.</p>
<p>But he had nearly persuaded me that I was fit in every way to
be trusted with a command.&nbsp; There came three months of
mental worry, hard rolling, remorse, and physical pain to drive
home the lesson of insufficient experience.</p>
<p>Yes, your ship wants to be humoured with knowledge.&nbsp; You
must treat with an understanding consideration the mysteries of
her feminine nature, and then she will stand by you faithfully in
the unceasing struggle with forces wherein defeat is no
shame.&nbsp; It is a serious relation, that in which a man stands
to his ship.&nbsp; She has her <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>rights as though she could breathe
and speak; and, indeed, there are ships that, for the right man,
will do anything but speak, as the saying goes.</p>
<p>A ship is not a slave.&nbsp; You must make her easy in a
seaway, you must never forget that you owe her the fullest share
of your thought, of your skill, of your self-love.&nbsp; If you
remember that obligation, naturally and without effort, as if it
were an instinctive feeling of your inner life, she will sail,
stay, run for you as long as she is able, or, like a sea-bird
going to rest upon the angry waves, she will lay out the heaviest
gale that ever made you doubt living long enough to see another
sunrise.</p>
<h2>XVI.</h2>
<p>Often I turn with melancholy eagerness to the space reserved
in the newspapers under the general heading of &ldquo;Shipping
Intelligence.&rdquo;&nbsp; I meet there the names of ships I have
known.&nbsp; Every year some of these names disappear&mdash;the
names of old friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tempi passati!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The different divisions of that kind of news are set down in
their order, which varies but slightly in its arrangement of
concise headlines.&nbsp; And first comes
&ldquo;Speakings&rdquo;&mdash;reports of ships met and signalled
at sea, name, port, where from, where bound for, so many days
out, ending frequently with the words &ldquo;All
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then come &ldquo;Wrecks and
Casualties&rdquo;&mdash;a longish array of paragraphs, unless the
weather has been fair and clear, and friendly to ships all over
the world.</p>
<p>On some days there appears the heading
&ldquo;Overdue&rdquo;&mdash;an ominous threat of loss and sorrow
trembling yet in the balance of fate.&nbsp; There is something
sinister to a seaman in the very grouping of the letters which
form this word, clear in its meaning, and seldom threatening in
vain.</p>
<p>Only a very few days more&mdash;appallingly few to the hearts
which had set themselves bravely to hope against hope&mdash;three
weeks, a month later, perhaps, the name of ships under the blight
of the &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; heading shall appear again in the
column of &ldquo;Shipping Intelligence,&rdquo; but under the
final declaration of &ldquo;Missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship, or barque, or brig So-and-so, bound from such
a port, with such and such cargo, for such another port, having
left at such and such a date, last spoken at sea on such a day,
and never having been heard of since, was posted to-day as
missing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such in its strictly official eloquence is
the form of funeral orations on ships that, perhaps wearied with
a long struggle, or in some unguarded moment that may come to the
readiest of us, had let themselves be overwhelmed by a sudden
blow from the enemy.</p>
<p>Who can say?&nbsp; Perhaps the men she carried had asked her
to do too much, had stretched beyond breaking-point the enduring
faithfulness which seems wrought and hammered into that
assemblage of iron ribs and plating, of wood and steel and canvas
and wire, which goes to the making of a ship&mdash;a complete
creation endowed with character, individuality, qualities and
defects, by men whose hands launch her upon the water, and that
other men shall learn to know with an intimacy surpassing the
intimacy of man with man, to love with a love nearly as great as
that of man for woman, and often as blind in its infatuated
disregard of defects.</p>
<p>There are ships which bear a bad name, but I have yet to meet
one whose crew for the time being failed to stand up angrily for
her against every criticism.&nbsp; One ship which I call to mind
now had the reputation of killing somebody every voyage she
made.&nbsp; This was no calumny, and yet I remember well,
somewhere far back in the late seventies, that the crew of that
ship were, if anything, rather proud of her evil fame, as if they
had been an utterly corrupt lot of desperadoes glorying in their
association with an atrocious creature.&nbsp; We, belonging to
other vessels moored all about the Circular Quay in Sydney, used
to shake our heads at her with a great sense of the unblemished
virtue of our own well-loved ships.</p>
<p>I shall not pronounce her name.&nbsp; She is
&ldquo;missing&rdquo; now, after a sinister but, from the point
of view of her owners, a useful career extending over many years,
and, I should say, across every ocean of our globe.&nbsp; Having
killed a man for every voyage, and perhaps rendered more
misanthropic by the infirmities that come with years upon a ship,
she had made up her mind to kill all hands at once before leaving
the scene of her exploits.&nbsp; A fitting end, this, to a life
of usefulness and crime&mdash;in a last outburst of an evil
passion supremely satisfied on some wild night, perhaps, to the
applauding clamour of wind and wave.</p>
<p>How did she do it?&nbsp; In the word &ldquo;missing&rdquo;
there is a horrible depth of doubt and speculation.&nbsp; Did she
go quickly from under the men&rsquo;s feet, or did she resist to
the end, letting the sea batter her to pieces, start her butts,
wrench her frame, load her with an increasing weight of salt
water, and, dismasted, unmanageable, rolling heavily, her boats
gone, her decks swept, had she wearied her men half to death with
the unceasing labour at the pumps before she sank with them like
a stone?</p>
<p>However, such a case must be rare.&nbsp; I imagine a raft of
some sort could always be contrived; and, even if it saved no
one, it would float on and be picked up, perhaps conveying some
hint of the vanished name.&nbsp; Then that ship would not be,
properly speaking, missing.&nbsp; She would be &ldquo;lost with
all hands,&rdquo; and in that distinction there is a subtle
difference&mdash;less horror and a less appalling darkness.</p>
<h2>XVII.</h2>
<p>The unholy fascination of dread dwells in the thought of the
last moments of a ship reported as &ldquo;missing&rdquo; in the
columns of the <i>Shipping Gazette</i>.&nbsp; Nothing of her ever
comes to light&mdash;no grating, no lifebuoy, no piece of boat or
branded oar&mdash;to give a hint of the place and date of her
sudden end.&nbsp; The <i>Shipping Gazette</i> does not even call
her &ldquo;lost with all hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; She remains simply
&ldquo;missing&rdquo;; she has disappeared enigmatically into a
mystery of fate as big as the world, where your imagination of a
brother-sailor, of a fellow-servant and lover of ships, may range
unchecked.</p>
<p>And yet sometimes one gets a hint of what the last scene may
be like in the life of a ship and her crew, which resembles a
drama in its struggle against a great force bearing it up,
formless, ungraspable, chaotic and mysterious, as fate.</p>
<p>It was on a gray afternoon in the lull of a three days&rsquo;
gale that had left the Southern Ocean tumbling heavily upon our
ship, under a sky hung with rags of clouds that seemed to have
been cut and hacked by the keen edge of a sou&rsquo;-west
gale.</p>
<p>Our craft, a Clyde-built barque of 1,000 tons, rolled so
heavily that something aloft had carried away.&nbsp; No matter
what the damage was, but it was serious enough to induce me to go
aloft myself with a couple of hands and the carpenter to see the
temporary repairs properly done.</p>
<p>Sometimes we had to drop everything and cling with both hands
to the swaying spars, holding our breath in fear of a terribly
heavy roll.&nbsp; And, wallowing as if she meant to turn over
with us, the barque, her decks full of water, her gear flying in
bights, ran at some ten knots an hour.&nbsp; We had been driven
far south&mdash;much farther that way than we had meant to go;
and suddenly, up there in the slings of the foreyard, in the
midst of our work, I felt my shoulder gripped with such force in
the carpenter&rsquo;s powerful paw that I positively yelled with
unexpected pain.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s eyes stared close in my
face, and he shouted, &ldquo;Look, sir! look!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
this?&rdquo; pointing ahead with his other hand.</p>
<p>At first I saw nothing.&nbsp; The sea was one empty wilderness
of black and white hills.&nbsp; Suddenly, half-concealed in the
tumult of the foaming rollers I made out awash, something
enormous, rising and falling&mdash;something spread out like a
burst of foam, but with a more bluish, more solid look.</p>
<p>It was a piece of an ice-floe melted down to a fragment, but
still big enough to sink a ship, and floating lower than any
raft, right in our way, as if ambushed among the waves with
murderous intent.&nbsp; There was no time to get down on
deck.&nbsp; I shouted from aloft till my head was ready to
split.&nbsp; I was heard aft, and we managed to clear the sunken
floe which had come all the way from the Southern ice-cap to have
a try at our unsuspecting lives.&nbsp; Had it been an hour later,
nothing could have saved the ship, for no eye could have made out
in the dusk that pale piece of ice swept over by the
white-crested waves.</p>
<p>And as we stood near the taffrail side by side, my captain and
I, looking at it, hardly discernible already, but still quite
close-to on our quarter, he remarked in a meditative tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for the turn of that wheel just in time, there
would have been another case of a &lsquo;missing&rsquo;
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody ever comes back from a &ldquo;missing&rdquo; ship to
tell how hard was the death of the craft, and how sudden and
overwhelming the last anguish of her men.&nbsp; Nobody can say
with what thoughts, with what regrets, with what words on their
lips they died.&nbsp; But there is something fine in the sudden
passing away of these hearts from the extremity of struggle and
stress and tremendous uproar&mdash;from the vast, unrestful rage
of the surface to the profound peace of the depths, sleeping
untroubled since the beginning of ages.</p>
<h2>XVIII.</h2>
<p>But if the word &ldquo;missing&rdquo; brings all hope to an
end and settles the loss of the underwriters, the word
&ldquo;overdue&rdquo; confirms the fears already born in many
homes ashore, and opens the door of speculation in the market of
risks.</p>
<p>Maritime risks, be it understood.&nbsp; There is a class of
optimists ready to reinsure an &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; ship at a
heavy premium.&nbsp; But nothing can insure the hearts on shore
against the bitterness of waiting for the worst.</p>
<p>For if a &ldquo;missing&rdquo; ship has never turned up within
the memory of seamen of my generation, the name of an
&ldquo;overdue&rdquo; ship, trembling as it were on the edge of
the fatal heading, has been known to appear as
&ldquo;arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must blaze up, indeed, with a great brilliance the dull
printer&rsquo;s ink expended on the assemblage of the few letters
that form the ship&rsquo;s name to the anxious eyes scanning the
page in fear and trembling.&nbsp; It is like the message of
reprieve from the sentence of sorrow suspended over many a home,
even if some of the men in her have been the most homeless
mortals that you may find among the wanderers of the sea.</p>
<p>The reinsurer, the optimist of ill-luck and disaster, slaps
his pocket with satisfaction.&nbsp; The underwriter, who had been
trying to minimize the amount of impending loss, regrets his
premature pessimism.&nbsp; The ship has been stauncher, the skies
more merciful, the seas less angry, or perhaps the men on board
of a finer temper than he has been willing to take for
granted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship So-and-so, bound to such a port, and posted as
&lsquo;overdue,&rsquo; has been reported yesterday as having
arrived safely at her destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus run the official words of the reprieve addressed to the
hearts ashore lying under a heavy sentence.&nbsp; And they come
swiftly from the other side of the earth, over wires and cables,
for your electric telegraph is a great alleviator of
anxiety.&nbsp; Details, of course, shall follow.&nbsp; And they
may unfold a tale of narrow escape, of steady ill-luck, of high
winds and heavy weather, of ice, of interminable calms or endless
head-gales; a tale of difficulties overcome, of adversity defied
by a small knot of men upon the great loneliness of the sea; a
tale of resource, of courage&mdash;of helplessness, perhaps.</p>
<p>Of all ships disabled at sea, a steamer who has lost her
propeller is the most helpless.&nbsp; And if she drifts into an
unpopulated part of the ocean she may soon become overdue.&nbsp;
The menace of the &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; and the finality of
&ldquo;missing&rdquo; come very quickly to steamers whose life,
fed on coals and breathing the black breath of smoke into the
air, goes on in disregard of wind and wave.&nbsp; Such a one, a
big steamship, too, whose working life had been a record of
faithful keeping time from land to land, in disregard of wind and
sea, once lost her propeller down south, on her passage out to
New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was the wintry, murky time of cold gales and heavy
seas.&nbsp; With the snapping of her tail-shaft her life seemed
suddenly to depart from her big body, and from a stubborn,
arrogant existence she passed all at once into the passive state
of a drifting log.&nbsp; A ship sick with her own weakness has
not the pathos of a ship vanquished in a battle with the
elements, wherein consists the inner drama of her life.&nbsp; No
seaman can look without compassion upon a disabled ship, but to
look at a sailing-vessel with her lofty spars gone is to look
upon a defeated but indomitable warrior.&nbsp; There is defiance
in the remaining stumps of her masts, raised up like maimed limbs
against the menacing scowl of a stormy sky; there is high courage
in the upward sweep of her lines towards the bow; and as soon as,
on a hastily-rigged spar, a strip of canvas is shown to the wind
to keep her head to sea, she faces the waves again with an
unsubdued courage.</p>
<h2>XIX.</h2>
<p>The efficiency of a steamship consists not so much in her
courage as in the power she carries within herself.&nbsp; It
beats and throbs like a pulsating heart within her iron ribs, and
when it stops, the steamer, whose life is not so much a contest
as the disdainful ignoring of the sea, sickens and dies upon the
waves.&nbsp; The sailing-ship, with her unthrobbing body, seemed
to lead mysteriously a sort of unearthly existence, bordering
upon the magic of the invisible forces, sustained by the
inspiration of life-giving and death-dealing winds.</p>
<p>So that big steamer, dying by a sudden stroke, drifted, an
unwieldy corpse, away from the track of other ships.&nbsp; And
she would have been posted really as &ldquo;overdue,&rdquo; or
maybe as &ldquo;missing,&rdquo; had she not been sighted in a
snowstorm, vaguely, like a strange rolling island, by a whaler
going north from her Polar cruising ground.&nbsp; There was
plenty of food on board, and I don&rsquo;t know whether the
nerves of her passengers were at all affected by anything else
than the sense of interminable boredom or the vague fear of that
unusual situation.&nbsp; Does a passenger ever feel the life of
the ship in which he is being carried like a sort of honoured
bale of highly sensitive goods?&nbsp; For a man who has never
been a passenger it is impossible to say.&nbsp; But I know that
there is no harder trial for a seaman than to feel a dead ship
under his feet.</p>
<p>There is no mistaking that sensation, so dismal, so tormenting
and so subtle, so full of unhappiness and unrest.&nbsp; I could
imagine no worse eternal punishment for evil seamen who die
unrepentant upon the earthly sea than that their souls should be
condemned to man the ghosts of disabled ships, drifting for ever
across a ghostly and tempestuous ocean.</p>
<p>She must have looked ghostly enough, that broken-down steamer,
rolling in that snowstorm&mdash;a dark apparition in a world of
white snowflakes to the staring eyes of that whaler&rsquo;s
crew.&nbsp; Evidently they didn&rsquo;t believe in ghosts, for on
arrival into port her captain unromantically reported having
sighted a disabled steamer in latitude somewhere about 50 degrees
S. and a longitude still more uncertain.&nbsp; Other steamers
came out to look for her, and ultimately towed her away from the
cold edge of the world into a harbour with docks and workshops,
where, with many blows of hammers, her pulsating heart of steel
was set going again to go forth presently in the renewed pride of
its strength, fed on fire and water, breathing black smoke into
the air, pulsating, throbbing, shouldering its arrogant way
against the great rollers in blind disdain of winds and sea.</p>
<p>The track she had made when drifting while her heart stood
still within her iron ribs looked like a tangled thread on the
white paper of the chart.&nbsp; It was shown to me by a friend,
her second officer.&nbsp; In that surprising tangle there were
words in minute letters&mdash;&ldquo;gales,&rdquo; &ldquo;thick
fog,&rdquo; &ldquo;ice&rdquo;&mdash;written by him here and there
as memoranda of the weather.&nbsp; She had interminably turned
upon her tracks, she had crossed and recrossed her haphazard path
till it resembled nothing so much as a puzzling maze of pencilled
lines without a meaning.&nbsp; But in that maze there lurked all
the romance of the &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; and a menacing hint of
&ldquo;missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had three weeks of it,&rdquo; said my friend,
&ldquo;just think of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you feel about it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He waved his hand as much as to say: It&rsquo;s all in the
day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; But then, abruptly, as if making up his
mind:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; Towards the last I used to
shut myself up in my berth and cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shed tears,&rdquo; he explained briefly, and rolled up
the chart.</p>
<p>I can answer for it, he was a good man&mdash;as good as ever
stepped upon a ship&rsquo;s deck&mdash;but he could not bear the
feeling of a dead ship under his feet: the sickly, disheartening
feeling which the men of some &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; ships that
come into harbour at last under a jury-rig must have felt,
combated, and overcome in the faithful discharge of their
duty.</p>
<h2><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>XX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is difficult for a seaman to
believe that his stranded ship does not feel as unhappy at the
unnatural predicament of having no water under her keel as he is
himself at feeling her stranded.</p>
<p>Stranding is, indeed, the reverse of sinking.&nbsp; The sea
does not close upon the water-logged hull with a sunny ripple, or
maybe with the angry rush of a curling wave, erasing her name
from the roll of living ships.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It is as if an
invisible hand had been stealthily uplifted from the bottom to
catch hold of her keel as it glides through the water.</p>
<p>More than any other event does stranding bring to the sailor a
sense of utter and dismal failure.&nbsp; There are strandings and
strandings, but I am safe to say that 90 per cent. of them are
occasions in which a sailor, without dishonour, may well wish
himself dead; and I have no doubt that of those who had the
experience of their ship taking the ground, 90 per cent. did
actually for five seconds or so wish themselves dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking the ground&rdquo; is the professional expression
for a ship that is stranded in gentle circumstances.&nbsp; But
the feeling is more as if the ground had taken hold of her.&nbsp;
It is for those on her deck a surprising sensation.&nbsp; It is
as if your feet had been caught in an imponderable snare; you
feel the balance of your body threatened, and the steady poise of
your mind is destroyed at once.&nbsp; This sensation lasts only a
second, for even while you stagger something seems to turn over
in your head, bringing uppermost the mental exclamation, full of
astonishment and dismay, &ldquo;By Jove! she&rsquo;s on the
ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that is very terrible.&nbsp; After all, the only mission
of a seaman&rsquo;s calling is to keep ships&rsquo; keels off the
ground.&nbsp; Thus the moment of her stranding takes away from
him every excuse for his continued existence.&nbsp; To keep ships
afloat is his business; it is his trust; it is the effective
formula of the bottom of all these vague impulses, dreams, and
illusions that go to the making up of a boy&rsquo;s
vocation.&nbsp; The grip of the land upon the keel of your ship,
even if nothing worse comes of it than the wear and tear of
tackle and the loss of time, remains in a seaman&rsquo;s memory
an indelibly fixed taste of disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranded&rdquo; within the meaning of this paper stands
for a more or less excusable mistake.&nbsp; A ship may be
&ldquo;driven ashore&rdquo; by stress of weather.&nbsp; It is a
catastrophe, a defeat.&nbsp; To be &ldquo;run ashore&rdquo; has
the littleness, poignancy, and bitterness of human error.</p>
<h2>XXI.</h2>
<p>That is why your &ldquo;strandings&rdquo; are for the most
part so unexpected.&nbsp; In fact, they are all unexpected,
except those heralded by some short glimpse of the danger, full
of agitation and excitement, like an awakening from a dream of
incredible folly.</p>
<p>The land suddenly at night looms up right over your bows, or
perhaps the cry of &ldquo;Broken water ahead!&rdquo; is raised,
and some long mistake, some complicated edifice of self-delusion,
over-confidence, and wrong reasoning is brought down in a fatal
shock, and the heart-searing experience of your ship&rsquo;s keel
scraping and scrunching over, say, a coral reef.&nbsp; It is a
sound, for its size, far more terrific to your soul than that of
a world coming violently to an end.&nbsp; But out of that chaos
your belief in your own prudence and sagacity reasserts
itself.&nbsp; You ask yourself, Where on earth did I get
to?&nbsp; How on earth did I get there? with a conviction that it
could not be your own act, that there has been at work some
mysterious conspiracy of accident; that the charts are all wrong,
and if the charts are not wrong, that land and sea have changed
their places; that your misfortune shall for ever remain
inexplicable, since you have lived always with the sense of your
trust, the last thing on closing your eyes, the first on opening
them, as if your mind had kept firm hold of your responsibility
during the hours of sleep.</p>
<p>You contemplate mentally your mischance, till little by little
your mood changes, cold doubt steals into the very marrow of your
bones, you see the inexplicable fact in another light.&nbsp; That
is the time when you ask yourself, How on earth could I have been
fool enough to get there?&nbsp; And you are ready to renounce all
belief in your good sense, in your knowledge, in your fidelity,
in what you thought till then was the best in you, giving you the
daily bread of life and the moral support of other men&rsquo;s
confidence.</p>
<p>The ship is lost or not lost.&nbsp; Once stranded, you have to
do your best by her.&nbsp; She may be saved by your efforts, by
your resource and fortitude bearing up against the heavy weight
of guilt and failure.&nbsp; And there are justifiable strandings
in fogs, on uncharted seas, on dangerous shores, through
treacherous tides.&nbsp; But, saved or not saved, there remains
with her commander a distinct sense of loss, a flavour in the
mouth of the real, abiding danger that lurks in all the forms of
human existence.&nbsp; It is an acquisition, too, that
feeling.&nbsp; A man may be the better for it, but he will not be
the same.&nbsp; Damocles has seen the sword suspended by a hair
over his head, and though a good man need not be made less
valuable by such a knowledge, the feast shall not henceforth have
the same flavour.</p>
<p>Years ago I was concerned as chief mate in a case of stranding
which was not fatal to the ship.&nbsp; We went to work for ten
hours on end, laying out anchors in readiness to heave off at
high water.&nbsp; While I was still busy about the decks forward
I heard the steward at my elbow saying: &ldquo;The captain asks
whether you mean to come in, sir, and have something to eat
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went into the cuddy.&nbsp; My captain sat at the head of the
table like a statue.&nbsp; There was a strange motionlessness of
everything in that pretty little cabin.&nbsp; The swing-table
which for seventy odd days had been always on the move, if ever
so little, hung quite still above the soup-tureen.&nbsp; Nothing
could have altered the rich colour of my commander&rsquo;s
complexion, laid on generously by wind and sea; but between the
two tufts of fair hair above his ears, his skull, generally
suffused with the hue of blood, shone dead white, like a dome of
ivory.&nbsp; And he looked strangely untidy.&nbsp; I perceived he
had not shaved himself that day; and yet the wildest motion of
the ship in the most stormy latitudes we had passed through,
never made him miss one single morning ever since we left the
Channel.&nbsp; The fact must be that a commander cannot possibly
shave himself when his ship is aground.&nbsp; I have commanded
ships myself, but I don&rsquo;t know; I have never tried to shave
in my life.</p>
<p>He did not offer to help me or himself till I had coughed
markedly several times.&nbsp; I talked to him professionally in a
cheery tone, and ended with the confident assertion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall get her off before midnight, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled faintly without looking up, and muttered as if to
himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; the captain put the ship ashore and we got
her off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, raising his head, he attacked grumpily the steward, a
lanky, anxious youth with a long, pale face and two big front
teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes this soup so bitter?&nbsp; I am surprised
the mate can swallow the beastly stuff.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure the
cook&rsquo;s ladled some salt water into it by
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charge was so outrageous that the steward for all answer
only dropped his eyelids bashfully.</p>
<p>There was nothing the matter with the soup.&nbsp; I had a
second helping.&nbsp; My heart was warm with hours of hard work
at the head of a willing crew.&nbsp; I was elated with having
handled heavy anchors, cables, boats without the slightest hitch;
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>pleased
with having laid out scientifically bower, stream, and kedge
exactly where I believed they would do most good.&nbsp; On that
occasion the bitter taste of a stranding was not for my
mouth.&nbsp; That experience came later, and it was only then
that I understood the loneliness of the man in charge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the captain who puts the ship ashore; it&rsquo;s we
who get her off.</p>
<h2>XXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seems to me that no man born and
truthful to himself could declare that he ever saw the sea
looking young as the earth looks young in spring.&nbsp; But some
of us, regarding the ocean with understanding and affection, have
seen it looking old, as if the immemorial ages had been stirred
up from the undisturbed bottom of ooze.&nbsp; For it is a gale of
wind that makes the sea look old.</p>
<p>From a distance of years, looking at the remembered aspects of
the storms lived through, it is that impression which disengages
itself clearly from the great body of impressions left by many
years of intimate contact.</p>
<p>If you would know the age of the earth, look upon the sea in a
storm.&nbsp; The grayness of the whole immense surface, the wind
furrows upon the faces of the waves, the great masses of foam,
tossed about and waving, like matted white locks, give to the sea
in a gale an appearance of hoary age, lustreless, dull, without
gleams, as though it had been created before light itself.</p>
<p>Looking back after much love and much trouble, the instinct of
primitive man, who seeks to personify the forces of Nature for
his affection and for his fear, is awakened again in the breast
of one civilized beyond that stage even in his infancy.&nbsp; One
seems to have known gales as enemies, and even as enemies one
embraces them in that affectionate regret which clings to the
past.</p>
<p>Gales have their personalities, and, after all, perhaps it is
not strange; for, when all is said and done, they are adversaries
whose wiles you must defeat, whose violence you must resist, and
yet with whom you must live in the intimacies of nights and
days.</p>
<p>Here speaks the man of masts and sails, to whom the sea is not
a navigable element, but an intimate companion.&nbsp; The length
of passages, the growing sense of solitude, the close dependence
upon the very forces that, friendly to-day, without changing
their nature, by the mere putting forth of their might, become
dangerous to-morrow, make for that sense of fellowship which
modern seamen, good men as they are, cannot hope to know.&nbsp;
And, besides, your modern ship which is a steamship makes her
passages on other principles than yielding to the weather and
humouring the sea.&nbsp; She receives smashing blows, but she
advances; it is a slogging fight, and not a scientific
campaign.&nbsp; The machinery, the steel, the fire, the steam,
have stepped in between the man and the sea.&nbsp; A modern fleet
of ships does not so much make use of the sea as exploit a
highway.&nbsp; The modern ship is not the sport of the
waves.&nbsp; Let us say that each of her voyages is a triumphant
progress; and yet it is a question whether it is not a more
subtle and more human triumph to be the sport of the waves and
yet survive, achieving your end.</p>
<p>In his own time a man is always very modern.&nbsp; Whether the
seamen of three hundred years hence will have the faculty of
sympathy it is impossible to say.&nbsp; An incorrigible mankind
hardens its heart in the progress of its own
perfectability.&nbsp; How will they feel on seeing the
illustrations to the sea novels of our day, or of our
yesterday?&nbsp; It is impossible to guess.&nbsp; But the seaman
of the last generation, brought into sympathy with the caravels
of ancient time by his sailing-ship, their lineal descendant,
cannot look upon those lumbering forms navigating the na&iuml;ve
seas of ancient woodcuts without a feeling of surprise, of
affectionate derision, envy, and admiration.&nbsp; For those
things, whose unmanageableness, even when represented on paper,
makes one gasp with a sort of amused horror, were manned by men
who are his direct professional ancestors.</p>
<p>No; the seamen of three hundred years hence will probably be
neither touched nor moved to derision, affection, or
admiration.&nbsp; They will glance at the photogravures of our
nearly defunct sailing-ships with a cold, inquisitive and
indifferent eye.&nbsp; Our ships of yesterday will stand to their
ships as no lineal ancestors, but as mere predecessors whose
course will have been run and the race extinct.&nbsp; Whatever
craft he handles with skill, the seaman of the future shall be,
not our descendant, but only our successor.</p>
<h2>XXIII.</h2>
<p>And so much depends upon the craft which, made by man, is one
with man, that the sea shall wear for him another aspect.&nbsp; I
remember once seeing the commander&mdash;officially the master,
by courtesy the captain&mdash;of a fine iron ship of the old wool
fleet shaking his head at a very pretty brigantine.&nbsp; She was
bound the other way.&nbsp; She was a taut, trim, neat little
craft, extremely well kept; and on that serene evening when we
passed her close she looked the embodiment of coquettish comfort
on the sea.&nbsp; It was somewhere near the Cape&mdash;<i>The</i>
Cape being, of course, the Cape of Good Hope, the Cape of Storms
of its Portuguese discoverer.&nbsp; And whether it is that the
word &ldquo;storm&rdquo; should not be pronounced upon the sea
where the storms dwell thickly, or because men are shy of
confessing their good hopes, it has become the nameless
cape&mdash;the Cape <i>tout court</i>.&nbsp; The other great cape
of the world, strangely enough, is seldom if ever called a
cape.&nbsp; We say, &ldquo;a voyage round the Horn&rdquo;;
&ldquo;we rounded the Horn&rdquo;; &ldquo;we got a frightful
battering off the Horn&rdquo;; but rarely &ldquo;Cape
Horn,&rdquo; and, indeed, with some reason, for Cape Horn is as
much an island as a cape.&nbsp; The third stormy cape of the
world, which is the Leeuwin, receives generally its full name, as
if to console its second-rate dignity.&nbsp; These are the capes
that look upon the gales.</p>
<p>The little brigantine, then, had doubled the Cape.&nbsp;
Perhaps she was coming from Port Elizabeth, from East
London&mdash;who knows?&nbsp; It was many years ago, but I
remember well the captain of the wool-clipper nodding at her with
the words, &ldquo;Fancy having to go about the sea in a thing
like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a man brought up in big deep-water ships, and the size
of the craft under his feet was a part of his conception of the
sea.&nbsp; His own ship was certainly big as ships went
then.&nbsp; He may have thought of the size of his cabin,
or&mdash;unconsciously, perhaps&mdash;have conjured up a vision
of a vessel so small tossing amongst the great seas.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t inquire, and to a young second mate the captain of
the little pretty brigantine, sitting astride a camp stool with
his chin resting on his hands that were crossed upon the rail,
might have appeared a minor king amongst men.&nbsp; We passed her
within earshot, without a hail, reading each other&rsquo;s names
with the naked eye.</p>
<p>Some years later, the second mate, the recipient of that
almost involuntary mutter, could have told his captain that a man
brought up in big ships may yet take a peculiar delight in what
we should both then have called a small craft.&nbsp; Probably the
captain of the big ship would not have understood very
well.&nbsp; His answer would have been a gruff, &ldquo;Give me
size,&rdquo; as I heard another man reply to a remark praising
the handiness of a small vessel.&nbsp; It was not a love of the
grandiose or the prestige attached to the command of great
tonnage, for he continued, with an air of disgust and contempt,
&ldquo;Why, you get flung out of your bunk as likely as not in
any sort of heavy weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I remember a few nights in my
lifetime, and in a big ship, too (as big as they made them then),
when one did not get flung out of one&rsquo;s bed simply because
one never even attempted to get in; one had been made too weary,
too hopeless, to try.&nbsp; The expedient of turning your bedding
out on to a damp floor and lying on it there was no earthly good,
since you could not keep your place or get a second&rsquo;s rest
in that or any other position.&nbsp; But of the delight of seeing
a small craft run bravely amongst the great seas there can be no
question to him whose soul does not dwell ashore.&nbsp; Thus I
well remember a three days&rsquo; run got out of a little barque
of 400 tons somewhere between the islands of St. Paul and
Amsterdam and Cape Otway on the Australian coast.&nbsp; It was a
hard, long gale, gray clouds and green sea, heavy weather
undoubtedly, but still what a sailor would call manageable.&nbsp;
Under two lower topsails and a reefed foresail the barque seemed
to race with a long, steady sea that did not becalm her in the
troughs.&nbsp; The solemn thundering combers caught her up from
astern, passed her with a fierce boiling up of foam level with
the bulwarks, swept on ahead with a swish and a roar: and the
little vessel, dipping her jib-boom into the tumbling froth,
would go on running in a smooth, glassy hollow, a deep valley
between two ridges of the sea, hiding the horizon ahead and
astern.&nbsp; There was such fascination in her pluck,
nimbleness, the continual exhibition of unfailing seaworthiness,
in the semblance of courage and endurance, that I could not give
up the delight of watching her run through the three
unforgettable days of that gale which my mate also delighted to
extol as &ldquo;a famous shove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this is one of those gales whose memory in after-years
returns, welcome in dignified austerity, as you would remember
with pleasure the noble features of a stranger with whom you
crossed swords once in knightly encounter and are never to see
again.&nbsp; In this way gales have their physiognomy.&nbsp; You
remember them by your own feelings, and no two gales stamp
themselves in the same way upon your emotions.&nbsp; Some cling
to you in woebegone misery; others come back fiercely and
weirdly, like ghouls bent upon sucking your strength away;
others, again, have a catastrophic splendour; some are
unvenerated recollections, as of spiteful wild-cats clawing at
your agonized vitals; others are severe, like a visitation; and
one or two rise up draped and mysterious, with an aspect of
ominous menace.&nbsp; In each of them there is a characteristic
point at which the whole feeling seems contained in one single
moment.&nbsp; Thus there is a certain four o&rsquo;clock in the
morning in the confused roar of a black and white world when
coming on deck to take charge of my watch I received the
instantaneous impression that the ship could not live for another
hour in such a raging sea.</p>
<p>I wonder what became of the men who silently (you
couldn&rsquo;t hear yourself speak) must have shared that
conviction with me.&nbsp; To be left to write about it is not,
perhaps, the most enviable fate; but the point is that this
impression resumes in its intensity the whole recollection of
days and days of desperately dangerous weather.&nbsp; We were
then, for reasons which it is not worth while to specify, in the
close neighbourhood of Kerguelen Land; and now, when I open an
atlas and look at the tiny dots on the map of the Southern Ocean,
I see as if engraved upon the paper the enraged physiognomy of
that gale.</p>
<p>Another, strangely, recalls a silent man.&nbsp; And yet it was
not din that was wanting; in fact, it was terrific.&nbsp; That
one was a gale that came upon the ship swiftly, like a parnpero,
which last is a very sudden wind indeed.&nbsp; Before we knew
very well what was coming all the sails we had set had burst; the
furled ones were blowing loose, ropes flying, sea
hissing&mdash;it hissed tremendously&mdash;wind howling, and the
ship lying on her side, so that half of the crew were swimming
and the other half clawing desperately at whatever came to hand,
according to the side of the deck each man had been caught on by
the catastrophe, either to leeward or to windward.&nbsp; The
shouting I need not mention&mdash;it was the merest drop in an
ocean of noise&mdash;and yet the character of the gale seems
contained in the recollection of one small, not particularly
impressive, sallow man without a cap and with a very still
face.&nbsp; Captain Jones&mdash;let us call him Jones&mdash;had
been caught unawares.&nbsp; Two orders he had given at the first
sign of an utterly unforeseen onset; after that the magnitude of
his mistake seemed to have overwhelmed him.&nbsp; We were doing
what was needed and feasible.&nbsp; The ship behaved well.&nbsp;
Of course, it was some time before we could pause in our fierce
and laborious exertions; but all through the work, the
excitement, the uproar, and some dismay, we were aware of this
silent little man at the break of the poop, perfectly motionless,
soundless, and often hidden from us by the drift of sprays.</p>
<p>When we officers clambered at last upon the poop, he seemed to
come out of that numbed composure, and shouted to us down wind:
&ldquo;Try the pumps.&rdquo;&nbsp; Afterwards he
disappeared.&nbsp; As to the ship, I need not say that, although
she was presently swallowed up in one of the blackest nights I
can remember, she did not disappear.&nbsp; In truth, I
don&rsquo;t fancy that there had ever been much danger of that,
but certainly the experience was noisy and particularly
distracting&mdash;and yet it is the memory of a very quiet
silence that survives.</p>
<h2>XXIV.</h2>
<p>For, after all, a gale of wind, the thing of mighty sound, is
inarticulate.&nbsp; It is man who, in a chance phrase, interprets
the elemental passion of his enemy.&nbsp; Thus there is another
gale in my memory, a thing of endless, deep, humming roar,
moonlight, and a spoken sentence.</p>
<p>It was off that other cape which is always deprived of its
title as the Cape of Good Hope is robbed of its name.&nbsp; It
was off the Horn.&nbsp; For a true expression of dishevelled
wildness there is nothing like a gale in the bright moonlight of
a high latitude.</p>
<p>The ship, brought-to and bowing to enormous flashing seas,
glistened wet from deck to trucks; her one set sail stood out a
coal-black shape upon the gloomy blueness of the air.&nbsp; I was
a youngster then, and suffering from weariness, cold, and
imperfect oilskins which let water in at every seam.&nbsp; I
craved human companionship, and, coming off the poop, took my
place by the side of the boatswain (a man whom I did not like) in
a comparatively dry spot where at worst we had water only up to
our knees.&nbsp; Above our heads the explosive booming gusts of
wind passed continuously, justifying the sailor&rsquo;s saying
&ldquo;It blows great guns.&rdquo;&nbsp; And just from that need
of human companionship, being very close to the man, I said, or
rather shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blows very hard, boatswain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His answer was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and if it blows only a little harder things will
begin to go.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind as long as everything
holds, but when things begin to go it&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note of dread in the shouting voice, the practical truth
of these words, heard years ago from a man I did not like, have
stamped its peculiar character on that gale.</p>
<p>A look in the eyes of a shipmate, a low murmur in the most
sheltered spot where the watch on duty are huddled together, a
meaning moan from one to the other with a glance at the windward
sky, a sigh of weariness, a gesture of disgust passing into the
keeping of the great wind, become part and parcel of the
gale.&nbsp; The olive hue of hurricane clouds presents an aspect
peculiarly appalling.&nbsp; The inky ragged wrack, flying before
a nor&rsquo;-west wind, makes you dizzy with its headlong speed
that depicts the rush of the invisible air.&nbsp; A hard
sou&rsquo;-wester startles you with its close horizon and its low
gray sky, as if the world were a dungeon wherein there is no rest
for body or soul.&nbsp; And there are black squalls, white
squalls, thunder squalls, and unexpected gusts that come without
a single sign in the sky; and of each kind no one of them
resembles another.</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>There
is infinite variety in the gales of wind at sea, and except for
the peculiar, terrible, and mysterious moaning that may be heard
sometimes passing through the roar of a hurricane&mdash;except
for that unforgettable sound, as if the soul of the universe had
been goaded into a mournful groan&mdash;it is, after all, the
human voice that stamps the mark of human consciousness upon the
character of a gale.</p>
<h2>XXV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no part of the world of
coasts, continents, oceans, seas, straits, capes, and islands
which is not under the sway of a reigning wind, the sovereign of
its typical weather.&nbsp; The wind rules the aspects of the sky
and the action of the sea.&nbsp; But no wind rules unchallenged
his realm of land and water.&nbsp; As with the kingdoms of the
earth, there are regions more turbulent than others.&nbsp; In the
middle belt of the earth the Trade Winds reign supreme,
undisputed, like monarchs of long-settled kingdoms, whose
traditional power, checking all undue ambitions, is not so much
an exercise of personal might as the working of long-established
institutions.&nbsp; The intertropical kingdoms of the Trade Winds
are favourable to the ordinary life of a merchantman.&nbsp; The
trumpet-call of strife is seldom borne on their wings to the
watchful ears of men on the decks of ships.&nbsp; The regions
ruled by the north-east and south-east Trade Winds are
serene.&nbsp; In a southern-going ship, bound out for a long
voyage, the passage through their dominions is characterized by a
relaxation of strain and vigilance on the part of the
seamen.&nbsp; Those citizens of the ocean feel sheltered under
the &aelig;gis of an uncontested law, of an undisputed
dynasty.&nbsp; There, indeed, if anywhere on earth, the weather
may be trusted.</p>
<p>Yet not too implicitly.&nbsp; Even in the constitutional realm
of Trade Winds, north and south of the equator, ships are
overtaken by strange disturbances.&nbsp; Still, the easterly
winds, and, generally speaking, the easterly weather all the
world over, is characterized by regularity and persistence.</p>
<p>As a ruler, the East Wind has a remarkable stability; as an
invader of the high latitudes lying under the tumultuous sway of
his great brother, the Wind of the West, he is extremely
difficult to dislodge, by the reason of his cold craftiness and
profound duplicity.</p>
<p>The narrow seas around these isles, where British admirals
keep watch and ward upon the marches of the Atlantic Ocean, are
subject to the turbulent sway of the West Wind.&nbsp; Call it
north-west or south-west, it is all one&mdash;a different phase
of the same character, a changed expression on the same
face.&nbsp; In the orientation of the winds that rule the seas,
the north and south directions are of no importance.&nbsp; There
are no North and South Winds of any account upon this
earth.&nbsp; The North and South Winds are but small princes in
the dynasties that make peace and war upon the sea.&nbsp; They
never assert themselves upon a vast stage.&nbsp; They depend upon
local causes&mdash;the configuration of coasts, the shapes of
straits, the accidents of bold promontories round which they play
their little part.&nbsp; In the polity of winds, as amongst the
tribes of the earth, the real struggle lies between East and
West.</p>
<h2>XXVI.</h2>
<p>The West Wind reigns over the seas surrounding the coasts of
these kingdoms; and from the gateways of the channels, from
promontories as if from watch-towers, from estuaries of rivers as
if from postern gates, from passage-ways, inlets, straits,
firths, the garrison of the Isle and the crews of the ships going
and returning look to the westward to judge by the varied
splendours of his sunset mantle the mood of that arbitrary
ruler.&nbsp; The end of the day is the time to gaze at the kingly
face of the Westerly Weather, who is the arbiter of ships&rsquo;
destinies.&nbsp; Benignant and splendid, or splendid and
sinister, the western sky reflects the hidden purposes of the
royal mind.&nbsp; Clothed in a mantle of dazzling gold or draped
in rags of black clouds like a beggar, the might of the Westerly
Wind sits enthroned upon the western horizon with the whole North
Atlantic as a footstool for his feet and the first twinkling
stars making a diadem for his brow.&nbsp; Then the seamen,
attentive courtiers of the weather, think of regulating the
conduct of their ships by the mood of the master.&nbsp; The West
Wind is too great a king to be a dissembler: he is no calculator
plotting deep schemes in a sombre heart; he is too strong for
small artifices; there is passion in all his moods, even in the
soft mood of his serene days, in the grace of his blue sky whose
immense and unfathomable tenderness reflected in the mirror of
the sea embraces, possesses, lulls to sleep the ships with white
sails.&nbsp; He is all things to all oceans; he is like a poet
seated upon a throne&mdash;magnificent, simple, barbarous,
pensive, generous, impulsive, changeable, unfathomable&mdash;but
when you understand him, always the same.&nbsp; Some of his
sunsets are like pageants devised for the delight of the
multitude, when all the gems of the royal treasure-house are
displayed above the sea.&nbsp; Others are like the opening of his
royal confidence, tinged with thoughts of sadness and compassion
in a melancholy splendour meditating upon the short-lived peace
of the waters.&nbsp; And I have seen him put the pent-up anger of
his heart into the aspect of the inaccessible sun, and cause it
to glare fiercely like the eye of an implacable autocrat out of a
pale and frightened sky.</p>
<p>He is the war-lord who sends his battalions of Atlantic
rollers to the assault of our seaboard.&nbsp; The compelling
voice of the West Wind musters up to his service all the might of
the ocean.&nbsp; At the bidding of the West Wind there arises a
great commotion in the sky above these Islands, and a great rush
of waters falls upon our shores.&nbsp; The sky of the westerly
weather is full of flying clouds, of great big white clouds
coming thicker and thicker till they seem to stand welded into a
solid canopy, upon whose gray face the lower wrack of the gale,
thin, black and angry-looking, flies past with vertiginous
speed.&nbsp; Denser and denser grows this dome of vapours,
descending lower and lower upon the sea, narrowing the horizon
around the ship.&nbsp; And the characteristic aspect of westerly
weather, the thick, gray, smoky and sinister tone sets in,
circumscribing the view of the men, drenching their bodies,
oppressing their souls, taking their breath away with booming
gusts, deafening, blinding, driving, rushing them onwards in a
swaying ship towards our coasts lost in mists and rain.</p>
<p>The caprice of the winds, like the wilfulness of men, is
fraught with the disastrous consequences of
self-indulgence.&nbsp; Long anger, the sense of his uncontrolled
power, spoils the frank and generous nature of the West
Wind.&nbsp; It is as if his heart were corrupted by a malevolent
and brooding rancour.&nbsp; He devastates his own kingdom in the
wantonness of his force.&nbsp; South-west is the quarter of the
heavens where he presents his darkened brow.&nbsp; He breathes
his rage in terrific squalls, and overwhelms his realm with an
inexhaustible welter of clouds.&nbsp; He strews the seeds of
anxiety upon the decks of scudding ships, makes the foam-stripped
ocean look old, and sprinkles with gray hairs the heads of
ship-masters in the homeward-bound ships running for the
Channel.&nbsp; The Westerly Wind asserting his sway from the
south-west quarter is often like a monarch gone mad, driving
forth with wild imprecations the most faithful of his courtiers
to shipwreck, disaster, and death.</p>
<p>The south-westerly weather is the thick weather <i>par
excellence</i>.&nbsp; It is not the thickness of the fog; it is
rather a contraction of the horizon, a mysterious veiling of the
shores with clouds that seem to make a low-vaulted dungeon around
the running ship.&nbsp; It is not blindness; it is a shortening
of the sight.&nbsp; The West Wind does not say to the seaman,
&ldquo;You shall be blind&rdquo;; it restricts merely the range
of his vision and raises the dread of land within his
breast.&nbsp; It makes of him a man robbed of half his force, of
half his efficiency.&nbsp; Many times in my life, standing in
long sea-boots and streaming oilskins at the elbow of my
commander on the poop of a homeward-bound ship making for the
Channel, and gazing ahead into the gray and tormented waste, I
have heard a weary sigh shape itself into a studiously casual
comment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see very far in this weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And have made answer in the same low, perfunctory tone</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be merely the instinctive voicing of an ever-present
thought associated closely with the consciousness of the land
somewhere ahead and of the great speed of the ship.&nbsp; Fair
wind, fair wind!&nbsp; Who would dare to grumble at a fair
wind?&nbsp; It was a favour of the Western King, who rules
masterfully the North Atlantic from the latitude of the Azores to
the latitude of Cape Farewell.&nbsp; A famous shove this to end a
good passage with; and yet, somehow, one could not muster upon
one&rsquo;s lips the smile of a courtier&rsquo;s gratitude.&nbsp;
This favour was dispensed to you from under an overbearing scowl,
which is the true expression of the great autocrat when he has
made up his mind to give a battering to some ships and to hunt
certain others home in one breath of cruelty and benevolence,
equally distracting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t see very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus would the mate&rsquo;s voice repeat the thought of the
master, both gazing ahead, while under their feet the ship rushes
at some twelve knots in the direction of the lee shore; and only
a couple of miles in front of her swinging and dripping jib-boom,
carried naked with an upward slant like a spear, a gray horizon
closes the view with a multitude of waves surging upwards
violently as if to strike at the stooping clouds.</p>
<p>Awful and threatening scowls darken the face of the West Wind
in his clouded, south-west mood; and from the King&rsquo;s
throne-hall in the western board stronger gusts reach you, like
the fierce shouts of raving fury to which only the gloomy
grandeur of the scene imparts a saving dignity.&nbsp; A shower
pelts the deck and the sails of the ship as if flung with a
scream by an angry hand; and when the night closes in, the night
of a south-westerly gale, it seems more hopeless than the shade
of Hades.&nbsp; The south-westerly mood of the great West Wind is
a lightless mood, without sun, moon, or stars, with no gleam of
light but the phosphorescent flashes of the great sheets of foam
that, boiling up on each side of the ship, fling bluish gleams
upon her dark and narrow hull, rolling as she runs, chased by
enormous seas, distracted in the tumult.</p>
<p>There are some bad nights in the kingdom of the West Wind for
homeward-bound ships making for the Channel; and the days of
wrath dawn upon them colourless and vague like the timid turning
up of invisible lights upon the scene of a tyrannical and
passionate outbreak, awful in the monotony of its method and the
increasing strength of its violence.&nbsp; It is the same wind,
the same clouds, the same wildly racing seas, the same thick
horizon around the ship.&nbsp; Only the wind is stronger, the
clouds seem denser and more overwhelming, the waves appear to
have grown bigger and more threatening during the night.&nbsp;
The hours, whose minutes are marked by the crash of the breaking
seas, slip by with the screaming, pelting squalls overtaking the
ship as she runs on and on with darkened canvas, with streaming
spars and dripping ropes.&nbsp; The down-pours thicken.&nbsp;
Preceding each shower a mysterious gloom, like the passage of a
shadow above the firmament of gray clouds, filters down upon the
ship.&nbsp; Now and then the rain pours upon your head in streams
as if from spouts.&nbsp; It seems as if your ship were going to
be drowned before she sank, as if all atmosphere had turned to
water.&nbsp; You gasp, you splutter, you are blinded and
deafened, you are submerged, obliterated, dissolved, annihilated,
streaming all over as if your limbs, too, had turned to
water.&nbsp; And every nerve on the alert you watch for the
clearing-up mood of the Western King, that shall come with a
shift of wind as likely as not to whip all the three masts out of
your ship in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<h2>XXVII.</h2>
<p>Heralded by the increasing fierceness of the squalls,
sometimes by a faint flash of lightning like the signal of a
lighted torch waved far away behind the clouds, the shift of wind
comes at last, the crucial moment of the change from the brooding
and veiled violence of the south-west gale to the sparkling,
flashing, cutting, clear-eyed anger of the King&rsquo;s
north-westerly mood.&nbsp; You behold another phase of his
passion, a fury bejewelled with stars, mayhap bearing the
crescent of the moon on its brow, shaking the last vestiges of
its torn cloud-mantle in inky-black squalls, with hail and sleet
descending like showers of crystals and pearls, bounding off the
spars, drumming on the sails, pattering on the oilskin coats,
whitening the decks of homeward-bound ships.&nbsp; Faint, ruddy
flashes of lightning flicker in the starlight upon her
mastheads.&nbsp; A chilly blast hums in the taut rigging, causing
the ship to tremble to her very keel, and the soaked men on her
decks to shiver in their wet clothes to the very marrow of their
bones.&nbsp; Before one squall has flown over to sink in the
eastern board, the edge of another peeps up already above the
western horizon, racing up swift, shapeless, like a black bag
full of frozen water ready to burst over your devoted head.&nbsp;
The temper of the ruler of the ocean has changed.&nbsp; Each gust
of the clouded mood that seemed warmed by the heat of a heart
flaming with anger has its counterpart in the chilly blasts that
seem blown from a breast turned to ice with a sudden revulsion of
feeling.&nbsp; Instead of blinding your eyes and crushing your
soul with a terrible apparatus of cloud and mists and seas and
rain, the King of the West turns his power to contemptuous
pelting of your back with icicles, to making your weary eyes
water as if in grief, and your worn-out carcass quake
pitifully.&nbsp; But each mood of the great autocrat has its own
greatness, and each is hard to bear.&nbsp; Only the north-west
phase of that mighty display is not demoralizing to the same
extent, because between the hail and sleet squalls of a
north-westerly gale one can see a long way ahead.</p>
<p>To see! to see!&mdash;this is the craving of the sailor, as of
the rest of blind humanity.&nbsp; To have his path made clear for
him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and
tempestuous existence.&nbsp; I have heard a reserved, silent man,
with no nerves to speak of, after three days of hard running in
thick south-westerly weather, burst out passionately: &ldquo;I
wish to God we could get sight of something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had just gone down below for a moment to commune in a
battened-down cabin, with a large white chart lying limp and damp
upon a cold and clammy table under the light of a smoky
lamp.&nbsp; Sprawling over that seaman&rsquo;s silent and trusted
adviser, with one elbow upon the coast of Africa and the other
planted in the neighbourhood of Cape Hatteras (it was a general
track-chart of the North Atlantic), my skipper lifted his rugged,
hairy face, and glared at me in a half-exasperated,
half-appealing way.&nbsp; We have seen no sun, moon, or stars for
something like seven days.&nbsp; By the effect of the West
Wind&rsquo;s wrath the celestial bodies had gone into hiding for
a week or more, and the last three days had seen the force of a
south-west gale grow from fresh, through strong, to heavy, as the
entries in my log-book could testify.&nbsp; Then we separated, he
to go on deck again, in obedience to that mysterious call that
seems to sound for ever in a shipmaster&rsquo;s ears, I to
stagger into my cabin with some vague notion of putting down the
words &ldquo;Very heavy weather&rdquo; in a log-book not quite
written up-to-date.&nbsp; But I gave it up, and crawled into my
bunk instead, boots and hat on, all standing (it did not matter;
everything was soaking wet, a heavy sea having burst the poop
skylights the night before), to remain in a nightmarish state
between waking and sleeping for a couple of hours of so-called
rest.</p>
<p>The south-westerly mood of the West Wind is an enemy of sleep,
and even of a recumbent position, in the responsible officers of
a ship.&nbsp; After two hours of futile, light-headed,
inconsequent thinking upon all things under heaven in that dark,
dank, wet and devastated cabin, I arose suddenly and staggered up
on deck.&nbsp; The autocrat of the North Atlantic was still
oppressing his kingdom and its outlying dependencies, even as far
as the Bay of Biscay, in the dismal secrecy of thick, very thick,
weather.&nbsp; The force of the wind, though we were running
before it at the rate of some ten knots an hour, was so great
that it drove me with a steady push to the front of the poop,
where my commander was holding on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; he addressed me in an
interrogative yell.</p>
<p>What I really thought was that we both had had just about
enough of it.&nbsp; The manner in which the great West Wind
chooses at times to administer his possessions does not commend
itself to a person of peaceful and law-abiding disposition,
inclined to draw distinctions between right and wrong in the face
of natural forces, whose standard, naturally, is that of might
alone.&nbsp; But, of course, I said nothing.&nbsp; For a man
caught, as it were, between his skipper and the great West Wind
silence is the safest sort of diplomacy.&nbsp; Moreover, I knew
my skipper.&nbsp; He did not want to know what I thought.&nbsp;
Shipmasters hanging on a breath before the thrones of the winds
ruling the seas have their psychology, whose workings are as
important to the ship and those on board of her as the changing
moods of the weather.&nbsp; The man, as a matter of fact, under
no circumstances, ever cared a brass farthing for what I or
anybody else in his ship thought.&nbsp; He had had just about
enough of it, I guessed, and what he was at really was a process
of fishing for a suggestion.&nbsp; It was the pride of his life
that he had never wasted a chance, no matter how boisterous,
threatening, and dangerous, of a fair wind.&nbsp; Like men racing
blindfold for a gap in a hedge, we were finishing a splendidly
quick passage from the Antipodes, with a tremendous rush for the
Channel in as thick a weather as any I can remember, but his
psychology did not permit him to bring the ship to with a fair
wind blowing&mdash;at least not on his own initiative.&nbsp; And
yet he felt that very soon indeed something would have to be
done.&nbsp; He wanted the suggestion to come from me, so that
later on, when the trouble was over, he could argue this point
with his own uncompromising spirit, laying the blame upon my
shoulders.&nbsp; I must render him the justice that this sort of
pride was his only weakness.</p>
<p>But he got no suggestion from me.&nbsp; I understood his
psychology.&nbsp; Besides, I had my own stock of weaknesses at
the time (it is a different one now), and amongst them was the
conceit of being remarkably well up in the psychology of the
Westerly weather.&nbsp; I believed&mdash;not to mince
matters&mdash;that I had a genius for reading the mind of the
great ruler of high latitudes.&nbsp; I fancied I could discern
already the coming of a change in his royal mood.&nbsp; And all I
said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weather&rsquo;s bound to clear up with the shift of
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody knows that much!&rdquo; he snapped at me, at
the highest pitch of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean before dark!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>This was all the opening he ever got from me.&nbsp; The
eagerness with which he seized upon it gave me the measure of the
anxiety he had been labouring under.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he shouted, with an affectation of
impatience, as if giving way to long entreaties.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
right.&nbsp; If we don&rsquo;t get a shift by then we&rsquo;ll
take that foresail off her and put her head under her wing for
the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was struck by the picturesque character of the phrase as
applied to a ship brought-to in order to ride out a gale with
wave after wave passing under her breast.&nbsp; I could see her
resting in the tumult of the elements like a sea-bird sleeping in
wild weather upon the raging waters with its head tucked under
its wing.&nbsp; In imaginative precision, in true feeling, this
is one of the most expressive sentences I have ever heard on
human lips.&nbsp; But as to taking the foresail off that ship
before we put her head under her wing, I had my grave
doubts.&nbsp; They were justified.&nbsp; That long enduring piece
of canvas was confiscated by the arbitrary decree of the West
Wind, to whom belong the lives of men and the contrivances of
their hands within the limits of his kingdom.&nbsp; With the
sound of a faint explosion it vanished into the thick weather
bodily, leaving behind of its stout substance not so much as one
solitary strip big enough to be picked into a handful of lint
for, say, a wounded elephant.&nbsp; Torn out of its bolt-ropes,
it faded like a whiff of smoke in the smoky drift of clouds
shattered and torn by the shift of wind.&nbsp; For the shift of
wind had come.&nbsp; The unveiled, low sun glared angrily from a
chaotic sky upon a confused and tremendous sea dashing itself
upon a coast.&nbsp; We recognised the headland, and looked at
each other in the silence of dumb wonder.&nbsp; Without knowing
it in the least, we had run up alongside the Isle of Wight, and
that tower, tinged a faint evening red in the salt wind-haze, was
the lighthouse on St. Catherine&rsquo;s Point.</p>
<p>My skipper recovered first from his astonishment.&nbsp; His
bulging eyes sank back gradually into their orbits.&nbsp; His
psychology, taking it all round, was really very creditable for
an average sailor.&nbsp; He had been spared the humiliation of
laying his ship to with a fair wind; and at once that man, of an
open and truthful nature, spoke up in perfect good faith, rubbing
together his brown, hairy hands&mdash;the hands of a
master-craftsman upon the sea:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! that&rsquo;s just about where I reckoned we had
got to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The transparency and ingenuousness, in a way, of that
delusion, the airy tone, the hint of already growing pride, were
perfectly delicious.&nbsp; But, in truth, this was one of the
greatest surprises ever sprung by the clearing up mood of the
West Wind upon one of the most accomplished of his courtiers.</p>
<h2>XXVIII.</h2>
<p>The winds of North and South are, as I have said, but small
princes amongst the powers of the sea.&nbsp; They have no
territory of their own; they are not reigning winds
anywhere.&nbsp; Yet it is from their houses that the reigning
dynasties which have shared between them the waters of the earth
are sprung.&nbsp; All the weather of the world is based upon the
contest of the Polar and Equatorial strains of that tyrannous
race.&nbsp; The West Wind is the greatest king.&nbsp; The East
rules between the Tropics.&nbsp; They have shared each ocean
between them.&nbsp; Each has his genius of supreme rule.&nbsp;
The King of the West never intrudes upon the recognised dominion
of his kingly brother.&nbsp; He is a barbarian, of a northern
type.&nbsp; Violent without craftiness, and furious without
malice, one may imagine him seated masterfully with a
double-edged sword on his knees upon the painted and gilt clouds
of the sunset, bowing his shock head of golden locks, a flaming
beard over his breast, imposing, colossal, mighty-limbed, with a
thundering voice, distended cheeks and fierce blue eyes, urging
the speed of his gales.&nbsp; The other, the East king, the king
of blood-red sunrises, I represent to myself as a spare
Southerner with clear-cut features, black-browed and dark-eyed,
gray-robed, upright in sunshine, resting a smooth-shaven cheek in
the palm of his hand, impenetrable, secret, full of wiles,
fine-drawn, keen&mdash;meditating aggressions.</p>
<p>The West Wind keeps faith with his brother, the King of the
Easterly weather.&nbsp; &ldquo;What we have divided we have
divided,&rdquo; he seems to say in his gruff voice, this ruler
without guile, who hurls as if in sport enormous masses of cloud
across the sky, and flings the great waves of the Atlantic clear
across from the shores of the New World upon the hoary headlands
of Old Europe, which harbours more kings and rulers upon its
seamed and furrowed body than all the oceans of the world
together.&nbsp; &ldquo;What we have divided we have divided; and
if no rest and peace in this world have fallen to my share, leave
me alone.&nbsp; Let me play at quoits with cyclonic gales,
flinging the discs of spinning cloud and whirling air from one
end of my dismal kingdom to the other: over the Great Banks or
along the edges of pack-ice&mdash;this one with true aim right
into the bight of the Bay of Biscay, that other upon the fiords
of Norway, across the North Sea where the fishermen of many
nations look watchfully into my angry eye.&nbsp; This is the time
of kingly sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the royal master of high latitudes sighs mightily, with
the sinking sun upon his breast and the double-edged sword upon
his knees, as if wearied by the innumerable centuries of a
strenuous rule and saddened by the unchangeable aspect of the
ocean under his feet&mdash;by the endless vista of future ages
where the work of sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind shall
go on and on till his realm of living waters becomes a frozen and
motionless ocean.&nbsp; But the other, crafty and unmoved,
nursing his shaven chin between the thumb and forefinger of his
slim and treacherous hand, thinks deep within his heart full of
guile: &ldquo;Aha! our brother of the West has fallen into the
mood of kingly melancholy.&nbsp; He is tired of playing with
circular gales, and blowing great guns, and unrolling thick
streamers of fog in wanton sport at the cost of his own poor,
miserable subjects.&nbsp; Their fate is most pitiful.&nbsp; Let
us make a foray upon the dominions of that noisy barbarian, a
great raid from Finisterre to Hatteras, catching his fishermen
unawares, baffling the fleets that trust to his power, and
shooting sly arrows into the livers of men who court his good
graces.&nbsp; He is, indeed, a worthless fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
forthwith, while the West Wind meditates upon the vanity of his
irresistible might, the thing is done, and the Easterly weather
sets in upon the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>The prevailing weather of the North Atlantic is typical of the
way in which the West Wind rules his realm on which the sun never
sets.&nbsp; North Atlantic is the heart of a great empire.&nbsp;
It is the part of the West Wind&rsquo;s dominions most thickly
populated with generations of fine ships and hardy men.&nbsp;
Heroic deeds and adventurous exploits have been performed there,
within the very stronghold of his sway.&nbsp; The best sailors in
the world have been born and bred under the shadow of his
sceptre, learning to manage their ships with skill and audacity
before the steps of his stormy throne.&nbsp; Reckless
adventurers, toiling fishermen, admirals as wise and brave as the
world has ever known, have waited upon the signs of his westerly
sky.&nbsp; Fleets of victorious ships have hung upon his
breath.&nbsp; He has tossed in his hand squadrons of war-scarred
three-deckers, and shredded out in mere sport the bunting of
flags hallowed in the traditions of honour and glory.&nbsp; He is
a good friend and a dangerous enemy, without mercy to unseaworthy
ships and faint-hearted seamen.&nbsp; In his kingly way he has
taken but little account of lives sacrificed to his impulsive
policy; he is a king with a double-edged sword bared in his right
hand.&nbsp; The East Wind, an interloper in the dominions of
Westerly weather, is an impassive-faced tyrant with a sharp
poniard held behind his back for a treacherous stab.</p>
<p>In his forays into the North Atlantic the East Wind behaves
like a subtle and cruel adventurer without a notion of honour or
fair play.&nbsp; Veiling his clear-cut, lean face in a thin layer
of a hard, high cloud, I have seen him, like a wizened robber
sheik of the sea, hold up large caravans of ships to the number
of three hundred or more at the very gates of the English
Channel.&nbsp; And the worst of it was that there was no ransom
that we could pay to satisfy his avidity; for whatever evil is
wrought by the raiding East Wind, it is done only to spite his
kingly brother of the West.&nbsp; We gazed helplessly at the
systematic, cold, gray-eyed obstinacy of the Easterly weather,
while short rations became the order of the day, and the pinch of
hunger under the breast-bone grew familiar to every sailor in
that held-up fleet.&nbsp; Every day added to our numbers.&nbsp;
In knots and groups and straggling parties we flung to and fro
before the closed gate.&nbsp; And meantime the outward-bound
ships passed, running through our humiliated ranks under all the
canvas they could show.&nbsp; It is my idea that the Easterly
Wind helps the ships away from home in the wicked hope that they
shall all come to an untimely end and be heard of no more.&nbsp;
For six weeks did the robber sheik hold the trade route of the
earth, while our liege lord, the West Wind, slept profoundly like
a tired Titan, or else remained lost in a mood of idle sadness
known only to frank natures.&nbsp; All was still to the westward;
we looked in vain towards his stronghold: the King slumbered on
so deeply that he let his foraging brother steal the very mantle
of gold-lined purple clouds from his bowed shoulders.&nbsp; What
had become of the dazzling hoard of royal jewels exhibited at
every close of day?&nbsp; Gone, disappeared, extinguished,
carried off without leaving a single gold band or the flash of a
single sunbeam in the evening sky!&nbsp; Day after day through a
cold streak of heavens as bare and poor as the inside of a rifled
safe a rayless and despoiled sun would slink shamefacedly,
without pomp or show, to hide in haste under the waters.&nbsp;
And still the King slept on, or mourned the vanity of his might
and his power, while the thin-lipped intruder put the impress of
his cold and implacable spirit upon the sky and sea.&nbsp; With
every daybreak the rising sun had to wade through a crimson
stream, luminous and sinister, like the spilt blood of celestial
bodies murdered during the night.</p>
<p>In this particular instance the mean interloper held the road
for some six weeks on end, establishing his particular
administrative methods over the best part of the North
Atlantic.&nbsp; It looked as if the easterly weather had come to
stay for ever, or, at least, till we had all starved to death in
the held-up fleet&mdash;starved within sight, as it were, of
plenty, within touch, almost, of the bountiful heart of the
Empire.&nbsp; There we were, dotting with our white dry sails the
hard blueness of the deep sea.&nbsp; There we were, a growing
company of ships, each with her burden of grain, of timber, of
wool, of hides, and even of oranges, for we had one or two
belated fruit schooners in company.&nbsp; There we were, in that
memorable spring of a certain year in the late seventies, dodging
to and fro, baffled on every tack, and with our stores running
down to sweepings of bread-lockers and scrapings of
sugar-casks.&nbsp; It was just like the East Wind&rsquo;s nature
to inflict starvation upon the bodies of unoffending sailors,
while he corrupted their simple souls by an exasperation leading
to outbursts of profanity as lurid as his blood-red
sunrises.&nbsp; They were followed by gray days under the cover
of high, motionless clouds that looked as if carved in a slab of
ash-coloured marble.&nbsp; And each mean starved sunset left us
calling with imprecations upon the West Wind even in its most
veiled misty mood to wake up and give us our liberty, if only to
rush on and dash the heads of our ships against the very walls of
our unapproachable home.</p>
<h2>XXIX.</h2>
<p>In the atmosphere of the Easterly weather, as pellucid as a
piece of crystal and refracting like a prism, we could see the
appalling numbers of our helpless company, even to those who in
more normal conditions would have remained invisible, sails down
under the horizon.&nbsp; It is the malicious pleasure of the East
Wind to augment the power of your eyesight, in order, perhaps,
that you should see better the perfect humiliation, the hopeless
character of your captivity.&nbsp; Easterly weather is generally
clear, and that is all that can be said for it&mdash;almost
supernaturally clear when it likes; but whatever its mood, there
is something uncanny in its nature.&nbsp; Its duplicity is such
that it will deceive a scientific instrument.&nbsp; No barometer
will give warning of an easterly gale, were it ever so wet.&nbsp;
It would be an unjust and ungrateful thing to say that a
barometer is a stupid contrivance.&nbsp; It is simply that the
wiles of the East Wind are too much for its fundamental
honesty.&nbsp; After years and years of experience the most
trusty instrument of the sort that ever went to sea screwed on to
a ship&rsquo;s cabin bulkhead will, almost invariably, be induced
to rise by the diabolic ingenuity of the Easterly weather, just
at the moment when the Easterly weather, discarding its methods
of hard, dry, impassive cruelty, contemplates drowning what is
left of your spirit in torrents of a peculiarly cold and horrid
rain.&nbsp; The sleet-and-hail squalls following the lightning at
the end of a westerly gale are cold and benumbing and stinging
and cruel enough.&nbsp; But the dry, Easterly weather, when it
turns to wet, seems to rain poisoned showers upon your
head.&nbsp; It is a sort of steady, persistent, overwhelming,
endlessly driving downpour, which makes your heart sick, and
opens it to dismal forebodings.&nbsp; And the stormy mood of the
Easterly weather looms black upon the sky with a peculiar and
amazing blackness.&nbsp; The West Wind hangs heavy gray curtains
of mist and spray before your gaze, but the Eastern interloper of
the narrow seas, when he has mustered his courage and cruelty to
the point of a gale, puts your eyes out, puts them out
completely, makes you feel blind for life upon a lee-shore.&nbsp;
It is the wind, also, that brings snow.</p>
<p>Out of his black and merciless heart he flings a white
blinding sheet upon the ships of the sea.&nbsp; He has more
manners of villainy, and no more conscience than an Italian
prince of the seventeenth century.&nbsp; His weapon is a dagger
carried under a black cloak when he goes out on his unlawful
enterprises.&nbsp; The mere hint of his approach fills with dread
every craft that swims the sea, from fishing-smacks to
four-masted ships that recognise the sway of the West Wind.&nbsp;
Even in his most accommodating mood he inspires a dread of
treachery.&nbsp; I have heard upwards of ten score of windlasses
spring like one into clanking life in the dead of night, filling
the Downs with a panic-struck sound of anchors being torn
hurriedly out of the ground at the first breath of his
approach.&nbsp; Fortunately, his heart often fails him: he does
not always blow home upon our exposed coast; he has not the
fearless temper of his Westerly brother.</p>
<p>The natures of those two winds that share the dominions of the
great oceans are fundamentally different.&nbsp; It is strange
that the winds which men are prone to style capricious remain
true to their character in all the various regions of the
earth.&nbsp; To us here, for instance, the East Wind comes across
a great continent, sweeping over the greatest body of solid land
upon this earth.&nbsp; For the Australian east coast the East
Wind is the wind of the ocean, coming across the greatest body of
water upon the globe; and yet here and there its characteristics
remain the same with a strange consistency in everything that is
vile and base.&nbsp; The members of the West Wind&rsquo;s dynasty
are modified in a way by the regions they rule, as a
Hohenzollern, without ceasing to be himself, becomes a Roumanian
by virtue of his throne, or a Saxe-Coburg learns to put the dress
of Bulgarian phrases upon his particular thoughts, whatever they
are.</p>
<p>The autocratic sway of the West Wind, whether forty north or
forty south of the Equator, is characterized by an open,
generous, frank, barbarous recklessness.&nbsp; For he is a great
autocrat, and to be a great autocrat you must be a great
barbarian.&nbsp; I have been too much moulded to his sway to
nurse now any idea of rebellion in my heart.&nbsp; Moreover, what
is a rebellion within the four walls of a room against the
tempestuous rule of the West Wind?&nbsp; I remain faithful to the
memory of the mighty King with a double-edged sword in one hand,
and in the other holding out rewards of great daily runs and
famously quick passages to those of his courtiers who knew how to
wait watchfully for every sign of his secret mood.&nbsp; As we
deep-water men always reckoned, he made one year in three fairly
lively for anybody having business upon the Atlantic or down
there along the &ldquo;forties&rdquo; of the Southern
Ocean.&nbsp; You had to take the bitter with the sweet; and it
cannot be denied he played carelessly with our lives and
fortunes.&nbsp; But, then, he was always a great king, fit to
rule over the great waters where, strictly speaking, a man would
have no business whatever but for his audacity.</p>
<p>The audacious should not complain.&nbsp; A mere trader ought
not to grumble at the tolls levied by a mighty king.&nbsp; His
mightiness was sometimes very overwhelming; but even when you had
to defy him openly, as on the banks of the Agulhas homeward bound
from the East Indies, or on the outward passage round the Horn,
he struck at you fairly his stinging blows (full in the face,
too), and it was your business not to get too much
staggered.&nbsp; And, after all, if you showed anything of a
countenance, the good-natured barbarian would let you fight your
way past the very steps of his throne.&nbsp; It was only now and
then that the sword descended and a head fell; but if you fell
you were sure of impressive obsequies and of a roomy, generous
grave.</p>
<p>Such is the king to whom Viking chieftains bowed their heads,
and whom the modern and palatial steamship defies with impunity
seven times a week.&nbsp; And yet it is but defiance, not
victory.&nbsp; The magnificent barbarian sits enthroned in a
mantle of gold-lined clouds looking from on high on great ships
gliding like mechanical toys upon his sea and on men who, armed
with fire and iron, no longer need to watch anxiously for the
slightest sign of his royal mood.&nbsp; He is disregarded; but he
has kept all his strength, all his splendour, and a great part of
his power.&nbsp; Time itself, that shakes all the thrones, is on
the side of that king.&nbsp; The sword in his hand remains as
sharp as ever upon both its edges; and he may well go on playing
his royal game of quoits with hurricanes, tossing them over from
the continent of republics to the continent of kingdoms, in the
assurance that both the new republics and the old <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>kingdoms,
the heat of fire and the strength of iron, with the untold
generations of audacious men, shall crumble to dust at the steps
of his throne, and pass away, and be forgotten before his own
rule comes to an end.</p>
<h2>XXX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> estuaries of rivers appeal
strongly to an adventurous imagination.&nbsp; This appeal is not
always a charm, for there are estuaries of a particularly
dispiriting ugliness: lowlands, mud-flats, or perhaps barren
sandhills without beauty of form or amenity of aspect, covered
with a shabby and scanty vegetation conveying the impression of
poverty and uselessness.&nbsp; Sometimes such an ugliness is
merely a repulsive mask.&nbsp; A river whose estuary resembles a
breach in a sand rampart may flow through a most fertile
country.&nbsp; But all the estuaries of great rivers have their
fascination, the attractiveness of an open portal.&nbsp; Water is
friendly to man.&nbsp; The ocean, a part of Nature furthest
removed in the unchangeableness and majesty of its might from the
spirit of mankind, has ever been a friend to the enterprising
nations of the earth.&nbsp; And of all the elements this is the
one to which men have always been prone to trust themselves, as
if its immensity held a reward as vast as itself.</p>
<p>From the offing the open estuary promises every possible
fruition to adventurous hopes.&nbsp; That road open to enterprise
and courage invites the explorer of coasts to new efforts towards
the fulfilment of great expectations.&nbsp; The commander of the
first Roman galley must have looked with an intense absorption
upon the estuary of the Thames as he turned the beaked prow of
his ship to the westward under the brow of the North
Foreland.&nbsp; The estuary of the Thames is not beautiful; it
has no noble features, no romantic grandeur of aspect, no smiling
geniality; but it is wide open, spacious, inviting, hospitable at
the first glance, with a strange air of mysteriousness which
lingers about it to this very day.&nbsp; The navigation of his
craft must have engrossed all the Roman&rsquo;s attention in the
calm of a summer&rsquo;s day (he would choose his weather), when
the single row of long sweeps (the galley would be a light one,
not a trireme) could fall in easy cadence upon a sheet of water
like plate-glass, reflecting faithfully the classic form of his
vessel and the contour of the lonely shores close on his left
hand.&nbsp; I assume he followed the land and passed through what
is at present known as Margate Roads, groping his careful way
along the hidden sandbanks, whose every tail and spit has its
beacon or buoy nowadays.&nbsp; He must have been anxious, though
no doubt he had collected beforehand on the shores of the Gauls a
store of information from the talk of traders, adventurers,
fishermen, slave-dealers, pirates&mdash;all sorts of unofficial
men connected with the sea in a more or less reputable way.&nbsp;
He would have heard of channels and sandbanks, of natural
features of the land useful for sea-marks, of villages and tribes
and modes of barter and precautions to take: with the instructive
tales about native chiefs dyed more or less blue, whose character
for greediness, ferocity, or amiability must have been expounded
to him with that capacity for vivid language which seems joined
naturally to the shadiness of moral character and recklessness of
disposition.&nbsp; With that sort of spiced food provided for his
anxious thought, watchful for strange men, strange beasts,
strange turns of the tide, he would make the best of his way up,
a military seaman with a short sword on thigh and a bronze helmet
on his head, the pioneer post-captain of an imperial fleet.&nbsp;
Was the tribe inhabiting the Isle of Thanet of a ferocious
disposition, I wonder, and ready to fall with stone-studded clubs
and wooden lances hardened in the fire, upon the backs of unwary
mariners?</p>
<p>Amongst the great commercial streams of these islands, the
Thames is the only one, I think, open to romantic feeling, from
the fact that the sight of human labour and the sounds of human
industry do not come down its shores to the very sea, destroying
the suggestion of mysterious vastness caused by the configuration
of the shore.&nbsp; The broad inlet of the shallow North Sea
passes gradually into the contracted shape of the river; but for
a long time the feeling of the open water remains with the ship
steering to the westward through one of the lighted and buoyed
passage-ways of the Thames, such as Queen&rsquo;s Channel,
Prince&rsquo;s Channel, Four-Fathom Channel; or else coming down
the Swin from the north.&nbsp; The rush of the yellow flood-tide
hurries her up as if into the unknown between the two fading
lines of the coast.&nbsp; There are no features to this land, no
conspicuous, far-famed landmarks for the eye; there is nothing so
far down to tell you of the greatest agglomeration of mankind on
earth dwelling no more than five and twenty miles away, where the
sun sets in a blaze of colour flaming on a gold background, and
the dark, low shores trend towards each other.&nbsp; And in the
great silence the deep, faint booming of the big guns being
tested at Shoeburyness hangs about the Nore&mdash;a historical
spot in the keeping of one of England&rsquo;s appointed
guardians.</p>
<h2>XXXI.</h2>
<p>The Nore sand remains covered at low-water, and never seen by
human eye; but the Nore is a name to conjure with visions of
historical events, of battles, of fleets, of mutinies, of watch
and ward kept upon the great throbbing heart of the State.&nbsp;
This ideal point of the estuary, this centre of memories, is
marked upon the steely gray expanse of the waters by a lightship
painted red that, from a couple of miles off, looks like a cheap
and bizarre little toy.&nbsp; I remember how, on coming up the
river for the first time, I was surprised at the smallness of
that vivid object&mdash;a tiny warm speck of crimson lost in an
immensity of gray tones.&nbsp; I was startled, as if of necessity
the principal beacon in the water-way of the greatest town on
earth should have presented imposing proportions.&nbsp; And,
behold! the brown sprit-sail of a barge hid it entirely from my
view.</p>
<p>Coming in from the eastward, the bright colouring of the
lightship marking the part of the river committed to the charge
of an Admiral (the Commander-in-Chief at the Nore) accentuates
the dreariness and the great breadth of the Thames Estuary.&nbsp;
But soon the course of the ship opens the entrance of the Medway,
with its men-of-war moored in line, and the long wooden jetty of
Port Victoria, with its few low buildings like the beginning of a
hasty settlement upon a wild and unexplored shore.&nbsp; The
famous Thames barges sit in brown clusters upon the water with an
effect of birds floating upon a pond.&nbsp; On the imposing
expanse of the great estuary the traffic of the port where so
much of the world&rsquo;s work and the world&rsquo;s thinking is
being done becomes insignificant, scattered, streaming away in
thin lines of ships stringing themselves out into the eastern
quarter through the various navigable channels of which the Nore
lightship marks the divergence.&nbsp; The coasting traffic
inclines to the north; the deep-water ships steer east with a
southern inclination, on through the Downs, to the most remote
ends of the world.&nbsp; In the widening of the shores sinking
low in the gray, smoky distances the greatness of the sea
receives the mercantile fleet of good ships that London sends out
upon the turn of every tide.&nbsp; They follow each other, going
very close by the Essex shore.&nbsp; Such as the beads of a
rosary told by business-like shipowners for the greater profit of
the world they slip one by one into the open: while in the offing
the inward-bound ships come up singly and in bunches from under
the sea horizon closing the mouth of the river between Orfordness
and North Foreland.&nbsp; They all converge upon the Nore, the
warm speck of red upon the tones of drab and gray, with the
distant shores running together towards the west, low and flat,
like the sides of an enormous canal.&nbsp; The sea-reach of the
Thames is straight, and, once Sheerness is left behind, its banks
seem very uninhabited, except for the cluster of houses which is
Southend, or here and there a lonely wooden jetty where petroleum
ships discharge their dangerous cargoes, and the oil-storage
tanks, low and round with slightly-domed roofs, peep over the
edge of the fore-shore, as it were a village of Central African
huts imitated in iron.&nbsp; Bordered by the black and shining
mud-flats, the level marsh extends for miles.&nbsp; Away in the
far background the land rises, closing the view with a continuous
wooded slope, forming in the distance an interminable rampart
overgrown with bushes.</p>
<p>Then, on the slight turn of the Lower Hope Reach, clusters of
factory chimneys come distinctly into view, tall and slender
above the squat ranges of cement works in Grays and
Greenhithe.&nbsp; Smoking quietly at the top against the great
blaze of a magnificent sunset, they give an industrial character
to the scene, speak of work, manufactures, and trade, as
palm-groves on the coral strands of distant islands speak of the
luxuriant grace, beauty and vigour of tropical nature.&nbsp; The
houses of Gravesend crowd upon the shore with an effect of
confusion as if they had tumbled down haphazard from the top of
the hill at the back.&nbsp; The flatness of the Kentish shore
ends there.&nbsp; A fleet of steam-tugs lies at anchor in front
of the various piers.&nbsp; A conspicuous church spire, the first
seen distinctly coming from the sea, has a thoughtful grace, the
serenity of a fine form above the chaotic disorder of men&rsquo;s
houses.&nbsp; But on the other side, on the flat Essex side, a
shapeless and desolate red edifice, a vast pile of bricks with
many windows and a slate roof more inaccessible than an Alpine
slope, towers over the bend in monstrous ugliness, the tallest,
heaviest building for miles around, a thing like an hotel, like a
mansion of flats (all to let), exiled into these fields out of a
street in West Kensington.&nbsp; Just round the corner, as it
were, on a pier defined with stone blocks and wooden piles, a
white mast, slender like a stalk of straw and crossed by a yard
like a knitting-needle, flying the signals of flag and balloon,
watches over a set of heavy dock-gates.&nbsp; Mast-heads and
funnel-tops of ships peep above the ranges of corrugated iron
roofs.&nbsp; This is the entrance to Tilbury Dock, the most
recent of all London docks, the nearest to the sea.</p>
<p>Between the crowded houses of Gravesend and the monstrous
red-brick pile on the Essex shore the ship is surrendered fairly
to the grasp of the river.&nbsp; That hint of loneliness, that
soul of the sea which had accompanied her as far as the Lower
Hope Reach, abandons her at the turn of the first bend
above.&nbsp; The salt, acrid flavour is gone out of the air,
together with a sense of unlimited space opening free beyond the
threshold of sandbanks below the Nore.&nbsp; The waters of the
sea rush on past Gravesend, tumbling the big mooring buoys laid
along the face of the town; but the sea-freedom stops short
there, surrendering the salt tide to the needs, the artifices,
the contrivances of toiling men.&nbsp; Wharves, landing-places,
dock-gates, waterside stairs, follow each other continuously
right up to London Bridge, and the hum of men&rsquo;s work fills
the river with a menacing, muttering note as of a breathless,
ever-driving gale.&nbsp; The water-way, so fair above and wide
below, flows oppressed by bricks and mortar and stone, by
blackened timber and grimed glass and rusty iron, covered with
black barges, whipped up by paddles and screws, overburdened with
craft, overhung with chains, overshadowed by walls making a steep
gorge for its bed, filled with a haze of smoke and dust.</p>
<p>This stretch of the Thames from London Bridge to the Albert
Docks is to other watersides of river ports what a virgin forest
would be to a garden.&nbsp; It is a thing grown up, not
made.&nbsp; It recalls a jungle by the confused, varied, and
impenetrable aspect of the buildings that line the shore, not
according to a planned purpose, but as if sprung up by accident
from scattered seeds.&nbsp; Like the matted growth of bushes and
creepers veiling the silent depths of an unexplored wilderness,
they hide the depths of London&rsquo;s infinitely varied,
vigorous, seething life.&nbsp; In other river ports it is not
so.&nbsp; They lie open to their stream, with quays like broad
clearings, with streets like avenues cut through thick timber for
the convenience of trade.&nbsp; I am thinking now of river ports
I have seen&mdash;of Antwerp, for instance; of Nantes or
Bordeaux, or even old Rouen, where the night-watchmen of ships,
elbows on rail, gaze at shop-windows and brilliant caf&eacute;s,
and see the audience go in and come out of the opera-house.&nbsp;
But London, the oldest and greatest of river ports, does not
possess as much as a hundred yards of open quays upon its river
front.&nbsp; Dark and impenetrable at night, like the face of a
forest, is the London waterside.&nbsp; It is the waterside of
watersides, where only one aspect of the world&rsquo;s life can
be seen, and only one kind of men toils on the edge of the
stream.&nbsp; The lightless walls seem to spring from the very
mud upon which the stranded barges lie; and the narrow lanes
coming down to the foreshore resemble the paths of smashed bushes
and crumbled earth where big game comes to drink on the banks of
tropical streams.</p>
<p>Behind the growth of the London waterside the docks of London
spread out unsuspected, smooth, and placid, lost amongst the
buildings like dark lagoons hidden in a thick forest.&nbsp; They
lie concealed in the intricate growth of houses with a few stalks
of mastheads here and there overtopping the roof of some
four-story warehouse.</p>
<p>It is a strange conjunction this of roofs and mastheads, of
walls and yard-arms.&nbsp; I remember once having the incongruity
of the relation brought home to me in a practical way.&nbsp; I
was the chief officer of a fine ship, just docked with a cargo of
wool from Sydney, after a ninety days&rsquo; passage.&nbsp; In
fact, we had not been in more than half an hour and I was still
busy making her fast to the stone posts of a very narrow quay in
front of a lofty warehouse.&nbsp; An old man with a gray whisker
under the chin and brass buttons on his pilot-cloth jacket,
hurried up along the quay hailing my ship by name.&nbsp; He was
one of those officials called berthing-masters&mdash;not the one
who had berthed us, but another, who, apparently, had been busy
securing a steamer at the other end of the dock.&nbsp; I could
see from afar his hard blue eyes staring at us, as if fascinated,
with a queer sort of absorption.&nbsp; I wondered what that
worthy sea-dog had found to criticise in my ship&rsquo;s
rigging.&nbsp; And I, too, glanced aloft anxiously.&nbsp; I could
see nothing wrong there.&nbsp; But perhaps that superannuated
fellow-craftsman was simply admiring the ship&rsquo;s perfect
order aloft, I thought, with some secret pride; for the chief
officer is responsible for his ship&rsquo;s appearance, and as to
her outward condition, he is the man open to praise or
blame.&nbsp; Meantime the old salt (&ldquo;ex-coasting
skipper&rdquo; was writ large all over his person) had hobbled up
alongside in his bumpy, shiny boots, and, waving an arm, short
and thick like the flipper of a seal, terminated by a paw red as
an uncooked beef-steak, addressed the poop in a muffled, faint,
roaring voice, as if a sample of every North-Sea fog of his life
had been permanently lodged in his throat: &ldquo;Haul &rsquo;em
round, Mr. Mate!&rdquo; were his words.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t look sharp, you&rsquo;ll have your topgallant yards
through the windows of that &rsquo;ere warehouse
presently!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the only cause of his interest
in the ship&rsquo;s beautiful spars.&nbsp; I own that for a time
I was struck dumb by the bizarre associations of yard-arms and
window-panes.&nbsp; To break windows is the last thing one would
think of in connection with a ship&rsquo;s topgallant yard,
unless, indeed, one were an experienced berthing-master in one of
the London docks.&nbsp; This old chap was doing his little share
of the world&rsquo;s work with proper efficiency.&nbsp; His
little blue eyes had made out the danger many hundred yards
off.&nbsp; His rheumaticky feet, tired with balancing that squat
body for many years upon the decks of small coasters, and made
sore by miles of tramping upon the flagstones of the dock side,
had hurried up in time to avert a ridiculous catastrophe.&nbsp; I
answered him pettishly, I fear, and as if I had known all about
it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right! can&rsquo;t do everything at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remained near by, muttering to himself till the yards had
been hauled round at my order, and then raised again his foggy,
thick voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;None too soon,&rdquo; he observed, with a critical
glance up at the towering side of the warehouse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a half-sovereign in your pocket, Mr.
Mate.&nbsp; You should always look first how you are for them
windows before you begin to breast in your ship to the
quay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was good advice.&nbsp; But one cannot think of everything
or foresee contacts of things apparently as remote as stars and
hop-poles.</p>
<h2>XXXII.</h2>
<p>The view of ships lying moored in some of the older docks of
London has always suggested to my mind the image of a flock of
swans kept in the flooded backyard of grim tenement houses.&nbsp;
The flatness of the walls surrounding the dark pool on which they
float brings out wonderfully the flowing grace of the lines on
which a ship&rsquo;s hull is built.&nbsp; The lightness of these
forms, devised to meet the winds and the seas, makes, by contrast
with the great piles of bricks, the chains and cables of their
moorings appear very necessary, as if nothing less could prevent
them from soaring upwards and over the roofs.&nbsp; The least
puff of wind stealing round the corners of the dock buildings
stirs these captives fettered to rigid shores.&nbsp; It is as if
the soul of a ship were impatient of confinement.&nbsp; Those
masted hulls, relieved of their cargo, become restless at the
slightest hint of the wind&rsquo;s freedom.&nbsp; However tightly
moored, they range a little at their berths, swaying
imperceptibly the spire-like assemblages of cordage and
spars.&nbsp; You can detect their impatience by watching the sway
of the mastheads against the motionless, the soulless gravity of
mortar and stones.&nbsp; As you pass alongside each hopeless
prisoner chained to the quay, the slight grinding noise of the
wooden fenders makes a sound of angry muttering.&nbsp; But, after
all, it may be good for ships to go through a period of restraint
and repose, as the restraint and self-communion of inactivity may
be good for an unruly soul&mdash;not, indeed, that I mean to say
that ships are unruly; on the contrary, they are faithful
creatures, as so many men can testify.&nbsp; And faithfulness is
a great restraint, the strongest bond laid upon the self-will of
men and ships on this globe of land and sea.</p>
<p>This interval of bondage in the docks rounds each period of a
ship&rsquo;s life with the sense of accomplished duty, of an
effectively played part in the work of the world.&nbsp; The dock
is the scene of what the world would think the most serious part
in the light, bounding, swaying life of a ship.&nbsp; But there
are docks and docks.&nbsp; The ugliness of some docks is
appalling.&nbsp; Wild horses would not drag from me the name of a
certain river in the north whose narrow estuary is inhospitable
and dangerous, and whose docks are like a nightmare of dreariness
and misery.&nbsp; Their dismal shores are studded thickly with
scaffold-like, enormous timber structures, whose lofty heads are
veiled periodically by the infernal gritty night of a cloud of
coal-dust.&nbsp; The most important ingredient for getting the
world&rsquo;s work along is distributed there under the
circumstances of the greatest cruelty meted out to helpless
ships.&nbsp; Shut up in the desolate circuit of these basins, you
would think a free ship would droop and die like a wild bird put
into a dirty cage.&nbsp; But a ship, perhaps because of her
faithfulness to men, will endure an extraordinary lot of
ill-usage.&nbsp; Still, I have seen ships issue from certain
docks like half-dead prisoners from a dungeon, bedraggled,
overcome, wholly disguised in dirt, and with their men rolling
white eyeballs in black and worried faces raised to a heaven
which, in its smoky and soiled aspect, seemed to reflect the
sordidness of the earth below.&nbsp; One thing, however, may be
said for the docks of the Port of London on both sides of the
river: for all the complaints of their insufficient equipment, of
their obsolete rules, of failure (they say) in the matter of
quick despatch, no ship need ever issue from their gates in a
half-fainting condition.&nbsp; London is a general cargo port, as
is only proper for the greatest capital of the world to be.&nbsp;
General cargo ports belong to the aristocracy of the
earth&rsquo;s trading places, and in that aristocracy London, as
it is its way, has a unique physiognomy.</p>
<p>The absence of picturesqueness cannot be laid to the charge of
the docks opening into the Thames.&nbsp; For all my unkind
comparisons to swans and backyards, it cannot be denied that each
dock or group of docks along the north side of the river has its
own individual attractiveness.&nbsp; Beginning with the cosy
little St. Katherine&rsquo;s Dock, lying overshadowed and black
like a quiet pool amongst rocky crags, through the venerable and
sympathetic London Docks, with not a single line of rails in the
whole of their area and the aroma of spices lingering between its
warehouses, with their far-famed wine-cellars&mdash;down through
the interesting group of West India Docks, the fine docks at
Blackwall, on past the Galleons Reach entrance of the Victoria
and Albert Docks, right down to the vast gloom of the great
basins in Tilbury, each of those places of restraint for ships
has its own peculiar physiognomy, its own expression.&nbsp; And
what makes them unique and attractive is their common trait of
being romantic in their usefulness.</p>
<p>In their way they are as romantic as the river they serve is
unlike all the other commercial streams of the world.&nbsp; The
cosiness of the St. Katherine&rsquo;s Dock, the old-world air of
the London Docks, remain impressed upon the memory.&nbsp; The
docks down the river, abreast of Woolwich, are imposing by their
proportions and the vast scale of the ugliness that forms their
surroundings&mdash;ugliness so picturesque as to become a delight
to the eye.&nbsp; When one talks of the Thames docks,
&ldquo;beauty&rdquo; is a vain word, but romance has lived too
long upon this river not to have thrown a mantle of glamour upon
its banks.</p>
<p>The antiquity of the port appeals to the imagination by the
long chain of adventurous enterprises that had their inception in
the town and floated out into the world on the waters of the
river.&nbsp; Even the newest of the docks, the Tilbury Dock,
shares in the glamour conferred by historical associations.&nbsp;
Queen Elizabeth has made one of her progresses down there, not
one of her journeys of pomp and ceremony, but an anxious business
progress at a crisis of national history.&nbsp; The menace of
that time has passed away, and now Tilbury is known by its
docks.&nbsp; These are very modern, but their remoteness and
isolation upon the Essex marsh, the days of failure attending
their creation, invested them with a romantic air.&nbsp; Nothing
in those days could have been more striking than the vast, empty
basins, surrounded by miles of bare quays and the ranges of
cargo-sheds, where two or three ships seemed lost like bewitched
children in a forest of gaunt, hydraulic cranes.&nbsp; One
received a wonderful impression of utter abandonment, of wasted
efficiency.&nbsp; From the first the Tilbury Docks were very
efficient and ready for their task, but they had come, perhaps,
too soon into the field.&nbsp; A great future lies before Tilbury
Docks.&nbsp; They shall never fill a long-felt want (in the
sacramental phrase that is applied to railways, tunnels,
newspapers, and new editions of books).&nbsp; They were too early
in the field.&nbsp; The want shall never be felt because, free of
the trammels of the tide, easy of access, magnificent and
desolate, they are already there, prepared to take and keep the
biggest ships that float upon the sea.&nbsp; They are worthy of
the oldest river port in the world.</p>
<p>And, truth to say, for all the criticisms flung upon the heads
of the dock companies, the other docks of the Thames are no
disgrace to the town with a population greater than that of some
commonwealths.&nbsp; The growth of London as a well-equipped port
has been slow, while not unworthy of a great capital, of a great
centre of distribution.&nbsp; It must not be forgotten that
London has not the backing of great industrial districts or great
fields of natural exploitation.&nbsp; In this it differs from
Liverpool, from Cardiff, from Newcastle, from Glasgow; and
therein the Thames differs from the Mersey, from the Tyne, from
the Clyde.&nbsp; It is an historical river; it is a romantic
stream flowing through the centre of great affairs, and for all
the criticism of the river&rsquo;s administration, my contention
is that its development has been worthy of its dignity.&nbsp; For
a long time the stream itself could accommodate quite easily the
oversea and coasting traffic.&nbsp; That was in the days when, in
the part called the Pool, just below London Bridge, the vessels
moored stem and stern in the very strength of the tide formed one
solid mass like an island covered with a forest of gaunt,
leafless trees; and when the trade had grown too big for the
river there came the St. Katherine&rsquo;s Docks and the London
Docks, magnificent undertakings answering to the need of their
time.&nbsp; The same may be said of the other artificial lakes
full of ships that go in and out upon this high road to all parts
of the world.&nbsp; The labour of the imperial waterway goes on
from generation to generation, goes on day and night.&nbsp;
Nothing ever arrests its sleepless industry but the coming of a
heavy fog, which clothes the teeming stream in a mantle of
impenetrable stillness.</p>
<p>After the gradual cessation of all sound and movement on the
faithful river, only the ringing of ships&rsquo; bells is heard,
mysterious and muffled in the white vapour from London Bridge
right down to the Nore, for miles and miles in a decrescendo
tinkling, to where the estuary broadens out into the North Sea,
and the anchored ships lie scattered thinly in the shrouded
channels between the sand-banks of the Thames&rsquo; mouth.&nbsp;
Through the <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>long and glorious tale of years of the river&rsquo;s
strenuous service to its people these are its only breathing
times.</p>
<h2>XXXIII.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">ship</span> in dock, surrounded by quays
and the walls of warehouses, has the appearance of a prisoner
meditating upon freedom in the sadness of a free spirit put under
restraint.&nbsp; Chain cables and stout ropes keep her bound to
stone posts at the edge of a paved shore, and a berthing-master,
with brass buttons on his coat, walks about like a weather-beaten
and ruddy gaoler, casting jealous, watchful glances upon the
moorings that fetter a ship lying passive and still and safe, as
if lost in deep regrets of her days of liberty and danger on the
sea.</p>
<p>The swarm of renegades&mdash;dock-masters, berthing-masters,
gatemen, and such like&mdash;appear to nurse an immense distrust
of the captive ship&rsquo;s resignation.&nbsp; There never seem
chains and ropes enough to satisfy their minds concerned with the
safe binding of free ships to the strong, muddy, enslaved
earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better put another bight of a hawser
astern, Mr. Mate,&rdquo; is the usual phrase in their
mouth.&nbsp; I brand them for renegades, because most of them
have been sailors in their time.&nbsp; As if the infirmities of
old age&mdash;the gray hair, the wrinkles at the corners of the
eyes, and the knotted veins of the hands&mdash;were the symptoms
of moral poison, they prowl about the quays with an underhand air
of gloating over the broken spirit of noble captives.&nbsp; They
want more fenders, more breasting-ropes; they want more springs,
more shackles, more fetters; they want to make ships with
volatile souls as motionless as square blocks of stone.&nbsp;
They stand on the mud of pavements, these degraded sea-dogs, with
long lines of railway-trucks clanking their couplings behind
their backs, and run malevolent glances over your ship from
headgear to taffrail, only wishing to tyrannize over the poor
creature under the hypocritical cloak of benevolence and
care.&nbsp; Here and there cargo cranes looking like instruments
of torture for ships swing cruel hooks at the end of long
chains.&nbsp; Gangs of dock-labourers swarm with muddy feet over
the gangways.&nbsp; It is a moving sight this, of so many men of
the earth, earthy, who never cared anything for a ship, trampling
unconcerned, brutal and hob-nailed upon her helpless body.</p>
<p>Fortunately, nothing can deface the beauty of a ship.&nbsp;
That sense of a dungeon, that sense of a horrible and degrading
misfortune overtaking a creature fair to see and safe to trust,
attaches only to ships moored in the docks of great European
ports.&nbsp; You feel that they are dishonestly locked up, to be
hunted about from wharf to wharf on a dark, greasy, square pool
of black water as a brutal reward at the end of a faithful
voyage.</p>
<p>A ship anchored in an open roadstead, with cargo-lighters
alongside and her own tackle swinging the burden over the rail,
is accomplishing in freedom a function of her life.&nbsp; There
is no restraint; there is space: clear water around her, and a
clear sky above her mastheads, with a landscape of green hills
and charming bays opening around her anchorage.&nbsp; She is not
abandoned by her own men to the tender mercies of shore
people.&nbsp; She still shelters, and is looked after by, her own
little devoted band, and you feel that presently she will glide
between the headlands and disappear.&nbsp; It is only at home, in
dock, that she lies abandoned, shut off from freedom by all the
artifices of men that think of quick despatch and profitable
freights.&nbsp; It is only then that the odious, rectangular
shadows of walls and roofs fall upon her decks, with showers of
soot.</p>
<p>To a man who has never seen the extraordinary nobility,
strength, and grace that the devoted generations of ship-builders
have evolved from some pure nooks of their simple souls, the
sight that could be seen five-and-twenty years ago of a large
fleet of clippers moored along the north side of the New South
Dock was an inspiring spectacle.&nbsp; Then there was a quarter
of a mile of them, from the iron dockyard-gates guarded by
policemen, in a long, forest-like perspective of masts, moored
two and two to many stout wooden jetties.&nbsp; Their spars
dwarfed with their loftiness the corrugated-iron sheds, their
jibbooms extended far over the shore, their white-and-gold
figure-heads, almost dazzling in their purity, overhung the
straight, long quay above the mud and dirt of the wharfside, with
the busy figures of groups and single men moving to and fro,
restless and grimy under their soaring immobility.</p>
<p>At tide-time you would see one of the loaded ships with
battened-down hatches drop out of the ranks and float in the
clear space of the dock, held by lines dark and slender, like the
first threads of a spider&rsquo;s web, extending from her bows
and her quarters to the mooring-posts on shore.&nbsp; There,
graceful and still, like a bird ready to spread its wings, she
waited till, at the opening of the gates, a tug or two would
hurry in noisily, hovering round her with an air of fuss and
solicitude, and take her out into the river, tending, shepherding
her through open bridges, through dam-like gates between the flat
pier-heads, with a bit of green lawn surrounded by gravel and a
white signal-mast with yard and gaff, flying a couple of dingy
blue, red, or white flags.</p>
<p>This New South Dock (it was its official name), round which my
earlier professional memories are centred, belongs to the group
of West India Docks, together with two smaller and much older
basins called Import and Export respectively, both with the
greatness of their trade departed from them already.&nbsp;
Picturesque and clean as docks go, these twin basins spread side
by side the dark lustre of their glassy water, sparely peopled by
a few ships laid up on buoys or tucked far away from each other
at the end of sheds in the corners of empty quays, where they
seemed to slumber quietly remote, untouched by the bustle of
men&rsquo;s affairs&mdash;in retreat rather than in
captivity.&nbsp; They were quaint and sympathetic, those two
homely basins, unfurnished and silent, with no aggressive display
of cranes, no apparatus of hurry and work on their narrow
shores.&nbsp; No railway-lines cumbered them.&nbsp; The knots of
labourers trooping in clumsily round the corners of cargo-sheds
to eat their food in peace out of red cotton handkerchiefs had
the air of picnicking by the side of a lonely mountain
pool.&nbsp; They were restful (and I should say very
unprofitable), those basins, where the chief officer of one of
the ships involved in the harassing, strenuous, noisy activity of
the New South Dock only a few yards away could escape in the
dinner-hour to stroll, unhampered by men and affairs, meditating
(if he chose) on the vanity of all things human.&nbsp; At one
time they must have been full of good old slow West Indiamen of
the square-stern type, that took their captivity, one imagines,
as stolidly as they had faced the buffeting of the waves with
their blunt, honest bows, and disgorged sugar, rum, molasses,
coffee, or logwood sedately with their own winch and
tackle.&nbsp; But when I knew them, of exports there was never a
sign that one could detect; and all the imports I have ever seen
were some rare cargoes of tropical timber, enormous baulks
roughed out of iron trunks grown in the woods about the Gulf of
Mexico.&nbsp; They lay piled up in stacks of mighty boles, and it
was hard to believe that all this mass of dead and stripped trees
had come out of the flanks of a slender, innocent-looking little
barque with, as likely as not, a homely woman&rsquo;s
name&mdash;Ellen this or Annie that&mdash;upon her fine
bows.&nbsp; But this is generally the case with a discharged
cargo.&nbsp; Once spread at large over the quay, it looks the
most impossible bulk to have all come there out of that ship
alongside.</p>
<p>They were quiet, serene nooks in the busy world of docks,
these basins where it has never been my good luck to get a berth
after some more or less arduous passage.&nbsp; But one could see
at a glance that men and ships were never hustled there.&nbsp;
They were so quiet that, remembering them well, one comes to
doubt that they ever existed&mdash;places of repose for tired
ships to dream in, places of meditation rather than work, where
wicked ships&mdash;the cranky, the lazy, the wet, the bad sea
boats, the wild steerers, the capricious, the pig-headed, the
generally ungovernable&mdash;would have full leisure to take
count and repent of their sins, sorrowful and naked, with their
rent garments of sailcloth stripped off them, and with the dust
and ashes of the London atmosphere upon their mastheads.&nbsp;
For that the worst of ships would repent if she were ever given
time I make no doubt.&nbsp; I have known too many of them.&nbsp;
No ship is wholly bad; and now that their bodies that had braved
so many tempests have been blown off the face of the sea by a
puff of steam, the evil and the good together into the limbo of
things that have served their time, there can be no harm in
affirming that in these vanished generations of willing servants
there never has been one utterly unredeemable soul.</p>
<p>In the New South Dock there was certainly no time for remorse,
introspection, repentance, or any phenomena of inner life either
for the captive ships or for their officers.&nbsp; From six in
the morning till six at night the hard labour of the
prison-house, which rewards the valiance of ships that win the
harbour went on steadily, great slings of general cargo swinging
over the rail, to drop plumb into the hatchways at the sign of
the gangway-tender&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; The New South Dock was
especially a loading dock for the Colonies in those great (and
last) days of smart wool-clippers, good to look at
and&mdash;well&mdash;exciting to handle.&nbsp; Some of them were
more fair to see than the others; many were (to put it mildly)
somewhat over-masted; all were expected to make good passages;
and of all that line of ships, whose rigging made a thick,
enormous network against the sky, whose brasses flashed almost as
far as the eye of the policeman at the gates could reach, there
was hardly one that knew of any other port amongst all the ports
on the wide earth but London and Sydney, or London and Melbourne,
or London and Adelaide, perhaps with Hobart Town added for those
of smaller tonnage.&nbsp; One could almost have believed, as her
gray-whiskered second mate used to say of the old <i>Duke of
S&mdash;</i>, that they knew the road to the Antipodes better
than their own skippers, who, year in, year out, took them from
London&mdash;the place of captivity&mdash;to some Australian port
where, twenty-five years ago, though moored well and tight enough
to the wooden wharves, they felt themselves no captives, but
honoured guests.</p>
<h2>XXXIV.</h2>
<p>These towns of the Antipodes, not so great then as they are
now, took an interest in the shipping, the running links with
&ldquo;home,&rdquo; whose numbers confirmed the sense of their
growing importance.&nbsp; They made it part and parcel of their
daily interests.&nbsp; This was especially the case in Sydney,
where, from the heart of the fair city, down the vista of
important streets, could be seen the wool-clippers lying at the
Circular Quay&mdash;no walled prison-house of a dock that, but
the integral part of one of the finest, most beautiful, vast, and
safe bays the sun ever shone upon.&nbsp; Now great steam-liners
lie at these berths, always reserved for the sea
aristocracy&mdash;grand and imposing enough ships, but here
to-day and gone next week; whereas the general cargo, emigrant,
and passenger clippers of my time, rigged with heavy spars, and
built on fine lines, used to remain for months together waiting
for their load of wool.&nbsp; Their names attained the dignity of
household words.&nbsp; On Sundays and holidays the citizens
trooped down, on visiting bent, and the lonely officer on duty
solaced himself by playing the cicerone&mdash;especially to the
citizenesses with engaging manners and a well-developed sense of
the fun that may be got out of the inspection of a ship&rsquo;s
cabins and state-rooms.&nbsp; The tinkle of more or less untuned
cottage pianos floated out of open stern-ports till the gas-lamps
began to twinkle in the streets, and the ship&rsquo;s
night-watchman, coming sleepily on duty after his unsatisfactory
day slumbers, hauled down the flags and fastened a lighted
lantern at the break of the gangway.&nbsp; The night closed
rapidly upon the silent ships with their crews on shore.&nbsp; Up
a short, steep ascent by the King&rsquo;s Head pub., patronized
by the cooks and stewards of the fleet, the voice of a man crying
&ldquo;Hot saveloys!&rdquo; at the end of George Street, where
the cheap eating-houses (sixpence a meal) were kept by Chinamen
(Sun-kum-on&rsquo;s was not bad), is heard at regular
intervals.&nbsp; I have listened for hours to this most
pertinacious pedlar (I wonder whether he is dead or has made a
fortune), while sitting on the rail of the old <i>Duke of
S&mdash;</i> (she&rsquo;s dead, poor thing! a violent death on
the coast of New Zealand), fascinated by the monotony, the
regularity, the abruptness of the recurring cry, and so
exasperated at the absurd spell, that I wished the fellow would
choke himself to death with a mouthful of his own infamous
wares.</p>
<p>A stupid job, and fit only for an old man, my comrades used to
tell me, to be the night-watchman of a captive (though honoured)
ship.&nbsp; And generally the oldest of the able seamen in a
ship&rsquo;s crew does get it.&nbsp; But sometimes neither the
oldest nor any other fairly steady seaman is forthcoming.&nbsp;
Ships&rsquo; crews had the trick of melting away swiftly in those
days.&nbsp; So, probably on account of my youth, innocence, and
pensive habits (which made me sometimes dilatory in my work about
the rigging), I was suddenly nominated, in our chief mate Mr.
B&mdash;&rsquo;s most sardonic tones, to that enviable
situation.&nbsp; I do not regret the experience.&nbsp; The night
humours of the town descended from the street to the waterside in
the still watches of the night: larrikins rushing down in bands
to settle some quarrel by a stand-up fight, away from the police,
in an indistinct ring half hidden by piles of cargo, with the
sounds of blows, a groan now and then, the stamping of feet, and
the cry of &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; rising suddenly above the sinister
and excited murmurs; night-prowlers, pursued or pursuing, with a
stifled shriek followed by a profound silence, or slinking
stealthily alongside like ghosts, and addressing me from the quay
below in mysterious tones with incomprehensible
propositions.&nbsp; The cabmen, too, who twice a week, on the
night when the A.S.N. Company&rsquo;s passenger-boat was due to
arrive, used to range a battalion of blazing lamps opposite the
ship, were very amusing in their way.&nbsp; They got down from
their perches and told each other impolite stories in racy
language, every word of which reached me distinctly over the
bulwarks as I sat smoking on the main-hatch.&nbsp; On one
occasion I had an hour or so of a most intellectual conversation
with a person whom I could not see distinctly, a gentleman from
England, he said, with a cultivated voice, I on deck and he on
the quay sitting on the case of a piano (landed out of our hold
that very afternoon), and smoking a cigar which smelt very
good.&nbsp; We touched, in our discourse, upon science, politics,
natural history, and operatic singers.&nbsp; Then, after
remarking abruptly, &ldquo;You seem to be rather intelligent, my
man,&rdquo; he informed me pointedly that his name was Mr.
Senior, and walked off&mdash;to his hotel, I suppose.&nbsp;
Shadows!&nbsp; Shadows!&nbsp; I think I saw a white whisker as he
turned under the lamp-post.&nbsp; It is a shock to think that in
the natural course of nature he must be dead by now.&nbsp; There
was nothing to object to in his intelligence but a little
dogmatism maybe.&nbsp; And his name was Senior!&nbsp; Mr.
Senior!</p>
<p>The position had its drawbacks, however.&nbsp; One wintry,
blustering, dark night in July, as I stood sleepily out of the
rain under the break of the poop something resembling an ostrich
dashed up the gangway.&nbsp; I say ostrich because the creature,
though it ran on two legs, appeared to help its progress by
working a pair of short wings; it was a man, however, only his
coat, ripped up the back and flapping in two halves above his
shoulders, gave him that weird and fowl-like appearance.&nbsp; At
least, I suppose it was his coat, for it was impossible to make
him out distinctly.&nbsp; How he managed to come so straight upon
me, at speed and without a stumble over a strange deck, I cannot
imagine.&nbsp; He must have been able to see in the dark better
than any cat.&nbsp; He overwhelmed me with panting entreaties to
let him take shelter till morning in our forecastle.&nbsp;
Following my strict orders, I refused his request, mildly at
first, in a sterner tone as he insisted with growing
impudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake let me, matey!&nbsp; Some of
&rsquo;em are after me&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got hold of a ticker
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You clear out of this!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard on a chap, old man!&rdquo; he
whined pitifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, get ashore at once.&nbsp; Do you
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence.&nbsp; He appeared to cringe, mute, as if words had
failed him through grief; then&mdash;bang! came a concussion and
a great flash of light in which he vanished, leaving me prone on
my back with the most abominable black eye that anybody ever got
in the faithful discharge of duty.&nbsp; Shadows!&nbsp;
Shadows!&nbsp; I hope he escaped the enemies he was fleeing from
to live and flourish to this day.&nbsp; But his fist was
uncommonly hard and his aim miraculously true in the dark.</p>
<p>There were other experiences, less painful and more funny for
the most part, with one amongst them of a dramatic complexion;
but the greatest experience of them all was Mr. B&mdash;, our
chief mate himself.</p>
<p>He used to go ashore every night to foregather in some
hotel&rsquo;s parlour with his crony, the mate of the barque
<i>Cicero</i>, lying on the other side of the Circular
Quay.&nbsp; Late at night I would hear from afar their stumbling
footsteps and their voices raised in endless argument.&nbsp; The
mate of the <i>Cicero</i> was seeing his friend on board.&nbsp;
They would continue their senseless and muddled discourse in
tones of profound friendship for half an hour or so at the shore
end of our gangway, and then I would hear Mr. B&mdash; insisting
that he must see the other on board his ship.&nbsp; And away they
would go, their voices, still conversing with excessive amity,
being heard moving all round the harbour.&nbsp; It happened more
than once that they would thus perambulate three or four times
the distance, each seeing the other on board his ship out of pure
and disinterested affection.&nbsp; Then, through sheer weariness,
or perhaps in a moment of forgetfulness, they would manage to
part from each other somehow, and by-and-by the planks of our
long gangway would bend and creak under the weight of Mr.
B&mdash; coming on board for good at last.</p>
<p>On the rail his burly form would stop and stand swaying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watchman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>He waited for a moment of steadiness before negotiating the
three steps of the inside ladder from rail to deck; and the
watchman, taught by experience, would forbear offering help which
would be received as an insult at that particular stage of the
mate&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; But many times I trembled for his
neck.&nbsp; He was a heavy man.</p>
<p>Then with a rush and a thump it would be done.&nbsp; He never
had to pick himself up; but it took him a minute or so to pull
himself together after the descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watchman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Our dog was a gaunt and unpleasant beast, more like a wolf in
poor health than a dog, and I never noticed Mr. B&mdash; at any
other time show the slightest interest in the doings of the
animal.&nbsp; But that question never failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have your arm to steady me
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was always prepared for that request.&nbsp; He leaned on me
heavily till near enough the cabin-door to catch hold of the
handle.&nbsp; Then he would let go my arm at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; I can manage now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he could manage.&nbsp; He could manage to find his way
into his berth, light his lamp, get into his bed&mdash;ay, and
get out of it when I called him at half-past five, the first man
on deck, lifting the cup of morning coffee to his lips with a
steady hand, ready for duty as though he had virtuously slept ten
solid hours&mdash;a better chief officer than many a man who had
never tasted grog in his life.&nbsp; He could manage all that,
but could never manage to get on in life.</p>
<p>Only once he failed to seize the cabin-door handle at the
first grab.&nbsp; He waited a little, tried again, and again
failed.&nbsp; His weight was growing heavier on my arm.&nbsp; He
sighed slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n that handle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without letting go his hold of me he turned about, his face
lit up bright as day by the full moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she were out at sea,&rdquo; he growled
savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt the need to say something, because he hung on to me as
if lost, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ports are no good&mdash;ships rot, men go to the
devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I kept still, and after a while he repeated with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she were at sea out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, sir,&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
<p>Holding my shoulder, he turned upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that to you where she is?&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t&mdash;drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And even on that night he &ldquo;managed it&rdquo; at
last.&nbsp; He got hold of the handle.&nbsp; But he did not
manage to light his lamp (I don&rsquo;t think he even tried),
though in the morning as usual he was the first on deck,
bull-necked, curly-headed, watching the hands turn-to with his
sardonic expression and unflinching gaze.</p>
<p>I met him ten years afterwards, casually, unexpectedly, in the
street, on coming out of my consignee office.&nbsp; I was not
likely to have forgotten him with his &ldquo;I can manage
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; He recognised me at once, remembered my name,
and in what ship I had served under his orders.&nbsp; He looked
me over from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am commanding a little barque,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;loading here for Mauritius.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
thoughtlessly, I added: &ldquo;And what are you doing, Mr.
B-?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he said, looking at me unflinchingly, with
his old sardonic grin&mdash;&ldquo;I am looking for something to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt I would rather have bitten out my tongue.&nbsp; His
jet-black, curly hair had turned iron-gray; he was scrupulously
neat as ever, but frightfully threadbare.&nbsp; His shiny boots
were worn down at heel.&nbsp; But he forgave me, and we drove off
together in a hansom to dine on board my ship.&nbsp; He went over
her conscientiously, praised her heartily, congratulated me on my
command with absolute sincerity.&nbsp; At dinner, as I offered
him wine and beer he shook his head, and as I sat looking at him
interrogatively, muttered in an undertone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner we came again on deck.&nbsp; It seemed as though
he could not tear himself away from the ship.&nbsp; We were
fitting some new lower rigging, and he hung about, approving,
suggesting, giving me advice in his old manner.&nbsp; Twice he
addressed me as &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; and corrected himself
quickly to &ldquo;Captain.&rdquo;&nbsp; My mate was about to
leave me (to get married), but I concealed the fact from Mr.
B&mdash;.&nbsp; I was afraid he would ask me to give him the
berth in some ghastly jocular hint that I could not refuse to
take.&nbsp; I was afraid.&nbsp; It would have been
impossible.&nbsp; I could not have given orders to Mr. B&mdash;,
and I am sure he would not have taken them from me very
long.&nbsp; He could not have managed that, though he had managed
to break himself from drink&mdash;too late.</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>He
said good-bye at last.&nbsp; As I watched his burly, bull-necked
figure walk away up the street, I wondered with a sinking heart
whether he had much more than the price of a night&rsquo;s
lodging in his pocket.&nbsp; And I understood that if that very
minute I were to call out after him, he would not even turn his
head.&nbsp; He, too, is no more than a shadow, but I seem to hear
his words spoken on the moonlit deck of the old <i>Duke</i>
&mdash;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ports are no good&mdash;ships rot, men go to the
devil!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XXXV.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ships!&rdquo; exclaimed an elderly seaman in clean
shore togs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ships&rdquo;&mdash;and his keen glance,
turning away from my face, ran along the vista of magnificent
figure-heads that in the late seventies used to overhang in a
serried rank the muddy pavement by the side of the New South
Dock&mdash;&ldquo;ships are all right; it&rsquo;s the men in
&rsquo;em. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifty hulls, at least, moulded on lines of beauty and
speed&mdash;hulls of wood, of iron, expressing in their forms the
highest achievement of modern ship-building&mdash;lay moored all
in a row, stem to quay, as if assembled there for an exhibition,
not of a great industry, but of a great art.&nbsp; Their colours
were gray, black, dark green, with a narrow strip of yellow
moulding defining their sheer, or with a row of painted ports
decking in warlike decoration their robust flanks of
cargo-carriers that would know no triumph but of speed in
carrying a burden, no glory other than of a long service, no
victory but that of an endless, obscure contest with the
sea.&nbsp; The great empty hulls with swept holds, just out of
dry-dock, with their paint glistening freshly, sat high-sided
with ponderous dignity alongside the wooden jetties, looking more
like unmovable buildings than things meant to go afloat; others,
half loaded, far on the way to recover the true sea-physiognomy
of a ship brought down to her load-line, looked more
accessible.&nbsp; Their less steeply slanting gangways seemed to
invite the strolling sailors in search of a berth to walk on
board and try &ldquo;for a chance&rdquo; with the chief mate, the
guardian of a ship&rsquo;s efficiency.&nbsp; As if anxious to
remain unperceived amongst their overtopping sisters, two or
three &ldquo;finished&rdquo; ships floated low, with an air of
straining at the leash of their level headfasts, exposing to view
their cleared decks and covered hatches, prepared to drop stern
first out of the labouring ranks, displaying the true comeliness
of form which only her proper sea-trim gives to a ship.&nbsp; And
for a good quarter of a mile, from the dockyard gate to the
farthest corner, where the old housed-in hulk, the
<i>President</i> (drill-ship, then, of the Naval Reserve), used
to lie with her frigate side rubbing against the stone of the
quay, above all these hulls, ready and unready, a hundred and
fifty lofty masts, more or less, held out the web of their
rigging like an immense net, in whose close mesh, black against
the sky, the heavy yards seemed to be entangled and
suspended.</p>
<p>It was a sight.&nbsp; The humblest craft that floats makes its
appeal to a seaman by the faithfulness of her life; and this was
the place where one beheld the aristocracy of ships.&nbsp; It was
a noble gathering of the fairest and the swiftest, each bearing
at the bow the carved emblem of her name, as in a gallery of
plaster-casts, figures of women with mural crowns, women with
flowing robes, with gold fillets on their hair or blue scarves
round their waists, stretching out rounded arms as if to point
the way; heads of men helmeted or bare; full lengths of warriors,
of kings, of statesmen, of lords and princesses, all white from
top to toe; with here and there a dusky turbaned figure,
bedizened in many colours, of some Eastern sultan or hero, all
inclined forward under the slant of mighty bowsprits as if eager
to begin another run of 11,000 miles in their leaning
attitudes.&nbsp; These were the fine figure-heads of the finest
ships afloat.&nbsp; But why, unless for the love of the life
those effigies shared with us in their wandering impassivity,
should one try to reproduce in words an impression of whose
fidelity there can be no critic and no judge, since such an
exhibition of the art of shipbuilding and the art of figure-head
carving as was seen from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end in
the open-air gallery of the New South Dock no man&rsquo;s eye
shall behold again?&nbsp; All that patient, pale company of
queens and princesses, of kings and warriors, of allegorical
women, of heroines and statesmen and heathen gods, crowned,
helmeted, bare-headed, has run for good off the sea stretching to
the last above the tumbling foam their fair, rounded arms;
holding out their spears, swords, shields, tridents in the same
unwearied, striving forward pose.&nbsp; And nothing remains but
lingering perhaps in the memory of a few men, the sound of their
names, vanished a long time ago from the first page of the great
London dailies; from big posters in railway-stations and the
doors of shipping offices; from the minds of sailors,
dockmasters, pilots, and tugmen; from the hail of gruff voices
and the flutter of signal flags exchanged between ships closing
upon each other and drawing apart in the open immensity of the
sea.</p>
<p>The elderly, respectable seaman, withdrawing his gaze from
that multitude of spars, gave me a glance to make sure of our
fellowship in the craft and mystery of the sea.&nbsp; We had met
casually, and had got into contact as I had stopped near him, my
attention being caught by the same peculiarity he was looking at
in the rigging of an obviously new ship, a ship with her
reputation all to make yet in the talk of the seamen who were to
share their life with her.&nbsp; Her name was already on their
lips.&nbsp; I had heard it uttered between two thick, red-necked
fellows of the semi-nautical type at the Fenchurch Street
Railway-station, where, in those days, the everyday male crowd
was attired in jerseys and pilot-cloth mostly, and had the air of
being more conversant with the times of high-water than with the
times of the trains.&nbsp; I had noticed that new ship&rsquo;s
name on the first page of my morning paper.&nbsp; I had stared at
the unfamiliar grouping of its letters, blue on white ground, on
the advertisement-boards, whenever the train came to a standstill
alongside one of the shabby, wooden, wharf-like platforms of the
dock railway-line.&nbsp; She had been named, with proper
observances, on the day she came off the stocks, no doubt, but
she was very far yet from &ldquo;having a name.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Untried, ignorant of the ways of the sea, she had been thrust
amongst that renowned company of ships to load for her maiden
voyage.&nbsp; There was nothing to vouch for her soundness and
the worth of her character, but the reputation of the
building-yard whence she was launched headlong into the world of
waters.&nbsp; She looked modest to me.&nbsp; I imagined her
diffident, lying very quiet, with her side nestling shyly against
the wharf to which she was made fast with very new lines,
intimidated by the company of her tried and experienced sisters
already familiar with all the violences of the ocean and the
exacting love of men.&nbsp; They had had more long voyages to
make their names in than she had known weeks of carefully tended
life, for a new ship receives as much attention as if she were a
young bride.&nbsp; Even crabbed old dock-masters look at her with
benevolent eyes.&nbsp; In her shyness at the threshold of a
laborious and uncertain life, where so much is expected of a
ship, she could not have been better heartened and comforted, had
she only been able to hear and understand, than by the tone of
deep conviction in which my elderly, respectable seaman repeated
the first part of his saying, &ldquo;Ships are all right . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His civility prevented him from repeating the other, the
bitter part.&nbsp; It had occurred to him that it was perhaps
indelicate to insist.&nbsp; He had recognised in me a
ship&rsquo;s officer, very possibly looking for a berth like
himself, and so far a comrade, but still a man belonging to that
sparsely-peopled after-end of a ship, where a great part of her
reputation as a &ldquo;good ship,&rdquo; in seaman&rsquo;s
parlance, is made or marred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you say that of all ships without exception?&rdquo;
I asked, being in an idle mood, because, if an obvious
ship&rsquo;s officer, I was not, as a matter of fact, down at the
docks to &ldquo;look for a berth,&rdquo; an occupation as
engrossing as gambling, and as little favourable to the free
exchange of ideas, besides being destructive of the kindly temper
needed for casual intercourse with one&rsquo;s
fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can always put up with &rsquo;em,&rdquo; opined the
respectable seaman judicially.</p>
<p>He was not averse from talking, either.&nbsp; If he had come
down to the dock to look for a berth, he did not seem oppressed
by anxiety as to his chances.&nbsp; He had the serenity of a man
whose estimable character is fortunately expressed by his
personal appearance in an unobtrusive, yet convincing, manner
which no chief officer in want of hands could resist.&nbsp; And,
true enough, I learned presently that the mate of the
<i>Hyperion</i> had &ldquo;taken down&rdquo; his name for
quarter-master.&nbsp; &ldquo;We sign on Friday, and join next day
for the morning tide,&rdquo; he remarked, in a deliberate,
careless tone, which contrasted strongly with his evident
readiness to stand there yarning for an hour or so with an utter
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hyperion</i>,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t remember ever seeing that ship anywhere.&nbsp; What
sort of a name has she got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared from his discursive answer that she had not much
of a name one way or another.&nbsp; She was not very fast.&nbsp;
It took no fool, though, to steer her straight, he
believed.&nbsp; Some years ago he had seen her in Calcutta, and
he remembered being told by somebody then, that on her passage up
the river she had carried away both her hawse-pipes.&nbsp; But
that might have been the pilot&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; Just now,
yarning with the apprentices on board, he had heard that this
very voyage, brought up in the Downs, outward bound, she broke
her sheer, struck adrift, and lost an anchor and chain.&nbsp; But
that might have occurred through want of careful tending in a
tideway.&nbsp; All the same, this looked as though she were
pretty hard on her ground-tackle.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;
She seemed a heavy ship to handle, anyway.&nbsp; For the rest, as
she had a new captain and a new mate this voyage, he understood,
one couldn&rsquo;t say how she would turn out. . . .</p>
<p>In such marine shore-talk as this is the name of a ship slowly
established, her fame made for her, the tale of her qualities and
of her defects kept, her idiosyncrasies commented upon with the
zest of personal gossip, her achievements made much of, her
faults glossed over as things that, being without remedy in our
imperfect world, should not be dwelt upon too much by men who,
with the help of ships, wrest out a bitter living from the rough
grasp of the sea.&nbsp; All that talk makes up her
&ldquo;name,&rdquo; which is handed over from one crew to another
without bitterness, without animosity, with the indulgence of
mutual dependence, and with the feeling of close association in
the exercise of her perfections and in the danger of her
defects.</p>
<p>This feeling explains men&rsquo;s pride in ships.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ships are all right,&rdquo; as my middle-aged, respectable
quartermaster said with much conviction and some irony; but they
are not exactly what men make them.&nbsp; They have their own
nature; they can of themselves minister to our self-esteem by the
demand their qualities make upon our skill and their shortcomings
upon our hardiness and endurance.&nbsp; Which is the more
flattering exaction it is hard to say; but there is the fact that
in listening for upwards of twenty years to the sea-talk that
goes on afloat and ashore I have never detected the true note of
animosity.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t deny that at sea, sometimes, the
note of profanity was audible enough in those chiding
interpellations a wet, cold, weary seaman addresses to his ship,
and in moments of exasperation is disposed to extend to all ships
that ever were launched&mdash;to the whole everlastingly exacting
brood that swims in deep waters.&nbsp; And I have heard curses
launched at the unstable element itself, whose fascination,
outlasting the accumulated experience of ages, had captured him
as it had captured the generations of his forebears.</p>
<p>For all that has been said of the love that certain natures
(on shore) have professed to feel for it, for all the
celebrations it had been the object of in prose and song, the sea
has never been friendly to man.&nbsp; At most it has been the
accomplice of human restlessness, and playing the part of
dangerous abettor of world-wide ambitions.&nbsp; Faithful to no
race after the manner of the kindly earth, receiving no impress
from valour and toil and self-sacrifice, recognising no finality
of dominion, the sea has never adopted the cause of its masters
like those lands where the victorious nations of mankind have
taken root, rocking their cradles and setting up their
gravestones.&nbsp; He&mdash;man or people&mdash;who, putting his
trust in the friendship of the sea, neglects the strength and
cunning of his right hand, is a fool!&nbsp; As if it were too
great, too mighty for common virtues, the ocean has no
compassion, no faith, no law, no memory.&nbsp; Its fickleness is
to be held true to men&rsquo;s purposes only by an undaunted
resolution and by a sleepless, armed, jealous vigilance, in
which, perhaps, there has always been more hate than love.&nbsp;
<i>Odi et amo</i> may well be the confession of those who
consciously or blindly have surrendered their existence to the
fascination of the sea.&nbsp; All the tempestuous passions of
mankind&rsquo;s young days, the love of loot and the love of
glory, the love of adventure and the love of danger, with the
great love of the unknown and vast dreams of dominion and power,
have passed like images reflected from a mirror, leaving no
record upon the mysterious face of the sea.&nbsp; Impenetrable
and heartless, the sea has given nothing of itself to the suitors
for its precarious favours.&nbsp; Unlike the earth, it cannot be
subjugated at any cost of patience and toil.&nbsp; For all its
fascination that has lured so many to a violent death, its
immensity has never been loved as the mountains, the plains, the
desert itself, have been loved.&nbsp; Indeed, I suspect that,
leaving aside the protestations and tributes of writers who, one
is safe in saying, care for little else in the world than the
rhythm of their lines and the cadence of their phrase, the love
of the sea, to which some men and nations confess so readily, is
a complex sentiment wherein pride enters for much, necessity for
not a little, and the love of ships&mdash;the untiring servants
of our hopes and our self-esteem&mdash;for the best and most
genuine part.&nbsp; For the hundreds who have reviled the sea,
beginning with Shakespeare in the line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;More fell than hunger, anguish, or the
sea,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>down to the last obscure sea-dog of the &ldquo;old
model,&rdquo; having but few words and still fewer thoughts,
there could not be found, I believe, one sailor who has ever
coupled a curse with the good or bad name of a ship.&nbsp; If
ever his profanity, provoked by the hardships of the sea, went so
far as to touch his ship, it would be lightly, as a hand may,
without sin, be laid in the way of kindness on a woman.</p>
<h2>XXXVI.</h2>
<p>The love that is given to ships is profoundly different from
the love men feel for every other work of their hands&mdash;the
love they bear to their houses, for instance&mdash;because it is
untainted by the pride of possession.&nbsp; The pride of skill,
the pride of responsibility, the pride of endurance there may be,
but otherwise it is a disinterested sentiment.&nbsp; No seaman
ever cherished a ship, even if she belonged to him, merely
because of the profit she put in his pocket.&nbsp; No one, I
think, ever did; for a ship-owner, even of the best, has always
been outside the pale of that sentiment embracing in a feeling of
intimate, equal fellowship the ship and the man, backing each
other against the implacable, if sometimes dissembled, hostility
of their world of waters.&nbsp; The sea&mdash;this truth must be
confessed&mdash;has no generosity.&nbsp; No display of manly
qualities&mdash;courage, hardihood, endurance,
faithfulness&mdash;has ever been known to touch its irresponsible
consciousness of power.&nbsp; The ocean has the conscienceless
temper of a savage autocrat spoiled by much adulation.&nbsp; He
cannot brook the slightest appearance of defiance, and has
remained the irreconcilable enemy of ships and men ever since
ships and men had the unheard of audacity to go afloat together
in the face of his frown.&nbsp; From that day he has gone on
swallowing up fleets and men without his resentment being glutted
by the number of victims&mdash;by so many wrecked ships and
wrecked lives.&nbsp; To-day, as ever, he is ready to beguile and
betray, to smash and to drown the incorrigible optimism of men
who, backed by the fidelity of ships, are trying to wrest from
him the fortune of their house, the dominion of their world, or
only a dole of food for their hunger.&nbsp; If not always in the
hot mood to smash, he is always stealthily ready for a
drowning.&nbsp; The most amazing wonder of the deep is its
unfathomable cruelty.</p>
<p>I felt its dread for the first time in mid-Atlantic one day,
many years ago, when we took off the crew of a Danish brig
homeward bound from the West Indies.&nbsp; A thin, silvery mist
softened the calm and majestic splendour of light without
shadows&mdash;seemed to render the sky less remote and the ocean
less immense.&nbsp; It was one of the days, when the might of the
sea appears indeed lovable, like the nature of a strong man in
moments of quiet intimacy.&nbsp; At sunrise we had made out a
black speck to the westward, apparently suspended high up in the
void behind a stirring, shimmering veil of silvery blue gauze
that seemed at times to stir and float in the breeze which fanned
us slowly along.&nbsp; The peace of that enchanting forenoon was
so profound, so untroubled, that it seemed that every word
pronounced loudly on our deck would penetrate to the very heart
of that infinite mystery born from the conjunction of water and
sky.&nbsp; We did not raise our voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
water-logged derelict, I think, sir,&rdquo; said the second
officer quietly, coming down from aloft with the binoculars in
their case slung across his shoulders; and our captain, without a
word, signed to the helmsman to steer for the black speck.&nbsp;
Presently we made out a low, jagged stump sticking up
forward&mdash;all that remained of her departed masts.</p>
<p>The captain was expatiating in a low conversational tone to
the chief mate upon the danger of these derelicts, and upon his
dread of coming upon them at night, when suddenly a man forward
screamed out, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s people on board of her,
sir!&nbsp; I see them!&rdquo; in a most extraordinary
voice&mdash;a voice never heard before in our ship; the amazing
voice of a stranger.&nbsp; It gave the signal for a sudden tumult
of shouts.&nbsp; The watch below ran up the forecastle head in a
body, the cook dashed out of the galley.&nbsp; Everybody saw the
poor fellows now.&nbsp; They were there!&nbsp; And all at once
our ship, which had the well-earned name of being without a rival
for speed in light winds, seemed to us to have lost the power of
motion, as if the sea, becoming viscous, had clung to her
sides.&nbsp; And yet she moved.&nbsp; Immensity, the inseparable
companion of a ship&rsquo;s life, chose that day to breathe upon
her as gently as a sleeping child.&nbsp; The clamour of our
excitement had died out, and our living ship, famous for never
losing steerage way as long as there was air enough to float a
feather, stole, without a ripple, silent and white as a ghost,
towards her mutilated and wounded sister, come upon at the point
of death in the sunlit haze of a calm day at sea.</p>
<p>With the binoculars glued to his eyes, the captain said in a
quavering tone: &ldquo;They are waving to us with something aft
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; He put down the glasses on the skylight
brusquely, and began to walk about the poop.&nbsp; &ldquo;A shirt
or a flag,&rdquo; he ejaculated irritably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make it out. . . Some damn rag or
other!&rdquo;&nbsp; He took a few more turns on the poop,
glancing down over the rail now and then to see how fast we were
moving.&nbsp; His nervous footsteps rang sharply in the quiet of
the ship, where the other men, all looking the same way, had
forgotten themselves in a staring immobility.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
will never do!&rdquo; he cried out suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lower
the boats at once!&nbsp; Down with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I jumped into mine he took me aside, as being an
inexperienced junior, for a word of warning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look out as you come alongside that she
doesn&rsquo;t take you down with her.&nbsp; You
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He murmured this confidentially, so that none of the men at
the falls should overhear, and I was shocked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heavens! as if in such an emergency one stopped to think
of danger!&rdquo; I exclaimed to myself mentally, in scorn of
such cold-blooded caution.</p>
<p>It takes many lessons to make a real seaman, and I got my
rebuke at once.&nbsp; My experienced commander seemed in one
searching glance to read my thoughts on my ingenuous face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re going for is to save life, not to
drown your boat&rsquo;s crew for nothing,&rdquo; he growled
severely in my ear.&nbsp; But as we shoved off he leaned over and
cried out: &ldquo;It all rests on the power of your arms,
men.&nbsp; Give way for life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made a race of it, and I would never have believed that a
common boat&rsquo;s crew of a merchantman could keep up so much
determined fierceness in the regular swing of their stroke.&nbsp;
What our captain had clearly perceived before we left had become
plain to all of us since.&nbsp; The issue of our enterprise hung
on a hair above that abyss of waters which will not give up its
dead till the Day of Judgment.&nbsp; It was a race of two
ship&rsquo;s boats matched against Death for a prize of nine
men&rsquo;s lives, and Death had a long start.&nbsp; We saw the
crew of the brig from afar working at the pumps&mdash;still
pumping on that wreck, which already had settled so far down that
the gentle, low swell, over which our boats rose and fell easily
without a check to their speed, welling up almost level with her
head-rails, plucked at the ends of broken gear swinging
desolately under her naked bowsprit.</p>
<p>We could not, in all conscience, have picked out a better day
for our regatta had we had the free choice of all the days that
ever dawned upon the lonely struggles and solitary agonies of
ships since the Norse rovers first steered to the westward
against the run of Atlantic waves.&nbsp; It was a very good
race.&nbsp; At the finish there was not an oar&rsquo;s length
between the first and second boat, with Death coming in a good
third on the top of the very next smooth swell, for all one knew
to the contrary.&nbsp; The scuppers of the brig gurgled softly
all together when the water rising against her sides subsided
sleepily with a low wash, as if playing about an immovable
rock.&nbsp; Her bulwarks were gone fore and aft, and one saw her
bare deck low-lying like a raft and swept clean of boats, spars,
houses&mdash;of everything except the ringbolts and the heads of
the pumps.&nbsp; I had one dismal glimpse of it as I braced
myself up to receive upon my breast the last man to leave her,
the captain, who literally let himself fall into my arms.</p>
<p>It had been a weirdly silent rescue&mdash;a rescue without a
hail, without a single uttered word, without a gesture or a sign,
without a conscious exchange of glances.&nbsp; Up to the very
last moment those on board stuck to their pumps, which spouted
two clear streams of water upon their bare feet.&nbsp; Their
brown skin showed through the rents of their shirts; and the two
small bunches of half-naked, tattered men went on bowing from the
waist to each other in their back-breaking labour, up and down,
absorbed, with no time for a glance over the shoulder at the help
that was coming to them.&nbsp; As we dashed, unregarded,
alongside a voice let out one, only one hoarse howl of command,
and then, just as they stood, without caps, with the salt drying
gray in the wrinkles and folds of their hairy, haggard faces,
blinking stupidly at us their red eyelids, they made a bolt away
from the handles, tottering and jostling against each other, and
positively flung themselves over upon our very heads.&nbsp; The
clatter they made tumbling into the boats had an extraordinarily
destructive effect upon the illusion of tragic dignity our
self-esteem had thrown over the contests of mankind with the
sea.&nbsp; On that exquisite day of gently breathing peace and
veiled sunshine perished my romantic love to what men&rsquo;s
imagination had proclaimed the most august aspect of
Nature.&nbsp; The cynical indifference of the sea to the merits
of human suffering and courage, laid bare in this ridiculous,
panic-tainted performance extorted from the dire extremity of
nine good and honourable seamen, revolted me.&nbsp; I saw the
duplicity of the sea&rsquo;s most tender mood.&nbsp; It was so
because it could not help itself, but the awed respect of the
early days was gone.&nbsp; I felt ready to smile bitterly at its
enchanting charm and glare viciously at its furies.&nbsp; In a
moment, before we shoved off, I had looked coolly at the life of
my choice.&nbsp; Its illusions were gone, but its fascination
remained.&nbsp; I had become a seaman at last.</p>
<p>We pulled hard for a quarter of an hour, then laid on our oars
waiting for our ship.&nbsp; She was coming down on us with
swelling sails, looking delicately tall and exquisitely noble
through the mist.&nbsp; The captain of the brig, who sat in the
stern sheets by my side with his face in his hands, raised his
head and began to speak with a sort of sombre volubility.&nbsp;
They had lost their masts and sprung a leak in a hurricane;
drifted for weeks, always at the pumps, met more bad weather; the
ships they sighted failed to make them out, the leak gained upon
them slowly, and the seas had left them nothing to make a raft
of.&nbsp; It was very hard to see ship after ship pass by at a
distance, &ldquo;as if everybody had agreed that we must be left
to drown,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; But they went on trying to keep
the brig afloat as long as possible, and working the pumps
constantly on insufficient food, mostly raw, till
&ldquo;yesterday evening,&rdquo; he continued monotonously,
&ldquo;just as the sun went down, the men&rsquo;s hearts
broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made an almost imperceptible pause here, and went on again
with exactly the same intonation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me the brig could not be saved, and they
thought they had done enough for themselves.&nbsp; I said nothing
to that.&nbsp; It was true.&nbsp; It was no mutiny.&nbsp; I had
nothing to say to them.&nbsp; They lay about aft all night, as
still as so many dead men.&nbsp; I did not lie down.&nbsp; I kept
a look-out.&nbsp; When the first light came I saw your ship at
once.&nbsp; I waited for more light; the breeze began to fail on
my face.&nbsp; Then I shouted out as loud as I was able,
&lsquo;Look at that ship!&rsquo; but only two men got up very
slowly and came to me.&nbsp; At first only we three stood alone,
for a long time, watching you coming down to us, and feeling the
breeze drop to a calm almost; but afterwards others, too, rose,
one after another, and by-and-by I had all my crew behind
me.&nbsp; I turned round and said to them that they could see the
ship was coming our way, but in this small breeze she might come
too late after all, unless we turned to and tried to keep the
brig afloat long enough to give you time to save us all.&nbsp; I
spoke like that to them, and then I gave the command to man the
pumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave the command, and gave the example, too, by going
himself to the handles, but it seems that these men did actually
hang back for a moment, looking at each other dubiously before
they followed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke
out into a most unexpected, imbecile, pathetic, nervous little
giggle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their hearts were broken so!&nbsp; They had
been played with too long,&rdquo; he explained apologetically,
lowering his eyes, and became silent.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years is a long time&mdash;a quarter of a century
is a dim and distant past; but to this day I remember the
dark-brown feet, hands, and faces of two of these men whose
hearts had been broken by the sea.&nbsp; They were lying very
still on their sides on the bottom boards between the thwarts,
curled up like dogs.&nbsp; My boat&rsquo;s crew, leaning over the
looms of their oars, stared and listened as if at the play.&nbsp;
The master of the brig looked up suddenly to ask me what day it
was.</p>
<p>They had lost the date.&nbsp; When I told him it was Sunday,
the 22nd, he frowned, making some mental calculation, then nodded
twice sadly to himself, staring at nothing.</p>
<p>His aspect was miserably unkempt and wildly sorrowful.&nbsp;
Had it not been for the unquenchable candour of his blue eyes,
whose unhappy, tired glance every moment sought his abandoned,
sinking brig, as if it could find rest nowhere else, he would
have appeared mad.&nbsp; But he was too simple to go mad, too
simple with that manly simplicity which alone can bear men
unscathed in mind and body through an encounter with the deadly
playfulness of the sea or with its less abominable fury.</p>
<p>Neither angry, nor playful, nor smiling, it enveloped our
distant ship growing bigger as she neared us, our boats with the
rescued men and the dismantled hull of the brig we were leaving
behind, in the large and placid embrace of its quietness, half
lost in the fair haze, as if in a dream of infinite and tender
clemency.&nbsp; There was no frown, no wrinkle on its face, not a
ripple.&nbsp; And the run of the slight swell was so smooth that
it resembled the graceful undulation of a piece of shimmering
gray silk shot with gleams of green.&nbsp; We pulled an easy
stroke; but when the master of the brig, after a glance over his
shoulder, stood up with a low exclamation, my men feathered their
oars instinctively, without an order, and the boat lost her
way.</p>
<p>He was steadying himself on my shoulder with a strong grip,
while his other arm, flung up rigidly, pointed a denunciatory
finger at the immense tranquillity of the ocean.&nbsp; After his
first exclamation, which stopped the swing of our oars, he made
no sound, but his whole attitude seemed to cry out an indignant
&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; . . . I could not imagine what vision of
evil had come to him.&nbsp; I was startled, and the amazing
energy of his immobilized gesture made my heart beat faster with
the anticipation of something monstrous and unsuspected.&nbsp;
The stillness around us became crushing.</p>
<p>For a moment the succession of silky undulations ran on
innocently.&nbsp; I saw each of them swell up the misty line of
the horizon, far, far away beyond the derelict brig, and the next
moment, with a slight friendly toss of our boat, it had passed
under us and was gone.&nbsp; The lulling cadence of the rise and
fall, the invariable gentleness of this irresistible force, the
great charm of the deep waters, warmed my breast deliciously,
like the subtle poison of a love-potion.&nbsp; But all this
lasted only a few soothing seconds before I jumped up too, making
the boat roll like the veriest landlubber.</p>
<p>Something startling, mysterious, hastily confused, was taking
place.&nbsp; I watched it with incredulous and fascinated awe, as
one watches the confused, swift movements of some deed of
violence done in the dark.&nbsp; As if at a given signal, the run
of the smooth undulations seemed checked suddenly around the
brig.&nbsp; By a strange optical delusion the whole sea appeared
to rise upon her in one overwhelming heave of its silky surface,
where in one spot a smother of foam broke out ferociously.&nbsp;
And then the effort subsided.&nbsp; It was all over, and the
smooth swell ran on as before from the horizon in uninterrupted
cadence of motion, passing under us with a slight friendly toss
of our boat.&nbsp; Far away, where the brig had been, an angry
white stain undulating on the surface of steely-gray waters, shot
with gleams of green, diminished swiftly, without a hiss, like a
patch of pure snow melting in the sun.&nbsp; And the great
stillness after this initiation into the sea&rsquo;s implacable
hate seemed full of dread thoughts and shadows of disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; ejaculated from the depths of his chest my
bowman in a final tone.&nbsp; He spat in his hands, and took a
better grip on his oar.&nbsp; The captain of the brig lowered his
rigid arm slowly, and looked at our faces in a solemnly conscious
silence, which called upon us to share in his simple-minded,
marvelling awe.&nbsp; All at once he sat down by my side, and
leaned forward earnestly at my boat&rsquo;s crew, who, swinging
together in a long, easy stroke, kept their eyes fixed upon him
faithfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ship could have done so well,&rdquo; he addressed
them firmly, after a moment of strained silence, during which he
seemed with trembling lips to seek for words fit to bear such
high testimony.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was small, but she was
good.&nbsp; I had no anxiety.&nbsp; She was strong.&nbsp; Last
voyage I had my wife and two children in her.&nbsp; No other ship
could have stood so long the weather she had to live through for
days and days before we got dismasted a fortnight ago.&nbsp; She
was fairly worn out, and that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; You may believe
me.&nbsp; She lasted under us for days and days, but she could
not last for ever.&nbsp; It was long enough.&nbsp; I am glad it
is over.&nbsp; No better ship was ever left to sink at sea on
such a day as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was competent to pronounce the funereal oration of a ship,
this son of ancient sea-folk, whose national existence, so little
stained by the excesses of manly virtues, had demanded nothing
but the merest foothold from the earth.&nbsp; By the merits of
his sea-wise forefathers and by the artlessness of his heart, he
was made fit to deliver this excellent discourse.&nbsp; There was
nothing wanting in its orderly arrangement&mdash;neither piety
nor faith, nor the tribute of praise due to the worthy dead, with
the edifying recital of their achievement.&nbsp; She had lived,
he had loved her; she had suffered, and he was glad she was at
rest.&nbsp; It was an excellent discourse.&nbsp; And it was
orthodox, too, in its fidelity to the cardinal article of a
seaman&rsquo;s faith, of which it was a single-minded
confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ships are all right.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
are.&nbsp; They who live with the sea have got to hold by that
creed first and last; and it came to me, as I glanced at him
sideways, that some men were not altogether unworthy in honour
and conscience to pronounce the funereal eulogium of a
ship&rsquo;s constancy in life and death.</p>
<p>After this, sitting by my side with his loosely-clasped hands
hanging between his knees, he uttered no word, made no movement
till the shadow of our ship&rsquo;s sails fell on the boat, when,
at the loud cheer greeting the return of the victors with their
prize, he lifted up his troubled face with a faint smile of
pathetic indulgence.&nbsp; This smile of the worthy descendant of
the most ancient sea-folk whose audacity and hardihood had left
no trace of greatness and glory upon the waters, completed the
cycle of my initiation.&nbsp; There was an infinite depth of
hereditary wisdom in its pitying sadness.&nbsp; It made the
hearty bursts of cheering sound like a childish noise of
triumph.&nbsp; Our crew shouted with immense
confidence&mdash;honest souls!&nbsp; As if anybody could ever
make sure of having prevailed against the sea, which has betrayed
so many ships of great &ldquo;name,&rdquo; so many proud men, so
many towering ambitions of fame, power, wealth, greatness!</p>
<p>As I brought the boat under the falls my captain, in high
good-humour, leaned over, spreading his red and freckled elbows
on the rail, and called down to me sarcastically, out of the
depths of his cynic philosopher&rsquo;s beard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have brought the boat back after all, have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarcasm was &ldquo;his way,&rdquo; and the most that can be
said for it is that it was natural.&nbsp; This did not make it
lovable.&nbsp; But it is decorous and expedient to fall in with
one&rsquo;s commander&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I
brought the boat back all right, sir,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
And the good man believed me.&nbsp; It was not for him to discern
upon me the marks of my recent initiation.&nbsp; And yet I was
not exactly the same youngster who had taken the boat
away&mdash;all impatience for a race against death, with the
prize of nine men&rsquo;s lives at the end.</p>
<p>Already I looked with other eyes upon the sea.&nbsp; I knew it
capable of betraying the generous ardour of youth as implacably
as, indifferent to evil and good, it would have betrayed the
basest greed or the noblest heroism.&nbsp; My conception of its
magnanimous greatness was gone.&nbsp; And I looked upon the true
sea&mdash;the sea that plays with men till their hearts are
broken, and wears stout ships to death.&nbsp; Nothing can touch
the brooding bitterness of its heart.&nbsp; Open to all and
faithful to none, it exercises its fascination for the undoing of
the best.&nbsp; To love it is not well.&nbsp; It knows no bond of
plighted troth, no fidelity to misfortune, to long companionship,
to long devotion.&nbsp; The promise it holds out perpetually is
very great; but the only secret of its possession is strength,
strength&mdash;the jealous, sleepless strength of a man guarding
a coveted treasure within his gates.</p>
<h2><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>XXXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cradle of oversea traffic and
of the art of naval combats, the Mediterranean, apart from all
the associations of adventure and glory, the common heritage of
all mankind, makes a tender appeal to a seaman.&nbsp; It has
sheltered the infancy of his craft.&nbsp; He looks upon it as a
man may look at a vast nursery in an old, old mansion where
innumerable generations of his own people have learned to
walk.&nbsp; I say his own people because, in a sense, all sailors
belong to one family: all are descended from that adventurous and
shaggy ancestor who, bestriding a shapeless log and paddling with
a crooked branch, accomplished the first coasting-trip in a
sheltered bay ringing with the admiring howls of his tribe.&nbsp;
It is a matter of regret that all those brothers in craft and
feeling, whose generations have learned to walk a ship&rsquo;s
deck in that nursery, have been also more than once fiercely
engaged in cutting each other&rsquo;s throats there.&nbsp; But
life, apparently, has such exigencies.&nbsp; Without human
propensity to murder and other sorts of unrighteousness there
would have been no historical heroism.&nbsp; It is a consoling
reflection.&nbsp; And then, if one examines impartially the deeds
of violence, they appear of but small consequence.&nbsp; From
Salamis to Actium, through Lepanto and the Nile to the naval
massacre of Navarino, not to mention other armed encounters of
lesser interest, all the blood heroically spilt into the
Mediterranean has not stained with a single trail of purple the
deep azure of its classic waters.</p>
<p>Of course, it may be argued that battles have shaped the
destiny of mankind.&nbsp; The question whether they have shaped
it well would remain open, however.&nbsp; But it would be hardly
worth discussing.&nbsp; It is very probable that, had the Battle
of Salamis never been fought, the face of the world would have
been much as we behold it now, fashioned by the mediocre
inspiration and the short-sighted labours of men.&nbsp; From a
long and miserable experience of suffering, injustice, disgrace
and aggression the nations of the earth are mostly swayed by
fear&mdash;fear of the sort that a little cheap oratory turns
easily to rage, hate, and violence.&nbsp; Innocent, guileless
fear has been the cause of many wars.&nbsp; Not, of course, the
fear of war itself, which, in the evolution of sentiments and
ideas, has come to be regarded at last as a half-mystic and
glorious ceremony with certain fashionable rites and preliminary
incantations, wherein the conception of its true nature has been
lost.&nbsp; To apprehend the true aspect, force, and morality of
war as a natural function of mankind one requires a feather in
the hair and a ring in the nose, or, better still, teeth filed to
a point and a tattooed breast.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a return to
such simple ornamentation is impossible.&nbsp; We are bound to
the chariot of progress.&nbsp; There is no going back; and, as
bad luck would have it, our civilization, which has done so much
for the comfort and adornment of our bodies and the elevation of
our minds, has made lawful killing frightfully and needlessly
expensive.</p>
<p>The whole question of improved armaments has been approached
by the governments of the earth in a spirit of nervous and
unreflecting haste, whereas the right way was lying plainly
before them, and had only to be pursued with calm
determination.&nbsp; The learned vigils and labours of a certain
class of inventors should have been rewarded with honourable
liberality as justice demanded; and the bodies of the inventors
should have been blown to pieces by means of their own perfected
explosives and improved weapons with extreme publicity as the
commonest prudence dictated.&nbsp; By this method the ardour of
research in that direction would have been restrained without
infringing the sacred privileges of science.&nbsp; For the lack
of a little cool thinking in our guides and masters this course
has not been followed, and a beautiful simplicity has been
sacrificed for no real advantage.&nbsp; A frugal mind cannot
defend itself from considerable bitterness when reflecting that
at the Battle of Actium (which was fought for no less a stake
than the dominion of the world) the fleet of Octavianus
C&aelig;sar and the fleet of Antonius, including the Egyptian
division and Cleopatra&rsquo;s galley with purple sails, probably
cost less than two modern battleships, or, as the modern naval
book-jargon has it, two capital units.&nbsp; But no amount of
lubberly book-jargon can disguise a fact well calculated to
afflict the soul of every sound economist.&nbsp; It is not likely
that the Mediterranean will ever behold a battle with a greater
issue; but when the time comes for another historical fight its
bottom will be enriched as never before by a quantity of jagged
scrap-iron, paid for at pretty nearly its weight of gold by the
deluded populations inhabiting the isles and continents of this
planet.</p>
<h2>XXXVIII.</h2>
<p>Happy he who, like Ulysses, has made an adventurous voyage;
and there is no such sea for adventurous voyages as the
Mediterranean&mdash;the inland sea which the ancients looked upon
as so vast and so full of wonders.&nbsp; And, indeed, it was
terrible and wonderful; for it is we alone who, swayed by the
audacity of our minds and the tremors of our hearts, are the sole
artisans of all the wonder and romance of the world.</p>
<p>It was for the Mediterranean sailors that fair-haired sirens
sang among the black rocks seething in white foam and mysterious
voices spoke in the darkness above the moving wave&mdash;voices
menacing, seductive, or prophetic, like that voice heard at the
beginning of the Christian era by the master of an African vessel
in the Gulf of Syrta, whose calm nights are full of strange
murmurs and flitting shadows.&nbsp; It called him by name,
bidding him go and tell all men that the great god Pan was
dead.&nbsp; But the great legend of the Mediterranean, the legend
of traditional song and grave history, lives, fascinating and
immortal, in our minds.</p>
<p>The dark and fearful sea of the subtle Ulysses&rsquo;
wanderings, agitated by the wrath of Olympian gods, harbouring on
its isles the fury of strange monsters and the wiles of strange
women; the highway of heroes and sages, of warriors, pirates, and
saints; the workaday sea of Carthaginian merchants and the
pleasure lake of the Roman C&aelig;sars, claims the veneration of
every seaman as the historical home of that spirit of open
defiance against the great waters of the earth which is the very
soul of his calling.&nbsp; Issuing thence to the west and south,
as a youth leaves the shelter of his parental house, this spirit
found the way to the Indies, discovered the coasts of a new
continent, and traversed at last the immensity of the great
Pacific, rich in groups of islands remote and mysterious like the
constellations of the sky.</p>
<p>The first impulse of navigation took its visible form in that
tideless basin freed from hidden shoals and treacherous currents,
as if in tender regard for the infancy of the art.&nbsp; The
steep shores of the Mediterranean favoured the beginners in one
of humanity&rsquo;s most daring enterprises, and the enchanting
inland sea of classic adventure has led mankind gently from
headland to headland, from bay to bay, from island to island, out
into the promise of world-wide oceans beyond the Pillars of
Hercules.</p>
<h2>XXXIX.</h2>
<p>The charm of the Mediterranean dwells in the unforgettable
flavour of my early days, and to this hour this sea, upon which
the Romans alone ruled without dispute, has kept for me the
fascination of youthful romance.&nbsp; The very first Christmas
night I ever spent away from land was employed in running before
a Gulf of Lions gale, which made the old ship groan in every
timber as she skipped before it over the short seas until we
brought her to, battered and out of breath, under the lee of
Majorca, where the smooth water was torn by fierce
cat&rsquo;s-paws under a very stormy sky.</p>
<p>We&mdash;or, rather, they, for I had hardly had two glimpses
of salt water in my life till then&mdash;kept her standing off
and on all that day, while I listened for the first time with the
curiosity of my tender years to the song of the wind in a
ship&rsquo;s rigging.&nbsp; The monotonous and vibrating note was
destined to grow into the intimacy of the heart, pass into blood
and bone, accompany the thoughts and acts of two full decades,
remain to haunt like a reproach the peace of the quiet fireside,
and enter into the very texture of respectable dreams dreamed
safely under a roof of rafters and tiles.&nbsp; The wind was
fair, but that day we ran no more.</p>
<p>The thing (I will not call her a ship twice in the same
half-hour) leaked.&nbsp; She leaked fully, generously,
overflowingly, all over&mdash;like a basket.&nbsp; I took an
enthusiastic part in the excitement caused by that last infirmity
of noble ships, without concerning myself much with the why or
the wherefore.&nbsp; The surmise of my maturer years is that,
bored by her interminable life, the venerable antiquity was
simply yawning with ennui at every seam.&nbsp; But at the time I
did not know; I knew generally very little, and least of all what
I was doing in that <i>gal&egrave;re</i>.</p>
<p>I remember that, exactly as in the comedy of Moli&egrave;re,
my uncle asked the precise question in the very words&mdash;not
of my confidential valet, however, but across great distances of
land, in a letter whose mocking but indulgent turn ill concealed
his almost paternal anxiety.&nbsp; I fancy I tried to convey to
him my (utterly unfounded) impression that the West Indies
awaited my coming.&nbsp; I had to go there.&nbsp; It was a sort
of mystic conviction&mdash;something in the nature of a
call.&nbsp; But it was difficult to state intelligibly the
grounds of this belief to that man of rigorous logic, if of
infinite charity.</p>
<p>The truth must have been that, all unversed in the arts of the
wily Greek, the deceiver of gods, the lover of strange women, the
evoker of bloodthirsty shades, I yet longed for the beginning of
my own obscure Odyssey, which, as was proper for a modern, should
unroll its wonders and terrors beyond the Pillars of
Hercules.&nbsp; The disdainful ocean did not open wide to swallow
up my audacity, though the ship, the ridiculous and ancient
<i>gal&egrave;re</i> of my folly, the old, weary, disenchanted
sugar-waggon, seemed extremely disposed to open out and swallow
up as much salt water as she could hold.&nbsp; This, if less
grandiose, would have been as final a catastrophe.</p>
<p>But no catastrophe occurred.&nbsp; I lived to watch on a
strange shore a black and youthful Nausicaa, with a joyous train
of attendant maidens, carrying baskets of linen to a clear stream
overhung by the heads of slender palm-trees.&nbsp; The vivid
colours of their draped raiment and the gold of their earrings
invested with a barbaric and regal magnificence their figures,
stepping out freely in a shower of broken sunshine.&nbsp; The
whiteness of their teeth was still more dazzling than the
splendour of jewels at their ears.&nbsp; The shaded side of the
ravine gleamed with their smiles.&nbsp; They were as unabashed as
so many princesses, but, alas! not one of them was the daughter
of a jet-black sovereign.&nbsp; Such was my abominable luck in
being born by the mere hair&rsquo;s breadth of twenty-five
centuries too late into a world where kings have been growing
scarce with scandalous rapidity, while the few who remain have
adopted the uninteresting manners and customs of simple
millionaires.&nbsp; Obviously it was a vain hope in 187&ndash; to
see the ladies of a royal household walk in chequered sunshine,
with baskets of linen on their heads, to the banks of a clear
stream overhung by the starry fronds of palm-trees.&nbsp; It was
a vain hope.&nbsp; If I did not ask myself whether, limited by
such discouraging impossibilities, life were still worth living,
it was only because I had then before me several other pressing
questions, some of which have remained unanswered to this
day.&nbsp; The resonant, laughing voices of these gorgeous
maidens scared away the multitude of humming-birds, whose
delicate wings wreathed with the mist of their vibration the tops
of flowering bushes.</p>
<p>No, they were not princesses.&nbsp; Their unrestrained
laughter filling the hot, fern-clad ravine had a soulless
limpidity, as of wild, inhuman dwellers in tropical
woodlands.&nbsp; Following the example of certain prudent
travellers, I withdrew unseen&mdash;and returned, not much wiser,
to the Mediterranean, the sea of classic adventures.</p>
<h2><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>XL.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was written that there, in the
nursery of our navigating ancestors, I should learn to walk in
the ways of my craft and grow in the love of the sea, blind as
young love often is, but absorbing and disinterested as all true
love must be.&nbsp; I demanded nothing from it&mdash;not even
adventure.&nbsp; In this I showed, perhaps, more intuitive wisdom
than high self-denial.&nbsp; No adventure ever came to one for
the asking.&nbsp; He who starts on a deliberate quest of
adventure goes forth but to gather dead-sea fruit, unless,
indeed, he be beloved of the gods and great amongst heroes, like
that most excellent cavalier Don Quixote de la Mancha.&nbsp; By
us ordinary mortals of a mediocre animus that is only too anxious
to pass by wicked giants for so many honest windmills, adventures
are entertained like visiting angels.&nbsp; They come upon our
complacency unawares.&nbsp; As unbidden guests are apt to do,
they often come at inconvenient times.&nbsp; And we are glad to
let them go unrecognised, without any acknowledgment of so high a
favour.&nbsp; After many years, on looking back from the middle
turn of life&rsquo;s way at the events of the past, which, like a
friendly crowd, seem to gaze sadly after us hastening towards the
Cimmerian shore, we may see here and there, in the gray throng,
some figure glowing with a faint radiance, as though it had
caught all the light of our already crepuscular sky.&nbsp; And by
this glow we may recognise the faces of our true adventures, of
the once unbidden guests entertained unawares in our young
days.</p>
<p>If the Mediterranean, the venerable (and sometimes atrociously
ill-tempered) nurse of all navigators, was to rock my youth, the
providing of the cradle necessary for that operation was
entrusted by Fate to the most casual assemblage of irresponsible
young men (all, however, older than myself) that, as if drunk
with Proven&ccedil;al sunshine, frittered life away in joyous
levity on the model of Balzac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Histoire des
Treize&rdquo; qualified by a dash of romance <i>de cape et
d&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e</i>.</p>
<p>She who was my cradle in those years had been built on the
River of Savona by a famous builder of boats, was rigged in
Corsica by another good man, and was described on her papers as a
&lsquo;tartane&rsquo; of sixty tons.&nbsp; In reality, she was a
true balancelle, with two short masts raking forward and two
curved yards, each as long as her hull; a true child of the Latin
lake, with a spread of two enormous sails resembling the pointed
wings on a sea-bird&rsquo;s slender body, and herself, like a
bird indeed, skimming rather than sailing the seas.</p>
<p>Her name was the <i>Tremolino</i>.&nbsp; How is this to be
translated?&nbsp; The <i>Quiverer</i>?&nbsp; What a name to give
the pluckiest little craft that ever dipped her sides in angry
foam!&nbsp; I had felt her, it is true, trembling for nights and
days together under my feet, but it was with the high-strung
tenseness of her faithful courage.&nbsp; In her short, but
brilliant, career she has taught me nothing, but she has given me
everything.&nbsp; I owe to her the awakened love for the sea
that, with the quivering of her swift little body and the humming
of the wind under the foot of her lateen sails, stole into my
heart with a sort of gentle violence, and brought my imagination
under its despotic sway.&nbsp; The <i>Tremolino</i>!&nbsp; To
this day I cannot utter or even write that name without a strange
tightening of the breast and the gasp of mingled delight and
dread of one&rsquo;s first passionate experience.</p>
<h2>XLI.</h2>
<p>We four formed (to use a term well understood nowadays in
every social sphere) a &ldquo;syndicate&rdquo; owning the
<i>Tremolino</i>: an international and astonishing
syndicate.&nbsp; And we were all ardent Royalists of the
snow-white Legitimist complexion&mdash;Heaven only knows
why!&nbsp; In all associations of men there is generally one who,
by the authority of age and of a more experienced wisdom, imparts
a collective character to the whole set.&nbsp; If I mention that
the oldest of us was very old, extremely old&mdash;nearly thirty
years old&mdash;and that he used to declare with gallant
carelessness, &ldquo;I live by my sword,&rdquo; I think I have
given enough information on the score of our collective
wisdom.&nbsp; He was a North Carolinian gentleman, J. M. K. B.
were the initials of his name, and he really did live by the
sword, as far as I know.&nbsp; He died by it, too, later on, in a
Balkanian squabble, in the cause of some Serbs or else
Bulgarians, who were neither Catholics nor gentlemen&mdash;at
least, not in the exalted but narrow sense he attached to that
last word.</p>
<p>Poor J. M. K. B., <i>Am&eacute;ricain</i>, <i>Catholique</i>,
<i>et gentilhomme</i>, as he was disposed to describe himself in
moments of lofty expansion!&nbsp; Are there still to be found in
Europe gentlemen keen of face and elegantly slight of body, of
distinguished aspect, with a fascinating drawing-room manner and
with a dark, fatal glance, who live by their swords, I
wonder?&nbsp; His family had been ruined in the Civil War, I
fancy, and seems for a decade or so to have led a wandering life
in the Old World.&nbsp; As to Henry C&mdash;, the next in age and
wisdom of our band, he had broken loose from the unyielding
rigidity of his family, solidly rooted, if I remember rightly, in
a well-to-do London suburb.&nbsp; On their respectable authority
he introduced himself meekly to strangers as a &ldquo;black
sheep.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have never seen a more guileless specimen
of an outcast.&nbsp; Never.</p>
<p>However, his people had the grace to send him a little money
now and then.&nbsp; Enamoured of the South, of Provence, of its
people, its life, its sunshine and its poetry, narrow-chested,
tall and short-sighted, he strode along the streets and the
lanes, his long feet projecting far in advance of his body, and
his white nose and gingery moustache buried in an open book: for
he had the habit of reading as he walked.&nbsp; How he avoided
falling into precipices, off the quays, or down staircases is a
great mystery.&nbsp; The sides of his overcoat bulged out with
pocket editions of various poets.&nbsp; When not engaged in
reading Virgil, Homer, or Mistral, in parks, restaurants,
streets, and suchlike public places, he indited sonnets (in
French) to the eyes, ears, chin, hair, and other visible
perfections of a nymph called Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, the
daughter, honesty compels me to state, of a certain Madame
Leonore who kept a small caf&eacute; for sailors in one of the
narrowest streets of the old town.</p>
<p>No more charming face, clear-cut like an antique gem, and
delicate in colouring like the petal of a flower, had ever been
set on, alas! a somewhat squat body.&nbsp; He read his verses
aloud to her in the very caf&eacute; with the innocence of a
little child and the vanity of a poet.&nbsp; We followed him
there willingly enough, if only to watch the divine
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se laugh, under the vigilant black eyes of
Madame Leonore, her mother.&nbsp; She laughed very prettily, not
so much at the sonnets, which she could not but esteem, as at
poor Henry&rsquo;s French accent, which was unique, resembling
the warbling of birds, if birds ever warbled with a stuttering,
nasal intonation.</p>
<p>Our third partner was Roger P. de la S&mdash;, the most
Scandinavian-looking of Proven&ccedil;al squires, fair, and six
feet high, as became a descendant of sea-roving Northmen,
authoritative, incisive, wittily scornful, with a comedy in three
acts in his pocket, and in his breast a heart blighted by a
hopeless passion for his beautiful cousin, married to a wealthy
hide and tallow merchant.&nbsp; He used to take us to lunch at
their house without ceremony.&nbsp; I admired the good
lady&rsquo;s sweet patience.&nbsp; The husband was a conciliatory
soul, with a great fund of resignation, which he expended on
&ldquo;Roger&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suspect he was
secretly horrified at these invasions.&nbsp; But it was a Carlist
salon, and as such we were made welcome.&nbsp; The possibility of
raising Catalonia in the interest of the <i>Rey netto</i>, who
had just then crossed the Pyrenees, was much discussed there.</p>
<p>Don Carlos, no doubt, must have had many queer friends (it is
the common lot of all Pretenders), but amongst them none more
extravagantly fantastic than the <i>Tremolino</i> Syndicate,
which used to meet in a tavern on the quays of the old
port.&nbsp; The antique city of Massilia had surely never, since
the days of the earliest Phoenicians, known an odder set of
ship-owners.&nbsp; We met to discuss and settle the plan of
operations for each voyage of the <i>Tremolino</i>.&nbsp; In
these operations a banking-house, too, was concerned&mdash;a very
respectable banking-house.&nbsp; But I am afraid I shall end by
saying too much.&nbsp; Ladies, too, were concerned (I am really
afraid I am saying too much)&mdash;all sorts of ladies, some old
enough to know better than to put their trust in princes, others
young and full of illusions.</p>
<p>One of these last was extremely amusing in the imitations, she
gave us in confidence, of various highly-placed personages she
was perpetually rushing off to Paris to interview in the
interests of the cause&mdash;<i>Por el Rey</i>!&nbsp; For she was
a Carlist, and of Basque blood at that, with something of a
lioness in the expression of her courageous face (especially when
she let her hair down), and with the volatile little soul of a
sparrow dressed in fine Parisian feathers, which had the trick of
coming off disconcertingly at unexpected moments.</p>
<p>But her imitations of a Parisian personage, very highly placed
indeed, as she represented him standing in the corner of a room
with his face to the wall, rubbing the back of his head and
moaning helplessly, &ldquo;Rita, you are the death of me!&rdquo;
were enough to make one (if young and free from cares) split
one&rsquo;s sides laughing.&nbsp; She had an uncle still living,
a very effective Carlist, too, the priest of a little mountain
parish in Guipuzcoa.&nbsp; As the sea-going member of the
syndicate (whose plans depended greatly on Do&ntilde;a
Rita&rsquo;s information), I used to be charged with humbly
affectionate messages for the old man.&nbsp; These messages I was
supposed to deliver to the Arragonese muleteers (who were sure to
await at certain times the <i>Tremolino</i> in the neighbourhood
of the Gulf of Rosas), for faithful transportation inland,
together with the various unlawful goods landed secretly from
under the <i>Tremolino&rsquo;s</i> hatches.</p>
<p>Well, now, I have really let out too much (as I feared I
should in the end) as to the usual contents of my
sea-cradle.&nbsp; But let it stand.&nbsp; And if anybody remarks
cynically that I must have been a promising infant in those days,
let that stand, too.&nbsp; I am concerned but for the good name
of the <i>Tremolino</i>, and I affirm that a ship is ever
guiltless of the sins, transgressions, and follies of her
men.</p>
<h2>XLII.</h2>
<p>It was not <i>Tremolino&rsquo;s</i> fault that the syndicate
depended so much on the wit and wisdom and the information of
Do&ntilde;a Rita.&nbsp; She had taken a little furnished house on
the Prado for the good of the cause&mdash;<i>Por el
Rey</i>!&nbsp; She was always taking little houses for
somebody&rsquo;s good, for the sick or the sorry, for broken-down
artists, cleaned-out gamblers, temporarily unlucky
speculators&mdash;<i>vieux amis</i>&mdash;old friends, as she
used to explain apologetically, with a shrug of her fine
shoulders.</p>
<p>Whether Don Carlos was one of the &ldquo;old friends,&rdquo;
too, it&rsquo;s hard to say.&nbsp; More unlikely things have been
heard of in smoking-rooms.&nbsp; All I know is that one evening,
entering incautiously the salon of the little house just after
the news of a considerable Carlist success had reached the
faithful, I was seized round the neck and waist and whirled
recklessly three times round the room, to the crash of upsetting
furniture and the humming of a valse tune in a warm contralto
voice.</p>
<p>When released from the dizzy embrace, I sat down on the
carpet&mdash;suddenly, without affectation.&nbsp; In this
unpretentious attitude I became aware that J. M. K. B. had
followed me into the room, elegant, fatal, correct and severe in
a white tie and large shirt-front.&nbsp; In answer to his
politely sinister, prolonged glance of inquiry, I overheard
Do&ntilde;a Rita murmuring, with some confusion and annoyance,
&ldquo;<i>Vous &ecirc;tes b&ecirc;te mon cher</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Voyons</i>!&nbsp; <i>&Ccedil;a n&rsquo;a aucune
cons&eacute;quence</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well content in this case to
be of no particular consequence, I had already about me the
elements of some worldly sense.</p>
<p>Rearranging my collar, which, truth to say, ought to have been
a round one above a short jacket, but was not, I observed
felicitously that I had come to say good-bye, being ready to go
off to sea that very night with the <i>Tremolino</i>.&nbsp; Our
hostess, slightly panting yet, and just a shade dishevelled,
turned tartly upon J. M. K. B., desiring to know when <i>he</i>
would be ready to go off by the <i>Tremolino</i>, or in any other
way, in order to join the royal headquarters.&nbsp; Did he
intend, she asked ironically, to wait for the very eve of the
entry into Madrid?&nbsp; Thus by a judicious exercise of tact and
asperity we re-established the atmospheric equilibrium of the
room long before I left them a little before midnight, now
tenderly reconciled, to walk down to the harbour and hail the
<i>Tremolino</i> by the usual soft whistle from the edge of the
quay.&nbsp; It was our signal, invariably heard by the
ever-watchful Dominic, the <i>padrone</i>.</p>
<p>He would raise a lantern silently to light my steps along the
narrow, springy plank of our primitive gangway.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
so we are going off,&rdquo; he would murmur directly my foot
touched the deck.&nbsp; I was the harbinger of sudden departures,
but there was nothing in the world sudden enough to take Dominic
unawares.&nbsp; His thick black moustaches, curled every morning
with hot tongs by the barber at the corner of the quay, seemed to
hide a perpetual smile.&nbsp; But nobody, I believe, had ever
seen the true shape of his lips.&nbsp; From the slow,
imperturbable gravity of that broad-chested man you would think
he had never smiled in his life.&nbsp; In his eyes lurked a look
of perfectly remorseless irony, as though he had been provided
with an extremely experienced soul; and the slightest distension
of his nostrils would give to his bronzed face a look of
extraordinary boldness.&nbsp; This was the only play of feature
of which he seemed capable, being a Southerner of a concentrated,
deliberate type.&nbsp; His ebony hair curled slightly on the
temples.&nbsp; He may have been forty years old, and he was a
great voyager on the inland sea.</p>
<p>Astute and ruthless, he could have rivalled in resource the
unfortunate son of Laertes and Anticlea.&nbsp; If he did not pit
his craft and audacity against the very gods, it is only because
the Olympian gods are dead.&nbsp; Certainly no woman could
frighten him.&nbsp; A one-eyed giant would not have had the ghost
of a chance against Dominic Cervoni, of Corsica, not Ithaca; and
no king, son of kings, but of very respectable
family&mdash;authentic Caporali, he affirmed.&nbsp; But that is
as it may be.&nbsp; The Caporali families date back to the
twelfth century.</p>
<p>For want of more exalted adversaries Dominic turned his
audacity fertile in impious stratagems against the powers of the
earth, as represented by the institution of Custom-houses and
every mortal belonging thereto&mdash;scribes, officers, and
guardacostas afloat and ashore.&nbsp; He was the very man for us,
this modern and unlawful wanderer with his own legend of loves,
dangers, and bloodshed.&nbsp; He told us bits of it sometimes in
measured, ironic tones.&nbsp; He spoke Catalonian, the Italian of
Corsica and the French of Proven&ccedil;e with the same easy
naturalness.&nbsp; Dressed in shore-togs, a white starched shirt,
black jacket, and round hat, as I took him once to see
Do&ntilde;a Rita, he was extremely presentable.&nbsp; He could
make himself interesting by a tactful and rugged reserve set off
by a grim, almost imperceptible, playfulness of tone and
manner.</p>
<p>He had the physical assurance of strong-hearted men.&nbsp;
After half an hour&rsquo;s interview in the dining-room, during
which they got in touch with each other in an amazing way, Rita
told us in her best <i>grande dame</i> manner: &ldquo;<i>Mais il
esi parfait</i>, <i>cet homme</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
perfect.&nbsp; On board the <i>Tremolino</i>, wrapped up in a
black <i>caban</i>, the picturesque cloak of Mediterranean
seamen, with those massive moustaches and his remorseless eyes
set off by the shadow of the deep hood, he looked piratical and
monkish and darkly initiated into the most awful mysteries of the
sea.</p>
<h2>XLIII.</h2>
<p>Anyway, he was perfect, as Do&ntilde;a Rita had
declared.&nbsp; The only thing unsatisfactory (and even
inexplicable) about our Dominic was his nephew, Cesar.&nbsp; It
was startling to see a desolate expression of shame veil the
remorseless audacity in the eyes of that man superior to all
scruples and terrors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would never have dared to bring him on board your
balancelle,&rdquo; he once apologized to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what am I to do?&nbsp; His mother is dead, and my brother has
gone into the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way I learned that our Dominic had a brother.&nbsp; As
to &ldquo;going into the bush,&rdquo; this only means that a man
has done his duty successfully in the pursuit of a hereditary
vendetta.&nbsp; The feud which had existed for ages between the
families of Cervoni and Brunaschi was so old that it seemed to
have smouldered out at last.&nbsp; One evening Pietro Brunaschi,
after a laborious day amongst his olive-trees, sat on a chair
against the wall of his house with a bowl of broth on his knees
and a piece of bread in his hand.&nbsp; Dominic&rsquo;s brother,
going home with a gun on his shoulder, found a sudden offence in
this picture of content and rest so obviously calculated to
awaken the feelings of hatred and revenge.&nbsp; He and Pietro
had never had any personal quarrel; but, as Dominic explained,
&ldquo;all our dead cried out to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shouted
from behind a wall of stones, &ldquo;O Pietro!&nbsp; Behold what
is coming!&rdquo;&nbsp; And as the other looked up innocently he
took aim at the forehead and squared the old vendetta account so
neatly that, according to Dominic, the dead man continued to sit
with the bowl of broth on his knees and the piece of bread in his
hand.</p>
<p>This is why&mdash;because in Corsica your dead will not leave
you alone&mdash;Dominic&rsquo;s brother had to go into the
<i>maquis</i>, into the bush on the wild mountain-side, to dodge
the gendarmes for the insignificant remainder of his life, and
Dominic had charge of his nephew with a mission to make a man of
him.</p>
<p>No more unpromising undertaking could be imagined.&nbsp; The
very material for the task seemed wanting.&nbsp; The Cervonis, if
not handsome men, were good sturdy flesh and blood.&nbsp; But
this extraordinarily lean and livid youth seemed to have no more
blood in him than a snail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some cursed witch must have stolen my brother&rsquo;s
child from the cradle and put that spawn of a starved devil in
its place,&rdquo; Dominic would say to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at
him!&nbsp; Just look at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To look at Cesar was not pleasant.&nbsp; His parchment skin,
showing dead white on his cranium through the thin wisps of dirty
brown hair, seemed to be glued directly and tightly upon his big
bones, Without being in any way deformed, he was the nearest
approach which I have ever seen or could imagine to what is
commonly understood by the word &ldquo;monster.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
the source of the effect produced was really moral I have no
doubt.&nbsp; An utterly, hopelessly depraved nature was expressed
in physical terms, that taken each separately had nothing
positively startling.&nbsp; You imagined him clammily cold to the
touch, like a snake.&nbsp; The slightest reproof, the most mild
and justifiable remonstrance, would be met by a resentful glare
and an evil shrinking of his thin dry upper lip, a snarl of hate
to which he generally added the agreeable sound of grinding
teeth.</p>
<p>It was for this venomous performance rather than for his lies,
impudence, and laziness that his uncle used to knock him
down.&nbsp; It must not be imagined that it was anything in the
nature of a brutal assault.&nbsp; Dominic&rsquo;s brawny arm
would be seen describing deliberately an ample horizontal
gesture, a dignified sweep, and Cesar would go over suddenly like
a ninepin&mdash;which was funny to see.&nbsp; But, once down, he
would writhe on the deck, gnashing his teeth in impotent
rage&mdash;which was pretty horrible to behold.&nbsp; And it also
happened more than once that he would disappear
completely&mdash;which was startling to observe.&nbsp; This is
the exact truth.&nbsp; Before some of these majestic cuffs Cesar
would go down and vanish.&nbsp; He would vanish heels overhead
into open hatchways, into scuttles, behind up-ended casks,
according to the place where he happened to come into contact
with his uncle&rsquo;s mighty arm.</p>
<p>Once&mdash;it was in the old harbour, just before the
<i>Tremolino&rsquo;s</i> last voyage&mdash;he vanished thus
overboard to my infinite consternation.&nbsp; Dominic and I had
been talking business together aft, and Cesar had sneaked up
behind us to listen, for, amongst his other perfections, he was a
consummate eavesdropper and spy.&nbsp; At the sound of the heavy
plop alongside horror held me rooted to the spot; but Dominic
stepped quietly to the rail and leaned over, waiting for his
nephew&rsquo;s miserable head to bob up for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&eacute;, Cesar!&rdquo; he yelled contemptuously to
the spluttering wretch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Catch hold of that mooring
hawser&mdash;<i>charogne</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He approached me to resume the interrupted conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Cesar?&rdquo; I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canallia!&nbsp; Let him hang there,&rdquo; was his
answer.&nbsp; And he went on talking over the business in hand
calmly, while I tried vainly to dismiss from my mind the picture
of Cesar steeped to the chin in the water of the old harbour, a
decoction of centuries of marine refuse.&nbsp; I tried to dismiss
it, because the mere notion of that liquid made me feel very
sick.&nbsp; Presently Dominic, hailing an idle boatman, directed
him to go and fish his nephew out; and by-and-by Cesar appeared
walking on board from the quay, shivering, streaming with filthy
water, with bits of rotten straws in his hair and a piece of
dirty orange-peel stranded on his shoulder.&nbsp; His teeth
chattered; his yellow eyes squinted balefully at us as he passed
forward.&nbsp; I thought it my duty to remonstrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you always knocking him about, Dominic?&rdquo;
I asked.&nbsp; Indeed, I felt convinced it was no earthly
good&mdash;a sheer waste of muscular force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must try to make a man of him,&rdquo; Dominic
answered hopelessly.</p>
<p>I restrained the obvious retort that in this way he ran the
risk of making, in the words of the immortal Mr. Mantalini,
&ldquo;a demnition damp, unpleasant corpse of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to be a locksmith!&rdquo; burst out
Cervoni.&nbsp; &ldquo;To learn how to pick locks, I
suppose,&rdquo; he added with sardonic bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not let him be a locksmith?&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would teach him?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where could I leave him?&rdquo; he asked, with a drop in
his voice; and I had my first glimpse of genuine despair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He steals, you know, alas!&nbsp; <i>Par ta
Madonne</i>!&nbsp; I believe he would put poison in your food and
mine&mdash;the viper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his face and both his clenched fists slowly to
heaven.&nbsp; However, Cesar never dropped poison into our
cups.&nbsp; One cannot be sure, but I fancy he went to work in
another way.</p>
<p>This voyage, of which the details need not be given, we had to
range far afield for sufficient reasons.&nbsp; Coming up from the
South to end it with the important and really dangerous part of
the scheme in hand, we found it necessary to look into Barcelona
for certain definite information.&nbsp; This appears like running
one&rsquo;s head into the very jaws of the lion, but in reality
it was not so.&nbsp; We had one or two high, influential friends
there, and many others humble but valuable because bought for
good hard cash.&nbsp; We were in no danger of being molested;
indeed, the important information reached us promptly by the
hands of a Custom-house officer, who came on board full of showy
zeal to poke an iron rod into the layer of oranges which made the
visible part of our cargo in the hatchway.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention before that the <i>Tremolino</i> was
officially known as a fruit and cork-wood trader.&nbsp; The
zealous officer managed to slip a useful piece of paper into
Dominic&rsquo;s hand as he went ashore, and a few hours
afterwards, being off duty, he returned on board again athirst
for drinks and gratitude.&nbsp; He got both as a matter of
course.&nbsp; While he sat sipping his liqueur in the tiny cabin,
Dominic plied him with questions as to the whereabouts of the
guardacostas.&nbsp; The preventive service afloat was really the
one for us to reckon with, and it was material for our success
and safety to know the exact position of the patrol craft in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The news could not have been more
favourable.&nbsp; The officer mentioned a small place on the
coast some twelve miles off, where, unsuspicious and unready, she
was lying at anchor, with her sails unbent, painting yards and
scraping spars.&nbsp; Then he left us after the usual
compliments, smirking reassurringly over his shoulder.</p>
<p>I had kept below pretty close all day from excess of
prudence.&nbsp; The stake played on that trip was big.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready to go at once, but for Cesar, who has been
missing ever since breakfast,&rdquo; announced Dominic to me in
his slow, grim way.</p>
<p>Where the fellow had gone, and why, we could not
imagine.&nbsp; The usual surmises in the case of a missing seaman
did not apply to Cesar&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; He was too odious
for love, friendship, gambling, or even casual intercourse.&nbsp;
But once or twice he had wandered away like this before.</p>
<p>Dominic went ashore to look for him, but returned at the end
of two hours alone and very angry, as I could see by the token of
the invisible smile under his moustache being intensified.&nbsp;
We wondered what had become of the wretch, and made a hurried
investigation amongst our portable property.&nbsp; He had stolen
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be back before long,&rdquo; I said
confidently.</p>
<p>Ten minutes afterwards one of the men on deck called out
loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see him coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cesar had only his shirt and trousers on.&nbsp; He had sold
his coat, apparently for pocket-money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knave!&rdquo; was all Dominic said, with a terrible
softness of voice.&nbsp; He restrained his choler for a
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where have you been, vagabond?&rdquo; he asked
menacingly.</p>
<p>Nothing would induce Cesar to answer that question.&nbsp; It
was as if he even disdained to lie.&nbsp; He faced us, drawing
back his lips and gnashing his teeth, and did not shrink an inch
before the sweep of Dominic&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; He went down as if
shot, of course.&nbsp; But this time I noticed that, when picking
himself up, he remained longer than usual on all fours, baring
his big teeth over his shoulder and glaring upwards at his uncle
with a new sort of hate in his round, yellow eyes.&nbsp; That
permanent sentiment seemed pointed at that moment by especial
malice and curiosity.&nbsp; I became quite interested.&nbsp; If
he ever manages to put poison in the dishes, I thought to myself,
this is how he will look at us as we sit at our meal.&nbsp; But I
did not, of course, believe for a moment that he would ever put
poison in our food.&nbsp; He ate the same things himself.&nbsp;
Moreover, he had no poison.&nbsp; And I could not imagine a human
being so blinded by cupidity as to sell poison to such an
atrocious creature.</p>
<h2>XLIV.</h2>
<p>We slipped out to sea quietly at dusk, and all through the
night everything went well.&nbsp; The breeze was gusty; a
southerly blow was making up.&nbsp; It was fair wind for our
course.&nbsp; Now and then Dominic slowly and rhythmically struck
his hands together a few times, as if applauding the performance
of the <i>Tremolino</i>.&nbsp; The balancelle hummed and quivered
as she flew along, dancing lightly under our feet.</p>
<p>At daybreak I pointed out to Dominic, amongst the several sail
in view running before the gathering storm, one particular
vessel.&nbsp; The press of canvas she carried made her loom up
high, end-on, like a gray column standing motionless directly in
our wake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this fellow, Dominic,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He seems to be in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Padrone made no remark, but, wrapping his black cloak
close about him, stood up to look.&nbsp; His weather-tanned face,
framed in the hood, had an aspect of authority and challenging
force, with the deep-set eyes gazing far away fixedly, without a
wink, like the intent, merciless, steady eyes of a sea-bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chi va piano va sano</i>,&rdquo; he remarked at
last, with a derisive glance over the side, in ironic allusion to
our own tremendous speed.</p>
<p>The <i>Tremolino</i> was doing her best, and seemed to hardly
touch the great burst of foam over which she darted.&nbsp; I
crouched down again to get some shelter from the low
bulwark.&nbsp; After more than half an hour of swaying immobility
expressing a concentrated, breathless watchfulness, Dominic sank
on the deck by my side.&nbsp; Within the monkish cowl his eyes
gleamed with a fierce expression which surprised me.&nbsp; All he
said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has come out here to wash the new paint off his
yards, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I shouted, getting up on my knees.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is she the guardacosta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The perpetual suggestion of a smile under Dominic&rsquo;s
piratical moustaches seemed to become more
accentuated&mdash;quite real, grim, actually almost visible
through the wet and uncurled hair.&nbsp; Judging by that symptom,
he must have been in a towering rage.&nbsp; But I could also see
that he was puzzled, and that discovery affected me
disagreeably.&nbsp; Dominic puzzled!&nbsp; For a long time,
leaning against the bulwark, I gazed over the stern at the gray
column that seemed to stand swaying slightly in our wake always
at the same distance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dominic, black and cowled, sat cross-legged on the
deck, with his back to the wind, recalling vaguely an Arab chief
in his burnuss sitting on the sand.&nbsp; Above his motionless
figure the little cord and tassel on the stiff point of the hood
swung about inanely in the gale.&nbsp; At last I gave up facing
the wind and rain, and crouched down by his side.&nbsp; I was
satisfied that the sail was a patrol craft.&nbsp; Her presence
was not a thing to talk about, but soon, between two clouds
charged with hail-showers, a burst of sunshine fell upon her
sails, and our men discovered her character for themselves.&nbsp;
From that moment I noticed that they seemed to take no heed of
each other or of anything else.&nbsp; They could spare no eyes
and no thought but for the slight column-shape astern of
us.&nbsp; Its swaying had become perceptible.&nbsp; For a moment
she remained dazzlingly white, then faded away slowly to nothing
in a squall, only to reappear again, nearly black, resembling a
post stuck upright against the slaty background of solid
cloud.&nbsp; Since first noticed she had not gained on us a
foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will never catch the <i>Tremolino</i>,&rdquo; I
said exultingly.</p>
<p>Dominic did not look at me.&nbsp; He remarked absently, but
justly, that the heavy weather was in our pursuer&rsquo;s
favour.&nbsp; She was three times our size.&nbsp; What we had to
do was to keep our distance till dark, which we could manage
easily, and then haul off to seaward and consider the
situation.&nbsp; But his thoughts seemed to stumble in the
darkness of some not-solved enigma, and soon he fell
silent.&nbsp; We ran steadily, wing-and-wing.&nbsp; Cape San
Sebastian nearly ahead seemed to recede from us in the squalls of
rain, and come out again to meet our rush, every time more
distinct between the showers.</p>
<p>For my part I was by no means certain that this <i>gabelou</i>
(as our men alluded to her opprobriously) was after us at
all.&nbsp; There were nautical difficulties in such a view which
made me express the sanguine opinion that she was in all
innocence simply changing her station.&nbsp; At this Dominic
condescended to turn his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you she is in chase,&rdquo; he affirmed moodily,
after one short glance astern.</p>
<p>I never doubted his opinion.&nbsp; But with all the ardour of
a neophyte and the pride of an apt learner I was at that time a
great nautical casuist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; I insisted
subtly, &ldquo;is how on earth, with this wind, she has managed
to be just where she was when we first made her out.&nbsp; It is
clear that she could not, and did not, gain twelve miles on us
during the night.&nbsp; And there are other impossibilities. . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dominic had been sitting motionless, like an inanimate black
cone posed on the stern deck, near the rudder-head, with a small
tassel fluttering on its sharp point, and for a time he preserved
the immobility of his meditation.&nbsp; Then, bending over with a
short laugh, he gave my ear the bitter fruit of it.&nbsp; He
understood everything now perfectly.&nbsp; She was where we had
seen her first, not because she had caught us up, but because we
had passed her during the night while she was already waiting for
us, hove-to, most likely, on our very track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you understand&mdash;already?&rdquo; Dominic
muttered in a fierce undertone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Already!&nbsp; You
know we left a good eight hours before we were expected to leave,
otherwise she would have been in time to lie in wait for us on
the other side of the Cape, and&rdquo;&mdash;he snapped his teeth
like a wolf close to my face&mdash;&ldquo;and she would have had
us like&mdash;that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw it all plainly enough now.&nbsp; They had eyes in their
heads and all their wits about them in that craft.&nbsp; We had
passed them in the dark as they jogged on easily towards their
ambush with the idea that we were yet far behind.&nbsp; At
daylight, however, sighting a balancelle ahead under a press of
canvas, they had made sail in chase.&nbsp; But if that was so,
then&mdash;</p>
<p>Dominic seized my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&nbsp; She came out on an information&mdash;do
you see, it?&mdash;on information. . . . We have been
sold&mdash;betrayed.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; How?&nbsp; What for?&nbsp;
We always paid them all so well on shore. . . . No!&nbsp; But it
is my head that is going to burst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to choke, tugged at the throat button of the cloak,
jumped up open-mouthed as if to hurl curses and denunciation, but
instantly mastered himself, and, wrapping up the cloak closer
about him, sat down on the deck again as quiet as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it must be the work of some scoundrel
ashore,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>He pulled the edge of the hood well forward over his brow
before he muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scoundrel. . . . Yes. . . . It&rsquo;s
evident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t get us,
that&rsquo;s clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he assented quietly, &ldquo;they
cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shaved the Cape very close to avoid an adverse
current.&nbsp; On the other side, by the effect of the land, the
wind failed us so completely for a moment that the
<i>Tremolino&rsquo;s</i> two great lofty sails hung idle to the
masts in the thundering uproar of the seas breaking upon the
shore we had left behind.&nbsp; And when the returning gust
filled them again, we saw with amazement half of the new
mainsail, which we thought fit to drive the boat under before
giving way, absolutely fly out of the bolt-ropes.&nbsp; We
lowered the yard at once, and saved it all, but it was no longer
a sail; it was only a heap of soaked strips of canvas cumbering
the deck and weighting the craft.&nbsp; Dominic gave the order to
throw the whole lot overboard.</p>
<p>I would have had the yard thrown overboard, too, he said,
leading me aft again, &ldquo;if it had not been for the
trouble.&nbsp; Let no sign escape you,&rdquo; he continued,
lowering his voice, &ldquo;but I am going to tell you something
terrible.&nbsp; Listen: I have observed that the roping stitches
on that sail have been cut!&nbsp; You hear?&nbsp; Cut with a
knife in many places.&nbsp; And yet it stood all that time.&nbsp;
Not enough cut.&nbsp; That flap did it at last.&nbsp; What
matters it?&nbsp; But look! there&rsquo;s treachery seated on
this very deck.&nbsp; By the horns of the devil! seated here at
our very backs.&nbsp; Do not turn, signorine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were facing aft then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; I asked, appalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; Silence!&nbsp; Be a man,
signorine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>To show I could be a man, I resolved to utter no sound as long
as Dominic himself had the force to keep his lips closed.&nbsp;
Nothing but silence becomes certain situations.&nbsp; Moreover,
the experience of treachery seemed to spread a hopeless
drowsiness over my thoughts and senses.&nbsp; For an hour or more
we watched our pursuer surging out nearer and nearer from amongst
the squalls that sometimes hid her altogether.&nbsp; But even
when not seen, we felt her there like a knife at our
throats.&nbsp; She gained on us frightfully.&nbsp; And the
<i>Tremolino</i>, in a fierce breeze and in much smoother water,
swung on easily under her one sail, with something appallingly
careless in the joyous freedom of her motion.&nbsp; Another
half-hour went by.&nbsp; I could not stand it any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will get the poor barky,&rdquo; I stammered out
suddenly, almost on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>Dominic stirred no more than a carving.&nbsp; A sense of
catastrophic loneliness overcame my inexperienced soul.&nbsp; The
vision of my companions passed before me.&nbsp; The whole
Royalist gang was in Monte Carlo now, I reckoned.&nbsp; And they
appeared to me clear-cut and very small, with affected voices and
stiff gestures, like a procession of rigid marionettes upon a toy
stage.&nbsp; I gave a start.&nbsp; What was this?&nbsp; A
mysterious, remorseless whisper came from within the motionless
black hood at my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Il faul la tuer</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard it very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Dominic?&rdquo; I asked, moving
nothing but my lips.</p>
<p>And the whisper within the hood repeated mysteriously,
&ldquo;She must be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart began to beat violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; I faltered out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love her well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must find the heart for that work too.&nbsp;
You must steer her yourself, and I shall see to it that she dies
quickly, without leaving as much as a chip behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; I murmured, fascinated by the black
hood turned immovably over the stern, as if in unlawful communion
with that old sea of magicians, slave-dealers, exiles and
warriors, the sea of legends and terrors, where the mariners of
remote antiquity used to hear the restless shade of an old
wanderer weep aloud in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a rock,&rdquo; whispered the initiated voice
within the hood secretly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;caution!&nbsp;
It must be done before our men perceive what we are about.&nbsp;
Whom can we trust now?&nbsp; A knife drawn across the fore
halyards would bring the foresail down, and put an end to our
liberty in twenty minutes.&nbsp; And the best of our men may be
afraid of drowning.&nbsp; There is our little boat, but in an
affair like this no one can be sure of being saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice ceased.&nbsp; We had started from Barcelona with our
dinghy in tow; afterwards it was too risky to try to get her in,
so we let her take her chance of the seas at the end of a
comfortable scope of rope.&nbsp; Many times she had seemed to us
completely overwhelmed, but soon we would see her bob up again on
a wave, apparently as buoyant and whole as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; I said softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
well, Dominic.&nbsp; When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&nbsp; We must get a little more in
first,&rdquo; answered the voice from the hood in a ghostly
murmur.</p>
<h2>XLV.</h2>
<p>It was settled.&nbsp; I had now the courage to turn
about.&nbsp; Our men crouched about the decks here and there with
anxious, crestfallen faces, all turned one way to watch the
chaser.&nbsp; For the first time that morning I perceived Cesar
stretched out full length on the deck near the foremast and
wondered where he had been skulking till then.&nbsp; But he might
in truth have been at my elbow all the time for all I knew.&nbsp;
We had been too absorbed in watching our fate to pay attention to
each other.&nbsp; Nobody had eaten anything that morning, but the
men had been coming constantly to drink at the water-butt.</p>
<p>I ran down to the cabin.&nbsp; I had there, put away in a
locker, ten thousand francs in gold of whose presence on board,
so far as I was aware, not a soul, except Dominic had the
slightest inkling.&nbsp; When I emerged on deck again Dominic had
turned about and was peering from under his cowl at the
coast.&nbsp; Cape Creux closed the view ahead.&nbsp; To the left
a wide bay, its waters torn and swept by fierce squalls, seemed
full of smoke.&nbsp; Astern the sky had a menacing look.</p>
<p>Directly he saw me, Dominic, in a placid tone, wanted to know
what was the matter.&nbsp; I came close to him and, looking as
unconcerned as I could, told him in an undertone that I had found
the locker broken open and the money-belt gone.&nbsp; Last
evening it was still there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you want to do with it?&rdquo; he asked me,
trembling violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it round my waist, of course,&rdquo; I answered,
amazed to hear his teeth chattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cursed gold!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
weight of the money might have cost you your life,
perhaps.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shuddered.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no time
to talk about that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&nbsp; I am waiting for that squall to come
over,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; And a few leaden minutes
passed.</p>
<p>The squall came over at last.&nbsp; Our pursuer, overtaken by
a sort of murky whirlwind, disappeared from our sight.&nbsp; The
<i>Tremolino</i> quivered and bounded forward.&nbsp; The land
ahead vanished, too, and we seemed to be left alone in a world of
water and wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Prenez la barre</i>, <i>monsieur</i>,&rdquo; Dominic
broke the silence suddenly in an austere voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
hold of the tiller.&rdquo;&nbsp; He bent his hood to my
ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;The balancelle is yours.&nbsp; Your own hands
must deal the blow.&nbsp; I&mdash;I have yet another piece of
work to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke up loudly to the man who
steered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the signorino take the tiller, and you
with the others stand by to haul the boat alongside quickly at
the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man obeyed, surprised, but silent.&nbsp; The others
stirred, and pricked up their ears at this.&nbsp; I heard their
murmurs.&nbsp; &ldquo;What now?&nbsp; Are we going to run in
somewhere and take to our heels?&nbsp; The Padrone knows what he
is doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dominic went forward.&nbsp; He paused to look down at Cesar,
who, as I have said before, was lying full length face down by
the foremast, then stepped over him, and dived out of my sight
under the foresail.&nbsp; I saw nothing ahead.&nbsp; It was
impossible for me to see anything except the foresail open and
still, like a great shadowy wing.&nbsp; But Dominic had his
bearings.&nbsp; His voice came to me from forward, in a just
audible cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, signorino!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bore on the tiller, as instructed before.&nbsp; Again I
heard him faintly, and then I had only to hold her
straight.&nbsp; No ship ran so joyously to her death
before.&nbsp; She rose and fell, as if floating in space, and
darted forward, whizzing like an arrow.&nbsp; Dominic, stooping
under the foot of the foresail, reappeared, and stood steadying
himself against the mast, with a raised forefinger in an attitude
of expectant attention.&nbsp; A second before the shock his arm
fell down by his side.&nbsp; At that I set my teeth.&nbsp; And
then&mdash;</p>
<p>Talk of splintered planks and smashed timbers!&nbsp; This
shipwreck lies upon my soul with the dread and horror of a
homicide, with the unforgettable remorse of having crushed a
living, faithful heart at a single blow.&nbsp; At one moment the
rush and the soaring swing of speed; the next a crash, and death,
stillness&mdash;a moment of horrible immobility, with the song of
the wind changed to a strident wail, and the heavy waters boiling
up menacing and sluggish around the corpse.&nbsp; I saw in a
distracting minute the foreyard fly fore and aft with a brutal
swing, the men all in a heap, cursing with fear, and hauling
frantically at the line of the boat.&nbsp; With a strange
welcoming of the familiar I saw also Cesar amongst them, and
recognised Dominic&rsquo;s old, well-known, effective gesture,
the horizontal sweep of his powerful arm.&nbsp; I recollect
distinctly saying to myself, &ldquo;Cesar must go down, of
course,&rdquo; and then, as I was scrambling on all fours, the
swinging tiller I had let go caught me a crack under the ear, and
knocked me over senseless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was actually unconscious for more than a
few minutes, but when I came to myself the dinghy was driving
before the wind into a sheltered cove, two men just keeping her
straight with their oars.&nbsp; Dominic, with his arm round my
shoulders, supported me in the stern-sheets.</p>
<p>We landed in a familiar part of the country.&nbsp; Dominic
took one of the boat&rsquo;s oars with him.&nbsp; I suppose he
was thinking of the stream we would have presently to cross, on
which there was a miserable specimen of a punt, often robbed of
its pole.&nbsp; But first of all we had to ascend the ridge of
land at the back of the Cape.&nbsp; He helped me up.&nbsp; I was
dizzy.&nbsp; My head felt very large and heavy.&nbsp; At the top
of the ascent I clung to him, and we stopped to rest.</p>
<p>To the right, below us, the wide, smoky bay was empty.&nbsp;
Dominic had kept his word.&nbsp; There was not a chip to be seen
around the black rock from which the <i>Tremolino</i>, with her
plucky heart crushed at one blow, had slipped off into deep water
to her eternal rest.&nbsp; The vastness of the open sea was
smothered in driving mists, and in the centre of the thinning
squall, phantom-like, under a frightful press of canvas, the
unconscious guardacosta dashed on, still chasing to the
northward.&nbsp; Our men were already descending the reverse
slope to look for that punt which we knew from experience was not
always to be found easily.&nbsp; I looked after them with dazed,
misty eyes.&nbsp; One, two, three, four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dominic, where&rsquo;s Cesar?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>As if repulsing the very sound of the name, the Padrone made
that ample, sweeping, knocking-down gesture.&nbsp; I stepped back
a pace and stared at him fearfully.&nbsp; His open shirt
uncovered his muscular neck and the thick hair on his
chest.&nbsp; He planted the oar upright in the soft soil, and
rolling up slowly his right sleeve, extended the bare arm before
my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he began, with an extreme deliberation,
whose superhuman restraint vibrated with the suppressed violence
of his feelings, &ldquo;is the arm which delivered the
blow.&nbsp; I am afraid it is your own gold that did the
rest.&nbsp; I forgot all about your money.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
clasped his hands together in sudden distress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
forgot, I forgot,&rdquo; he repeated disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cesar stole the belt?&rdquo; I stammered out,
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who else?&nbsp; <i>Canallia</i>!&nbsp; He must have
been spying on you for days.&nbsp; And he did the whole
thing.&nbsp; Absent all day in Barcelona.&nbsp;
<i>Traditore</i>!&nbsp; Sold his jacket&mdash;to hire a
horse.&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp; A good affair!&nbsp; I tell you it was
he who set him at us. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dominic pointed at the sea, where the guardacosta was a mere
dark speck.&nbsp; His chin dropped on his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . On information,&rdquo; he murmured, in a gloomy
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Cervoni!&nbsp; Oh! my poor brother! . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you drowned him,&rdquo; I said feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I struck once, and the wretch went down like a
stone&mdash;with the gold.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But he had time to
read in my eyes that nothing could save him while I was
alive.&nbsp; And had I not the right&mdash;I, Dominic Cervoni,
Padrone, who brought him aboard your fellucca&mdash;my nephew, a
traitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled the oar out of the ground and helped me carefully
down the slope.&nbsp; All the time he never once looked me in the
face.&nbsp; He punted us over, then shouldered the oar again and
waited till our men were at some distance before he offered me
his arm.&nbsp; After we had gone a little way, the fishing hamlet
we were making for came into view.&nbsp; Dominic stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can make your way as far as the houses
by yourself?&rdquo; he asked me quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; Where are you
going, Dominic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere.&nbsp; What a question!&nbsp; Signorino, you
are but little more than a boy to ask such a question of a man
having this tale in his family.&nbsp; <i>Ah</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Traditore</i>!&nbsp; What made me ever own that spawn of a
hungry devil for our own blood!&nbsp; Thief, cheat, coward,
liar&mdash;other men can deal with that.&nbsp; But I was his
uncle, and so . . . I wish he had poisoned
me&mdash;<i>charogne</i>!&nbsp; But this: that I, a confidential
man and a Corsican, should have to ask your pardon for bringing
on board your vessel, of which I was Padrone, a Cervoni, who has
betrayed you&mdash;a traitor!&mdash;that is too much.&nbsp; It is
too much.&nbsp; Well, I beg your pardon; and you may spit in
Dominic&rsquo;s face because a traitor of our blood taints us
all.&nbsp; A theft may be made good between men, a lie may be set
right, a death avenged, but what can one do to atone for a
treachery like this? . . . Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and walked away from me along the bank of the
stream, flourishing a vengeful arm and repeating to himself
slowly, with savage emphasis: &ldquo;<i>Ah</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Canaille</i>!&nbsp; <i>Canaille</i>!&nbsp; <i>Canaille</i>! .
. .&rdquo;&nbsp; He left me there trembling with weakness and
mute with awe.&nbsp; Unable to make a sound, I gazed after the
strangely desolate figure of that seaman carrying an oar on his
shoulder up a barren, rock-strewn ravine under the dreary leaden
sky of <i>Tremolino&rsquo;s</i> last day.&nbsp; Thus, walking
deliberately, with his back to the sea, Dominic vanished from my
sight.</p>
<p>With the quality of our desires, thoughts, and wonder
proportioned to our infinite littleness, we measure even time
itself by our own stature.&nbsp; Imprisoned in the house of
personal illusions, thirty centuries in mankind&rsquo;s history
seem less to look back upon than thirty years of our own
life.&nbsp; And Dominic Cervoni takes his place in my memory by
the side of the legendary wanderer on the sea of marvels and
terrors, by the side of the fatal and impious adventurer, to whom
the evoked shade of the soothsayer predicted a journey inland
with an oar on his shoulder, till he met men who had never set
eyes on ships and oars.&nbsp; It seems to me I can see them side
by side in the twilight of an arid land, the unfortunate
possessors of the secret lore of the sea, bearing the emblem of
their hard calling on their shoulders, surrounded by silent and
curious men: even as I, too, having turned my back upon the sea,
am bearing those few pages in the twilight, with the hope of
finding in an inland valley the silent welcome of some patient
listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">fellow</span> has now no chance
of promotion unless he jumps into the muzzle of a gun and crawls
out of the touch-hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He who, a hundred years ago, more or less, pronounced the
above words in the uneasiness of his heart, thirsting for
professional distinction, was a young naval officer.&nbsp; Of his
life, career, achievements, and end nothing is preserved for the
edification of his young successors in the fleet of
to-day&mdash;nothing but this phrase, which, sailor-like in the
simplicity of personal sentiment and strength of graphic
expression, embodies the spirit of the epoch.&nbsp; This obscure
but vigorous testimony has its price, its significance, and its
lesson.&nbsp; It comes to us from a worthy ancestor.&nbsp; We do
not know whether he lived long enough for a chance of that
promotion whose way was so arduous.&nbsp; He belongs to the great
array of the unknown&mdash;who are great, indeed, by the sum
total of the devoted effort put out, and the colossal scale of
success attained by their insatiable and steadfast
ambition.&nbsp; We do not know his name; we only know of him what
is material for us to know&mdash;that he was never backward on
occasions of desperate service.&nbsp; We have this on the
authority of a distinguished seaman of Nelson&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;
Departing this life as Admiral of the Fleet on the eve of the
Crimean War, Sir Thomas Byam Martin has recorded for us amongst
his all too short autobiographical notes these few characteristic
words uttered by one young man of the many who must have felt
that particular inconvenience of a heroic age.</p>
<p>The distinguished Admiral had lived through it himself, and
was a good judge of what was expected in those days from men and
ships.&nbsp; A brilliant frigate captain, a man of sound
judgment, of dashing bravery and of serene mind, scrupulously
concerned for the welfare and honour of the navy, he missed a
larger fame only by the chances of the service.&nbsp; We may well
quote on this day the words written of Nelson, in the decline of
a well-spent life, by Sir T. B. Martin, who died just fifty years
ago on the very anniversary of Trafalgar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nelson&rsquo;s nobleness of mind was a prominent and
beautiful part of his character.&nbsp; His foibles&mdash;faults
if you like&mdash;will never be dwelt upon in any memorandum of
mine,&rdquo; he declares, and goes on&mdash;&ldquo;he whose
splendid and matchless achievements will be remembered with
admiration while there is gratitude in the hearts of Britons, or
while a ship floats upon the ocean; he whose example on the
breaking out of the war gave so chivalrous an impulse to the
younger men of the service that all rushed into rivalry of daring
which disdained every warning of prudence, and led to acts of
heroic enterprise which tended greatly to exalt the glory of our
nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are his words, and they are true.&nbsp; The dashing
young frigate captain, the man who in middle age was nothing loth
to give chase single-handed in his seventy-four to a whole fleet,
the man of enterprise and consummate judgment, the old Admiral of
the Fleet, the good and trusted servant of his country under two
kings and a queen, had felt correctly Nelson&rsquo;s influence,
and expressed himself with precision out of the fulness of his
seaman&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exalted,&rdquo; he wrote, not
&ldquo;augmented.&rdquo;&nbsp; And therein his feeling and his
pen captured the very truth.&nbsp; Other men there were ready and
able to add to the treasure of victories the British navy has
given to the nation.&nbsp; It was the lot of Lord Nelson to exalt
all this glory.&nbsp; Exalt! the word seems to be created for the
man.</p>
<h2>XLVII.</h2>
<p>The British navy may well have ceased to count its
victories.&nbsp; It is rich beyond the wildest dreams of success
and fame.&nbsp; It may well, rather, on a culminating day of its
history, cast about for the memory of some reverses to appease
the jealous fates which attend the prosperity and triumphs of a
nation.&nbsp; It holds, indeed, the heaviest inheritance that has
ever been entrusted to the courage and fidelity of armed men.</p>
<p>It is too great for mere pride.&nbsp; It should make the
seamen of to-day humble in the secret of their hearts, and
indomitable in their unspoken resolution.&nbsp; In all the
records of history there has never been a time when a victorious
fortune has been so faithful to men making war upon the
sea.&nbsp; And it must be confessed that on their part they knew
how to be faithful to their victorious fortune.&nbsp; They were
exalted.&nbsp; They were always watching for her smile; night or
day, fair weather or foul, they waited for her slightest sign
with the offering of their stout hearts in their hands.&nbsp; And
for the inspiration of this high constancy they were indebted to
Lord Nelson alone.&nbsp; Whatever earthly affection he abandoned
or grasped, the great Admiral was always, before all, beyond all,
a lover of Fame.&nbsp; He loved her jealously, with an
inextinguishable ardour and an insatiable desire&mdash;he loved
her with a masterful devotion and an infinite trustfulness.&nbsp;
In the plenitude of his passion he was an exacting lover.&nbsp;
And she never betrayed the greatness of his trust!&nbsp; She
attended him to the end of his life, and he died pressing her
last gift (nineteen prizes) to his heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anchor,
Hardy&mdash;anchor!&rdquo; was as much the cry of an ardent lover
as of a consummate seaman.&nbsp; Thus he would hug to his breast
the last gift of Fame.</p>
<p>It was this ardour which made him great.&nbsp; He was a
flaming example to the wooers of glorious fortune.&nbsp; There
have been great officers before&mdash;Lord Hood, for instance,
whom he himself regarded as the greatest sea officer England ever
had.&nbsp; A long succession of great commanders opened the sea
to the vast range of Nelson&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp; His time had
come; and, after the great sea officers, the great naval
tradition passed into the keeping of a great man.&nbsp; Not the
least glory of the navy is that it understood Nelson.&nbsp; Lord
Hood trusted him.&nbsp; Admiral Keith told him: &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t spare you either as Captain or Admiral.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Earl St. Vincent put into his hands, untrammelled by orders, a
division of his fleet, and Sir Hyde Parker gave him two more
ships at Copenhagen than he had asked for.&nbsp; So much for the
chiefs; the rest of the navy surrendered to him their devoted
affection, trust, and admiration.&nbsp; In return he gave them no
less than his own exalted soul.&nbsp; He breathed into them his
own ardour and his own ambition.&nbsp; In a few short years he
revolutionized, not the strategy or tactics of sea-warfare, but
the very conception of victory itself.&nbsp; And this is
genius.&nbsp; In that alone, through the fidelity of his fortune
and the power of his inspiration, he stands unique amongst the
leaders of fleets and sailors.&nbsp; He brought heroism into the
line of duty.&nbsp; Verily he is a terrible ancestor.</p>
<p>And the men of his day loved him.&nbsp; They loved him not
only as victorious armies have loved great commanders; they loved
him with a more intimate feeling as one of themselves.&nbsp; In
the words of a contemporary, he had &ldquo;a most happy way of
gaining the affectionate respect of all who had the felicity to
serve under his command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be so great and to remain so accessible to the affection of
one&rsquo;s fellow-men is the mark of exceptional humanity.&nbsp;
Lord Nelson&rsquo;s greatness was very human.&nbsp; It had a
moral basis; it needed to feel itself surrounded by the warm
devotion of a band of brothers.&nbsp; He was vain and
tender.&nbsp; The love and admiration which the navy gave him so
unreservedly soothed the restlessness of his professional
pride.&nbsp; He trusted them as much as they trusted him.&nbsp;
He was a seaman of seamen.&nbsp; Sir T. B. Martin states that he
never conversed with any officer who had served under Nelson
&ldquo;without hearing the heartiest expressions of attachment to
his person and admiration of his frank and conciliatory manner to
his subordinates.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Sir Robert Stopford, who
commanded one of the ships with which Nelson chased to the West
Indies a fleet nearly double in number, says in a letter:
&ldquo;We are half-starved and otherwise inconvenienced by being
so long out of port, but our reward is that we are with
Nelson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This heroic spirit of daring and endurance, in which all
public and private differences were sunk throughout the whole
fleet, is Lord Nelson&rsquo;s great legacy, triply sealed by the
victorious impress of the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar.&nbsp;
This is a legacy whose value the changes of time cannot
affect.&nbsp; The men and the ships he knew how to lead lovingly
to the work of courage and the reward of glory have passed away,
but Nelson&rsquo;s uplifting touch remains in the standard of
achievement he has set for all time.&nbsp; The principles of
strategy may be immutable.&nbsp; It is certain they have been,
and shall be again, disregarded from timidity, from blindness,
through infirmity of purpose.&nbsp; The tactics of great captains
on land and sea can be infinitely discussed.&nbsp; The first
object of tactics is to close with the adversary on terms of the
greatest possible advantage; yet no hard-and-fast rules can be
drawn from experience, for this capital reason, amongst
others&mdash;that the quality of the adversary is a variable
element in the problem.&nbsp; The tactics of Lord Nelson have
been amply discussed, with much pride and some profit.&nbsp; And
yet, truly, they are already of but archaic interest.&nbsp; A
very few years more and the hazardous difficulties of handling a
fleet under canvas shall have passed beyond the conception of
seamen who hold in trust for their country Lord Nelson&rsquo;s
legacy of heroic spirit.&nbsp; The change in the character of the
ships is too great and too radical.&nbsp; It is good and proper
to study the acts of great men with thoughtful reverence, but
already the precise intention of Lord Nelson&rsquo;s famous
memorandum seems to lie under that veil which Time throws over
the clearest conceptions of every great art.&nbsp; It must not be
forgotten that this was the first time when Nelson, commanding in
chief, had his opponents under way&mdash;the first time and the
last.&nbsp; Had he lived, had there been other fleets left to
oppose him, we would, perhaps, have learned something more of his
greatness as a sea officer.&nbsp; Nothing could have been added
to his greatness as a leader.&nbsp; All that can be affirmed is,
that on no other day of his short and glorious career was Lord
Nelson more splendidly true to his genius and to his
country&rsquo;s fortune.</p>
<h2>XLVIII.</h2>
<p>And yet the fact remains that, had the wind failed and the
fleet lost steerage way, or, worse still, had it been taken aback
from the eastward, with its leaders within short range of the
enemy&rsquo;s guns, nothing, it seems, could have saved the
headmost ships from capture or destruction.&nbsp; No skill of a
great sea officer would have availed in such a contingency.&nbsp;
Lord Nelson was more than that, and his genius would have
remained undiminished by defeat.&nbsp; But obviously tactics,
which are so much at the mercy of irremediable accident, must
seem to a modern seaman a poor matter of study.&nbsp; The
Commander-in-Chief in the great fleet action that will take its
place next to the Battle of Trafalgar in the history of the
British navy will have no such anxiety, and will feel the weight
of no such dependence.&nbsp; For a hundred years now no British
fleet has engaged the enemy in line of battle.&nbsp; A hundred
years is a long time, but the difference of modern conditions is
enormous.&nbsp; The gulf is great.&nbsp; Had the last great fight
of the English navy been that of the First of June, for instance,
had there been no Nelson&rsquo;s victories, it would have been
wellnigh impassable.&nbsp; The great Admiral&rsquo;s slight and
passion-worn figure stands at the parting of the ways.&nbsp; He
had the audacity of genius, and a prophetic inspiration.</p>
<p>The modern naval man must feel that the time has come for the
tactical practice of the great sea officers of the past to be
laid by in the temple of august memories.&nbsp; The fleet tactics
of the sailing days have been governed by two points: the deadly
nature of a raking fire, and the dread, natural to a commander
dependent upon the winds, to find at some crucial moment part of
his fleet thrown hopelessly to leeward.&nbsp; These two points
were of the very essence of sailing tactics, and these two points
have been eliminated from the modern tactical problem by the
changes of propulsion and armament.&nbsp; Lord Nelson was the
first to disregard them with conviction and audacity sustained by
an unbounded trust in the men he led.&nbsp; This conviction, this
audacity and this trust stand out from amongst the lines of the
celebrated memorandum, which is but a declaration of his faith in
a crushing superiority of fire as the only means of victory and
the only aim of sound tactics.&nbsp; Under the difficulties of
the then existing conditions he strove for that, and for that
alone, putting his faith into practice against every risk.&nbsp;
And in that exclusive faith Lord Nelson appears to us as the
first of the moderns.</p>
<p>Against every risk, I have said; and the men of to-day, born
and bred to the use of steam, can hardly realize how much of that
risk was in the weather.&nbsp; Except at the Nile, where the
conditions were ideal for engaging a fleet moored in shallow
water, Lord Nelson was not lucky in his weather.&nbsp;
Practically it was nothing but a quite unusual failure of the
wind which cost him his arm during the Teneriffe
expedition.&nbsp; On Trafalgar Day the weather was not so much
unfavourable as extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>It was one of these covered days of fitful sunshine, of light,
unsteady winds, with a swell from the westward, and hazy in
general, but with the land about the Cape at times distinctly
visible.&nbsp; It has been my lot to look with reverence upon the
very spot more than once, and for many hours together.&nbsp; All
but thirty years ago, certain exceptional circumstances made me
very familiar for a time with that bight in the Spanish coast
which would be enclosed within a straight line drawn from Faro to
Spartel.&nbsp; My well-remembered experience has convinced me
that, in that corner of the ocean, once the wind has got to the
northward of west (as it did on the 20th, taking the British
fleet aback), appearances of westerly weather go for nothing, and
that it is infinitely more likely to veer right round to the east
than to shift back again.&nbsp; It was in those conditions that,
at seven on the morning of the 21st, the signal for the fleet to
bear up and steer east was made.&nbsp; Holding a clear
recollection of these languid easterly sighs rippling
unexpectedly against the run of the smooth swell, with no other
warning than a ten-minutes&rsquo; calm and a queer darkening of
the coast-line, I cannot think, without a gasp of professional
awe, of that fateful moment.&nbsp; Perhaps personal experience,
at a time of life when responsibility had a special freshness and
importance, has induced me to exaggerate to myself the danger of
the weather.&nbsp; The great Admiral and good seaman could read
aright the signs of sea and sky, as his order to prepare to
anchor at the end of the day sufficiently proves; but, all the
same, the mere idea of these baffling easterly airs, coming on at
any time within half an hour or so, after the firing of the first
shot, is enough to take one&rsquo;s breath away, with the image
of the rearmost ships of both divisions falling off,
unmanageable, broadside on to the westerly swell, and of two
British Admirals in desperate jeopardy.&nbsp; To this day I
cannot free myself from the impression that, for some forty
minutes, the fate of the great battle hung upon a breath of wind
such as I have felt stealing from behind, as it were, upon my
cheek while engaged in looking to the westward for the signs of
the true weather.</p>
<p>Never more shall British seamen going into action have to
trust the success of their valour to a breath of wind.&nbsp; The
God of gales and battles favouring her arms to the last, has let
the sun of England&rsquo;s sailing-fleet and of its greatest
master set in unclouded glory.&nbsp; And now the old ships and
their men are gone; the new ships and the new men, many of them
bearing the old, auspicious names, have taken up their watch on
the stern and impartial sea, which offers no opportunities but to
those who know how to grasp them with a ready hand and an
undaunted heart.</p>
<h2>XLIX.</h2>
<p>This the navy of the Twenty Years&rsquo; War knew well how to
do, and never better than when Lord Nelson had breathed into its
soul his own passion of honour and fame.&nbsp; It was a fortunate
navy.&nbsp; Its victories were no mere smashing of helpless ships
and massacres of cowed men.&nbsp; It was spared that cruel
favour, for which no brave heart had ever prayed.&nbsp; It was
fortunate in its adversaries.&nbsp; I say adversaries, for on
recalling such proud memories we should avoid the word
&ldquo;enemies,&rdquo; whose hostile sound perpetuates the
antagonisms and strife of nations, so irremediable perhaps, so
fateful&mdash;and also so vain.&nbsp; War is one of the gifts of
life; but, alas! no war appears so very necessary when time has
laid its soothing hand upon the passionate misunderstandings and
the passionate desires of great peoples.&nbsp; &ldquo;Le
temps,&rdquo; as a distinguished Frenchman has said, &ldquo;est
un galant homme.&rdquo;&nbsp; He fosters the spirit of concord
and justice, in whose work there is as much glory to be reaped as
in the deeds of arms.</p>
<p>One of them disorganized by revolutionary changes, the other
rusted in the neglect of a decayed monarchy, the two fleets
opposed to us entered the contest with odds against them from the
first.&nbsp; By the merit of our daring and our faithfulness, and
the genius of a great leader, we have in the course of the war
augmented our advantage and kept it to the last.&nbsp; But in the
exulting illusion of irresistible might a long series of military
successes brings to a nation the less obvious aspect of such a
fortune may perchance be lost to view.&nbsp; The old navy in its
last days earned a fame that no belittling malevolence dare cavil
at.&nbsp; And this supreme favour they owe to their adversaries
alone.</p>
<p>Deprived by an ill-starred fortune of that self-confidence
which strengthens the hands of an armed host, impaired in skill
but not in courage, it may safely be said that our adversaries
managed yet to make a better fight of it in 1797 than they did in
1793.&nbsp; Later still, the resistance offered at the Nile was
all, and more than all, that could be demanded from seamen, who,
unless blind or without understanding, must have seen their doom
sealed from the moment that the <i>Goliath</i>, bearing up under
the bows of the <i>Guerrier</i>, took up an inshore berth.&nbsp;
The combined fleets of 1805, just come out of port, and attended
by nothing but the disturbing memories of reverses, presented to
our approach a determined front, on which Captain Blackwood, in a
knightly spirit, congratulated his Admiral.&nbsp; By the
exertions of their valour our adversaries have but added a
greater lustre to our arms.&nbsp; No friend could have done more,
for even in war, which severs for a time all the sentiments of
human fellowship, this subtle bond of association remains between
brave men&mdash;that the final testimony to the value of victory
must be received at the hands of the vanquished.</p>
<p>Those who from the heat of that battle sank together to their
repose in the cool depths of the ocean would not understand the
watchwords of our day, would gaze with amazed eyes at the engines
of our strife.&nbsp; All passes, all changes: the animosity of
peoples, the handling of fleets, the forms of ships; and even the
sea itself seems to wear a different and diminished aspect from
the sea of Lord Nelson&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; In this ceaseless rush
of shadows and shades, that, like the fantastic forms of clouds
cast darkly upon the waters on a windy day, fly past us to fall
headlong below the hard edge of an implacable horizon, we must
turn to the national spirit, which, superior in its force and
continuity to good and evil fortune, can alone give us the
feeling of an enduring existence and of an invincible power
against the fates.</p>
<p>Like a subtle and mysterious elixir poured into the perishable
clay of successive generations, it grows in truth, splendour, and
potency with the march of ages.&nbsp; In its incorruptible flow
all round the globe of the earth it preserves from the decay and
forgetfulness of death the greatness of our great men, and
amongst them the passionate and gentle greatness of Nelson, the
nature of whose genius was, on the faith of a brave seaman and
distinguished Admiral, such as to &ldquo;Exalt the glory of our
nation.&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
