    <h2>TRAVELLING IN ENGLAND.</h2>

    <p>I suppose that the history of travelling in this country,
    from the Creation to the present time, may be divided into four
    periods&mdash;those of no coaches, slow coaches, fast coaches,
    railways. Whether balloons, or rockets, or some new mode which
    as yet has no name, because it has no existence, may come next,
    I cannot tell, and it is hardly worth while to think about it;
    for, no doubt, it will be something quite inconceivable.</p>

    <p>The third, or fast-coach period was brief, though brilliant.
    I doubt whether fifty years have elapsed since the newest news
    in the world of locomotive fashion was, that&mdash;to the utter
    confusion and defacement of the "Sick, Lame, and Lazy," a sober
    vehicle so called from the nature of its cargo, which was
    nightly disbanded into comfortable beds at Newbury&mdash;a new
    post-coach had been set up which performed the journey to Bath
    in a single day. Perhaps the day extended from about five
    o'clock in the morning to midnight, but still the coach was, as
    it called itself, a "<i>Day</i>-coach," for it travelled all
    day; and if it did somewhat "add the night unto the day, and so
    make up the measure," the passengers had all the more for their
    money, and were incomparably better off as to time than they
    had ever been before. But after this many years elapsed before
    "old Quicksilver" made good its ten miles an hour in one
    unbroken trot to Exeter, and was rivalled by "young
    Quicksilver" on the road to Bristol, and beaten by the
    light-winged Hirondelle, that flew from Liverpool to
    Cheltenham, and troops of others, each faster than the
    foregoing, each trumpeting its own fame on its own improved
    bugle, and beating time (all to nothing) with sixteen hoofs of
    invisible swiftness. How they would have stared if a
    parliamentary train had passed them, especially if they could
    have heard its inmates grumbling over their slow progress, and
    declaring that it would be almost quicker to get out and walk
    whenever their jealousy was roused by the sudden flash of an
    express.</p>

    <p>Certainly I was among those who rejoiced in the increased
    expedition of the fast-coach period; not because I loved, but
    because I hated, travelling, and was glad to have periods of
    misery abridged. I used to listen with delight to the stories
    of my seniors, and to marvel that in so short a space of time
    so great an improvement had been made. One friend told me that
    in earlier life he had travelled from Gloucester to Hereford in
    a coach, which performed the journey of about thirty miles
    between the hours of five in the morning and seven in the
    evening. I took it for granted that they stopped on the road to
    dine, and spent a long afternoon in smoking,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>{34}</span> napping, or playing at bowls.
       But he would not acknowledge anything of the kind, and the
       impression on his mind was that they kept going (such going
       as it was), except during the time necessarily expended in
       baiting the horses, who, I think, were not
       changed&mdash;unless indeed it were from bad to worse by
       fatigue. Another friend, a physician at Sheffield, told me
       that one of the first times (perhaps he may have said, the
       first) that a coach started for London, he was a passenger.
       Without setting out unreasonably early in the morning, or
       travelling late at night they made such progress, that the
       first night they lay at Nottingham, and the second at Market
       Harborough. The third morning they were up early, and off at
       five o'clock; and by a long pull and a strong pull through a
       long day, they were in time to hear Bow Church clock strike
       eleven or twelve (I forget which) as they passed through
       Cheapside. In fact such things have always seemed to me to
       be worth noting, for you never can tell to what extent, or
       even in what direction, they may throw some little ray of
       light on an obscure point of history. On this principle I
       thought it worth while to copy an original bill which lately
       fell into my hands. Many such have been reprinted, but I am
       not aware that this one has; and as what is wanted is a
       series, every little may help. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"YORK Four Dayes</p>

    <p>"Stage-Coach</p>

    <p>"Begins on Monday the 18 of March 1678.</p>

    <p>"All that are desirous to pass from London to York, or
    return from York to London or any other Place on that Road; Let
    them Repair to the Black Swan in Holborn in London and the
    Black Swan in Cony-Street in York.</p>

    <p>"At both which places they may be received in a Stage-Coach
    every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, which performs the whole
    journey in Four days (if God permit) and sets forth by Six in
    the Morning.</p>

    <p>"And returns from York to Doncaster in a Forenoon, to Newark
    in a day and a half, to Stamford in Two days, and from Stamford
    to London in Two days more.</p>

    <table summary="Performers">
        <tr>
            <td>"Performed by</td>

            <td><big><big><big><big>{</big></big></big></big></td>

            <td align="left">Henry Moulen<br />
            Margaret Gardner<br />
            Francis Gardner."</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>But I cannot deny that, while I have listened to, and
    rejoiced in, these stories, I have had some doubt whether full
    justice has been done to the other side of the question. I have
    always felt as if I had a sort of guilty knowledge of one
    contradictory fact, which I learned between twenty and thirty
    years ago, and which no one whom I have yet met with has been
    able to explain. For this reason I am desirous to lay it before
    you and your readers.</p>

    <p>Just one hundred years ago&mdash;that is to say, on Sunday,
    the 10th of August, 1749&mdash;two German travellers landed at
    Harwich. The principal one was Stephen Schultz, who travelled
    for twenty years through various parts of Europe, Asia, and
    Africa, in the service of the Callenberg Institution at Halle,
    of which he was afterwards Director, being at the same time
    Pastor of St. Ulrich's Church in that city, where his picture
    is (or was about twenty years ago) to be seen affixed to the
    great pillar next the organ. It represents him as an elderly
    divine in a black cap, and with a grave and prediger-like
    aspect; but there is another likeness of him&mdash;an engraved
    print&mdash;in which he looks more like a Turk than a
    Christian. He is dressed in a shawl turban, brickdust-red
    mantle, and the rest of the costume which he adopted in his
    Eastern travels. Our business, however, is with his English
    adventures, which must, I think, have astonished him as much as
    anything that he met with in Arabia, even if he acted all the
    Thousand and One Nights on the spot. As I have already said, he
    and his companion (Albrecht Friedrich Woltersdorf, son of the
    Pastor of St. George's Church in Berlin), landed at Harwich on
    Sunday, August 10. They staid there that night, and on Monday
    they walked over to Colchester. There (I presume the next
    morning) they took the "Land-Kutsche," and were <i>barely six
    hours</i> on the road to London.</p>

    <p>This statement seems to me to be so at variance with
    notorious facts, that, but for one or two circumstances, I
    should have quietly set it down for a mistake; but as I do not
    feel that I can do this, I should be glad to obtain information
    which may explain it. It is no error of words or figures, for
    the writer expresses very naturally the surprise which he
    certainly must have felt at the swiftness of the horses, and
    the goodness of the roads. He was a man who had seen something
    of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>{35}</span> the world, for he had lived
       five-and-thirty years, thirteen of which had elapsed since
       he began his travels. As a foreigner he was under no
       temptation to exaggerate the superiority of English
       travelling, especially to an extent incomprehensible by his
       countrymen; and, in short, I cannot imagine any ground for
       suspecting mistake or untruth of any
       kind.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>I have never been at Colchester, but I believe it is, and
    always was, full fifty miles from London. Ipswich, I believe,
    is only eighteen miles farther; and yet <i>fifteen years</i>
    later we find an advertisement (<i>Daily Advertiser</i>,
    Thursday, Aug. 30, 1764), announcing that London and Ipswich
    Post Coaches on <i>steel springs</i> (think of that, and think
    of the astonished Germans careering over the country from
    Colchester without that mitigation), from London to Ipswich in
    <i>ten hours</i> with Postillions, set out every morning at
    seven o'clock, Sundays excepted, from the Black Bull Inn, in
    Bishopsgate Street.</p>

    <p>It is right, however, to add that the Herr Preniger Schultz
    and his companion appear to have returned to Colchester, on
    their way back to Germany, at a much more moderate pace. The
    particulars do not very exactly appear; but it seems from his
    journal that on the 16th of September they dined with the Herr
    Prediger Pittius, minister of the German Church in the Savoy,
    at twelve o'clock (<i>nach teutscher art</i>, as the writer
    observes). They then went to their lodging, settled their
    accounts, took up their luggage, and proceeded to the inn from
    which the "St&auml;ts-Kutsche" was to start; and on arriving
    there found some of their friends assembled, who had ordered a
    meal, of which they partook. How much time was occupied in all
    this, or when the coach set out, does not appear; but they
    travelled the whole night, and until towards noon the next day,
    before they got to Colchester. This is rather more
    intelligible; but as to their up-journey I really am puzzled,
    and shall be glad of any explanation.</p>

    <p>Yours, &amp;c.</p>

    <h2>SANUTO'S DOGES OF VENICE.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;Among the well-wishers to your projected
    periodical, as a medium of literary communication, no one would
    be more ready to contribute to it than myself, did the leisure
    I enjoy permit me often to do so. I have been a maker of
    <i>Notes and Queries</i> for above twenty-five years, and
    perhaps should feel more inclined to trouble you with the
    latter than the former, in the hope of clearing up some of the
    many obscure points in your history, biography, and poetical
    literature, which have occurred to me in the course of my
    reading. At present, as a very inadequate specimen of what I
    once designed to call <i>Leisure Moments</i>, I beg to copy the
    following Note from one of my scrap-books:&mdash;</p>

    <p>In the year 1420, the Florentines sent an embassy to the
    state of Venice, to solicit them to unite in a league against
    the ambitious progress of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of
    Milan; and the historian Daru, in his <i>Histoire de
    Venise</i>, 8vo., Paris, 1821, has fallen into more than one
    error in his account of the transaction. Marino Sanuto, who
    wrote the lives of the Doges of Venice in 1493 (Daru says,
    erroneously, some fifty years afterwards), has preserved the
    Orations made by the Doge Tomaso Mocenigo, in opposition to the
    Florentine proposals; which he copied, according to his
    statement, from a manuscript that belonged to the Doge himself.
    Daru states, that the MS. was communicated to him by the Doge;
    but that could not be, since the Doge died in 1423, and Sanuto
    was not born till 1466. An abridged translation of these
    Orations is given in the <i>Histoire de Venise</i>, tom. ii,
    pp. 289-311.; and in the first of these, pronounced in January,
    1420 (1421, Daru), he is made to say, in reference to an
    ambassador sent by the Florentines to the Duke of Milan, in
    1414, as follows: "L'ambassadeur fut <i>un Juif</i>,
    nomm&eacute; Valori, banquier de sa profession,", p. 291. As a
    commentary on this passage, Daru subjoins a note from the
    Abb&eacute; Laugier, who, in his <i>Histoire de Venise</i>,
    liv. 21., remarks, 1. That it appears strange the Florentines
    should have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"

       ambassador; 2. That his surname was Bartolomeo, which could
       not have been borne by a Jew; 3. That the Florentine
       historian Poggio speaks of Valori as having been one of the
       principal members of the Council of Florence. The
       Abb&eacute; thence justly concludes, that the ambassador
       could not have been a Jew; and it is extraordinary that
       Daru, after such a conclusive argument, should have admitted
       the term <i>Jew</i> into his text. But the truth is, that
       this writer (like many others of great reputation) preferred
       blindly following the text of Sanuto, as printed by
       Muratori<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
       to the trouble of consulting any early manuscripts. It
       happens, however, that in a manuscript copy of these
       Orations of Mocenigo, written certainly earlier than the
       period of Sanuto, and preserved in the British Museum, MS.
       <i>Add.</i> 12, 121., the true reading of the passage may be
       found thus:&mdash;"Fo mandato Bartolomio Valori, <i>homo
       richo</i>, el qual viveva de cambij." By later transcribers
       the epithet <i>richo</i>, so properly here bestowed on the
       Florentine noble, was changed into <i>iudio</i>
       (<i>giudeo</i>), and having been transferred in that shape
       into Sanuto, has formed the groundwork of a serious error,
       which has now existed for more than three centuries and a
       half.</p>

    <h2>LETTERS OF LORD NELSON'S BROTHER IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE
    BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR.</h2>

    <p class="note">[The following letters will be best illustrated
    by a few words derived from the valuable life of our great
    naval hero lately published by Mr. Pettigrew. Besides his last
    will, properly so called, which had been some time executed,
    Lord Nelson wrote and signed another paper of testamentary
    character immediately before he commenced the battle of
    Trafalgar. It contained an enumeration of certain public
    services performed by Lady Hamilton, and a request that she
    might be provided for by the country. "Could I have rewarded
    those services," Lord Nelson says, "I would not now call upon
    my country; but as that has not been in my power, I leave Emma
    Hamilton, therefore, a legacy to my king and country, that will
    give her ample provision to maintain her rank in life." He also
    recommended to the beneficence of his country his adopted
    daughter. "My relations," he concludes, "it is needless to
    mention; they will of course be amply provided for."</p>

    <p class="note">This paper was delivered over to Lord Nelson's
    brother, together with his will. "Earl Nelson, with his wife
    and family, were then with Lady Hamilton, and had indeed been
    living with her many months. To their son Horatio, afterwards
    Viscount Trafalgar, she was as attentive as a mother, and their
    daughter had been almost exclusively under her care for
    education for six years. The Earl kept the codicil in his
    pocket until the day 120,000<i>l.</i> was voted for him by the
    House of Commons. On that day he dined with Lady Hamilton in
    Clarges Street, and learning at table what had been done, he
    brought forth the codicil, and throwing it to Lady Hamilton,
    coarsely said, she might now do with it as she
    pleased."&mdash;Pettigrew's <i>Memoirs of Nelson</i>, ii. 624,
    625. Lady Hamilton took the paper to Doctors' Commons, where it
    stands registered as a codicil to Nelson's will. A knowledge of
    these circumstances is necessary to the full understanding of
    our correspondents communication.]</p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;The following letters may be found interesting as
    illustrative of the private history of Lord Nelson, to which
    public attention has been strongly drawn of late by the able
    work of Mr. Pettigrew. The letters were addressed by Earl
    Nelson to the Rev. A.J. Scott, the friend and chaplain of the
    fallen hero.</p>

        <p>18, Charles Street, Berkeley Square,</p>

        <p>Dec. 2. 1805.</p>

        <p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I am this day favoured with your

           The afflicting intelligence you designed to prepare me
           for had arrived much sooner; but I am duly sensible of
           the kind motive which inducted this mark of your
           attention and remembrance.</p>

        <p>The King has been pleased to command that his great and
        gallant servant shall be buried with funeral honours
        suitable to the splendid services he rendered to his
        country, and that the body shall be conveyed by water to
        Greenwich, in order to be laid in state. For myself I need
        not say how anxious I am to pay every tribute of affection
        and of respect to my honoured and lamented brother's
        remains. And it affords me great satisfaction to learn your
        intention of accompanying them till deposited in their last
        earthly mansion. The coffin made of the L'Orient's mast
        will be sent to Greenwich to await the arrival of the body,
        and I hope there to have an opportunity of making my
        acknowledgments in person.</p>

        <p>Believe me, dear Sir,</p>

        <p>Your faithful friend, and obedient humble servant,</p>

        (with my sincere regards and kind compliments) to Captain
        Hardy the like request.</p>

        <p>Dec. 13. 1805.</p>

        <p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I have been to the Admiralty, and I am
        assured that leave will be sent to you to quit the ship,
        and follow the remains of my dear brother when you please.
        We have determined to send Mr. Tyson with the coffin to the
        Victory, when we know she is at the Nore. He, together with
        Captain hardy and yourself, will see the body safely
        deposited therein. I trust to the affection of all for
        that. The Admiralty will order the Commissioner's yacht at
        Sheerness to receive it, and bring it to Greenwich. I
        suppose an order from the Admiralty will go to Captain
        Hardy to deliver the body to Mr. Tyson, and you will of
        course attend. But if this should be omitted by any mistake
        of office, I trust Captain Hardy will have no
        difficulty.</p>

        <p>There is no hurry in it, as the funeral will not be till
        the 10th or 12th of January.</p>

        <p>We do not wish to send Tyson till we have the will and
        codicil, which Captain Hardy informed me was to come by
        Captain Blackwood from Portsmouth on Tuesday last. We are
        surprised he is not here. Compts. to Captain Hardy. Write
        to me as soon as you get to the Nore, or before, if you
        can.</p>

        <p>Believe me, yours faithfully,</p>

        <p>Dear Sir,&mdash; I received your letters of the 23rd and
        25th this morning. I am glad to hear the remains of my late
        dear and most illustrious brother are at length removed to
        Mr. Peddieson's coffin, and safely deposited in Greenwich
        Hospital. Your kind and affectionate attention throughout
        the whole of this mournful and trying scene cannot fail to
        meet my sincere and grateful thanks, and that of the whole
        family. I am perfectly satisfied with the surgeon's reports
        which have been sent to me, that every thing proper has
        been done. I could wish to have known what has been done
        with the bowels&mdash;whether they were thrown overboard,
        or whether they were preserved to be put into the coffin
        with the body. The features being now lost, the face
        cannot, as Mr. Beatty very properly observes, be exposed; I
        hope therefore everything is closed and soldered down.</p>

        <p>I wrote to Mr. Tyson a few days ago, and should be glad
        to hear from him. I mean to go towards London about the
        1st, 2nd or 3rd of Jan (the day not yet fixed), and call at
        Greenwich for a moment, just to have a melancholy sight of
        the coffin, &amp;c. &amp;c., when I hope I shall see
        you.</p>

        <p>I shall be glad to hear from you as often as you have
        any thing new to communicate, and how the preparations go
        on. Every thing now is in the hands of government, but,
        strange to tell, I have not yet heard from the Herald's
        Office, whether <i>I</i> am to attend the procession or
        <i>not</i>.</p>

    <p>The <i>codicil</i> referred to in these letters proved to
    be, or at least to include, that memorable document which the
    Earl suppressed, when he produced the will, lest it should
    curtail his own share of the amount of favour which a grateful
    country would be anxious to heap on the representative of the
    departed hero. By this unworthy conduct the fortunes of Lady
    Hamilton and her still surviving daughter were at once
    blighted.</p>

    <p>The Earl as tightly held all he had, as he grasped all he
    could get. It was expected that he would resign his stall at
    Canterbury in favour of his brother's faithful chaplain and
    when he "held on" notwithstanding his peerage and riches, he
    was attacked in the newspapers. The following letter is the
    last communication with which Dr. Scott was honoured, for his
    work was done:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Canterbury, May 28, 1806.</p>

        <p>Sir,&mdash;I am glad to find, by your letter, that you

        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"

    <h2>MISQUOTATIONS.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;The offence of misquoting the poets is
    become so general, that I would suggest to publishers the
    advantage of printing more copious indexes than those which are
    now offered to the public. For the want of these, the
    newspapers sometimes make strange blunders. The <i>Times</i>,
    for instance, has lately, more than once, given the following
    version of a well-known couplet:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Vice is a monster of <i>so frightful</i> mien,</p>

            <p><i>As</i> to be hated needs but to be seen."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The reader's memory will no doubt instantly substitute
    <i>such hideous</i> for "so frightful," and <i>that</i> for
    "as."</p>

    <p>The same paper, a short time since, made sad work with
    Moore, thus:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"You may break, you may ruin the vase if you
            will,</p>

            <p>But the scent of the roses will <i>hang by</i> it
            still."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Moore says nothing about the scents <i>hanging by</i> the
    vase. "Hanging" is an odious term, and destroys the sentiment
    altogether. What Moore really does say is this:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"You may break, you may ruin the vase if you
            will,</p>

            <p>But the scent of the roses will <i>cling round</i>
            it still."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Now the couplet appears in its original beauty.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to speak of the poets without thinking of
    Shakspeare, who towers above them all. We have yet to discover
    an editor capable of doing him full justice. Some of Johnson's
    notes are very amusing, and those of recent editors
    occasionally provoke a smile. If once a blunder has been made
    it is persisted in. Take, for instance, a glaring one in the
    2nd part of Henry IV., where, in the apostrophe to sleep,
    "clouds" is substituted for "shrouds."</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Wilt thou, upon the high and giddy mast,</p>

            <p>Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains</p>

            <p>In cradle of the rude imperious surge,</p>

            <p>And in the visitation of the winds,</p>

            <p>Who take the ruffian billows by the top,</p>

            <p>Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them</p>

            <p>With deafening clamours in the slippery
            <i>clouds</i>,</p>

            <p>That with the hurly death itself awakes?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>That <i>shrouds</i> is the correct word is so obvious, that
    it is surprising any man of common understanding should dispute
    it. Yet we find the following note in Knight's pictorial
    edition:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<i>Clouds</i>.&mdash;Some editors have proposed to read
        <i>shrouds</i>. A line in Julius C&aelig;sar makes
        Shakspere's meaning clear:&mdash;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i8">"'I have seen</p>

            <p>Th' ambitious ocean swell, and rage, and foam,</p>

            <p>To be exalted with the threatening
            <i>clouds</i>.'"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Clouds</i> in this instance is perfectly consistent; but
    here the scene is altogether different. We have no ship-boy
    sleeping on the giddy mast, in the midst of the shrouds, or
    ropes, rendered slippery by the perpetual dashing of the waves
    against them during the storm.</p>

    <p>If in Shakspeare's time the printer's rule of "following
    copy" had been as rigidly observed as in our day, errors would
    have been avoided, for Shakspeare's MS. was sufficiently clear.
    In the preface to the folio edition of 1623, it is stated that
    "his mind and hand went together; and what he thought he
    uttered with that easinesse that wee have scarse received from
    him a blot in his papers."</p>

    <h2>HERBERT AND DIBDIN'S AMES.</h2>

    <h3>BORDE'S BOKE OF KNOWLEDGE&mdash;BOWLAND'S CHOISE OF
    CHANGE&mdash;GREENE'S ROYAL EXCHANGE.</h3>

    <p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;I am induced to mention the following
    misstatement in Herbert's edition of Ames' <i>Typographical
    Antiquities</i>, enlarged by Dibdin, not by its importance, but
    by its supplying an appropriate specimen of the benefits which
    would be conferred on bibliography by your correspondents
    complying with Dr. Maitland's recommendations.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Bindley," says Dibdin, "is in possession of the
    original impression of Borde's <i>Boke of the Introduction of
    Knowledge</i>, which was successively in the collection of West
    and Pearson. This copy, and another in the Chetham Library at
    Manchester, are the only ones known with the following
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>{39}</span> imprint: 'Copland in
       Fletestrete, at the signe of the Rose Garland.' In the
       Selden Collection, in the Bodleian Library, and in the copy
       from which Mr. Upcott published his reprint, we read on the
       recto of the last leaf, 'Imprented at London in Lothbury
       ouer agaynste Sainct Margaryte's Church, by me Wyllyam
       Copland.'"</p>

    <p>The copy in the Chetham Library, now lying before me,
    corresponds with the description of the latter impression.
    Dibdin's mistake perhaps originated in the last page of the
    work preceding Borde, which is bound up with four other works,
    having the following: "Imprinted at London in
    <i>Fleetestrete</i> by Henry Wykes."</p>

    <p>This volume contains&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The Choise of Change: Containing the Triplicitie of
        Diuinitie, Philosophie, and Poetrie, Short for memorie,
        Profitable for Knowledge, and necessary for Maners; whereby
        the learned may be confirmed, the ignorant instructed, and
        all men generally recreated. Newly set forth by S.R., Gent
        and Student in the Universitie of Cambridge. Tria sunt
        omnia. At London, Printed by Roger Warde, dwelling neere
        Holborne Conduite, at the sign of the Talbot, An. Dom.
        1585."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These letters, S.R., are the well known initials of Samuel
    Rowlands, who appears to have been a Welshman, from his love of
    Triads, and from the dedications found in this the rarest of
    his works, and those described by Mr. Collier in his
    <i>Catalogue of the Bridgewater House Collection</i>. In the
    same volume is comprised a tract by Greene, with a copy of
    which Mr. Dyce could never meet, entitled <i>The Royal
    Exchange</i>, printed in 1590.</p>

    <h2>ABDICATION OF JAMES II.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;The recent publication of Macaulay's
    <i>History of England</i>, and the fresh prominence given
    thereby to the occurrences of the Revolution of 1688, have
    induced me, joined to a wish for the success of your
    happily-conceived work, to send you the following "Note." It
    was drawn up by the late Sir Harris Nicolas, and printed in the
    <i>Proceedings</i> of the late Record Commissioners. As,
    however, only fifty copies were printed for the use of the
    Commissioners, and a copy is rarely met with, perhaps this Note
    may have sufficient novelty for insertion. Sir Harris Nicolas,
    as editor of the <i>Proceedings of the Privy Council</i>, would
    doubtless, had that work been continued to 1688, have used the
    MSS. if attainable.</p>

    <p>"Notice of manuscript in the possession of the Rev. Sir
    Thomas Miller, Bart., containing the original Minutes of the
    Assembly of Peers and Privy Councillors that met at Guildhall,
    upon the flight of James II. from London.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Extracts from Memorandum of a MS. in the possession of
        the Rev. Sir Thomas Miller, Bart. shown to Mr. Cooper,
        Secretary to the Record Commissioners, to Sir Harris
        Nicolas, and to Mr. Hardy, in May, 1833, at Sir Thomas
        Miller's lodgings in the Edgeware Road.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"Immediately after the flight of James the Second from
    London, on the 11th of December, 1688, a tumult arose among the
    citizens which created considerable alarm; and with the view of
    preserving the peace, of imparting public confidence, and of
    providing for the extraordinary state of affairs, all the Peers
    and Privy Councillors then in the vicinity of the metropolis
    assembled at Guildhall. Of this important Assembly Bishop
    Burnet's notice is very brief, and it would appear from his
    statement that it was called by the Lord
    Mayor.<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
       A more full account of the Convention
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>{40}</span> is, however, given in the Memoir
       of James the Second published by Dr. Clarke: 'It seems, upon
       the King's withdrawing from London, the lords about town met
       at Guildhall to consult what was fit to be done. They looked
       upon the present state of affairs as an interregnum, that
       the government was in a manner devolved upon them, and were
       in great haste to make a present of it to the Prince of
       Orange.'<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
       Other acts of this Assembly are then mentioned; and its
       proceedings are among the most interesting and important
       events in English history, not only from their forming a
       precedent in a conjuncture of affairs for which no express
       provision is to be found in the constitution, but from the
       first regular offer of the throne to the Prince of Orange
       having emanated from this Convention. No Record of its
       proceedings has, it is presumed, been hitherto known to
       exist; and the fact that so valuable a Document is extant,
       cannot be too generally stated, for it is obvious that it
       has high claims to the attention of historians.</p>

    <p>"Sir Thomas Miller possesses the original Minutes of this
    Assembly of the Peers in the handwriting of a Mr. Glyn, who
    acted as secretary. His appointment to that situation is also
    preserved; and, as it is signed by all the Lords who were
    present, it affords evidence of the names of the Peers who took
    part in the business of the Assembly, and contains a very
    interesting collection of autographs.</p>

    <p>"The MS. itself is a small folio, but not above fifty pages
    are filled. It comprises the period between the 11th and the
    28th December, 1688, both days inclusive, and appears to be a
    perfect Record of every act of that memorable Assembly. The
    indorsement on the cover merits notice: it states with singular
    minuteness the precise hour of James's abdication, namely at
    <i>one in the morning</i> of the 11th of December, 1688."</p>

    <p>Sir Thomas Miller also possessed a manuscript, containing an
    "Account of the Earl of Rochester, Captain Kendall, and the
    Narrator's Journey to Salisbury with King James, Monday, Nov.
    19. to Friday, Nov. 23. 1688, inclusive."</p>

    <p>In connection with this subject, it may be noticed that
    there is no entry of any payment in the <i>Issue Books</i> of
    the clerks of the Pells between Tuesday, 11th December, and
    Monday, 24th December, 1688. J.E.</p>

    inform us where the MSS. in question are now deposited.]</p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I have, from time to time, made a few
    <i>notes</i> on our historical writers&mdash;rather I should
    say the conflicting opinions of critical writers on their
    relative value, and the dependence to be placed on them as
    historical guides. They are so opposite, as would in a great
    measure confirm the opinion of the celebrated statesman above
    quoted. I send, as a specimen, the opinions upon Burnet, and
    should its insertion in your "NOTES AND QUERIES" be deemed
    advisable, I will from time to time send others which I have in

    <h2>QUEEN ELIZABETH'S DOMESTIC ESTABLISHMENT.</h2>

    <p>Your readers may be curious to see a list of the persons
    composing the domestic establishment (as it may be called) of
    Queen Elizabeth in the middle of her reign, and an account of
    the sums of money severally allowed to them out of the privy
    purse of the sovereign. The payments will seem remarkably
    small, even allowing for the great difference in the value of
    money then and now. What that difference may be, I am not
    prepared to say; and I will venture here to put it as a
    "Query," to be answered by some competent person who may read
    this "Note." I have seen it stated by more than one writer,
    that the difference in the value of money at the end of
    Elizabeth's reign was at least five times, i.e. that one pound
    then would go as far as five pounds now; but I am not aware of
    the <i>data</i> upon which the calculation was made. I
    apprehend, besides, that the difference was greater in 1582, to
    which what follows applies, than afterwards, and I should be
    glad to have the matter cleared up. The subsequent account is
    indorsed in the hand-writing of Lord Burghley, Lord Treasurer,
    in these words:&mdash;"1582. The payment of the Ladies of the
    Privy Chamber;" but it applies also to the gentlemen.</p>

    <p>The above 673<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> was the whole
    sum paid out of the privy purse; but it is to be borne in mind
    that these persons were allowed diet and lodging in the Court,
    so that, after all, the payments were not quite as
    insignificant as they may at first seem. Whatever also may have
    been the case with the ladies, it is certain that the gentlemen
    had other sources of emolument derived from the Crown, such as
    monopolies, valuable grants of royal domains, leases of
    customs, &amp;c., which altogether made up an ample income. Sir
    Christopher Hatton, for instance, could not have built Holdenby
    out of his 50<i>l.</i> a year as Gentleman of the Privy
    Chamber.</p>

    <p>A similar entry occurs for the three following years.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>1648. Upon the third of June the following Infants all
        born in the parish of Brenchley were baptized in this
        parish Church, by an order granted from Sir John Sedley,
        Knight and Baronett, Sir John Rayney, and Sir Isaac Sedley,
        Knights:&mdash;</p>

        <p>"Whereas complaints have often been made unto us by many
        of the principal inhabitants of the Parish of Brenchley,
        that they having desired Mr. Gilbert, minister of the said
        Parish, to baptize their children, and according to the
        Directorie offered to present them before the Congregation,
        he hath neglected or refused so to do; whereby divers

    <p>The last extract may illustrate the progress of Anabaptism,

    <h2>PAWNBROKERS' THREE BALLS.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;The Edinburgh Reviewer, cited by your
    correspondent Mr. W.J. Thoms, seems to have sought rather too
    far for the origin of a pawnbroker's golden balls.</p>

    <p>He is right enough in referring their origin to the Italian
    bankers, generally called Lombards; but he has overlooked the
    fact that the greatest of those traders in money were the
    celebrated and eventually princely house of the Medici of
    Florence. They bore pills on their shield, (and those pills, as
    usual then, were gilded,) in allusion to the professional
    origin from whence they had derived the name of Medici; and
    their agents in England and other countries put that armorial
    bearing over their doors as their sign, and the reputation of
    that house induced others to put up the same sign.</p>

    <h2>THE LIONS IN THE TOWER.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;Some one of your readers may be interested
    in knowing that there was a royal menagerie in the Tower of
    London in the reign of Edward III. In the Issue Roll of the
    forty-fourth year of his reign, 1370, there are five entries of

    <h2>NOTES ON AUTHORS AND BOOKS, NO. 1.</h2>

    <h3>THE "BIBLIOGRAPHIE BIOGRAPHIQUE."</h3>

    <p>A lover of literature, and aspiring to promote its extension
    and improvement, I sometimes form projects for the adoption of
    others&mdash;sensible, be it also said, of the extent of my own
    engagements with certain learned societies.</p>

    <p>One of these projects has been a tabular view of the
    literary biography of the British Islands. In the midst of my
    reflections on the plans of Blair, Priestly, Playfair, Oberlin,
    Tytler, Jarry de Mancy, &amp;c. I received a specimen of a
    <i>Bibliographie biographique</i>, by Edouard-Marie Oettinger,
    now in the press at Leipzic.</p>

    <p>As books multiply, the inexpediency of attempting general
    bibliography becomes more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>{43}</span> and more apparent. Meritorious
       as are the works of Brunet and Ebert, and useful as they may
       be to <i>collectors</i>, they are inadequate to the wants of
       <i>men of letters</i>. Henceforth, the bibliographer who
       aims at completeness and accuracy must restrict himself to
       one class of books.</p>

    <p>M. Oettinger appears to have acted on this principle, and
    has been happy in the choice of his subject&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The proper study of mankind is man."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The work is comprehensive in its object, judicious in its
    plan, accurate in its details, as far as the specimen proceeds,
    and an unquestionable desideratum in literature.</p>

    <p>Ainsi, vive M. Edouard-Marie Oettinger! Vive la
    <i>Bibliographie biographique</i>!</p>

    <h3>QUERY AS TO NOTES&mdash;GREENE OF GREEN'S NORTON.</h3>

    <p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;I congratulate you on your happy motto,
    but will you give your readers the results of your own
    experience and practice, and tell them the simplest <i>mode of
    making Notes</i>, and when made, how to arrange <i>them</i> so
    <i>as to find them when required?</i></p>

    <p>I have been in the habit of using slips of paper&mdash;the
    blank turn-overs of old-fashioned letters before note paper
    came into fashion&mdash;and arranging in subjects as well as I
    could; but many a note so made has often caused me a long
    hour's looking after: this ought not so to be; pigeon-holes or
    portfolios, numbered or lettered, seem to be indispensable.</p>

    <p>Has any reader a <i>Note</i> whereby to tell who are the
    present representatives of Greenes of "Green's Norton?" or who
    was "Richard Greene, Apothecary," who was living 1770, and bore
    the arms of that family?</p>

    <p class="author">H.T.E.</p>

    <h3>BUSTS OF CHARLES I. AND JAMES I.&mdash;ANCIENT
    TAPESTRY.</h3>

    <p>1. Where is now the bust of Charles I., formerly in
    Westminster Hall, and engraved by Peter Mazell, for Pennant's
    <i>London</i>, in which engraving the bust is attributed to
    Bernini, though Vertue thought differently? (See Dallaway's
    <i>Walpole</i>, 1826, ii. 109.)</p>

    <p>2. Also, where is the correspondent bust of James I.,
    formerly at Whitehall, of which there is an engraving by N.
    Smith?</p>

    <p>3. What has become of the tapestry of the reign of Henry VI.
    which formerly adorned the Painted Chamber in the ancient
    Palace of Westminster? It appears that it remained in one of
    the lower apartments from the time when it was taken down in
    1800 until the year 1810; that it was then sold to Charles
    Yarnold, Esq., of Great Helen's, Bishopsgate Street, for
    10<i>l.</i> After his death in 1825, in the auction of his
    collection at Southgate's (June 11. that year, lot 238), it was
    sold as "Seven pieces representing the Siege of Troy, for
    7<i>l.</i> to Mr. Matheman." Who was Mr. Matheman? and what has
    now become of his acquisition?</p>

    <p>Another piece of tapestry in Mr. Yarnold's possession, but
    it may be presumed in far better condition, was bought by Mr.
    Teschmaker, his executor, for 63<i>l.</i> This was described as
    "The Plantagenet Tapestry, in fine preservation, containing 23
    full-sized portraits of the different branches of the Houses of
    York and Lancaster: among the most prominent are Margaret of
    Anjou; Cicely, Duchess of York; the Duke of Gloucester,
    afterwards Richard III.; Edward of Lancaster, Henry VI.; Earl
    of March, son of Richard (Duke of York and) afterwards Edward
    IV.; Henry VII.; Clarence [?] Duke of York," &amp;c. This
    description raises one's curiosity greatly, and query, has this
    tapestry been elsewhere described? At the meeting of the
    Arch&aelig;ological Association at Warwick in 1847, it was
    supposed to have come from St. Mary's Hall, Coventry; but that
    idea seems to have arisen merely from its similarity of design
    to the tapestry which is now there.</p>

    <h3>ORIGIN OF EPITHET "FACTOTUM."</h3>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;The following expression in Cavendish's <i>Life
    of Wolsey</i>, p. 42.&mdash;"He was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>{44}</span> Dominus fac totum with the
       king"&mdash;seems to point us to some ecclesiastical origin
       for the derivation of our familiar word "factotum." Does any
       one know the precise whereabouts of such a phrase in the
       Ancient Service books?</p>

    <h3>INSCRIPTION ON ANCIENT ALMS-BASINS.</h3>

    <p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;In the parish church in which I officiate
    are preserved four ancient and curious alms-basins, of latten;
    They appear to be of Flemish workmanship, and, from inventories
    of the church goods, made at different times, we may gather
    that they were given for their present use during the
    seventeenth century. They represent:&mdash;1. The Martyrdom of
    St. Sebastian; 2. The Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin; 3.
    The Temptation in Eden; and 4. The Spies bearing the Grapes.
    Around each of these subjects is a legend in foreign
    characters, "DER. INFRID. GEHWART." I have submitted this
    inscription to antiquaries and German scholars in vain; it
    still remains a puzzle. It has been suggested that it may have
    been only an arbitrary mark of the maker. Is this probable? If
    not, will you, or one of your readers, give the interpretation
    to</p>

    <p class="note">[We have much pleasure in inserting the
    foregoing QUERY, and trust that many of our correspondents will
    follow the example of <i>Clericus</i>, by furnishing us with

    <h2>NOTES OF BOOK SALES&mdash;CATALOGUES, ETC.</h2>

    <p>It is our purpose from time to time to call the attention of
    our book-buying friends to the approaching sales of any
    collections which may seem to us to deserve their attention;
    and to any catalogues which may reach us containing books of
    great rarity and curiosity. Had we entertained no such
    intention we should have shown our respect for the memory of
    that intelligent, obliging, and honourable member of the
    bookselling profession (to whom a literary man rarely addressed
    a QUERY, without receiving in reply a NOTE of information worth
    preserving), the late Mr. Thomas Rodd, by announcing that the

    <p>One of the most curious articles in this catalogue, copies
    of which may be obtained from the London Agent for the sale,
    Mr. Nutt, of the Strand, is No. 1965, a copy of Lilly's <i>Sixe
    Court Comedies</i>, which had belonged to Oliver Cromwell, and
    appears to contain his autograph.</p>

    <p>There are few literary men who have not, in the course of
    some one or other of their inquiries, experienced the
    difficulty there is in procuring copies of pamphlets which
    being for the most part originally published for purposes of
    temporary interest, are rarely preserved by binding, and
    consequently when afterwards wanted become extremely difficult
    of attainment. We all remember the valuable Catalogue published
    many years since by Mr. Rodd, of Newport Street, the father of
    Mr. Thomas Rodd, and have often regretted the loss of our copy
    of that extensive collection; and we record now for the
    information of our readers the publication by Mr. Russell

    <h2>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

    <p><i>The matter is so generally understood with regard to the
    management of periodical works, that it is hardly necessary for
    the Editor to say that</i> HE CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO RETURN
    MANUSCRIPTS; <i>but on one point he wishes to offer a few words
    of explanation to his correspondents in general, and
    particularly to those who do not enable him to communicate with
    them except in print. They will see, on a very little
    reflection, that it is plainly his interest to take all he can
    get, and make the most, and the best, of everything; and
    therefore he begs them to take for granted that their
    communications are received, and appreciated, even if the
    succeeding Number bears no proof of it. He is convinced that
    the want of specific acknowledgment will only be felt by those
    who have no idea of the labour and difficulty attendant on the
    hurried management of such a work, and of the impossibility of
    sometimes giving an explanation, when there really is one which
    would quite satisfy the writer, for the delay or non-insertion
    of his communication. Correspondents in such cases have no
    reason, and if they understood an editor's position they would
    feel that they have no right, to consider themselves
    under-valued; but nothing short of personal experience in
    editorship would explain to them the perplexities and evil
    consequences arising from an opposite course.</i></p>

    <p>PASQUIN <i>will find his suggestion attended to very
    shortly.</i></p>

    <p>THE CHORAL RESPONSES and LITANIES of the UNITED CHURCH of

    <p>The present Work contains a full collection of the
    harmonized compositions of ancient date, including nine sets of
    pieces and responses, and fifteen litanies, with a few of the
    more ancient Psalm Chants. They are given in full score, and in
    their proper cliffs. In the upper part, however, the treble is
    substituted for the "cantus" or "medius" cliff: and the whole
    work is so arranged as to suit the library of the musical

        <p>"This is a very able book; well arranged in its plan,
        and complete in its matter. To those who are interested in
        the controversy, or even to any readers of Junius who wish
        for further information than the common editions furnish,
        we strongly recommend this volume. They will find it full,
        without being overcharged; and it possesses an advantage
        even over Woodfall's edition, in only containing what is
        essential to the point, besides exhibiting much which does
        not appear in that elaborate publication. The 'History of
        Junius and his Works' is an essential companion to the
        'Letters of Junius.'"&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>, March 4.

        <p>"Since Stuart's 'Anecdotes of the Steam Engine,' there
        has been no such bit of delicious mechanical gossip as this
        little book of Mr. Bernan.... For six months or more every
        year, we must depend much more on the resources of science
        and the practical arts for our health and comfort, than on
        the natural climate: in short, we must create our own
        climate. To help us to the means of doing this appears to
        be one of the objects of these little volumes, in which, as
        we have shown, are collected a multitude of expedients of
        all times and nations, collected with research, selected
        with judgment, and skilfully arranged and described. The
        interest with which one reads is sustained and continuous,
        and you devour a two-volume inventory of stoves, grates,
        and ovens, with the voracity of a parish school-boy, and
        then&mdash;ask for more."&mdash;<i>The
        Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>

        <p>After mentioning the excesses committed by the mob, and
        the arrest of Judge Jefferies, Bishop Burnet says: "The
        Lord Mayor was so struck with the terror of this rude
        populace, and with the disgrace of a man who had made all
        people tremble before him, that he fell into fits upon it,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
