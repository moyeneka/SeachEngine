<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>A SMILE
OF FORTUNE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HARBOUR STORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ever</span> since the sun rose I had been
looking ahead.&nbsp; The ship glided gently in smooth
water.&nbsp; After a sixty days&rsquo; passage I was anxious to
make my landfall, a fertile and beautiful island of the
tropics.&nbsp; The more enthusiastic of its inhabitants delight
in describing it as the &ldquo;Pearl of the Ocean.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, let us call it the &ldquo;Pearl.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
good name.&nbsp; A pearl distilling much sweetness upon the
world.</p>
<p>This is only a way of telling you that first-rate sugar-cane
is grown there.&nbsp; All the population of the Pearl lives for
it and by it.&nbsp; Sugar is their daily bread, as it were.&nbsp;
And I was coming to them for a cargo of sugar in the hope of the
crop having been good and of the freights being high.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, my chief mate, made out the land first; and very
soon I became entranced by this blue, pinnacled apparition,
almost transparent against the light of the sky, a mere
emanation, the astral body of an island risen to greet me from
afar.&nbsp; It is a rare phenomenon, such a sight of the Pearl at
sixty miles off.&nbsp; And I wondered half seriously whether it
was a good omen, whether what would meet me in that island would
be as luckily exceptional as this beautiful, dreamlike vision so
very few seamen have been privileged to behold.</p>
<p>But horrid thoughts of business interfered with my enjoyment
of an accomplished passage.&nbsp; I was anxious for success and I
wished, too, to do justice to the flattering latitude of my
owners&rsquo; instructions contained in one noble phrase:
&ldquo;We leave it to you to do the best you can with the
ship.&rdquo; . . . All the world being thus given me for a stage,
my abilities appeared to me no bigger than a pinhead.</p>
<p>Meantime the wind dropped, and Mr. Burns began to make
disagreeable remarks about my usual bad luck.&nbsp; I believe it
was his devotion for me which made him critically outspoken on
every occasion.&nbsp; All the same, I would not have put up with
his humours if it had not been my lot at one time to nurse him
through a desperate illness at sea.&nbsp; After snatching him out
of the jaws of death, so to speak, it would have been absurd to
throw away such an efficient officer.&nbsp; But sometimes I
wished he would dismiss himself.</p>
<p>We were late in closing in with the land, and had to anchor
outside the harbour till next day.&nbsp; An unpleasant and
unrestful night followed.&nbsp; In this roadstead, strange to us
both, Burns and I remained on deck almost all the time.&nbsp;
Clouds swirled down the porphyry crags under which we lay.&nbsp;
The rising wind made a great bullying noise amongst the naked
spars, with interludes of sad moaning.&nbsp; I remarked that we
had been in luck to fetch the anchorage before dark.&nbsp; It
would have been a nasty, anxious night to hang off a harbour
under canvas.&nbsp; But my chief mate was uncompromising in his
attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luck, you call it, sir!&nbsp; Ay&mdash;our usual
luck.&nbsp; The sort of luck to thank God it&rsquo;s no
worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he fretted through the dark hours, while I drew on my
fund of philosophy.&nbsp; Ah, but it was an exasperating, weary,
endless night, to be lying at anchor close under that black
coast!&nbsp; The agitated water made snarling sounds all round
the ship.&nbsp; At times a wild gust of wind out of a gully high
up on the cliffs struck on our rigging a harsh and plaintive note
like the wail of a forsaken soul.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>By half-past seven in the morning, the ship being then inside
the harbour at last and moored within a long stone&rsquo;s-throw
from the quay, my stock of philosophy was nearly exhausted.&nbsp;
I was dressing hurriedly in my cabin when the steward came
tripping in with a morning suit over his arm.</p>
<p>Hungry, tired, and depressed, with my head engaged inside a
white shirt irritatingly stuck together by too much starch, I
desired him peevishly to &ldquo;heave round with that
breakfast.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wanted to get ashore as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; Ready at eight, sir.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a gentleman from the shore waiting to speak to you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement was curiously slurred over.&nbsp; I dragged the
shirt violently over my head and emerged staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So early!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
he?&nbsp; What does he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On coming in from sea one has to pick up the conditions of an
utterly unrelated existence.&nbsp; Every little event at first
has the peculiar emphasis of novelty.&nbsp; I was greatly
surprised by that early caller; but there was no reason for my
steward to look so particularly foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ask for the name?&rdquo; I inquired in
a stern tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Jacobus, I believe,&rdquo; he mumbled
shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jacobus!&rdquo; I exclaimed loudly, more surprised
than ever, but with a total change of feeling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
couldn&rsquo;t you say so at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fellow had scuttled out of my room.&nbsp; Through the
momentarily opened door I had a glimpse of a tall, stout man
standing in the cuddy by the table on which the cloth was already
laid; a &ldquo;harbour&rdquo; table-cloth, stainless and
dazzlingly white.&nbsp; So far good.</p>
<p>I shouted courteously through the closed door, that I was
dressing and would be with him in a moment.&nbsp; In return the
assurance that there was no hurry reached me in the
visitor&rsquo;s deep, quiet undertone.&nbsp; His time was my
own.&nbsp; He dared say I would give him a cup of coffee
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you will have a poor breakfast,&rdquo; I
cried apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have been sixty-one days at
sea, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quiet little laugh, with a &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all
right, Captain,&rdquo; was his answer.&nbsp; All this, words,
intonation, the glimpsed attitude of the man in the cuddy, had an
unexpected character, a something friendly in
it&mdash;propitiatory.&nbsp; And my surprise was not diminished
thereby.&nbsp; What did this call mean?&nbsp; Was it the sign of
some dark design against my commercial innocence?</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; These commercial interests&mdash;spoiling the finest
life under the sun.&nbsp; Why must the sea be used for
trade&mdash;and for war as well?&nbsp; Why kill and traffic on
it, pursuing selfish aims of no great importance after all?&nbsp;
It would have been so much nicer just to sail about with here and
there a port and a bit of land to stretch one&rsquo;s legs on,
buy a few books and get a change of cooking for a while.&nbsp;
But, living in a world more or less homicidal and desperately
mercantile, it was plainly my duty to make the best of its
opportunities.</p>
<p>My owners&rsquo; letter had left it to me, as I have said
before, to do my best for the ship, according to my own
judgment.&nbsp; But it contained also a postscript worded
somewhat as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without meaning to interfere with your liberty of
action we are writing by the outgoing mail to some of our
business friends there who may be of assistance to you.&nbsp; We
desire you particularly to call on Mr. Jacobus, a prominent
merchant and charterer.&nbsp; Should you hit it off with him he
may be able to put you in the way of profitable employment for
the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hit it off!&nbsp; Here was the prominent creature absolutely
on board asking for the favour of a cup of coffee!&nbsp; And life
not being a fairy-tale the improbability of the event almost
shocked me.&nbsp; Had I discovered an enchanted nook of the earth
where wealthy merchants rush fasting on board ships before they
are fairly moored?&nbsp; Was this white magic or merely some
black trick of trade?&nbsp; I came in the end (while making the
bow of my tie) to suspect that perhaps I did not get the name
right.&nbsp; I had been thinking of the prominent Mr. Jacobus
pretty frequently during the passage and my hearing might have
been deceived by some remote similarity of sound. . .&nbsp; The
steward might have said Antrobus&mdash;or maybe Jackson.</p>
<p>But coming out of my stateroom with an interrogative
&ldquo;Mr. Jacobus?&rdquo; I was met by a quiet
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; uttered with a gentle smile.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; was rather perfunctory.&nbsp; He did not seem
to make much of the fact that he was Mr. Jacobus.&nbsp; I took
stock of a big, pale face, hair thin on the top, whiskers also
thin, of a faded nondescript colour, heavy eyelids.&nbsp; The
thick, smooth lips in repose looked as if glued together.&nbsp;
The smile was faint.&nbsp; A heavy, tranquil man.&nbsp; I named
my two officers, who just then came down to breakfast; but why
Mr. Burns&rsquo;s silent demeanour should suggest suppressed
indignation I could not understand.</p>
<p>While we were taking our seats round the table some
disconnected words of an altercation going on in the companionway
reached my ear.&nbsp; A stranger apparently wanted to come down
to interview me, and the steward was opposing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Captain is at breakfast, I tell you.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be going on shore presently, and you can speak to him
on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair.&nbsp; You let&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had nothing to do with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you have.&nbsp; Everybody ought to have the
same chance.&nbsp; You let that fellow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest I lost.&nbsp; The person having been repulsed
successfully, the steward came down.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say he
looked flushed&mdash;he was a mulatto&mdash;but he looked
flustered.&nbsp; After putting the dishes on the table he
remained by the sideboard with that lackadaisical air of
indifference he used to assume when he had done something too
clever by half and was afraid of getting into a scrape over
it.&nbsp; The contemptuous expression of Mr. Burns&rsquo;s face
as he looked from him to me was really extraordinary.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t imagine what new bee had stung the mate now.</p>
<p>The Captain being silent, nobody else cared to speak, as is
the way in ships.&nbsp; And I was saying nothing simply because I
had been made dumb by the splendour of the entertainment.&nbsp; I
had expected the usual sea-breakfast, whereas I beheld spread
before us a veritable feast of shore provisions: eggs, sausages,
butter which plainly did not come from a Danish tin, cutlets, and
even a dish of potatoes.&nbsp; It was three weeks since I had
seen a real, live potato.&nbsp; I contemplated them with
interest, and Mr. Jacobus disclosed himself as a man of human,
homely sympathies, and something of a thought-reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try them, Captain,&rdquo; he encouraged me in a
friendly undertone.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look that,&rdquo; I admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grown
on the island, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, imported.&nbsp; Those grown here would be more
expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was grieved at the ineptitude of the conversation.&nbsp;
Were these the topics for a prominent and wealthy merchant to
discuss?&nbsp; I thought the simplicity with which he made
himself at home rather attractive; but what is one to talk about
to a man who comes on one suddenly, after sixty-one days at sea,
out of a totally unknown little town in an island one has never
seen before?&nbsp; What were (besides sugar) the interests of
that crumb of the earth, its gossip, its topics of
conversation?&nbsp; To draw him on business at once would have
been almost indecent&mdash;or even worse: impolitic.&nbsp; All I
could do at the moment was to keep on in the old groove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the provisions generally dear here?&rdquo; I asked,
fretting inwardly at my inanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; he answered placidly,
with that appearance of saving his breath his restrained manner
of speaking suggested.</p>
<p>He would not be more explicit, yet he did not evade the
subject.&nbsp; Eyeing the table in a spirit of complete
abstemiousness (he wouldn&rsquo;t let me help him to any
eatables) he went into details of supply.&nbsp; The beef was for
the most part imported from Madagascar; mutton of course was rare
and somewhat expensive, but good goat&rsquo;s flesh&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are these goat&rsquo;s cutlets?&rdquo; I exclaimed
hastily, pointing at one of the dishes.</p>
<p>Posed sentimentally by the sideboard, the steward gave a
start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, no, sir!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s real
mutton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burns got through his breakfast impatiently, as if
exasperated by being made a party to some monstrous foolishness,
muttered a curt excuse, and went on deck.&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards the second mate took his smooth red countenance out of
the cabin.&nbsp; With the appetite of a schoolboy, and after two
months of sea-fare, he appreciated the generous spread.&nbsp; But
I did not.&nbsp; It smacked of extravagance.&nbsp; All the same,
it was a remarkable feat to have produced it so quickly, and I
congratulated the steward on his smartness in a somewhat ominous
tone.&nbsp; He gave me a deprecatory smile and, in a way I
didn&rsquo;t know what to make of, blinked his fine dark eyes in
the direction of the guest.</p>
<p>The latter asked under his breath for another cup of coffee,
and nibbled ascetically at a piece of very hard ship&rsquo;s
biscuit.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he consumed a square inch in
the end; but meantime he gave me, casually as it were, a complete
account of the sugar crop, of the local business houses, of the
state of the freight market.&nbsp; All that talk was interspersed
with hints as to personalities, amounting to veiled warnings, but
his pale, fleshy face remained equable, without a gleam, as if
ignorant of his voice.&nbsp; As you may imagine I opened my ears
very wide.&nbsp; Every word was precious.&nbsp; My ideas as to
the value of business friendship were being favourably
modified.&nbsp; He gave me the names of all the disponible ships
together with their tonnage and the names of their
commanders.&nbsp; From that, which was still commercial
information, he condescended to mere harbour gossip.&nbsp; The
<i>Hilda</i> had unaccountably lost her figurehead in the Bay of
Bengal, and her captain was greatly affected by this.&nbsp; He
and the ship had been getting on in years together and the old
gentleman imagined this strange event to be the forerunner of his
own early dissolution.&nbsp; The <i>Stella</i> had experienced
awful weather off the Cape&mdash;had her decks swept, and the
chief officer washed overboard.&nbsp; And only a few hours before
reaching port the baby died.</p>
<p>Poor Captain H&mdash; and his wife were terribly cut up.&nbsp;
If they had only been able to bring it into port alive it could
have been probably saved; but the wind failed them for the last
week or so, light breezes, and . . . the baby was going to be
buried this afternoon.&nbsp; He supposed I would
attend&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I ought to?&rdquo; I asked,
shrinkingly.</p>
<p>He thought so, decidedly.&nbsp; It would be greatly
appreciated.&nbsp; All the captains in the harbour were going to
attend.&nbsp; Poor Mrs. H&mdash; was quite prostrated.&nbsp;
Pretty hard on H&mdash; altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Captain&mdash;you are not married I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not married,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Neither married nor even engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mentally I thanked my stars; and while he smiled in a musing,
dreamy fashion, I expressed my acknowledgments for his visit and
for the interesting business information he had been good enough
to impart to me.&nbsp; But I said nothing of my wonder
thereat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I would have made a point of calling on you
in a day or two,&rdquo; I concluded.</p>
<p>He raised his eyelids distinctly at me, and somehow managed to
look rather more sleepy than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In accordance with my owners&rsquo;
instructions,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have had their
letter, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By that time he had raised his eyebrows too but without any
particular emotion.&nbsp; On the contrary he struck me then as
absolutely imperturbable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; You must be thinking of my
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was for me, then, to say &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; But I hope
that no more than civil surprise appeared in my voice when I
asked him to what, then, I owed the pleasure. . . . He was
reaching for an inside pocket leisurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s a very different person.&nbsp; But I
am well known in this part of the world.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
probably heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took a card he extended to me.&nbsp; A thick business card,
as I lived!&nbsp; Alfred Jacobus&mdash;the other was
Ernest&mdash;dealer in every description of ship&rsquo;s
stores!&nbsp; Provisions salt and fresh, oils, paints, rope,
canvas, etc., etc.&nbsp; Ships in harbour victualled by contract
on moderate terms&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of you,&rdquo; I said
brusquely.</p>
<p>His low-pitched assurance did not abandon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be very well satisfied,&rdquo; he breathed out
quietly.</p>
<p>I was not placated.&nbsp; I had the sense of having been
circumvented somehow.&nbsp; Yet I had deceived myself&mdash;if
there was any deception.&nbsp; But the confounded cheek of
inviting himself to breakfast was enough to deceive any
one.&nbsp; And the thought struck me: Why!&nbsp; The fellow had
provided all these eatables himself in the way of business.&nbsp;
I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have got up mighty early this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He admitted with simplicity that he was on the quay before six
o&rsquo;clock waiting for my ship to come in.&nbsp; He gave me
the impression that it would be impossible to get rid of him
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think we are going to live on that scale,&rdquo;
I said, looking at the table with an irritated eye, &ldquo;you
are jolly well mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it all right, Captain.&nbsp; I quite
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could disturb his equanimity.&nbsp; I felt
dissatisfied, but I could not very well fly out at him.&nbsp; He
had told me many useful things&mdash;and besides he was the
brother of that wealthy merchant.&nbsp; That seemed queer
enough.</p>
<p>I rose and told him curtly that I must now go ashore.&nbsp; At
once he offered the use of his boat for all the time of my stay
in port.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only make a nominal charge,&rdquo; he continued
equably.&nbsp; &ldquo;My man remains all day at the
landing-steps.&nbsp; You have only to blow a whistle when you
want the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, standing aside at every doorway to let me go through
first, he carried me off in his custody after all.&nbsp; As we
crossed the quarter-deck two shabby individuals stepped forward
and in mournful silence offered me business cards which I took
from them without a word under his heavy eye.&nbsp; It was a
useless and gloomy ceremony.&nbsp; They were the touts of the
other ship-chandlers, and he placid at my back, ignored their
existence.</p>
<p>We parted on the quay, after he had expressed quietly the hope
of seeing me often &ldquo;at the store.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a
smoking-room for captains there, with newspapers and a box of
&ldquo;rather decent cigars.&rdquo;&nbsp; I left him very
unceremoniously.</p>
<p>My consignees received me with the usual business heartiness,
but their account of the state of the freight-market was by no
means so favourable as the talk of the wrong Jacobus had led me
to expect.&nbsp; Naturally I became inclined now to put my trust
in his version, rather.&nbsp; As I closed the door of the private
office behind me I thought to myself: &ldquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; A
lot of lies.&nbsp; Commercial diplomacy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
sort of thing a man coming from sea has got to expect.&nbsp; They
would try to charter the ship under the market rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the big, outer room, full of desks, the chief clerk, a
tall, lean, shaved person in immaculate white clothes and with a
shiny, closely-cropped black head on which silvery gleams came
and went, rose from his place and detained me affably.&nbsp;
Anything they could do for me, they would be most happy.&nbsp;
Was I likely to call again in the afternoon?&nbsp; What?&nbsp;
Going to a funeral?&nbsp; Oh, yes, poor Captain H&mdash;.</p>
<p>He pulled a long, sympathetic face for a moment, then,
dismissing from this workaday world the baby, which had got ill
in a tempest and had died from too much calm at sea, he asked me
with a dental, shark-like smile&mdash;if sharks had false
teeth&mdash;whether I had yet made my little arrangements for the
ship&rsquo;s stay in port.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with Jacobus,&rdquo; I answered carelessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I understand he&rsquo;s the brother of Mr. Ernest Jacobus
to whom I have an introduction from my owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not sorry to let him know I was not altogether helpless
in the hands of his firm.&nbsp; He screwed his thin lips
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t he the
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. . . . They haven&rsquo;t spoken to each other
for eighteen years,&rdquo; he added impressively after a
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the quarrel
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing!&nbsp; Nothing that one would care to
mention,&rdquo; he protested primly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got
quite a large business.&nbsp; The best ship-chandler here,
without a doubt.&nbsp; Business is all very well, but there is
such a thing as personal character, too, isn&rsquo;t there?&nbsp;
Good-morning, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went away mincingly to his desk.&nbsp; He amused me.&nbsp;
He resembled an old maid, a commercial old maid, shocked by some
impropriety.&nbsp; Was it a commercial impropriety?&nbsp;
Commercial impropriety is a serious matter, for it aims at
one&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp; Or was he only a purist in conduct who
disapproved of Jacobus doing his own touting?&nbsp; It was
certainly undignified.&nbsp; I wondered how the merchant brother
liked it.&nbsp; But then different countries, different
customs.&nbsp; In a community so isolated and so exclusively
&ldquo;trading&rdquo; social standards have their own scale.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">would</span> have gladly dispensed with
the mournful opportunity of becoming acquainted by sight with all
my fellow-captains at once.&nbsp; However I found my way to the
cemetery.&nbsp; We made a considerable group of bareheaded men in
sombre garments.&nbsp; I noticed that those of our company most
approaching to the now obsolete sea-dog type were the most
moved&mdash;perhaps because they had less &ldquo;manner&rdquo;
than the new generation.&nbsp; The old sea-dog, away from his
natural element, was a simple and sentimental animal.&nbsp; I
noticed one&mdash;he was facing me across the grave&mdash;who was
dropping tears.&nbsp; They trickled down his weather-beaten face
like drops of rain on an old rugged wall.&nbsp; I learned
afterwards that he was looked upon as the terror of sailors, a
hard man; that he had never had wife or chick of his own, and
that, engaged from his tenderest years in deep-sea voyages, he
knew women and children merely by sight.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was dropping those tears over his lost
opportunities, from sheer envy of paternity and in strange
jealousy of a sorrow which he could never know.&nbsp; Man, and
even the sea-man, is a capricious animal, the creature and the
victim of lost opportunities.&nbsp; But he made me feel ashamed
of my callousness.&nbsp; I had no tears.</p>
<p>I listened with horribly critical detachment to that service I
had had to read myself, once or twice, over childlike men who had
died at sea.&nbsp; The words of hope and defiance, the winged
words so inspiring in the free immensity of water and sky, seemed
to fall wearily into the little grave.&nbsp; What was the use of
asking Death where her sting was, before that small, dark hole in
the ground?&nbsp; And then my thoughts escaped me
altogether&mdash;away into matters of life&mdash;and no very high
matters at that&mdash;ships, freights, business.&nbsp; In the
instability of his emotions man resembles deplorably a
monkey.&nbsp; I was disgusted with my thoughts&mdash;and I
thought: Shall I be able to get a charter soon?&nbsp;
Time&rsquo;s money. . . . Will that Jacobus really put good
business in my way?&nbsp; I must go and see him in a day or
two.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t imagine that I pursued these thoughts with any
precision.&nbsp; They pursued me rather: vague, shadowy,
restless, shamefaced.&nbsp; Theirs was a callous, abominable,
almost revolting, pertinacity.&nbsp; And it was the presence of
that pertinacious ship-chandler which had started them.&nbsp; He
stood mournfully amongst our little band of men from the sea, and
I was angry at his presence, which, suggesting his brother the
merchant, had caused me to become outrageous to myself.&nbsp; For
indeed I had preserved some decency of feeling.&nbsp; It was only
the mind which&mdash;</p>
<p>It was over at last.&nbsp; The poor father&mdash;a man of
forty with black, bushy side-whiskers and a pathetic gash on his
freshly-shaved chin&mdash;thanked us all, swallowing his
tears.&nbsp; But for some reason, either because I lingered at
the gate of the cemetery being somewhat hazy as to my way back,
or because I was the youngest, or ascribing my moodiness caused
by remorse to some more worthy and appropriate sentiment, or
simply because I was even more of a stranger to him than the
others&mdash;he singled me out.&nbsp; Keeping at my side, he
renewed his thanks, which I listened to in a gloomy,
conscience-stricken silence.&nbsp; Suddenly he slipped one hand
under my arm and waved the other after a tall, stout figure
walking away by itself down a street in a flutter of thin, grey
garments:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good fellow&mdash;a real good
fellow&rdquo;&mdash;he swallowed down a belated
sob&mdash;&ldquo;this Jacobus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he told me in a low voice that Jacobus was the first man
to board his ship on arrival, and, learning of their misfortune,
had taken charge of everything, volunteered to attend to all
routine business, carried off the ship&rsquo;s papers on shore,
arranged for the funeral&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good fellow.&nbsp; I was knocked over.&nbsp; I had
been looking at my wife for ten days.&nbsp; And helpless.&nbsp;
Just you think of that!&nbsp; The dear little chap died the very
day we made the land.&nbsp; How I managed to take the ship in God
alone knows!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t see anything; I
couldn&rsquo;t speak; I couldn&rsquo;t. . . . You&rsquo;ve heard,
perhaps, that we lost our mate overboard on the passage?&nbsp;
There was no one to do it for me.&nbsp; And the poor woman nearly
crazy down below there all alone with the . . . By the
Lord!&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We walked in silence together.&nbsp; I did not know how to
part from him.&nbsp; On the quay he let go my arm and struck
fiercely his fist into the palm of his other hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, it isn&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo; he cried
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever marry unless you can
chuck the sea first. . . . It isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no intention to &ldquo;chuck the sea,&rdquo; and when he
left me to go aboard his ship I felt convinced that I would never
marry.&nbsp; While I was waiting at the steps for Jacobus&rsquo;s
boatman, who had gone off somewhere, the captain of the
<i>Hilda</i> joined me, a slender silk umbrella in his hand and
the sharp points of his archaic, Gladstonian shirt-collar framing
a small, clean-shaved, ruddy face.&nbsp; It was wonderfully fresh
for his age, beautifully modelled and lit up by remarkably clear
blue eyes.&nbsp; A lot of white hair, glossy like spun glass,
curled upwards slightly under the brim of his valuable, ancient,
panama hat with a broad black ribbon.&nbsp; In the aspect of that
vivacious, neat, little old man there was something quaintly
angelic and also boyish.</p>
<p>He accosted me, as though he had been in the habit of seeing
me every day of his life from my earliest childhood, with a
whimsical remark on the appearance of a stout negro woman who was
sitting upon a stool near the edge of the quay.&nbsp; Presently
he observed amiably that I had a very pretty little barque.</p>
<p>I returned this civil speech by saying readily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so pretty as the <i>Hilda</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the corners of his clear-cut, sensitive mouth dropped
dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&nbsp; I can hardly bear to look at her
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did I know, he asked anxiously, that he had lost the
figurehead of his ship; a woman in a blue tunic edged with gold,
the face perhaps not so very, very pretty, but her bare white
arms beautifully shaped and extended as if she were
swimming?&nbsp; Did I?&nbsp; Who would have expected such a
things . . . After twenty years too!</p>
<p>Nobody could have guessed from his tone that the woman was
made of wood; his trembling voice, his agitated manner gave to
his lamentations a ludicrously scandalous flavour. . . .
Disappeared at night&mdash;a clear fine night with just a slight
swell&mdash;in the gulf of Bengal.&nbsp; Went off without a
splash; no one in the ship could tell why, how, at what
hour&mdash;after twenty years last October. . . . Did I ever
hear! . . .</p>
<p>I assured him sympathetically that I had never heard&mdash;and
he became very doleful.&nbsp; This meant no good he was
sure.&nbsp; There was something in it which looked like a
warning.&nbsp; But when I remarked that surely another figure of
a woman could be procured I found myself being soundly rated for
my levity.&nbsp; The old boy flushed pink under his clear tan as
if I had proposed something improper.&nbsp; One could replace
masts, I was told, or a lost rudder&mdash;any working part of a
ship; but where was the use of sticking up a new
figurehead?&nbsp; What satisfaction?&nbsp; How could one care for
it?&nbsp; It was easy to see that I had never been shipmates with
a figurehead for over twenty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new figurehead!&rdquo; he scolded in unquenchable
indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a widower
now for eight-and-twenty years come next May and I would just as
soon think of getting a new wife.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re as bad as
that fellow Jacobus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was highly amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has Jacobus done?&nbsp; Did he want you to marry
again, Captain?&rdquo; I inquired in a deferential tone.&nbsp;
But he was launched now and only grinned fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Procure&mdash;indeed!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the sort of chap
to procure you anything you like for a price.&nbsp; I
hadn&rsquo;t been moored here for an hour when he got on board
and at once offered to sell me a figurehead he happens to have in
his yard somewhere.&nbsp; He got Smith, my mate, to talk to me
about it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Smith,&rsquo; says I,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t you know me better than that?&nbsp; Am I the
sort that would pick up with another man&rsquo;s cast-off
figurehead?&rsquo;&nbsp; And after all these years too!&nbsp; The
way some of you young fellows talk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I affected great compunction, and as I stepped into the boat I
said soberly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I see nothing for it but to fit in a neat
fiddlehead&mdash;perhaps.&nbsp; You know, carved scrollwork,
nicely gilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He became very dejected after his outburst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Scrollwork.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; Jacobus
hinted at that too.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s never at a loss when
there&rsquo;s any money to be extracted from a sailorman.&nbsp;
He would make me pay through the nose for that carving.&nbsp; A
gilt fiddlehead did you say&mdash;eh?&nbsp; I dare say it would
do for you.&nbsp; You young fellows don&rsquo;t seem to have any
feeling for what&rsquo;s proper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a convulsive gesture with his right arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind.&nbsp; Nothing can make much
difference.&nbsp; I would just as soon let the old thing go about
the world with a bare cutwater,&rdquo; he cried sadly.&nbsp; Then
as the boat got away from the steps he raised his voice on the
edge of the quay with comical animosity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would!&nbsp; If only to spite that
figurehead-procuring bloodsucker.&nbsp; I am an old bird here and
don&rsquo;t you forget it.&nbsp; Come and see me on board some
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spent my first evening in port quietly in my ship&rsquo;s
cuddy; and glad enough was I to think that the shore life which
strikes one as so pettily complex, discordant, and so full of new
faces on first coming from sea, could be kept off for a few hours
longer.&nbsp; I was however fated to hear the Jacobus note once
more before I slept.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns had gone ashore after the evening meal to have, as
he said, &ldquo;a look round.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it was quite dark
when he announced his intention I didn&rsquo;t ask him what it
was he expected to see.&nbsp; Some time about midnight, while
sitting with a book in the saloon, I heard cautious movements in
the lobby and hailed him by name.</p>
<p>Burns came in, stick and hat in hand, incredibly vulgarised by
his smart shore togs, with a jaunty air and an odious twinkle in
his eye.&nbsp; Being asked to sit down he laid his hat and stick
on the table and after we had talked of ship affairs for a little
while:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearing pretty tales on shore about
that ship-chandler fellow who snatched the job from you so
neatly, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remonstrated with my late patient for his manner of
expressing himself.&nbsp; But he only tossed his head
disdainfully.&nbsp; A pretty dodge indeed: boarding a strange
ship with breakfast in two baskets for all hands and calmly
inviting himself to the captain&rsquo;s table!&nbsp; Never heard
of anything so crafty and so impudent in his life.</p>
<p>I found myself defending Jacobus&rsquo;s unusual methods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the brother of one of the wealthiest
merchants in the port.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mate&rsquo;s eyes fairly
snapped green sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His grand brother hasn&rsquo;t spoken to him for
eighteen or twenty years,&rdquo; he declared triumphantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about that,&rdquo; I interrupted
loftily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you sir?&nbsp; H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;&nbsp; His mind was
still running on the ethics of commercial competition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see your good nature taken advantage
of.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s bribed that steward of ours with a
five-rupee note to let him come down&mdash;or ten for that
matter.&nbsp; He don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; He will shove that and
more into the bill presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that one of the tales you have heard ashore?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>He assured me that his own sense could tell him that
much.&nbsp; No; what he had heard on shore was that no
respectable person in the whole town would come near
Jacobus.&nbsp; He lived in a large old-fashioned house in one of
the quiet streets with a big garden.&nbsp; After telling me this
Burns put on a mysterious air.&nbsp; &ldquo;He keeps a girl shut
up there who, they say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve heard all this gossip in some
eminently respectable place?&rdquo; I snapped at him in a most
sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>The shaft told, because Mr. Burns, like many other
disagreeable people, was very sensitive himself.&nbsp; He
remained as if thunderstruck, with his mouth open for some
further communication, but I did not give him the chance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, anyhow, what the deuce do I care?&rdquo; I added,
retiring into my room.</p>
<p>And this was a natural thing to say.&nbsp; Yet somehow I was
not indifferent.&nbsp; I admit it is absurd to be concerned with
the morals of one&rsquo;s ship-chandler, if ever so well
connected; but his personality had stamped itself upon my first
day in harbour, in the way you know.</p>
<p>After this initial exploit Jacobus showed himself anything but
intrusive.&nbsp; He was out in a boat early every morning going
round the ships he served, and occasionally remaining on board
one of them for breakfast with the captain.</p>
<p>As I discovered that this practice was generally accepted, I
just nodded to him familiarly when one morning, on coming out of
my room, I found him in the cabin.&nbsp; Glancing over the table
I saw that his place was already laid.&nbsp; He stood awaiting my
appearance, very bulky and placid, holding a beautiful bunch of
flowers in his thick hand.&nbsp; He offered them to my notice
with a faint, sleepy smile.&nbsp; From his own garden; had a very
fine old garden; picked them himself that morning before going
out to business; thought I would like. . . . He turned
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Steward, can you oblige me with some water in
a large jar, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him jocularly, as I took my place at the table, that
he made me feel as if I were a pretty girl, and that he
mustn&rsquo;t be surprised if I blushed.&nbsp; But he was busy
arranging his floral tribute at the sideboard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stand
it before the Captain&rsquo;s plate, steward,
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made this request in his usual
undertone.</p>
<p>The offering was so pointed that I could do no less than to
raise it to my nose, and as he sat down noiselessly he breathed
out the opinion that a few flowers improved notably the
appearance of a ship&rsquo;s saloon.&nbsp; He wondered why I did
not have a shelf fitted all round the skylight for flowers in
pots to take with me to sea.&nbsp; He had a skilled workman able
to fit up shelves in a day, and he could procure me two or three
dozen good plants&mdash;</p>
<p>The tips of his thick, round fingers rested composedly on the
edge of the table on each side of his cup of coffee.&nbsp; His
face remained immovable.&nbsp; Mr. Burns was smiling maliciously
to himself.&nbsp; I declared that I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest
intention of turning my skylight into a conservatory only to keep
the cabin-table in a perpetual mess of mould and dead vegetable
matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rear most beautiful flowers,&rdquo; he insisted with an
upward glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble
really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it is.&nbsp; Lots of trouble,&rdquo; I
contradicted.&nbsp; &ldquo;And in the end some fool leaves the
skylight open in a fresh breeze, a flick of salt water gets at
them and the whole lot is dead in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burns snorted a contemptuous approval.&nbsp; Jacobus gave
up the subject passively.&nbsp; After a time he unglued his thick
lips to ask me if I had seen his brother yet.&nbsp; I was very
curt in my answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very different person,&rdquo; he remarked dreamily
and got up.&nbsp; His movements were particularly
noiseless.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well&mdash;thank you, Captain.&nbsp; If
anything is not to your liking please mention it to your
steward.&nbsp; I suppose you will be giving a dinner to the
office-clerks presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; I cried with some warmth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I were a steady trader to the port I could understand
it.&nbsp; But a complete stranger! . . . I may not turn up again
here for years.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why! . . . Do you mean to
say it is customary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be expected from a man like you,&rdquo; he
breathed out placidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eight of the principal
clerks, the manager, that&rsquo;s nine, you three gentlemen,
that&rsquo;s twelve.&nbsp; It needn&rsquo;t be very
expensive.&nbsp; If you tell your steward to give me a
day&rsquo;s notice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be expected of me!&nbsp; Why should it be
expected of me?&nbsp; Is it because I look particularly
soft&mdash;or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His immobility struck me as dignified suddenly, his
imperturbable quality as dangerous.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
plenty of time to think about that,&rdquo; I concluded weakly
with a gesture that tried to wave him away.&nbsp; But before he
departed he took time to mention regretfully that he had not yet
had the pleasure of seeing me at his &ldquo;store&rdquo; to
sample those cigars.&nbsp; He had a parcel of six thousand to
dispose of, very cheap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be worth your while to secure
some,&rdquo; he added with a fat, melancholy smile and left the
cabin.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns struck his fist on the table excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such impudence!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s made
up his mind to get something out of you one way or another,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once feeling inclined to defend Jacobus, I observed
philosophically that all this was business, I supposed.&nbsp; But
my absurd mate, muttering broken disjointed sentences, such as:
&ldquo;I cannot bear! . . . Mark my words! . . .&rdquo; and so
on, flung out of the cabin.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t nursed him
through that deadly fever I wouldn&rsquo;t have suffered such
manners for a single day.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Jacobus</span> having put me in mind of
his wealthy brother I concluded I would pay that business call at
once.&nbsp; I had by that time heard a little more of him.&nbsp;
He was a member of the Council, where he made himself
objectionable to the authorities.&nbsp; He exercised a
considerable influence on public opinion.&nbsp; Lots of people
owed him money.&nbsp; He was an importer on a great scale of all
sorts of goods.&nbsp; For instance, the whole supply of bags for
sugar was practically in his hands.&nbsp; This last fact I did
not learn till afterwards.&nbsp; The general impression conveyed
to me was that of a local personage.&nbsp; He was a bachelor and
gave weekly card-parties in his house out of town, which were
attended by the best people in the colony.</p>
<p>The greater, then, was my surprise to discover his office in
shabby surroundings, quite away from the business quarter,
amongst a lot of hovels.&nbsp; Guided by a black board with white
lettering, I climbed a narrow wooden staircase and entered a room
with a bare floor of planks littered with bits of brown paper and
wisps of packing straw.&nbsp; A great number of what looked like
wine-cases were piled up against one of the walls.&nbsp; A lanky,
inky, light-yellow, mulatto youth, miserably long-necked and
generally recalling a sick chicken, got off a three-legged stool
behind a cheap deal desk and faced me as if gone dumb with
fright.&nbsp; I had some difficulty in persuading him to take in
my name, though I could not get from him the nature of his
objection.&nbsp; He did it at last with an almost agonised
reluctance which ceased to be mysterious to me when I heard him
being sworn at menacingly with savage, suppressed growls, then
audibly cuffed and finally kicked out without any concealment
whatever; because he came back flying head foremost through the
door with a stifled shriek.</p>
<p>To say I was startled would not express it.&nbsp; I remained
still, like a man lost in a dream.&nbsp; Clapping both his hands
to that part of his frail anatomy which had received the shock,
the poor wretch said to me simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go in, please.&rdquo;&nbsp; His lamentable
self-possession was wonderful; but it did not do away with the
incredibility of the experience.&nbsp; A preposterous notion that
I had seen this boy somewhere before, a thing obviously
impossible, was like a delicate finishing touch of weirdness
added to a scene fit to raise doubts as to one&rsquo;s
sanity.&nbsp; I stared anxiously about me like an awakened
somnambulist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; I cried loudly, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t
a mistake, is there?&nbsp; This is Mr. Jacobus&rsquo;s
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy gazed at me with a pained expression&mdash;and somehow
so familiar!&nbsp; A voice within growled offensively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in, since you are there. . . . I
didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I crossed the outer room as one approaches the den of some
unknown wild beast; with intrepidity but in some
excitement.&nbsp; Only no wild beast that ever lived would rouse
one&rsquo;s indignation; the power to do that belongs to the
odiousness of the human brute.&nbsp; And I was very indignant,
which did not prevent me from being at once struck by the
extraordinary resemblance of the two brothers.</p>
<p>This one was dark instead of being fair like the other; but he
was as big.&nbsp; He was without his coat and waistcoat; he had
been doubtless snoozing in the rocking-chair which stood in a
corner furthest from the window.&nbsp; Above the great bulk of
his crumpled white shirt, buttoned with three diamond studs, his
round face looked swarthy.&nbsp; It was moist; his brown
moustache hung limp and ragged.&nbsp; He pushed a common,
cane-bottomed chair towards me with his foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at it casually, then, turning my indignant eyes full
upon him, I declared in precise and incisive tones that I had
called in obedience to my owners&rsquo; instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
understand what that fool was saying. . . . But never mind!&nbsp;
It will teach the scoundrel to disturb me at this time of the
day,&rdquo; he added, grinning at me with savage cynicism.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch.&nbsp; It was past three
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;quite the full swing of afternoon office work
in the port.&nbsp; He snarled imperiously: &ldquo;Sit down,
Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acknowledged the gracious invitation by saying
deliberately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can listen to all you may have to say without sitting
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emitting a loud and vehement &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; he glared
for a moment, very round-eyed and fierce.&nbsp; It was like a
gigantic tomcat spitting at one suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at
him! . . . What do you fancy yourself to be?&nbsp; What did you
come here for?&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t sit down and talk
business you had better go to the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him personally,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But after this I wouldn&rsquo;t mind calling on him.&nbsp;
It would be refreshing to meet a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed me, growling behind my back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The impudence!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a good mind to write to
your owners what I think of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned on him for a moment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it happens I don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; For my part I
assure you I won&rsquo;t even take the trouble to mention you to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped at the door of his office while I traversed the
littered anteroom.&nbsp; I think he was somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will break every bone in your body,&rdquo; he roared
suddenly at the miserable mulatto lad, &ldquo;if you ever dare to
disturb me before half-past three for anybody.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye
hear?&nbsp; For anybody! . . . Let alone any damned
skipper,&rdquo; he added, in a lower growl.</p>
<p>The frail youngster, swaying like a reed, made a low moaning
sound.&nbsp; I stopped short and addressed this sufferer with
advice.&nbsp; It was prompted by the sight of a hammer (used for
opening the wine-cases, I suppose) which was lying on the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you, my boy, I would have that thing up my
sleeve when I went in next and at the first occasion I
would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was there so familiar in that lad&rsquo;s yellow
face?&nbsp; Entrenched and quaking behind the flimsy desk, he
never looked up.&nbsp; His heavy, lowered eyelids gave me
suddenly the clue of the puzzle.&nbsp; He resembled&mdash;yes,
those thick glued lips&mdash;he resembled the brothers
Jacobus.&nbsp; He resembled both, the wealthy merchant and the
pushing shopkeeper (who resembled each other); he resembled them
as much as a thin, light-yellow mulatto lad may resemble a big,
stout, middle-aged white man.&nbsp; It was the exotic complexion
and the slightness of his build which had put me off so
completely.&nbsp; Now I saw in him unmistakably the Jacobus
strain, weakened, attenuated, diluted as it were in a bucket of
water&mdash;and I refrained from finishing my speech.&nbsp; I had
intended to say: &ldquo;Crack this brute&rsquo;s head for
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; I still felt the conclusion to be sound.&nbsp;
But it is no trifling responsibility to counsel parricide to any
one, however deeply injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beggarly&mdash;cheeky&mdash;skippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I despised the emphatic growl at my back; only, being much
vexed and upset, I regret to say that I slammed the door behind
me in a most undignified manner.</p>
<p>It may not appear altogether absurd if I say that I brought
out from that interview a kindlier view of the other
Jacobus.&nbsp; It was with a feeling resembling partisanship
that, a few days later, I called at his
&ldquo;store.&rdquo;&nbsp; That long, cavern-like place of
business, very dim at the back and stuffed full of all sorts of
goods, was entered from the street by a lofty archway.&nbsp; At
the far end I saw my Jacobus exerting himself in his
shirt-sleeves among his assistants.&nbsp; The captains&rsquo;
room was a small, vaulted apartment with a stone floor and heavy
iron bars in its windows like a dungeon converted to hospitable
purposes.&nbsp; A couple of cheerful bottles and several gleaming
glasses made a brilliant cluster round a tall, cool red
earthenware pitcher on the centre table which was littered with
newspapers from all parts of the world.&nbsp; A well-groomed
stranger in a smart grey check suit, sitting with one leg flung
over his knee, put down one of these sheets briskly and nodded to
me.</p>
<p>I guessed him to be a steamer-captain.&nbsp; It was impossible
to get to know these men.&nbsp; They came and went too quickly
and their ships lay moored far out, at the very entrance of the
harbour.&nbsp; Theirs was another life altogether.&nbsp; He
yawned slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dull hole, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understood this to allude to the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find it so?&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m off to-morrow,
thank goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a very gentlemanly person, good-natured and
superior.&nbsp; I watched him draw the open box of cigars to his
side of the table, take a big cigar-case out of his pocket and
begin to fill it very methodically.&nbsp; Presently, on our eyes
meeting, he winked like a common mortal and invited me to follow
his example.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are really decent
smokes.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not off to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that?&nbsp; Think I am abusing old
Jacobus&rsquo;s hospitality?&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp; It goes into
the bill, of course.&nbsp; He spreads such little matters all
over his account.&nbsp; He can take care of himself!&nbsp; Why,
it&rsquo;s business&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noted a shadow fall over his well-satisfied expression, a
momentary hesitation in closing his cigar-case.&nbsp; But he
ended by putting it in his pocket jauntily.&nbsp; A placid voice
uttered in the doorway: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite correct,
Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large noiseless Jacobus advanced into the room.&nbsp; His
quietness, in the circumstances, amounted to cordiality.&nbsp; He
had put on his jacket before joining us, and he sat down in the
chair vacated by the steamer-man, who nodded again to me and went
out with a short, jarring laugh.&nbsp; A profound silence
reigned.&nbsp; With his drowsy stare Jacobus seemed to be
slumbering open-eyed.&nbsp; Yet, somehow, I was aware of being
profoundly scrutinised by those heavy eyes.&nbsp; In the enormous
cavern of the store somebody began to nail down a case, expertly:
tap-tap . . . tap-tap-tap.</p>
<p>Two other experts, one slow and nasal, the other shrill and
snappy, started checking an invoice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A half-coil of three-inch manilla rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six assorted shackles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six tins assorted soups, three of pat&eacute;, two
asparagus, fourteen pounds tobacco, cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the captain who was here just
now,&rdquo; breathed out the immovable Jacobus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These steamer orders are very small.&nbsp; They pick up
what they want as they go along.&nbsp; That man will be in
Samarang in less than a fortnight.&nbsp; Very small orders
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The calling over of the items went on in the shop; an
extraordinary jumble of varied articles, paint-brushes, Yorkshire
Relish, etc., etc. . . . &ldquo;Three sacks of best
potatoes,&rdquo; read out the nasal voice.</p>
<p>At this Jacobus blinked like a sleeping man roused by a shake,
and displayed some animation.&nbsp; At his order, shouted into
the shop, a smirking half-caste clerk with his ringlets much
oiled and with a pen stuck behind his ear, brought in a sample of
six potatoes which he paraded in a row on the table.</p>
<p>Being urged to look at their beauty I gave them a cold and
hostile glance.&nbsp; Calmly, Jacobus proposed that I should
order ten or fifteen tons&mdash;tons!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
believe my ears.&nbsp; My crew could not have eaten such a lot in
a year; and potatoes (excuse these practical remarks) are a
highly perishable commodity.&nbsp; I thought he was
joking&mdash;or else trying to find out whether I was an
unutterable idiot.&nbsp; But his purpose was not so simple.&nbsp;
I discovered that he meant me to buy them on my own account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proposing you a bit of business, Captain.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t charge you a great price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him that I did not go in for trade.&nbsp; I even added
grimly that I knew only too well how that sort of spec. generally
ended.</p>
<p>He sighed and clasped his hands on his stomach with exemplary
resignation.&nbsp; I admired the placidity of his
impudence.&nbsp; Then waking up somewhat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you try a cigar, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t smoke
cigars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For once!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a patient
whisper.&nbsp; A melancholy silence ensued.&nbsp; You know how
sometimes a person discloses a certain unsuspected depth and
acuteness of thought; that is, in other words, utters something
unexpected.&nbsp; It was unexpected enough to hear Jacobus
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who just went out was right enough.&nbsp; You
might take one, Captain.&nbsp; Here everything is bound to be in
the way of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt a little ashamed of myself.&nbsp; The remembrance of
his horrid brother made him appear quite a decent sort of
fellow.&nbsp; It was with some compunction that I said a few
words to the effect that I could have no possible objection to
his hospitality.</p>
<p>Before I was a minute older I saw where this admission was
leading me.&nbsp; As if changing the subject, Jacobus mentioned
that his private house was about ten minutes&rsquo; walk
away.&nbsp; It had a beautiful old walled garden.&nbsp; Something
really remarkable.&nbsp; I ought to come round some day and have
a look at it.</p>
<p>He seemed to be a lover of gardens.&nbsp; I too take extreme
delight in them; but I did not mean my compunction to carry me as
far as Jacobus&rsquo;s flower-beds, however beautiful and
old.&nbsp; He added, with a certain homeliness of tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only my girl there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult to set everything down in due order; so I must
revert here to what happened a week or two before.&nbsp; The
medical officer of the port had come on board my ship to have a
look at one of my crew who was ailing, and naturally enough he
was asked to step into the cabin.&nbsp; A fellow-shipmaster of
mine was there too; and in the conversation, somehow or other,
the name of Jacobus came to be mentioned.&nbsp; It was pronounced
with no particular reverence by the other man, I believe.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t remember now what I was going to say.&nbsp; The
doctor&mdash;a pleasant, cultivated fellow, with an assured
manner&mdash;prevented me by striking in, in a sour tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re talking about my respected
papa-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, that sally silenced us at the time.&nbsp; But I
remembered the episode, and at this juncture, pushed for
something noncommittal to say, I inquired with polite
surprise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your married daughter living with you, Mr.
Jacobus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved his big hand from right to left quietly.&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; That was another of his girls, he stated, ponderously
and under his breath as usual.&nbsp; She . . . He seemed in a
pause to be ransacking his mind for some kind of descriptive
phrase.&nbsp; But my hopes were disappointed.&nbsp; He merely
produced his stereotyped definition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very different sort of person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed. . . . And by the by, Jacobus, I called on your
brother the other day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no great compliment if I
say that I found him a very different sort of person from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had an air of profound reflection, then remarked
quaintly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man of regular habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have been alluding to the habit of late siesta; but I
mumbled something about &ldquo;beastly habits
anyhow&rdquo;&mdash;and left the store abruptly.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> little passage with Jacobus the
merchant became known generally.&nbsp; One or two of my
acquaintances made distant allusions to it.&nbsp; Perhaps the
mulatto boy had talked.&nbsp; I must confess that people appeared
rather scandalised, but not with Jacobus&rsquo;s brutality.&nbsp;
A man I knew remonstrated with me for my hastiness.</p>
<p>I gave him the whole story of my visit, not forgetting the
tell-tale resemblance of the wretched mulatto boy to his
tormentor.&nbsp; He was not surprised.&nbsp; No doubt, no
doubt.&nbsp; What of that?&nbsp; In a jovial tone he assured me
that there must be many of that sort.&nbsp; The elder Jacobus had
been a bachelor all his life.&nbsp; A highly respectable
bachelor.&nbsp; But there had never been open scandal in that
connection.&nbsp; His life had been quite regular.&nbsp; It could
cause no offence to any one.</p>
<p>I said that I had been offended considerably.&nbsp; My
interlocutor opened very wide eyes.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because a
mulatto lad got a few knocks?&nbsp; That was not a great affair,
surely.&nbsp; I had no idea how insolent and untruthful these
half-castes were.&nbsp; In fact he seemed to think Mr. Jacobus
rather kind than otherwise to employ that youth at all; a sort of
amiable weakness which could be forgiven.</p>
<p>This acquaintance of mine belonged to one of the old French
families, descendants of the old colonists; all noble, all
impoverished, and living a narrow domestic life in dull,
dignified decay.&nbsp; The men, as a rule, occupy inferior posts
in Government offices or in business houses.&nbsp; The girls are
almost always pretty, ignorant of the world, kind and agreeable
and generally bilingual; they prattle innocently both in French
and English.&nbsp; The emptiness of their existence passes
belief.</p>
<p>I obtained my entry into a couple of such households because
some years before, in Bombay, I had occasion to be of use to a
pleasant, ineffectual young man who was rather stranded there,
not knowing what to do with himself or even how to get home to
his island again.&nbsp; It was a matter of two hundred rupees or
so, but, when I turned up, the family made a point of showing
their gratitude by admitting me to their intimacy.&nbsp; My
knowledge of the French language made me specially
acceptable.&nbsp; They had meantime managed to marry the fellow
to a woman nearly twice his age, comparatively well off: the only
profession he was really fit for.&nbsp; But it was not all cakes
and ale.&nbsp; The first time I called on the couple she spied a
little spot of grease on the poor devil&rsquo;s pantaloons and
made him a screaming scene of reproaches so full of sincere
passion that I sat terrified as at a tragedy of Racine.</p>
<p>Of course there was never question of the money I had advanced
him; but his sisters, Miss Angele and Miss Mary, and the aunts of
both families, who spoke quaint archaic French of pre-Revolution
period, and a host of distant relations adopted me for a friend
outright in a manner which was almost embarrassing.</p>
<p>It was with the eldest brother (he was employed at a desk in
my consignee&rsquo;s office) that I was having this talk about
the merchant Jacobus.&nbsp; He regretted my attitude and nodded
his head sagely.&nbsp; An influential man.&nbsp; One never knew
when one would need him.&nbsp; I expressed my immense preference
for the shopkeeper of the two.&nbsp; At that my friend looked
grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you pulling that long face
about?&rdquo; I cried impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;He asked me to
see his garden and I have a good mind to go some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said, so earnestly that
I burst into a fit of laughter; but he looked at me without a
smile.</p>
<p>This was another matter altogether.&nbsp; At one time the
public conscience of the island had been mightily troubled by my
Jacobus.&nbsp; The two brothers had been partners for years in
great harmony, when a wandering circus came to the island and my
Jacobus became suddenly infatuated with one of the
lady-riders.&nbsp; What made it worse was that he was
married.&nbsp; He had not even the grace to conceal his
passion.&nbsp; It must have been strong indeed to carry away such
a large placid creature.&nbsp; His behaviour was perfectly
scandalous.&nbsp; He followed that woman to the Cape, and
apparently travelled at the tail of that beastly circus to other
parts of the world, in a most degrading position.&nbsp; The woman
soon ceased to care for him, and treated him worse than a
dog.&nbsp; Most extraordinary stories of moral degradation were
reaching the island at that time.&nbsp; He had not the strength
of mind to shake himself free. . . .</p>
<p>The grotesque image of a fat, pushing ship-chandler, enslaved
by an unholy love-spell, fascinated me; and I listened rather
open-mouthed to the tale as old as the world, a tale which had
been the subject of legend, of moral fables, of poems, but which
so ludicrously failed to fit the personality.&nbsp; What a
strange victim for the gods!</p>
<p>Meantime his deserted wife had died.&nbsp; His daughter was
taken care of by his brother, who married her as advantageously
as was possible in the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; The Mrs. Doctor!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; A very able man.&nbsp;
He wanted a lift in the world, and there was a good bit of money
from her mother, besides the expectations. . . Of course, they
don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;The doctor
nods in the street, I believe, but he avoids speaking to him when
they meet on board a ship, as must happen sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remarked that this surely was an old story by now.</p>
<p>My friend assented.&nbsp; But it was Jacobus&rsquo;s own fault
that it was neither forgiven nor forgotten.&nbsp; He came back
ultimately.&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; Not in a spirit of contrition,
in a way to propitiate his scandalised fellow-citizens.&nbsp; He
must needs drag along with him a child&mdash;a girl. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spoke to me of a daughter who lives with him,&rdquo;
I observed, very much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s certainly the daughter of the
circus-woman,&rdquo; said my friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;She may be his
daughter too; I am willing to admit that she is.&nbsp; In fact I
have no doubt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not see why she should have been brought into a
respectable community to perpetuate the memory of the
scandal.&nbsp; And that was not the worst.&nbsp; Presently
something much more distressing happened.&nbsp; That abandoned
woman turned up.&nbsp; Landed from a mail-boat. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Here?&nbsp; To claim the child
perhaps,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not she!&rdquo;&nbsp; My friendly informant was very
scornful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Imagine a painted, haggard, agitated,
desperate hag.&nbsp; Been cast off in Mozambique by somebody who
paid her passage here.&nbsp; She had been injured internally by a
kick from a horse; she hadn&rsquo;t a cent on her when she got
ashore; I don&rsquo;t think she even asked to see the
child.&nbsp; At any rate, not till the last day of her
life.&nbsp; Jacobus hired for her a bungalow to die in.&nbsp; He
got a couple of Sisters from the hospital to nurse her through
these few months.&nbsp; If he didn&rsquo;t marry her <i>in
extremis</i> as the good Sisters tried to bring about, it&rsquo;s
because she wouldn&rsquo;t even hear of it.&nbsp; As the nuns
said: &lsquo;The woman died impenitent.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was
reported that she ordered Jacobus out of the room with her last
breath.&nbsp; This may be the real reason why he didn&rsquo;t go
into mourning himself; he only put the child into black.&nbsp;
While she was little she was to be seen sometimes about the
streets attended by a negro woman, but since she became of age to
put her hair up I don&rsquo;t think she has set foot outside that
garden once.&nbsp; She must be over eighteen now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus my friend, with some added details; such as, that he
didn&rsquo;t think the girl had spoken to three people of any
position in the island; that an elderly female relative of the
brothers Jacobus had been induced by extreme poverty to accept
the position of gouvernante to the girl.&nbsp; As to
Jacobus&rsquo;s business (which certainly annoyed his brother) it
was a wise choice on his part.&nbsp; It brought him in contact
only with strangers of passage; whereas any other would have
given rise to all sorts of awkwardness with his social
equals.&nbsp; The man was not wanting in a certain
tact&mdash;only he was naturally shameless.&nbsp; For why did he
want to keep that girl with him?&nbsp; It was most painful for
everybody.</p>
<p>I thought suddenly (and with profound disgust) of the other
Jacobus, and I could not refrain from saying slily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose if he employed her, say, as a scullion in his
household and occasionally pulled her hair or boxed her ears, the
position would have been more regular&mdash;less shocking to the
respectable class to which he belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not so stupid as to miss my intention, and shrugged his
shoulders impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; To begin with,
she&rsquo;s not a mulatto.&nbsp; And a scandal is a
scandal.&nbsp; People should be given a chance to forget.&nbsp; I
dare say it would have been better for her if she had been turned
into a scullion or something of that kind.&nbsp; Of course
he&rsquo;s trying to make money in every sort of petty way, but
in such a business there&rsquo;ll never be enough for anybody to
come forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When my friend left me I had a conception of Jacobus and his
daughter existing, a lonely pair of castaways, on a desert
island; the girl sheltering in the house as if it were a cavern
in a cliff, and Jacobus going out to pick up a living for both on
the beach&mdash;exactly like two shipwrecked people who always
hope for some rescuer to bring them back at last into touch with
the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>But Jacobus&rsquo;s bodily reality did not fit in with this
romantic view.&nbsp; When he turned up on board in the usual
course, he sipped the cup of coffee placidly, asked me if I was
satisfied&mdash;and I hardly listened to the harbour gossip he
dropped slowly in his low, voice-saving enunciation.&nbsp; I had
then troubles of my own.&nbsp; My ship chartered, my thoughts
dwelling on the success of a quick round voyage, I had been
suddenly confronted by a shortage of bags.&nbsp; A
catastrophe!&nbsp; The stock of one especial kind, called
pockets, seemed to be totally exhausted.&nbsp; A consignment was
shortly expected&mdash;it was afloat, on its way, but, meantime,
the loading of my ship dead stopped, I had enough to worry
about.&nbsp; My consignees, who had received me with such
heartiness on my arrival, now, in the character of my charterers,
listened to my complaints with polite helplessness.&nbsp; Their
manager, the old-maidish, thin man, who so prudishly didn&rsquo;t
even like to speak about the impure Jacobus, gave me the correct
commercial view of the position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Captain&rdquo;&mdash;he was retracting his
leathery cheeks into a condescending, shark-like
smile&mdash;&ldquo;we were not morally obliged to tell you of a
possible shortage before you signed the charter-party.&nbsp; It
was for you to guard against the contingency of a
delay&mdash;strictly speaking.&nbsp; But of course we
shouldn&rsquo;t have taken any advantage.&nbsp; This is no
one&rsquo;s fault really.&nbsp; We ourselves have been taken
unawares,&rdquo; he concluded primly, with an obvious lie.</p>
<p>This lecture I confess had made me thirsty.&nbsp; Suppressed
rage generally produces that effect; and as I strolled on
aimlessly I bethought myself of the tall earthenware pitcher in
the captains&rsquo; room of the Jacobus &ldquo;store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no more than a nod to the men I found assembled there, I
poured down a deep, cool draught on my indignation, then another,
and then, becoming dejected, I sat plunged in cheerless
reflections.&nbsp; The others read, talked, smoked, bandied over
my head some unsubtle chaff.&nbsp; But my abstraction was
respected.&nbsp; And it was without a word to any one that I rose
and went out, only to be quite unexpectedly accosted in the
bustle of the store by Jacobus the outcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Captain.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Going
away?&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t been looking so well these last few
days, I notice.&nbsp; Run down, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was in his shirt-sleeves, and his words were in the usual
course of business, but they had a human note.&nbsp; It was
commercial amenity, but I had been a stranger to amenity in that
connection.&nbsp; I do verily believe (from the direction of his
heavy glance towards a certain shelf) that he was going to
suggest the purchase of Clarkson&rsquo;s Nerve Tonic, which he
kept in stock, when I said impulsively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rather in trouble with my loading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wide awake under his sleepy, broad mask with glued lips, he
understood at once, had a movement of the head so appreciative
that I relieved my exasperation by exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely there must be eleven hundred quarter-bags to be
found in the colony.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only a matter of looking
for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again that slight movement of the big head, and in the noise
and activity of the store that tranquil murmur:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure.&nbsp; But then people likely to have a
reserve of quarter-bags wouldn&rsquo;t want to sell.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d need that size themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what my consignees are telling
me.&nbsp; Impossible to buy.&nbsp; Bosh!&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t
want to.&nbsp; It suits them to have the ship hung up.&nbsp; But
if I were to discover the lot they would have to&mdash;Look here,
Jacobus!&nbsp; You are the man to have such a thing up your
sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He protested with a ponderous swing of his big head.&nbsp; I
stood before him helplessly, being looked at by those heavy eyes
with a veiled expression as of a man after some soul-shaking
crisis.&nbsp; Then, suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to talk quietly here,&rdquo; he
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am very busy.&nbsp; But if you could go
and wait for me in my house.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s less than ten
minutes&rsquo; walk.&nbsp; Oh, yes, you don&rsquo;t know the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called for his coat and offered to take me there
himself.&nbsp; He would have to return to the store at once for
an hour or so to finish his business, and then he would be at
liberty to talk over with me that matter of quarter-bags.&nbsp;
This programme was breathed out at me through slightly parted,
still lips; his heavy, motionless glance rested upon me, placid
as ever, the glance of a tired man&mdash;but I felt that it was
searching, too.&nbsp; I could not imagine what he was looking for
in me and kept silent, wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am asking you to wait for me in my house till I am at
liberty to talk this matter over.&nbsp; You will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot promise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say not,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t expect a promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean I can&rsquo;t even promise to try the move
I&rsquo;ve in my mind.&nbsp; One must see first . . .
h&rsquo;m!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take the chance.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll wait for you as long as you like.&nbsp; What else have
I to do in this infernal hole of a port!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I had uttered my last words we had set off at a
swinging pace.&nbsp; We turned a couple of corners and entered a
street completely empty of traffic, of semi-rural aspect, paved
with cobblestones nestling in grass tufts.&nbsp; The house came
to the line of the roadway; a single story on an elevated
basement of rough-stones, so that our heads were below the level
of the windows as we went along.&nbsp; All the jalousies were
tightly shut, like eyes, and the house seemed fast asleep in the
afternoon sunshine.&nbsp; The entrance was at the side, in an
alley even more grass-grown than the street: a small door, simply
on the latch.</p>
<p>With a word of apology as to showing me the way, Jacobus
preceded me up a dark passage and led me across the naked parquet
floor of what I supposed to be the dining-room.&nbsp; It was
lighted by three glass doors which stood wide open on to a
verandah or rather loggia running its brick arches along the
garden side of the house.&nbsp; It was really a magnificent
garden: smooth green lawns and a gorgeous maze of flower-beds in
the foreground, displayed around a basin of dark water framed in
a marble rim, and in the distance the massed foliage of varied
trees concealing the roofs of other houses.&nbsp; The town might
have been miles away.&nbsp; It was a brilliantly coloured
solitude, drowsing in a warm, voluptuous silence.&nbsp; Where the
long, still shadows fell across the beds, and in shady nooks, the
massed colours of the flowers had an extraordinary magnificence
of effect.&nbsp; I stood entranced.&nbsp; Jacobus grasped me
delicately above the elbow, impelling me to a half-turn to the
left.</p>
<p>I had not noticed the girl before.&nbsp; She occupied a low,
deep, wickerwork arm-chair, and I saw her in exact profile like a
figure in a tapestry, and as motionless.&nbsp; Jacobus released
my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Alice,&rdquo; he announced tranquilly; and his
subdued manner of speaking made it sound so much like a
confidential communication that I fancied myself nodding
understandingly and whispering: &ldquo;I see, I see.&rdquo; . . .
Of course, I did nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Neither of us did
anything; we stood side by side looking down at the girl.&nbsp;
For quite a time she did not stir, staring straight before her as
if watching the vision of some pageant passing through the garden
in the deep, rich glow of light and the splendour of flowers.</p>
<p>Then, coming to the end of her reverie, she looked round and
up.&nbsp; If I had not at first noticed her, I am certain that
she too had been unaware of my presence till she actually
perceived me by her father&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; The quickened
upward movement of the heavy eyelids, the widening of the languid
glance, passing into a fixed stare, put that beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Under her amazement there was a hint of fear, and then came a
flash as of anger.&nbsp; Jacobus, after uttering my name fairly
loud, said: &ldquo;Make yourself at home, Captain&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t be gone long,&rdquo; and went away rapidly.&nbsp;
Before I had time to make a bow I was left alone with the
girl&mdash;who, I remembered suddenly, had not been seen by any
man or woman of that town since she had found it necessary to put
up her hair.&nbsp; It looked as though it had not been touched
again since that distant time of first putting up; it was a mass
of black, lustrous locks, twisted anyhow high on her head, with
long, untidy wisps hanging down on each side of the clear sallow
face; a mass so thick and strong and abundant that, nothing but
to look at, it gave you a sensation of heavy pressure on the top
of your head and an impression of magnificently cynical
untidiness.&nbsp; She leaned forward, hugging herself with
crossed legs; a dingy, amber-coloured, flounced wrapper of some
thin stuff revealed the young supple body drawn together tensely
in the deep low seat as if crouching for a spring.&nbsp; I
detected a slight, quivering start or two, which looked
uncommonly like bounding away.&nbsp; They were followed by the
most absolute immobility.</p>
<p>The absurd impulse to run out after Jacobus (for I had been
startled, too) once repressed, I took a chair, placed it not very
far from her, sat down deliberately, and began to talk about the
garden, caring not what I said, but using a gentle caressing
intonation as one talks to soothe a startled wild animal.&nbsp; I
could not even be certain that she understood me.&nbsp; She never
raised her face nor attempted to look my way.&nbsp; I kept on
talking only to prevent her from taking flight.&nbsp; She had
another of those quivering, repressed starts which made me catch
my breath with apprehension.</p>
<p>Ultimately I formed a notion that what prevented her perhaps
from going off in one great, nervous leap, was the scantiness of
her attire.&nbsp; The wicker armchair was the most substantial
thing about her person.&nbsp; What she had on under that dingy,
loose, amber wrapper must have been of the most flimsy and airy
character.&nbsp; One could not help being aware of it.&nbsp; It
was obvious.&nbsp; I felt it actually embarrassing at first; but
that sort of embarrassment is got over easily by a mind not
enslaved by narrow prejudices.&nbsp; I did not avert my gaze from
Alice.&nbsp; I went on talking with ingratiating softness, the
recollection that, most likely, she had never before been spoken
to by a strange man adding to my assurance.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know why an emotional tenseness should have crept into the
situation.&nbsp; But it did.&nbsp; And just as I was becoming
aware of it a slight scream cut short my flow of urbane
speech.</p>
<p>The scream did not proceed from the girl.&nbsp; It was emitted
behind me, and caused me to turn my head sharply.&nbsp; I
understood at once that the apparition in the doorway was the
elderly relation of Jacobus, the companion, the
gouvernante.&nbsp; While she remained thunderstruck, I got up and
made her a low bow.</p>
<p>The ladies of Jacobus&rsquo;s household evidently spent their
days in light attire.&nbsp; This stumpy old woman with a face
like a large wrinkled lemon, beady eyes, and a shock of iron-grey
hair, was dressed in a garment of some ash-coloured, silky, light
stuff.&nbsp; It fell from her thick neck down to her toes with
the simplicity of an unadorned nightgown.&nbsp; It made her
appear truly cylindrical.&nbsp; She exclaimed: &ldquo;How did you
get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I could say a word she vanished and presently I heard a
confusion of shrill protestations in a distant part of the
house.&nbsp; Obviously no one could tell her how I got
there.&nbsp; In a moment, with great outcries from two negro
women following her, she waddled back to the doorway,
infuriated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned to the girl.&nbsp; She was sitting straight up now,
her hands posed on the arms of the chair.&nbsp; I appealed to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Miss Alice, you will not let them drive me out
into the street?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her magnificent black eyes, narrowed, long in shape, swept
over me with an indefinable expression, then in a harsh,
contemptuous voice she let fall in French a sort of
explanation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est papa</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made another low bow to the old woman.</p>
<p>She turned her back on me in order to drive away her black
henchwomen, then surveying my person in a peculiar manner with
one small eye nearly closed and her face all drawn up on that
side as if with a twinge of toothache, she stepped out on the
verandah, sat down in a rocking-chair some distance away, and
took up her knitting from a little table.&nbsp; Before she
started at it she plunged one of the needles into the mop of her
grey hair and stirred it vigorously.</p>
<p>Her elementary nightgown-sort of frock clung to her ancient,
stumpy, and floating form.&nbsp; She wore white cotton stockings
and flat brown velvet slippers.&nbsp; Her feet and ankles were
obtrusively visible on the foot-rest.&nbsp; She began to rock
herself slightly, while she knitted.&nbsp; I had resumed my seat
and kept quiet, for I mistrusted that old woman.&nbsp; What if
she ordered me to depart?&nbsp; She seemed capable of any
outrage.&nbsp; She had snorted once or twice; she was knitting
violently.&nbsp; Suddenly she piped at the young girl in French a
question which I translate colloquially:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your father up to, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young creature shrugged her shoulders so comprehensively
that her whole body swayed within the loose wrapper; and in that
unexpectedly harsh voice which yet had a seductive quality to the
senses, like certain kinds of natural rough wines one drinks with
pleasure:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some captain.&nbsp; Leave me
alone&mdash;will you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chair rocked quicker, the old, thin voice was like a
whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your father make a pair.&nbsp; He would stick
at nothing&mdash;that&rsquo;s well known.&nbsp; But I
didn&rsquo;t expect this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought it high time to air some of my own French.&nbsp; I
remarked modestly, but firmly, that this was business.&nbsp; I
had some matters to talk over with Mr. Jacobus.</p>
<p>At once she piped out a derisive &ldquo;Poor
innocent!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, with a change of tone: &ldquo;The
shop&rsquo;s for business.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you go to the
shop to talk with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The furious speed of her fingers and knitting-needles made one
dizzy; and with squeaky indignation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sitting here staring at that girl&mdash;is that what
you call business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said suavely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call this
pleasure&mdash;an unexpected pleasure.&nbsp; And unless Miss
Alice objects&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I half turned to her.&nbsp; She flung at me an angry and
contemptuous &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; and leaning her
elbow on her knees took her chin in her hand&mdash;a Jacobus chin
undoubtedly.&nbsp; And those heavy eyelids, this black irritated
stare reminded me of Jacobus, too&mdash;the wealthy merchant, the
respected one.&nbsp; The design of her eyebrows also was the
same, rigid and ill-omened.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I traced in her a
resemblance to both of them.&nbsp; It came to me as a sort of
surprising remote inference that both these Jacobuses were rather
handsome men after all.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Then I shall stare at you till you
smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She favoured me again with an even more viciously scornful
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman broke in blunt and shrill:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear his impudence!&nbsp; And you too!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t care!&nbsp; Go at least and put some more clothes
on.&nbsp; Sitting there like this before this sailor
riff-raff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was about to leave the Pearl of the Ocean for other
seas, for other lands.&nbsp; The walled garden full of shadows
blazed with colour as if the flowers were giving up the light
absorbed during the day.&nbsp; The amazing old woman became very
explicit.&nbsp; She suggested to the girl a corset and a
petticoat with a cynical unreserve which humiliated me.&nbsp; Was
I of no more account than a wooden dummy?&nbsp; The girl snapped
out: &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not the naughty retort of a vulgar child; it had a note
of desperation.&nbsp; Clearly my intrusion had somehow upset the
balance of their established relations.&nbsp; The old woman
knitted with furious accuracy, her eyes fastened down on her
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are the true child of your father!&nbsp; And
<i>that</i> talks of entering a convent!&nbsp; Letting herself be
stared at by a fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shameless thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old sorceress,&rdquo; the girl uttered distinctly,
preserving her meditative pose, chin in hand, and a far-away
stare over the garden.</p>
<p>It was like the quarrel of the kettle and the pot.&nbsp; The
old woman flew out of the chair, banged down her work, and with a
great play of thick limb perfectly visible in that weird,
clinging garment of hers, strode at the girl&mdash;who never
stirred.&nbsp; I was experiencing a sort of trepidation when, as
if awed by that unconscious attitude, the aged relative of
Jacobus turned short upon me.</p>
<p>She was, I perceived, armed with a knitting-needle; and as she
raised her hand her intention seemed to be to throw it at me like
a dart.&nbsp; But she only used it to scratch her head with,
examining me the while at close range, one eye nearly shut and
her face distorted by a whimsical, one-sided grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; she asked abruptly, &ldquo;do you
expect any good to come of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope so indeed, Miss Jacobus.&rdquo;&nbsp; I tried
to speak in the easy tone of an afternoon caller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see, I am here after some bags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bags!&nbsp; Look at that now!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I hear
you holding forth to that graceless wretch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would like to see me in my grave,&rdquo; uttered
the motionless girl hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grave!&nbsp; What about me?&nbsp; Buried alive before I
am dead for the sake of a thing blessed with such a pretty
father!&rdquo; she cried; and turning to me: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
one of these men he does business with.&nbsp; Well&mdash;why
don&rsquo;t you leave us in peace, my good fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said in a tone&mdash;this &ldquo;leave us in
peace!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a sort of ruffianly familiarity, a
superiority, a scorn in it.&nbsp; I was to hear it more than
once, for you would show an imperfect knowledge of human nature
if you thought that this was my last visit to that
house&mdash;where no respectable person had put foot for ever so
many years.&nbsp; No, you would be very much mistaken if you
imagined that this reception had scared me away.&nbsp; First of
all I was not going to run before a grotesque and ruffianly old
woman.</p>
<p>And then you mustn&rsquo;t forget these necessary bags.&nbsp;
That first evening Jacobus made me stay to dinner; after,
however, telling me loyally that he didn&rsquo;t know whether he
could do anything at all for me.&nbsp; He had been thinking it
over.&nbsp; It was too difficult, he feared. . . . But he did not
give it up in so many words.</p>
<p>We were only three at table; the girl by means of repeated
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; having conveyed and affirmed her
intention not to come to the table, not to have any dinner, not
to move from the verandah.&nbsp; The old relative hopped about in
her flat slippers and piped indignantly, Jacobus towered over her
and murmured placidly in his throat; I joined jocularly from a
distance, throwing in a few words, for which under the cover of
the night I received secretly a most vicious poke in the ribs
from the old woman&rsquo;s elbow or perhaps her fist.&nbsp; I
restrained a cry.&nbsp; And all the time the girl didn&rsquo;t
even condescend to raise her head to look at any of us.&nbsp; All
this may sound childish&mdash;and yet that stony, petulant
sullenness had an obscurely tragic flavour.</p>
<p>And so we sat down to the food around the light of a good many
candles while she remained crouching out there, staring in the
dark as if feeding her bad temper on the heavily scented air of
the admirable garden.</p>
<p>Before leaving I said to Jacobus that I would come next day to
hear if the bag affair had made any progress.&nbsp; He shook his
head slightly at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll haunt your house daily till you pull it
off.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be always finding me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His faint, melancholy smile did not part his thick lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all right, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then seeing me to the door, very tranquil, he murmured
earnestly the recommendation: &ldquo;Make yourself at
home,&rdquo; and also the hospitable hint about there being
always &ldquo;a plate of soup.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was only on my way
to the quay, down the ill-lighted streets, that I remembered I
had been engaged to dine that very evening with the S&mdash;
family.&nbsp; Though vexed with my forgetfulness (it would be
rather awkward to explain) I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that it
had procured me a more amusing evening.&nbsp; And
besides&mdash;business.&nbsp; The sacred business&mdash;.</p>
<p>In a barefooted negro who overtook me at a run and bolted down
the landing-steps I recognised Jacobus&rsquo;s boatman, who must
have been feeding in the kitchen.&nbsp; His usual
&ldquo;Good-night, sah!&rdquo; as I went up my ship&rsquo;s
ladder had a more cordial sound than on previous occasions.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">kept</span> my word to Jacobus.&nbsp; I
haunted his home.&nbsp; He was perpetually finding me there of an
afternoon when he popped in for a moment from the
&ldquo;store.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sound of my voice talking to his
Alice greeted him on his doorstep; and when he returned for good
in the evening, ten to one he would hear it still going on in the
verandah.&nbsp; I just nodded to him; he would sit down heavily
and gently, and watch with a sort of approving anxiety my efforts
to make his daughter smile.</p>
<p>I called her often &ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; right before him;
sometimes I would address her as Miss &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
Care,&rdquo; and I exhausted myself in nonsensical chatter
without succeeding once in taking her out of her peevish and
tragic self.&nbsp; There were moments when I felt I must break
out and start swearing at her till all was blue.&nbsp; And I
fancied that had I done so Jacobus would not have moved a
muscle.&nbsp; A sort of shady, intimate understanding seemed to
have been established between us.</p>
<p>I must say the girl treated her father exactly in the same way
she treated me.</p>
<p>And how could it have been otherwise?&nbsp; She treated me as
she treated her father.&nbsp; She had never seen a visitor.&nbsp;
She did not know how men behaved.&nbsp; I belonged to the low lot
with whom her father did business at the port.&nbsp; I was of no
account.&nbsp; So was her father.&nbsp; The only decent people in
the world were the people of the island, who would have nothing
to do with him because of something wicked he had done.&nbsp;
This was apparently the explanation Miss Jacobus had given her of
the household&rsquo;s isolated position.&nbsp; For she had to be
told something!&nbsp; And I feel convinced that this version had
been assented to by Jacobus.&nbsp; I must say the old woman was
putting it forward with considerable gusto.&nbsp; It was on her
lips the universal explanation, the universal allusion, the
universal taunt.</p>
<p>One day Jacobus came in early and, beckoning me into the
dining-room, wiped his brow with a weary gesture and told me that
he had managed to unearth a supply of quarter-bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fourteen hundred your ship wanted, did you
say, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; I replied eagerly; but he remained
calm.&nbsp; He looked more tired than I had ever seen him
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain, you may go and tell your people that
they can get that lot from my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I remained open-mouthed at this, he added his usual placid
formula of assurance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it correct, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke to your brother about it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
distinctly awed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And for me?&nbsp; Because he must
have known that my ship&rsquo;s the only one hung up for
bags.&nbsp; How on earth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wiped his brow again.&nbsp; I noticed that he was dressed
with unusual care, in clothes in which I had never seen him
before.&nbsp; He avoided my eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard people talk, of course. . . .
That&rsquo;s true enough.&nbsp; He . . . I . . . We certainly. .
. for several years . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice declined to a
mere sleepy murmur.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see I had something to tell
him of, something which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His murmur stopped.&nbsp; He was not going to tell me what
this something was.&nbsp; And I didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; Anxious
to carry the news to my charterers, I ran back on the verandah to
get my hat.</p>
<p>At the bustle I made the girl turned her eyes slowly in my
direction, and even the old woman was checked in her
knitting.&nbsp; I stopped a moment to exclaim excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s a brick, Miss Don&rsquo;t
Care.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She beheld my elation in scornful surprise.&nbsp; Jacobus with
unwonted familiarity seized my arm as I flew through the
dining-room, and breathed heavily at me a proposal about &ldquo;A
plate of soup&rdquo; that evening.&nbsp; I answered distractedly:
&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Oh, thanks!&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp;
With pleasure,&rdquo; and tore myself away.&nbsp; Dine with
him?&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; The merest gratitude&mdash;</p>
<p>But some three hours afterwards, in the dusky, silent street,
paved with cobble-stones, I became aware that it was not mere
gratitude which was guiding my steps towards the house with the
old garden, where for years no guest other than myself had ever
dined.&nbsp; Mere gratitude does not gnaw at one&rsquo;s interior
economy in that particular way.&nbsp; Hunger might; but I was not
feeling particularly hungry for Jacobus&rsquo;s food.</p>
<p>On that occasion, too, the girl refused to come to the
table.</p>
<p>My exasperation grew.&nbsp; The old woman cast malicious
glances at me.&nbsp; I said suddenly to Jacobus:
&ldquo;Here!&nbsp; Put some chicken and salad on that
plate.&rdquo;&nbsp; He obeyed without raising his eyes.&nbsp; I
carried it with a knife and fork and a serviette out on the
verandah.&nbsp; The garden was one mass of gloom, like a cemetery
of flowers buried in the darkness, and she, in the chair, seemed
to muse mournfully over the extinction of light and colour.&nbsp;
Only whiffs of heavy scent passed like wandering, fragrant souls
of that departed multitude of blossoms.&nbsp; I talked volubly,
jocularly, persuasively, tenderly; I talked in a subdued
tone.&nbsp; To a listener it would have sounded like the murmur
of a pleading lover.&nbsp; Whenever I paused expectantly there
was only a deep silence.&nbsp; It was like offering food to a
seated statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to swallow a single morsel
thinking of you out here starving yourself in the dark.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s positively cruel to be so obstinate.&nbsp; Think of my
sufferings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt as if I could have done her some violence&mdash;shaken
her, beaten her maybe.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your absurd behaviour will prevent me coming here any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s false,&rdquo; she snarled.</p>
<p>My hand fell on her shoulder; and if she had flinched I verily
believe I would have shaken her.&nbsp; But there was no movement
and this immobility disarmed my anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do.&nbsp; Or you wouldn&rsquo;t be found on the
verandah every day.&nbsp; Why are you here, then?&nbsp; There are
plenty of rooms in the house.&nbsp; You have your own room to
stay in&mdash;if you did not want to see me.&nbsp; But you
do.&nbsp; You know you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt a slight shudder under my hand and released my grip as
if frightened by that sign of animation in her body.&nbsp; The
scented air of the garden came to us in a warm wave like a
voluptuous and perfumed sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to them,&rdquo; she whispered, almost
pitifully.</p>
<p>As I re-entered the dining-room I saw Jacobus cast down his
eyes.&nbsp; I banged the plate on the table.&nbsp; At this
demonstration of ill-humour he murmured something in an
apologetic tone, and I turned on him viciously as if he were
accountable to me for these &ldquo;abominable
eccentricities,&rdquo; I believe I called them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I dare say Miss Jacobus here is responsible for
most of this offensive manner,&rdquo; I added loftily.</p>
<p>She piped out at once in her brazen, ruffianly manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you leave us in peace, my
good fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was astonished that she should dare before Jacobus.&nbsp;
Yet what could he have done to repress her?&nbsp; He needed her
too much.&nbsp; He raised a heavy, drowsy glance for an instant,
then looked down again.&nbsp; She insisted with shrill
finality:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you done your business, you two?&nbsp;
Well, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had the true Jacobus impudence, that old woman.&nbsp; Her
mop of iron-grey hair was parted, on the side like a man&rsquo;s,
raffishly, and she made as if to plunge her fork into it, as she
used to do with the knitting-needle, but refrained.&nbsp; Her
little black eyes sparkled venomously.&nbsp; I turned to my host
at the head of the table&mdash;menacingly as it were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what do you say to that, Jacobus?&nbsp; Am I
to take it that we have done with each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to wait a little.&nbsp; The answer when it came was
rather unexpected, and in quite another spirit than the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly think we might do some business yet with
those potatoes of mine, Captain.&nbsp; You will find
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you before that I don&rsquo;t
trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His broad chest heaved without a sound in a noiseless
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over, Captain,&rdquo; he murmured, tenacious
and tranquil; and I burst into a jarring laugh, remembering how
he had stuck to the circus-rider woman&mdash;the depth of passion
under that placid surface, which even cuts with a riding-whip (so
the legend had it) could never raffle into the semblance of a
storm; something like the passion of a fish would be if one could
imagine such a thing as a passionate fish.</p>
<p>That evening I experienced more distinctly than ever the sense
of moral discomfort which always attended me in that house lying
under the ban of all &ldquo;decent&rdquo; people.&nbsp; I refused
to stay on and smoke after dinner; and when I put my hand into
the thickly-cushioned palm of Jacobus, I said to myself that it
would be for the last time under his roof.&nbsp; I pressed his
bulky paw heartily nevertheless.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t he got me out
of a serious difficulty?&nbsp; To the few words of acknowledgment
I was bound, and indeed quite willing, to utter, he answered by
stretching his closed lips in his melancholy, glued-together
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all right, I hope, Captain,&rdquo; he
breathed out weightily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked, alarmed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That your brother might yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he reassured me.&nbsp; &ldquo;He . . .
he&rsquo;s a man of his word, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My self-communion as I walked away from his door, trying to
believe that this was for the last time, was not
satisfactory.&nbsp; I was aware myself that I was not sincere in
my reflections as to Jacobus&rsquo;s motives, and, of course, the
very next day I went back again.</p>
<p>How weak, irrational, and absurd we are!&nbsp; How easily
carried away whenever our awakened imagination brings us the
irritating hint of a desire!&nbsp; I cared for the girl in a
particular way, seduced by the moody expression of her face, by
her obstinate silences, her rare, scornful words; by the
perpetual pout of her closed lips, the black depths of her fixed
gaze turned slowly upon me as if in contemptuous provocation,
only to be averted next moment with an exasperating
indifference.</p>
<p>Of course the news of my assiduity had spread all over the
little town.&nbsp; I noticed a change in the manner of my
acquaintances and even something different in the nods of the
other captains, when meeting them at the landing-steps or in the
offices where business called me.&nbsp; The old-maidish head
clerk treated me with distant punctiliousness and, as it were,
gathered his skirts round him for fear of contamination.&nbsp; It
seemed to me that the very niggers on the quays turned to look
after me as I passed; and as to Jacobus&rsquo;s boatman his
&ldquo;Good-night, sah!&rdquo; when he put me on board was no
longer merely cordial&mdash;it had a familiar, confidential sound
as though we had been partners in some villainy.</p>
<p>My friend S&mdash; the elder passed me on the other side of
the street with a wave of the hand and an ironic smile.&nbsp; The
younger brother, the one they had married to an elderly shrew,
he, on the strength of an older friendship and as if paying a
debt of gratitude, took the liberty to utter a word of
warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing yourself no good by your choice of
friends, my dear chap,&rdquo; he said with infantile gravity.</p>
<p>As I knew that the meeting of the brothers Jacobus was the
subject of excited comment in the whole of the sugary Pearl of
the Ocean I wanted to know why I was blamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been the occasion of a move which may end in a
reconciliation surely desirable from the point of view of the
proprieties&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if that girl were disposed of it would
certainly facilitate&mdash;&rdquo; he mused sagely, then,
inconsequential creature, gave me a light tap on the lower part
of my waistcoat.&nbsp; &ldquo;You old sinner,&rdquo; he cried
jovially, &ldquo;much you care for proprieties.&nbsp; But you had
better look out for yourself, you know, with a personage like
Jacobus who has no sort of reputation to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had recovered his gravity of a respectable citizen by that
time and added regretfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the women of our family are perfectly
scandalised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But by that time I had given up visiting the S&mdash; family
and the D&mdash; family.&nbsp; The elder ladies pulled such faces
when I showed myself, and the multitude of related young ladies
received me with such a variety of looks: wondering, awed,
mocking (except Miss Mary, who spoke to me and looked at me with
hushed, pained compassion as though I had been ill), that I had
no difficulty in giving them all up.&nbsp; I would have given up
the society of the whole town, for the sake of sitting near that
girl, snarling and superb and barely clad in that flimsy, dingy,
amber wrapper, open low at the throat.&nbsp; She looked, with the
wild wisps of hair hanging down her tense face, as though she had
just jumped out of bed in the panic of a fire.</p>
<p>She sat leaning on her elbow, looking at nothing.&nbsp; Why
did she stay listening to my absurd chatter?&nbsp; And not only
that; but why did she powder her face in preparation for my
arrival?&nbsp; It seemed to be her idea of making a toilette, and
in her untidy negligence a sign of great effort towards personal
adornment.</p>
<p>But I might have been mistaken.&nbsp; The powdering might have
been her daily practice and her presence in the verandah a sign
of an indifference so complete as to take no account of my
existence.&nbsp; Well, it was all one to me.</p>
<p>I loved to watch her slow changes of pose, to look at her long
immobilities composed in the graceful lines of her body, to
observe the mysterious narrow stare of her splendid black eyes,
somewhat long in shape, half closed, contemplating the
void.&nbsp; She was like a spellbound creature with the forehead
of a goddess crowned by the dishevelled magnificent hair of a
gipsy tramp.&nbsp; Even her indifference was seductive.&nbsp; I
felt myself growing attached to her by the bond of an
irrealisable desire, for I kept my head&mdash;quite.&nbsp; And I
put up with the moral discomfort of Jacobus&rsquo;s sleepy
watchfulness, tranquil, and yet so expressive; as if there had
been a tacit pact between us two.&nbsp; I put up with the
insolence of the old woman&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ever
going to leave us in peace, my good fellow?&rdquo; with her
taunts; with her brazen and sinister scolding.&nbsp; She was of
the true Jacobus stock, and no mistake.</p>
<p>Directly I got away from the girl I called myself many hard
names.&nbsp; What folly was this?&nbsp; I would ask myself.&nbsp;
It was like being the slave of some depraved habit.&nbsp; And I
returned to her with my head clear, my heart certainly free, not
even moved by pity for that castaway (she was as much of a
castaway as any one ever wrecked on a desert island), but as if
beguiled by some extraordinary promise.&nbsp; Nothing more
unworthy could be imagined.&nbsp; The recollection of that
tremulous whisper when I gripped her shoulder with one hand and
held a plate of chicken with the other was enough to make me
break all my good resolutions.</p>
<p>Her insulting taciturnity was enough sometimes to make one
gnash one&rsquo;s teeth with rage.&nbsp; When she opened her
mouth it was only to be abominably rude in harsh tones to the
associate of her reprobate father; and the full approval of her
aged relative was conveyed to her by offensive chuckles.&nbsp; If
not that, then her remarks, always uttered in the tone of
scathing contempt, were of the most appalling inanity.</p>
<p>How could it have been otherwise?&nbsp; That plump, ruffianly
Jacobus old maid in the tight grey frock had never taught her any
manners.&nbsp; Manners I suppose are not necessary for born
castaways.&nbsp; No educational establishment could ever be
induced to accept her as a pupil&mdash;on account of the
proprieties, I imagine.&nbsp; And Jacobus had not been able to
send her away anywhere.&nbsp; How could he have done it?&nbsp;
Who with?&nbsp; Where to?&nbsp; He himself was not enough of an
adventurer to think of settling down anywhere else.&nbsp; His
passion had tossed him at the tail of a circus up and down
strange coasts, but, the storm over, he had drifted back
shamelessly where, social outcast as he was, he remained still a
Jacobus&mdash;one of the oldest families on the island, older
than the French even.&nbsp; There must have been a Jacobus in at
the death of the last Dodo. . . . The girl had learned nothing,
she had never listened to a general conversation, she knew
nothing, she had heard of nothing.&nbsp; She could read
certainly; but all the reading matter that ever came in her way
were the newspapers provided for the captains&rsquo; room of the
&ldquo;store.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jacobus had the habit of taking these
sheets home now and then in a very stained and ragged
condition.</p>
<p>As her mind could not grasp the meaning of any matters treated
there except police-court reports and accounts of crimes, she had
formed for herself a notion of the civilised world as a scene of
murders, abductions, burglaries, stabbing affrays, and every sort
of desperate violence.&nbsp; England and France, Paris and London
(the only two towns of which she seemed to have heard), appeared
to her sinks of abomination, reeking with blood, in contrast to
her little island where petty larceny was about the standard of
current misdeeds, with, now and then, some more pronounced
crime&mdash;and that only amongst the imported coolie labourers
on sugar estates or the negroes of the town.&nbsp; But in Europe
these things were being done daily by a wicked population of
white men amongst whom, as that ruffianly, aristocratic old Miss
Jacobus pointed out, the wandering sailors, the associates of her
precious papa, were the lowest of the low.</p>
<p>It was impossible to give her a sense of proportion.&nbsp; I
suppose she figured England to herself as about the size of the
Pearl of the Ocean; in which case it would certainly have been
reeking with gore and a mere wreck of burgled houses from end to
end.&nbsp; One could not make her understand that these horrors
on which she fed her imagination were lost in the mass of orderly
life like a few drops of blood in the ocean.&nbsp; She directed
upon me for a moment the uncomprehending glance of her narrowed
eyes and then would turn her scornful powdered face away without
a word.&nbsp; She would not even take the trouble to shrug her
shoulders.</p>
<p>At that time the batches of papers brought by the last mail
reported a series of crimes in the East End of London, there was
a sensational case of abduction in France and a fine display of
armed robbery in Australia.&nbsp; One afternoon crossing the
dining-room I heard Miss Jacobus piping in the verandah with
venomous animosity: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your precious
papa is plotting with that fellow.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s just the
sort of man who&rsquo;s capable of carrying you off far away
somewhere and then cutting your throat some day for your
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a good half of the length of the verandah between
their chairs.&nbsp; I came out and sat down fiercely midway
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what we do with girls in
Europe,&rdquo; I began in a grimly matter-of-fact tone.&nbsp; I
think Miss Jacobus was disconcerted by my sudden
appearance.&nbsp; I turned upon her with cold ferocity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to objectionable old women, they are first strangled
quietly, then cut up into small pieces and thrown away, a bit
here and a bit there.&nbsp; They vanish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot go so far as to say I had terrified her.&nbsp; But
she was troubled by my truculence, the more so because I had been
always addressing her with a politeness she did not
deserve.&nbsp; Her plump, knitting hands fell slowly on her
knees.&nbsp; She said not a word while I fixed her with severe
determination.&nbsp; Then as I turned away from her at last, she
laid down her work gently and, with noiseless movements,
retreated from the verandah.&nbsp; In fact, she vanished.</p>
<p>But I was not thinking of her.&nbsp; I was looking at the
girl.&nbsp; It was what I was coming for daily; troubled,
ashamed, eager; finding in my nearness to her a unique sensation
which I indulged with dread, self-contempt, and deep pleasure, as
if it were a secret vice bound to end in my undoing, like the
habit of some drug or other which ruins and degrades its
slave.</p>
<p>I looked her over, from the top of her dishevelled head, down
the lovely line of the shoulder, following the curve of the hip,
the draped form of the long limb, right down to her fine ankle
below a torn, soiled flounce; and as far as the point of the
shabby, high-heeled, blue slipper, dangling from her well-shaped
foot, which she moved slightly, with quick, nervous jerks, as if
impatient of my presence.&nbsp; And in the scent of the massed
flowers I seemed to breathe her special and inexplicable charm,
the heady perfume of the everlastingly irritated captive of the
garden.</p>
<p>I looked at her rounded chin, the Jacobus chin; at the full,
red lips pouting in the powdered, sallow face; at the firm
modelling of the cheek, the grains of white in the hairs of the
straight sombre eyebrows; at the long eyes, a narrowed gleam of
liquid white and intense motionless black, with their gaze so
empty of thought, and so absorbed in their fixity that she seemed
to be staring at her own lonely image, in some far-off mirror
hidden from my sight amongst the trees.</p>
<p>And suddenly, without looking at me, with the appearance of a
person speaking to herself, she asked, in that voice slightly
harsh yet mellow and always irritated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep on coming here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do I keep on coming here?&rdquo; I repeated, taken
by surprise.&nbsp; I could not have told her.&nbsp; I could not
even tell myself with sincerity why I was coming there.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of you asking a question like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is any good,&rdquo; she observed scornfully to
the empty air, her chin propped on her hand, that hand never
extended to any man, that no one had ever grasped&mdash;for I had
only grasped her shoulder once&mdash;that generous, fine,
somewhat masculine hand.&nbsp; I knew well the peculiarly
efficient shape&mdash;broad at the base, tapering at the
fingers&mdash;of that hand, for which there was nothing in the
world to lay hold of.&nbsp; I pretended to be playful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; But do you really care to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged indolently her magnificent shoulders, from which
the dingy thin wrapper was slipping a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;never mind&mdash;never mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something smouldering under those airs of
lassitude.&nbsp; She exasperated me by the provocation of her
nonchalance, by something elusive and defiant in her very form
which I wanted to seize.&nbsp; I said roughly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think I should tell you the
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes glided my way for a sidelong look, and she murmured,
moving only her full, pouting lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you would not dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine I am afraid of you?&nbsp; What on earth.
. . . Well, it&rsquo;s possible, after all, that I don&rsquo;t
know exactly why I am coming here.&nbsp; Let us say, with Miss
Jacobus, that it is for no good.&nbsp; You seem to believe the
outrageous things she says, if you do have a row with her now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snapped out viciously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else am I to believe?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I had to own, seeing her
suddenly very helpless and condemned to moral solitude by the
verdict of a respectable community.&nbsp; &ldquo;You might
believe me, if you chose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a slight movement and asked me at once, with an
effort as if making an experiment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the business between you and papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the nature of your father&rsquo;s
business?&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; He sells provisions to
ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She became rigid again in her crouching pose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that.&nbsp; What brings you here&mdash;to this
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose it&rsquo;s you?&nbsp; You would not call
that business?&nbsp; Would you?&nbsp; And now let us drop the
subject.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use.&nbsp; My ship will be ready for
sea the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She murmured a distinctly scared &ldquo;So soon,&rdquo; and
getting up quickly, went to the little table and poured herself a
glass of water.&nbsp; She walked with rapid steps and with an
indolent swaying of her whole young figure above the hips; when
she passed near me I felt with tenfold force the charm of the
peculiar, promising sensation I had formed the habit to seek near
her.&nbsp; I thought with sudden dismay that this was the end of
it; that after one more day I would be no longer able to come
into this verandah, sit on this chair, and taste perversely the
flavour of contempt in her indolent poses, drink in the
provocation of her scornful looks, and listen to the curt,
insolent remarks uttered in that harsh and seductive voice.&nbsp;
As if my innermost nature had been altered by the action of some
moral poison, I felt an abject dread of going to sea.</p>
<p>I had to exercise a sudden self-control, as one puts on a
brake, to prevent myself jumping up to stride about, shout,
gesticulate, make her a scene.&nbsp; What for?&nbsp; What
about?&nbsp; I had no idea.&nbsp; It was just the relief of
violence that I wanted; and I lolled back in my chair, trying to
keep my lips formed in a smile; that half-indulgent, half-mocking
smile which was my shield against the shafts of her contempt and
the insulting sallies flung at me by the old woman.</p>
<p>She drank the water at a draught, with the avidity of raging
thirst, and let herself fall on the nearest chair, as if utterly
overcome.&nbsp; Her attitude, like certain tones of her voice,
had in it something masculine: the knees apart in the ample
wrapper, the clasped hands hanging between them, her body leaning
forward, with drooping head.&nbsp; I stared at the heavy black
coil of twisted hair.&nbsp; It was enormous, crowning the bowed
head with a crushing and disdained glory.&nbsp; The escaped wisps
hung straight down.&nbsp; And suddenly I perceived that the girl
was trembling from head to foot, as though that glass of iced
water had chilled her to the bone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; I said, startled,
but in no very sympathetic mood.</p>
<p>She shook her bowed, overweighted head and cried in a stifled
voice but with a rising inflection:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away!&nbsp; Go away!&nbsp; Go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got up then and approached her, with a strange sort of
anxiety.&nbsp; I looked down at her round, strong neck, then
stooped low enough to peep at her face.&nbsp; And I began to
tremble a little myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you gone wild about, Miss Don&rsquo;t
Care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung herself backwards violently, her head going over the
back of the chair.&nbsp; And now it was her smooth, full,
palpitating throat that lay exposed to my bewildered stare.&nbsp;
Her eyes were nearly closed, with only a horrible white gleam
under the lids as if she were dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has come to you?&rdquo; I asked in awe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are you terrifying yourself with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pulled herself together, her eyes open frightfully wide
now.&nbsp; The tropical afternoon was lengthening the shadows on
the hot, weary earth, the abode of obscure desires, of
extravagant hopes, of unimaginable terrors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
after a gasp, she spoke with such frightful rapidity that I could
hardly make out the amazing words: &ldquo;For if you were to shut
me up in an empty place as smooth all round as the palm of my
hand, I could always strangle myself with my hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, doubting my ears, I let this inconceivable
declaration sink into me.&nbsp; It is ever impossible to guess at
the wild thoughts that pass through the heads of our
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; What monstrous imaginings of violence
could have dwelt under the low forehead of that girl who had been
taught to regard her father as &ldquo;capable of anything&rdquo;
more in the light of a misfortune than that of a disgrace; as,
evidently, something to be resented and feared rather than to be
ashamed of?&nbsp; She seemed, indeed, as unaware of shame as of
anything else in the world; but in her ignorance, her resentment
and fear took a childish and violent shape.</p>
<p>Of course she spoke without knowing the value of words.&nbsp;
What could she know of death&mdash;she who knew nothing of
life?&nbsp; It was merely as the proof of her being beside
herself with some odious apprehension, that this extraordinary
speech had moved me, not to pity, but to a fascinated, horrified
wonder.&nbsp; I had no idea what notion she had of her
danger.&nbsp; Some sort of abduction.&nbsp; It was quite possible
with the talk of that atrocious old woman.&nbsp; Perhaps she
thought she could be carried off, bound hand and foot and even
gagged.&nbsp; At that surmise I felt as if the door of a furnace
had been opened in front of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall
end by going crazy if you listen to that abominable old aunt of
yours&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I studied her haggard expression, her trembling lips.&nbsp;
Her cheeks even seemed sunk a little.&nbsp; But how I, the
associate of her disreputable father, the &ldquo;lowest of the
low&rdquo; from the criminal Europe, could manage to reassure her
I had no conception.&nbsp; She was exasperating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens and earth!&nbsp; What do you think I can
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chin certainly trembled.&nbsp; And she was looking at me
with extreme attention.&nbsp; I made a step nearer to her
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do nothing.&nbsp; I promise you that.&nbsp;
Will that do?&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; I shall do nothing
whatever, of any kind; and the day after to-morrow I shall be
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What else could I have said?&nbsp; She seemed to drink in my
words with the thirsty avidity with which she had emptied the
glass of water.&nbsp; She whispered tremulously, in that touching
tone I had heard once before on her lips, and which thrilled me
again with the same emotion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would believe you.&nbsp; But what about
papa&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be hanged!&rdquo;&nbsp; My emotion betrayed itself
by the brutality of my tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough
of your papa.&nbsp; Are you so stupid as to imagine that I am
frightened of him?&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t make me do
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that sounded feeble to me in the face of her
ignorance.&nbsp; But I must conclude that the &ldquo;accent of
sincerity&rdquo; has, as some people say, a really irresistible
power.&nbsp; The effect was far beyond my hopes,&mdash;and even
beyond my conception.&nbsp; To watch the change in the girl was
like watching a miracle&mdash;the gradual but swift relaxation of
her tense glance, of her stiffened muscles, of every fibre of her
body.&nbsp; That black, fixed stare into which I had read a
tragic meaning more than once, in which I had found a sombre
seduction, was perfectly empty now, void of all consciousness
whatever, and not even aware any longer of my presence; it had
become a little sleepy, in the Jacobus fashion.</p>
<p>But, man being a perverse animal, instead of rejoicing at my
complete success, I beheld it with astounded and indignant
eyes.&nbsp; There was something cynical in that unconcealed
alteration, the true Jacobus shamelessness.&nbsp; I felt as
though I had been cheated in some rather complicated deal into
which I had entered against my better judgment.&nbsp; Yes,
cheated without any regard for, at least, the forms of
decency.</p>
<p>With an easy, indolent, and in its indolence supple, feline
movement, she rose from the chair, so provokingly ignoring me
now, that for very rage I held my ground within less than a foot
of her.&nbsp; Leisurely and tranquil, behaving right before me
with the ease of a person alone in a room, she extended her
beautiful arms, with her hands clenched, her body swaying, her
head thrown back a little, revelling contemptuously in a sense of
relief, easing her limbs in freedom after all these days of
crouching, motionless poses when she had been so furious and so
afraid.</p>
<p>All this with supreme indifference, incredible, offensive,
exasperating, like ingratitude doubled with treachery.</p>
<p>I ought to have been flattered, perhaps, but, on the contrary,
my anger grew; her movement to pass by me as if I were a wooden
post or a piece of furniture, that unconcerned movement brought
it to a head.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say I did not know what I was doing, but,
certainly, cool reflection had nothing to do with the
circumstance that next moment both my arms were round her
waist.&nbsp; It was an impulsive action, as one snatches at
something falling or escaping; and it had no hypocritical
gentleness about it either.&nbsp; She had no time to make a
sound, and the first kiss I planted on her closed lips was
vicious enough to have been a bite.</p>
<p>She did not resist, and of course I did not stop at one.&nbsp;
She let me go on, not as if she were inanimate&mdash;I felt her
there, close against me, young, full of vigour, of life, a strong
desirable creature, but as if she did not care in the least, in
the absolute assurance of her safety, what I did or left
undone.&nbsp; Our faces brought close together in this storm of
haphazard caresses, her big, black, wide-open eyes looked into
mine without the girl appearing either angry or pleased or moved
in any way.&nbsp; In that steady gaze which seemed impersonally
to watch my madness I could detect a slight surprise,
perhaps&mdash;nothing more.&nbsp; I showered kisses upon her face
and there did not seem to be any reason why this should not go on
for ever.</p>
<p>That thought flashed through my head, and I was on the point
of desisting, when, all at once, she began to struggle with a
sudden violence which all but freed her instantly, which revived
my exasperation with her, indeed a fierce desire never to let her
go any more.&nbsp; I tightened my embrace in time, gasping out:
&ldquo;No&mdash;you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; as if she were my mortal
enemy.&nbsp; On her part not a word was said.&nbsp; Putting her
hands against my chest, she pushed with all her might without
succeeding to break the circle of my arms.&nbsp; Except that she
seemed thoroughly awake now, her eyes gave me no clue
whatever.&nbsp; To meet her black stare was like looking into a
deep well, and I was totally unprepared for her change of
tactics.&nbsp; Instead of trying to tear my hands apart, she
flung herself upon my breast and with a downward, undulating,
serpentine motion, a quick sliding dive, she got away from me
smoothly.&nbsp; It was all very swift; I saw her pick up the tail
of her wrapper and run for the door at the end of the verandah
not very gracefully.&nbsp; She appeared to be limping a
little&mdash;and then she vanished; the door swung behind her so
noiselessly that I could not believe it was completely
closed.&nbsp; I had a distinct suspicion of her black eye being
at the crack to watch what I would do.&nbsp; I could not make up
my mind whether to shake my fist in that direction or blow a
kiss.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Either</span> would have been perfectly
consistent with my feelings.&nbsp; I gazed at the door,
hesitating, but in the end I did neither.&nbsp; The monition of
some sixth sense&mdash;the sense of guilt, maybe, that sense
which always acts too late, alas!&mdash;warned me to look round;
and at once I became aware that the conclusion of this tumultuous
episode was likely to be a matter of lively anxiety.&nbsp;
Jacobus was standing in the doorway of the dining-room.&nbsp; How
long he had been there it was impossible to guess; and
remembering my struggle with the girl I thought he must have been
its mute witness from beginning to end.&nbsp; But this
supposition seemed almost incredible.&nbsp; Perhaps that
impenetrable girl had heard him come in and had got away in
time.</p>
<p>He stepped on to the verandah in his usual manner, heavy-eyed,
with glued lips.&nbsp; I marvelled at the girl&rsquo;s
resemblance to this man.&nbsp; Those long, Egyptian eyes, that
low forehead of a stupid goddess, she had found in the sawdust of
the circus; but all the rest of the face, the design and the
modelling, the rounded chin, the very lips&mdash;all that was
Jacobus, fined down, more finished, more expressive.</p>
<p>His thick hand fell on and grasped with force the back of a
light chair (there were several standing about) and I perceived
the chance of a broken head at the end of all this&mdash;most
likely.&nbsp; My mortification was extreme.&nbsp; The scandal
would be horrible; that was unavoidable.&nbsp; But how to act so
as to satisfy myself I did not know.&nbsp; I stood on my guard
and at any rate faced him.&nbsp; There was nothing else for
it.&nbsp; Of one thing I was certain, that, however brazen my
attitude, it could never equal the characteristic Jacobus
impudence.</p>
<p>He gave me his melancholy, glued smile and sat down.&nbsp; I
own I was relieved.&nbsp; The perspective of passing from kisses
to blows had nothing particularly attractive in it.&nbsp;
Perhaps&mdash;perhaps he had seen nothing?&nbsp; He behaved as
usual, but he had never before found me alone on the
verandah.&nbsp; If he had alluded to it, if he had asked:
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Alice?&rdquo; or something of the sort, I
would have been able to judge from the tone.&nbsp; He would give
me no opportunity.&nbsp; The striking peculiarity was that he had
never looked up at me yet.&nbsp; &ldquo;He knows,&rdquo; I said
to myself confidently.&nbsp; And my contempt for him relieved my
disgust with myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are early home,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are very quiet; nothing doing at the store
to-day,&rdquo; he explained with a cast-down air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know, I am off,&rdquo; I said, feeling
that this, perhaps, was the best thing to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he breathed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Day after
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not what I had meant; but as he gazed persistently on
the floor, I followed the direction of his glance.&nbsp; In the
absolute stillness of the house we stared at the high-heeled
slipper the girl had lost in her flight.&nbsp; We stared.&nbsp;
It lay overturned.</p>
<p>After what seemed a very long time to me, Jacobus hitched his
chair forward, stooped with extended arm and picked it up.&nbsp;
It looked a slender thing in his big, thick hands.&nbsp; It was
not really a slipper, but a low shoe of blue, glazed kid, rubbed
and shabby.&nbsp; It had straps to go over the instep, but the
girl only thrust her feet in, after her slovenly manner.&nbsp;
Jacobus raised his eyes from the shoe to look at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Captain,&rdquo; he said at last, in his
subdued tone.</p>
<p>As if the sight of that shoe had renewed the spell, I gave up
suddenly the idea of leaving the house there and then.&nbsp; It
had become impossible.&nbsp; I sat down, keeping my eyes on the
fascinating object.&nbsp; Jacobus turned his daughter&rsquo;s
shoe over and over in his cushioned paws as if studying the way
the thing was made.&nbsp; He contemplated the thin sole for a
time; then glancing inside with an absorbed air:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I found you here, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered this by some sort of grunt, watching him
covertly.&nbsp; Then I added: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have much
more of me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still deep in the interior of that shoe on which my
eyes too were resting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought any more of this deal in potatoes I
spoke to you about the other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I answered curtly.&nbsp; He
checked my movement to rise by an austere, commanding gesture of
the hand holding that fatal shoe.&nbsp; I remained seated and
glared at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t
trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to, Captain.&nbsp; You ought to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reflected.&nbsp; If I left that house now I would never see
the girl again.&nbsp; And I felt I must see her once more, if
only for an instant.&nbsp; It was a need, not to be reasoned
with, not to be disregarded.&nbsp; No, I did not want to go
away.&nbsp; I wanted to stay for one more experience of that
strange provoking sensation and of indefinite desire, the habit
of which had made me&mdash;me of all people!&mdash;dread the
prospect of going to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jacobus,&rdquo; I pronounced slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you really think that upon the whole and taking
various&rsquo; matters into consideration&mdash;I mean
everything, do you understand?&mdash;it would be a good thing for
me to trade, let us say, with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I waited for a while.&nbsp; He went on looking at the shoe
which he held now crushed in the middle, the worn point of the
toe and the high heel protruding on each side of his heavy
fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all right,&rdquo; he said, facing me
squarely at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it quite correct,
Captain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had uttered his habitual phrases in his
usual placid, breath-saving voice and stood my hard, inquisitive
stare sleepily without as much as a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us trade,&rdquo; I said, turning my shoulder
to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see you are bent on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not want an open scandal, but I thought that outward
decency may be bought too dearly at times.&nbsp; I included
Jacobus, myself, the whole population of the island, in the same
contemptuous disgust as though we had been partners in an ignoble
transaction.&nbsp; And the remembered vision at sea, diaphanous
and blue, of the Pearl of the Ocean at sixty miles off; the
unsubstantial, clear marvel of it as if evoked by the art of a
beautiful and pure magic, turned into a thing of horrors
too.&nbsp; Was this the fortune this vaporous and rare apparition
had held for me in its hard heart, hidden within the shape as of
fair dreams and mist?&nbsp; Was this my luck?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&rdquo;&mdash;Jacobus became suddenly audible
after what seemed the silence of vile
meditation&mdash;&ldquo;that you might conveniently take some
thirty tons.&nbsp; That would be about the lot,
Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it?&nbsp; The lot!&nbsp; I dare say it would be
convenient, but I haven&rsquo;t got enough money for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never seen him so animated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed with what I took for the accent
of grim menace.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
paused, then, unrelenting: &ldquo;How much money have you got,
Captain?&rdquo; he inquired with awful directness.</p>
<p>It was my turn to face him squarely.&nbsp; I did so and
mentioned the amount I could dispose of.&nbsp; And I perceived
that he was disappointed.&nbsp; He thought it over, his
calculating gaze lost in mine, for quite a long time before he
came out in a thoughtful tone with the rapacious suggestion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could draw some more from your charterers.&nbsp;
That would be quite easy, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I retorted
brusquely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve drawn my salary up to date,
and besides, the ship&rsquo;s accounts are closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was growing furious.&nbsp; I pursued: &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll
tell you what: if I could do it I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then throwing off all restraint, I added: &ldquo;You are a bit
too much of a Jacobus, Mr. Jacobus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone alone was insulting enough, but he remained tranquil,
only a little puzzled, till something seemed to dawn upon him;
but the unwonted light in his eyes died out instantly.&nbsp; As a
Jacobus on his native heath, what a mere skipper chose to say
could not touch him, outcast as he was.&nbsp; As a ship-chandler
he could stand anything.&nbsp; All I caught of his mumble was a
vague&mdash;&ldquo;quite correct,&rdquo; than which nothing could
have been more egregiously false at bottom&mdash;to my view, at
least.&nbsp; But I remembered&mdash;I had never
forgotten&mdash;that I must see the girl.&nbsp; I did not mean to
go.&nbsp; I meant to stay in the house till I had seen her once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; I said finally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
take as many of your confounded potatoes as my money will buy, on
condition that you go off at once down to the wharf to see them
loaded in the lighter and sent alongside the ship straight
away.&nbsp; Take the invoice and a signed receipt with you.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s the key of my desk.&nbsp; Give it to Burns.&nbsp; He
will pay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up from his chair before I had finished speaking, but
he refused to take the key.&nbsp; Burns would never do it.&nbsp;
He wouldn&rsquo;t like to ask him even.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; I said, eyeing him slightingly,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing for it, Mr. Jacobus, but you must
wait on board till I come off to settle with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all right, Captain.&nbsp; I will go at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed at a loss what to do with the girl&rsquo;s shoe he
was still holding in his fist.&nbsp; Finally, looking dully at
me, he put it down on the chair from which he had risen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Captain?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you come along,
too, just to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take care
of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remained perplexed for a moment, as if trying to
understand; and then his weighty: &ldquo;Certainly, certainly,
Captain,&rdquo; seemed to be the outcome of some sudden
thought.&nbsp; His big chest heaved.&nbsp; Was it a sigh?&nbsp;
As he went out to hurry off those potatoes he never looked back
at me.</p>
<p>I waited till the noise of his footsteps had died out of the
dining-room, and I waited a little longer.&nbsp; Then turning
towards the distant door I raised my voice along the
verandah:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing answered me, not even a stir behind the door.&nbsp;
Jacobus&rsquo;s house might have been made empty for me to make
myself at home in.&nbsp; I did not call again.&nbsp; I had become
aware of a great discouragement.&nbsp; I was mentally jaded,
morally dejected.&nbsp; I turned to the garden again, sitting
down with my elbows spread on the low balustrade, and took my
head in my hands.</p>
<p>The evening closed upon me.&nbsp; The shadows lengthened,
deepened, mingled together into a pool of twilight in which the
flower-beds glowed like coloured embers; whiffs of heavy scent
came to me as if the dusk of this hemisphere were but the dimness
of a temple and the garden an enormous censer swinging before the
altar of the stars.&nbsp; The colours of the blossoms deepened,
losing their glow one by one.</p>
<p>The girl, when I turned my head at a slight noise, appeared to
me very tall and slender, advancing with a swaying limp, a
floating and uneven motion which ended in the sinking of her
shadowy form into the deep low chair.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t
know why or whence I received the impression that she had come
too late.&nbsp; She ought to have appeared at my call.&nbsp; She
ought to have . . . It was as if a supreme opportunity had been
missed.</p>
<p>I rose and took a seat close to her, nearly opposite her
arm-chair.&nbsp; Her ever discontented voice addressed me at
once, contemptuously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pitched mine low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come out at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to look for my shoe&mdash;before they bring in
the lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was her harsh, enticing whisper, subdued, not very steady,
but its low tremulousness gave me no thrill now.&nbsp; I could
only make out the oval of her face, her uncovered throat, the
long, white gleam of her eyes.&nbsp; She was mysterious
enough.&nbsp; Her hands were resting on the arms of the
chair.&nbsp; But where was the mysterious and provoking sensation
which was like the perfume of her flower-like youth?&nbsp; I said
quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got your shoe here.&rdquo;&nbsp; She made no
sound and I continued: &ldquo;You had better give me your foot
and I will put it on for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no movement.&nbsp; I bent low down and groped for her
foot under the flounces of the wrapper.&nbsp; She did not
withdraw it and I put on the shoe, buttoning the
instep-strap.&nbsp; It was an inanimate foot.&nbsp; I lowered it
gently to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you buttoned the strap you would not be losing your
shoe, Miss Don&rsquo;t Care,&rdquo; I said, trying to be playful
without conviction.&nbsp; I felt more like wailing over the lost
illusion of vague desire, over the sudden conviction that I would
never find again near her the strange, half-evil, half-tender
sensation which had given its acrid flavour to so many days,
which had made her appear tragic and promising, pitiful and
provoking.&nbsp; That was all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father picked it up,&rdquo; I said, thinking she
may just as well be told of the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of papa&mdash;by himself,&rdquo; she
declared scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only in conjunction with his
disreputable associates, strangers, the &lsquo;riff-raff of
Europe&rsquo; as your charming aunt or great-aunt says&mdash;men
like me, for instance&mdash;that you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of you,&rdquo; she snapped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know that I am now
doing business with your father.&nbsp; Yes, I am in fact doing
exactly what he wants me to do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve broken my
promise to you.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the sort of man I am.&nbsp;
And now&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you afraid?&nbsp; If you believe what
that dear, kind, truthful old lady says you ought to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with unexpected modulated softness that the
affirmed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I am not afraid.&rdquo;&nbsp; She hesitated.
. . . &ldquo;Not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; I shall
not see you again before I go to sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; I rose and
stood near her chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I shall often think of you
in this old garden, passing under the trees over there, walking
between these gorgeous flower-beds.&nbsp; You must love this
garden&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard in her sullen tone the faint echo of that resentfully
tragic note which I had found once so provoking.&nbsp; But it
left me unmoved except for a sudden and weary conviction of the
emptiness of all things under Heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Alice,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She did not answer, she did not move.&nbsp; To merely take her
hand, shake it, and go away seemed impossible, almost
improper.&nbsp; I stooped without haste and pressed my lips to
her smooth forehead.&nbsp; This was the moment when I realised
clearly with a sort of terror my complete detachment from that
unfortunate creature.&nbsp; And as I lingered in that cruel
self-knowledge I felt the light touch of her arms falling
languidly on my neck and received a hasty, awkward, haphazard
kiss which missed my lips.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; She was not afraid;
but I was no longer moved.&nbsp; Her arms slipped off my neck
slowly, she made no sound, the deep wicker arm-chair creaked
slightly; only a sense of my dignity prevented me fleeing
headlong from that catastrophic revelation.</p>
<p>I traversed the dining-room slowly.&nbsp; I thought:
She&rsquo;s listening to my footsteps; she can&rsquo;t help it;
she&rsquo;ll hear me open and shut that door.&nbsp; And I closed
it as gently behind me as if I had been a thief retreating with
his ill-gotten booty.&nbsp; During that stealthy act I
experienced the last touch of emotion in that house, at the
thought of the girl I had left sitting there in the obscurity,
with her heavy hair and empty eyes as black as the night itself,
staring into the walled garden, silent, warm, odorous with the
perfume of imprisoned flowers, which, like herself, were lost to
sight in a world buried in darkness.</p>
<p>The narrow, ill-lighted, rustic streets I knew so well on my
way to the harbour were extremely quiet.&nbsp; I felt in my heart
that the further one ventures the better one understands how
everything in our life is common, short, and empty; that it is in
seeking the unknown in our sensations that we discover how
mediocre are our attempts and how soon defeated!&nbsp;
Jacobus&rsquo;s boatman was waiting at the steps with an unusual
air of readiness.&nbsp; He put me alongside the ship, but did not
give me his confidential &ldquo;Good-evening, sah,&rdquo; and,
instead of shoving off at once, remained holding by the
ladder.</p>
<p>I was a thousand miles from commercial affairs, when on the
dark quarter-deck Mr. Burns positively rushed at me, stammering
with excitement.&nbsp; He had been pacing the deck distractedly
for hours awaiting my arrival.&nbsp; Just before sunset a lighter
loaded with potatoes had come alongside with that fat
ship-chandler himself sitting on the pile of sacks.&nbsp; He was
now stuck immovable in the cabin.&nbsp; What was the meaning of
it all?&nbsp; Surely I did not&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Burns, I did,&rdquo; I cut him short.&nbsp; He
was beginning to make gestures of despair when I stopped that,
too, by giving him the key of my desk and desiring him, in a tone
which admitted of no argument, to go below at once, pay Mr.
Jacobus&rsquo;s bill, and send him out of the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see him,&rdquo; I confessed
frankly, climbing the poop-ladder.&nbsp; I felt extremely
tired.&nbsp; Dropping on the seat of the skylight, I gave myself
up to idle gazing at the lights about the quay and at the black
mass of the mountain on the south side of the harbour.&nbsp; I
never heard Jacobus leave the ship with every single sovereign of
my ready cash in his pocket.&nbsp; I never heard anything till, a
long time afterwards, Mr. Burns, unable to contain himself any
longer, intruded upon me with his ridiculously angry lamentations
at my weakness and good nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, there&rsquo;s plenty of room in the
after-hatch.&nbsp; But they are sure to go rotten down
there.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I never heard . . . seventeen
tons!&nbsp; I suppose I must hoist in that lot first thing
to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you must.&nbsp; Unless you drop them
overboard.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t do
that.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t mind myself, but it&rsquo;s
forbidden to throw rubbish into the harbour, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the truest word you have said for many a day,
sir&mdash;rubbish.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just what I expect they
are.&nbsp; Nearly eighty good gold sovereigns gone; a perfectly
clean sweep of your drawer, sir.&nbsp; Bless me if I
understand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it was impossible to throw the right light on this
commercial transaction I left him to his lamentations and under
the impression that I was a hopeless fool.&nbsp; Next day I did
not go ashore.&nbsp; For one thing, I had no money to go ashore
with&mdash;no, not enough to buy a cigarette.&nbsp; Jacobus had
made a clean sweep.&nbsp; But that was not the only reason.&nbsp;
The Pearl of the Ocean had in a few short hours grown odious to
me.&nbsp; And I did not want to meet any one.&nbsp; My reputation
had suffered.&nbsp; I knew I was the object of unkind and
sarcastic comments.</p>
<p>The following morning at sunrise, just as our stern-fasts had
been let go and the tug plucked us out from between the buoys, I
saw Jacobus standing up in his boat.&nbsp; The nigger was pulling
hard; several baskets of provisions for ships were stowed between
the thwarts.&nbsp; The father of Alice was going his morning
round.&nbsp; His countenance was tranquil and friendly.&nbsp; He
raised his arm and shouted something with great heartiness.&nbsp;
But his voice was of the sort that doesn&rsquo;t carry any
distance; all I could catch faintly, or rather guess at, were the
words &ldquo;next time&rdquo; and &ldquo;quite
correct.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was only of these last that I was
certain.&nbsp; Raising my arm perfunctorily for all response, I
turned away.&nbsp; I rather resented the familiarity of the
thing.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t I settled accounts finally with him by
means of that potato bargain?</p>
<p>This being a harbour story it is not my purpose to speak of
our passage.&nbsp; I was glad enough to be at sea, but not with
the gladness of old days.&nbsp; Formerly I had no memories to
take away with me.&nbsp; I shared in the blessed forgetfulness of
sailors, that forgetfulness natural and invincible, which
resembles innocence in so far that it prevents
self-examination.&nbsp; Now however I remembered the girl.&nbsp;
During the first few days I was for ever questioning myself as to
the nature of facts and sensations connected with her person and
with my conduct.</p>
<p>And I must say also that Mr. Burns&rsquo; intolerable fussing
with those potatoes was not calculated to make me forget the part
which I had played.&nbsp; He looked upon it as a purely
commercial transaction of a particularly foolish kind, and his
devotion&mdash;if it was devotion and not mere cussedness as I
came to regard it before long&mdash;inspired him with a zeal to
minimise my loss as much as possible.&nbsp; Oh, yes!&nbsp; He
took care of those infamous potatoes with a vengeance, as the
saying goes.</p>
<p>Everlastingly, there was a tackle over the after-hatch and
everlastingly the watch on deck were pulling up, spreading out,
picking over, rebagging, and lowering down again, some part of
that lot of potatoes.&nbsp; My bargain with all its remotest
associations, mental and visual&mdash;the garden of flowers and
scents, the girl with her provoking contempt and her tragic
loneliness of a hopeless castaway&mdash;was everlastingly dangled
before my eyes, for thousands of miles along the open sea.&nbsp;
And as if by a satanic refinement of irony it was accompanied by
a most awful smell.&nbsp; Whiffs from decaying potatoes pursued
me on the poop, they mingled with my thoughts, with my food,
poisoned my very dreams.&nbsp; They made an atmosphere of
corruption for the ship.</p>
<p>I remonstrated with Mr. Burns about this excessive care.&nbsp;
I would have been well content to batten the hatch down and let
them perish under the deck.</p>
<p>That perhaps would have been unsafe.&nbsp; The horrid
emanations might have flavoured the cargo of sugar.&nbsp; They
seemed strong enough to taint the very ironwork.&nbsp; In
addition Mr. Burns made it a personal matter.&nbsp; He assured me
he knew how to treat a cargo of potatoes at sea&mdash;had been in
the trade as a boy, he said.&nbsp; He meant to make my loss as
small as possible.&nbsp; What between his devotion&mdash;it must
have been devotion&mdash;and his vanity, I positively dared not
give him the order to throw my commercial-venture
overboard.&nbsp; I believe he would have refused point blank to
obey my lawful command.&nbsp; An unprecedented and comical
situation would have been created with which I did not feel equal
to deal.</p>
<p>I welcomed the coming of bad weather as no sailor had ever
done.&nbsp; When at last I hove the ship to, to pick up the pilot
outside Port Philip Heads, the after-hatch had not been opened
for more than a week and I might have believed that no such thing
as a potato had ever been on board.</p>
<p>It was an abominable day, raw, blustering, with great squalls
of wind and rain; the pilot, a cheery person, looked after the
ship and chatted to me, streaming from head to foot; and the
heavier the lash of the downpour the more pleased with himself
and everything around him he seemed to be.&nbsp; He rubbed his
wet hands with a satisfaction, which to me, who had stood that
kind of thing for several days and nights, seemed inconceivable
in any non-aquatic creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to enjoy getting wet, Pilot,&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>He had a bit of land round his house in the suburbs and it was
of his garden he was thinking.&nbsp; At the sound of the word
garden, unheard, unspoken for so many days, I had a vision of
gorgeous colour, of sweet scents, of a girlish figure crouching
in a chair.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That was a distinct emotion breaking
into the peace I had found in the sleepless anxieties of my
responsibility during a week of dangerous bad weather.&nbsp; The
Colony, the pilot explained, had suffered from unparalleled
drought.&nbsp; This was the first decent drop of water they had
had for seven months.&nbsp; The root crops were lost.&nbsp; And,
trying to be casual, but with visible interest, he asked me if I
had perchance any potatoes to spare.</p>
<p>Potatoes!&nbsp; I had managed to forget them.&nbsp; In a
moment I felt plunged into corruption up to my neck.&nbsp; Mr.
Burns was making eyes at me behind the pilot&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Finally, he obtained a ton, and paid ten pounds for it.&nbsp;
This was twice the price of my bargain with Jacobus.&nbsp; The
spirit of covetousness woke up in me.&nbsp; That night, in
harbour, before I slept, the Custom House galley came
alongside.&nbsp; While his underlings were putting seals on the
storerooms, the officer in charge took me aside
confidentially.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, Captain, you don&rsquo;t
happen to have any potatoes to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly there was a potato famine in the land.&nbsp; I let him
have a ton for twelve pounds and he went away joyfully.&nbsp;
That night I dreamt of a pile of gold in the form of a grave in
which a girl was buried, and woke up callous with greed.&nbsp; On
calling at my ship-broker&rsquo;s office, that man, after the
usual business had been transacted, pushed his spectacles up on
his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking, Captain, that coming from the Pearl of
the Ocean you may have some potatoes to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said negligently: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I could spare you a
ton.&nbsp; Fifteen pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He exclaimed: &ldquo;I say!&rdquo;&nbsp; But after studying my
face for a while accepted my terms with a faint grimace.&nbsp; It
seems that these people could not exist without potatoes.&nbsp; I
could.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to see a potato as long as I
lived; but the demon of lucre had taken possession of me.&nbsp;
How the news got about I don&rsquo;t know, but, returning on
board rather late, I found a small group of men of the coster
type hanging about the waist, while Mr. Burns walked to and fro
the quarterdeck loftily, keeping a triumphant eye on them.&nbsp;
They had come to buy potatoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These chaps have been waiting here in the sun for
hours,&rdquo; Burns whispered to me excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
have drank the water-cask dry.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you throw away
your chances, sir.&nbsp; You are too good-natured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I selected a man with thick legs and a man with a cast in his
eye to negotiate with; simply because they were easily
distinguishable from the rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have the money on
you?&rdquo; I inquired, before taking them down into the
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; they answered in one voice, slapping
their pockets.&nbsp; I liked their air of quiet
determination.&nbsp; Long before the end of the day all the
potatoes were sold at about three times the price I had paid for
them.&nbsp; Mr. Burns, feverish and exulting, congratulated
himself on his skilful care of my commercial venture, but hinted
plainly that I ought to have made more of it.</p>
<p>That night I did not sleep very well.&nbsp; I thought of
Jacobus by fits and starts, between snatches of dreams concerned
with castaways starving on a desert island covered with
flowers.&nbsp; It was extremely unpleasant.&nbsp; In the morning,
tired and unrefreshed, I sat down and wrote a long letter to my
owners, giving them a carefully-thought-out scheme for the
ship&rsquo;s employment in the East and about the China Seas for
the next two years.&nbsp; I spent the day at that task and felt
somewhat more at peace when it was done.</p>
<p>Their reply came in due course.&nbsp; They were greatly struck
with my project; but considering that, notwithstanding the
unfortunate difficulty with the bags (which they trusted I would
know how to guard against in the future), the voyage showed a
very fair profit, they thought it would be better to keep the
ship in the sugar trade&mdash;at least for the present.</p>
<p>I turned over the page and read on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had a letter from our good friend Mr.
Jacobus.&nbsp; We are pleased to see how well you have hit it off
with him; for, not to speak of his assistance in the unfortunate
matter of the bags, he writes us that should you, by using all
possible dispatch, manage to bring the ship back early in the
season he would be able to give us a good rate of freight.&nbsp;
We have no doubt that your best endeavours . . . etc. . .
etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dropped the letter and sat motionless for a long time.&nbsp;
Then I wrote my answer (it was a short one) and went ashore
myself to post it.&nbsp; But I passed one letter-box, then
another, and in the end found myself going up Collins Street with
the letter still in my pocket&mdash;against my heart.&nbsp;
Collins Street at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon is not
exactly a desert solitude; but I had never felt more isolated
from the rest of mankind as when I walked that day its crowded
pavement, battling desperately with my thoughts and feeling
already vanquished.</p>
<p>There came a moment when the awful tenacity of Jacobus, the
man of one passion and of one idea, appeared to me almost
heroic.&nbsp; He had not given me up.&nbsp; He had gone again to
his odious brother.&nbsp; And then he appeared to me odious
himself.&nbsp; Was it for his own sake or for the sake of the
poor girl?&nbsp; And on that last supposition the memory of the
kiss which missed my lips appalled me; for whatever he had seen,
or guessed at, or risked, he knew nothing of that.&nbsp; Unless
the girl had told him.&nbsp; How could I go back to fan that
fatal spark with my cold breath?&nbsp; No, no, that unexpected
kiss had to be paid for at its full price.</p>
<p>At the first letter-box I came to I stopped and reaching into
my breast-pocket I took out the letter&mdash;it was as if I were
plucking out my very heart&mdash;and dropped it through the
slit.&nbsp; Then I went straight on board.</p>
<p>I wondered what dreams I would have that night; but as it
turned out I did not sleep at all.&nbsp; At breakfast I informed
Mr. Burns that I had resigned my command.</p>
<p>He dropped his knife and fork and looked at me with
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, sir!&nbsp; I thought you loved the
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do, Burns,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the
fact is that the Indian Ocean and everything that is in it has
lost its charm for me.&nbsp; I am going home as passenger by the
Suez Canal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything that is in it,&rdquo; he repeated
angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard anybody talk like
this.&nbsp; And to tell you the truth, sir, all the time we have
been together I&rsquo;ve never quite made you out.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s one ocean more than another?&nbsp; Charm,
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was really devoted to me, I believe.&nbsp; But he cheered
up when I told him that I had recommended him for my
successor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;let people say what
they like, this Jacobus has served your turn.&nbsp; I must admit
that this potato business has paid extremely well.&nbsp; Of
course, if only you had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Burns,&rdquo; I interrupted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quite a smile of fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I could not tell him that it was driving me out of the
ship I had learned to love.&nbsp; And as I sat heavy-hearted at
that parting, seeing all my plans destroyed, my modest future
endangered&mdash;for this command was like a foot in the stirrup
for a young man&mdash;he gave up completely for the first time
his critical attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful piece of luck!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h2><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>THE
SECRET SHARER<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AN EPISODE FROM THE COAST</span></h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> my right hand there were lines
of fishing-stakes resembling a mysterious system of
half-submerged bamboo fences, incomprehensible in its division of
the domain of tropical fishes, and crazy of aspect as if
abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen now gone to
the other end of the ocean; for there was no sign of human
habitation as far as the eye could reach.&nbsp; To the left a
group of barren islets, suggesting ruins of stone walls, towers,
and blockhouses, had its foundations set in a blue sea that
itself looked solid, so still and stable did it lie below my
feet; even the track of light from the westering sun shone
smoothly, without that animated glitter which tells of an
imperceptible ripple.&nbsp; And when I turned my head to take a
parting glance at the tug which had just left us anchored outside
the bar, I saw the straight line of the flat shore joined to the
stable sea, edge to edge, with a perfect and unmarked closeness,
in one levelled floor half brown, half blue under the enormous
dome of the sky.&nbsp; Corresponding in their insignificance to
the islets of the sea, two small clumps of trees, one on each
side of the only fault in the impeccable joint, marked the mouth
of the river Meinam we had just left on the first preparatory
stage of our homeward journey; and, far back on the inland level,
a larger and loftier mass, the grove surrounding the great Paknam
pagoda, was the only thing on which the eye could rest from the
vain task of exploring the monotonous sweep of the horizon.&nbsp;
Here and there gleams as of a few scattered pieces of silver
marked the windings of the great river; and on the nearest of
them, just within the bar, the tug steaming right into the land
became lost to my sight, hull and funnel and masts, as though the
impassive earth had swallowed her up without an effort, without a
tremor.&nbsp; My eye followed the light cloud of her smoke, now
here, now there, above the plain, according to the devious curves
of the stream, but always fainter and farther away, till I lost
it at last behind the mitre-shaped hill of the great
pagoda.&nbsp; And then I was left alone with my ship, anchored at
the head of the Gulf of Siam.</p>
<p>She floated at the starting-point of a long journey, very
still in an immense stillness, the shadows of her spars flung far
to the eastward by the setting sun.&nbsp; At that moment I was
alone on her decks.&nbsp; There was not a sound in her&mdash;and
around us nothing moved, nothing lived, not a canoe on the water,
not a bird in the air, not a cloud in the sky.&nbsp; In this
breathless pause at the threshold of a long passage we seemed to
be measuring our fitness for a long and arduous enterprise, the
appointed task of both our existences to be carried out, far from
all human eyes, with only sky and sea for spectators and for
judges.</p>
<p>There must have been some glare in the air to interfere with
one&rsquo;s sight, because it was only just before the sun left
us that my roaming eyes made out beyond the highest ridge of the
principal islet of the group something which did away with the
solemnity of perfect solitude.&nbsp; The tide of darkness flowed
on swiftly; and with tropical suddenness a swarm of stars came
out above the shadowy earth, while I lingered yet, my hand
resting lightly on my ship&rsquo;s rail as if on the shoulder of
a trusted friend.&nbsp; But, with all that multitude of celestial
bodies staring down at one, the comfort of quiet communion with
her was gone for good.&nbsp; And there were also disturbing
sounds by this time&mdash;voices, footsteps forward; the steward
flitted along the maindeck, a busily ministering spirit; a
hand-bell tinkled urgently under the poop-deck. . . .</p>
<p>I found my two officers waiting for me near the supper table,
in the lighted cuddy.&nbsp; We sat down at once, and as I helped
the chief mate, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you aware that there is a ship anchored inside the
islands?&nbsp; I saw her mastheads above the ridge as the sun
went down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised sharply his simple face, overcharged by a terrible
growth of whisker, and emitted his usual ejaculations:
&ldquo;Bless my soul, sir!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t say
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My second mate was a round-cheeked, silent young man, grave
beyond his years, I thought; but as our eyes happened to meet I
detected a slight quiver on his lips.&nbsp; I looked down at
once.&nbsp; It was not my part to encourage sneering on board my
ship.&nbsp; It must be said, too, that I knew very little of my
officers.&nbsp; In consequence of certain events of no particular
significance, except to myself, I had been appointed to the
command only a fortnight before.&nbsp; Neither did I know much of
the hands forward.&nbsp; All these people had been together for
eighteen months or so, and my position was that of the only
stranger on board.&nbsp; I mention this because it has some
bearing on what is to follow.&nbsp; But what I felt most was my
being a stranger to the ship; and if all the truth must be told,
I was somewhat of a stranger to myself.&nbsp; The youngest man on
board (barring the second mate), and untried as yet by a position
of the fullest responsibility, I was willing to take the adequacy
of the others for granted.&nbsp; They had simply to be equal to
their tasks; but I wondered how far I should turn out faithful to
that ideal conception of one&rsquo;s own personality every man
sets up for himself secretly.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Meantime the chief mate, with an almost visible effect of
collaboration on the part of his round eyes and frightful
whiskers, was trying to evolve a theory of the anchored
ship.&nbsp; His dominant trait was to take all things into
earnest consideration.&nbsp; He was of a painstaking turn of
mind.&nbsp; As he used to say, he &ldquo;liked to account to
himself&rdquo; for practically everything that came in his way,
down to a miserable scorpion he had found in his cabin a week
before.&nbsp; The why and the wherefore of that
scorpion&mdash;how it got on board and came to select his room
rather than the pantry (which was a dark place and more what a
scorpion would be partial to), and how on earth it managed to
drown itself in the inkwell of his writing-desk&mdash;had
exercised him infinitely.&nbsp; The ship within the islands was
much more easily accounted for; and just as we were about to rise
from table he made his pronouncement.&nbsp; She was, he doubted
not, a ship from home lately arrived.&nbsp; Probably she drew too
much water to cross the bar except at the top of spring
tides.&nbsp; Therefore she went into that natural harbour to wait
for a few days in preference to remaining in an open
roadstead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; confirmed the second mate,
suddenly, in his slightly hoarse voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;She draws
over twenty feet.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the Liverpool ship
<i>Sephora</i> with a cargo of coal.&nbsp; Hundred and
twenty-three days from Cardiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tugboat skipper told me when he came on board for
your letters, sir,&rdquo; explained the young man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He expects to take her up the river the day after
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After thus overwhelming us with the extent of his information
he slipped out of the cabin.&nbsp; The mate observed regretfully
that he &ldquo;could not account for that young fellow&rsquo;s
whims.&rdquo;&nbsp; What prevented him telling us all about it at
once, he wanted to know.</p>
<p>I detained him as he was making a move.&nbsp; For the last two
days the crew had had plenty of hard work, and the night before
they had very little sleep.&nbsp; I felt painfully that I&mdash;a
stranger&mdash;was doing something unusual when I directed him to
let all hands turn in without setting an anchor-watch.&nbsp; I
proposed to keep on deck myself till one o&rsquo;clock or
thereabouts.&nbsp; I would get the second mate to relieve me at
that hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will turn out the cook and the steward at
four,&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;and then give you a call.&nbsp;
Of course at the slightest sign of any sort of wind we&rsquo;ll
have the hands up and make a start at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He concealed his astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Outside the cuddy he put his head in the second
mate&rsquo;s door to inform him of my unheard-of caprice to take
a five hours&rsquo; anchor-watch on myself.&nbsp; I heard the
other raise his voice incredulously&mdash;&ldquo;What?&nbsp; The
captain himself?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then a few more murmurs, a door
closed, then another.&nbsp; A few moments later I went on
deck.</p>
<p>My strangeness, which had made me sleepless, had prompted that
unconventional arrangement, as if I had expected in those
solitary hours of the night to get on terms with the ship of
which I knew nothing, manned by men of whom I knew very little
more.&nbsp; Fast alongside a wharf, littered like any ship in
port with a tangle of unrelated things, invaded by unrelated
shore people, I had hardly seen her yet properly.&nbsp; Now, as
she lay cleared for sea, the stretch of her maindeck seemed to me
very fine under the stars.&nbsp; Very fine, very roomy for her
size, and very inviting.&nbsp; I descended the poop and paced the
waist, my mind picturing to myself the coming passage through the
Malay Archipelago, down the Indian Ocean, and up the
Atlantic.&nbsp; All its phases were familiar enough to me, every
characteristic, all the alternatives which were likely to face me
on the high seas&mdash;everything! . . . except the novel
responsibility of command.&nbsp; But I took heart from the
reasonable thought that the ship was like other ships, the men
like other men, and that the sea was not likely to keep any
special surprises expressly for my discomfiture.</p>
<p>Arrived at that comforting conclusion, I bethought myself of a
cigar and went below to get it.&nbsp; All was still down
there.&nbsp; Everybody at the after end of the ship was sleeping
profoundly.&nbsp; I came out again on the quarter-deck, agreeably
at ease in my sleeping-suit on that warm breathless night,
barefooted, a glowing cigar in my teeth, and, going forward, I
was met by the profound silence of the fore end of the
ship.&nbsp; Only as I passed the door of the forecastle I heard a
deep, quiet, trustful sigh of some sleeper inside.&nbsp; And
suddenly I rejoiced in the great security of the sea as compared
with the unrest of the land, in my choice of that untempted life
presenting no disquieting problems, invested with an elementary
moral beauty by the absolute straightforwardness of its appeal
and by the singleness of its purpose.</p>
<p>The riding-light in the fore-rigging burned with a clear,
untroubled, as if symbolic, flame, confident and bright in the
mysterious shades of the night.&nbsp; Passing on my way aft along
the other side of the ship, I observed that the rope side-ladder,
put over, no doubt, for the master of the tug when he came to
fetch away our letters, had not been hauled in as it should have
been.&nbsp; I became annoyed at this, for exactitude in small
matters is the very soul of discipline.&nbsp; Then I reflected
that I had myself peremptorily dismissed my officers from duty,
and by my own act had prevented the anchor-watch being formally
set and things properly attended to.&nbsp; I asked myself whether
it was wise ever to interfere with the established routine of
duties even from the kindest of motives.&nbsp; My action might
have made me appear eccentric.&nbsp; Goodness only knew how that
absurdly whiskered mate would &ldquo;account&rdquo; for my
conduct, and what the whole ship thought of that informality of
their new captain.&nbsp; I was vexed with myself.</p>
<p>Not from compunction certainly, but, as it were mechanically,
I proceeded to get the ladder in myself.&nbsp; Now a side-ladder
of that sort is a light affair and comes in easily, yet my
vigorous tug, which should have brought it flying on board,
merely recoiled upon my body in a totally unexpected jerk.&nbsp;
What the devil! . . . I was so astounded by the immovableness of
that ladder that I remained stock-still, trying to account for it
to myself like that imbecile mate of mine.&nbsp; In the end, of
course, I put my head over the rail.</p>
<p>The side of the ship made an opaque belt of shadow on the
darkling glassy shimmer of the sea.&nbsp; But I saw at once
something elongated and pale floating very close to the
ladder.&nbsp; Before I could form a guess a faint flash of
phosphorescent light, which seemed to issue suddenly from the
naked body of a man, flickered in the sleeping water with the
elusive, silent play of summer lightning in a night sky.&nbsp;
With a gasp I saw revealed to my stare a pair of feet, the long
legs, a broad livid back immersed right up to the neck in a
greenish cadaverous glow.&nbsp; One hand, awash, clutched the
bottom rung of the ladder.&nbsp; He was complete but for the
head.&nbsp; A headless corpse!&nbsp; The cigar dropped out of my
gaping mouth with a tiny plop and a short hiss quite audible in
the absolute stillness of all things under heaven.&nbsp; At that
I suppose he raised up his face, a dimly pale oval in the shadow
of the ship&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; But even then I could only barely
make out down there the shape of his black-haired head.&nbsp;
However, it was enough for the horrid, frost-bound sensation
which had gripped me about the chest to pass off.&nbsp; The
moment of vain exclamations was past, too.&nbsp; I only climbed
on the spare spar and leaned over the rail as far as I could, to
bring my eyes nearer to that mystery floating alongside.</p>
<p>As he hung by the ladder, like a resting swimmer, the
sea-lightning played about his limbs at every stir; and he
appeared in it ghastly, silvery, fish-like.&nbsp; He remained as
mute as a fish, too.&nbsp; He made no motion to get out of the
water, either.&nbsp; It was inconceivable that he should not
attempt to come on board, and strangely troubling to suspect that
perhaps he did not want to.&nbsp; And my first words were
prompted by just that troubled incertitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked in my ordinary
tone, speaking down to the face upturned exactly under mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cramp,&rdquo; it answered, no louder.&nbsp; Then
slightly anxious, &ldquo;I say, no need to call any
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not going to,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone on deck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had somehow the impression that he was on the point of
letting go the ladder to swim away beyond my ken&mdash;mysterious
as he came.&nbsp; But, for the moment, this being appearing as if
he had risen from the bottom of the sea (it was certainly the
nearest land to the ship) wanted only to know the time.&nbsp; I
told him.&nbsp; And he, down there, tentatively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your captain&rsquo;s turned in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He seemed to struggle with himself, for I heard something like
the low, bitter murmur of doubt.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
good?&rdquo;&nbsp; His next words came out with a hesitating
effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, my man.&nbsp; Could you call him out
quietly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought the time had come to declare myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> am the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard a &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; whispered at the level of the
water.&nbsp; The phosphorescence flashed in the swirl of the
water all about his limbs, his other hand seized the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Leggatt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was calm and resolute.&nbsp; A good voice.&nbsp; The
self-possession of that man had somehow induced a corresponding
state in myself.&nbsp; It was very quietly that I remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be a good swimmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been in the water practically
since nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The question for me now is
whether I am to let go this ladder and go on swimming till I sink
from exhaustion, or&mdash;to come on board here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt this was no mere formula of desperate speech, but a
real alternative in the view of a strong soul.&nbsp; I should
have gathered from this that he was young; indeed, it is only the
young who are ever confronted by such clear issues.&nbsp; But at
the time it was pure intuition on my part.&nbsp; A mysterious
communication was established already between us two&mdash;in the
face of that silent, darkened tropical sea.&nbsp; I was young,
too; young enough to make no comment.&nbsp; The man in the water
began suddenly to climb up the ladder, and I hastened away from
the rail to fetch some clothes.</p>
<p>Before entering the cabin I stood still, listening in the
lobby at the foot of the stairs.&nbsp; A faint snore came through
the closed door of the chief mate&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; The second
mate&rsquo;s door was on the hook, but the darkness in there was
absolutely soundless.&nbsp; He, too, was young and could sleep
like a stone.&nbsp; Remained the steward, but he was not likely
to wake up before he was called.&nbsp; I got a sleeping-suit out
of my room and, coming back on deck, saw the naked man from the
sea sitting on the main-hatch, glimmering white in the darkness,
his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.&nbsp; In a
moment he had concealed his damp body in a sleeping-suit of the
same grey-stripe pattern as the one I was wearing and followed me
like my double on the poop.&nbsp; Together we moved right aft,
barefooted, silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked in a deadened voice, taking
the lighted lamp out of the binnacle, and raising it to his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ugly business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had rather regular features; a good mouth; light eyes under
somewhat heavy, dark eyebrows; a smooth, square forehead; no
growth on his cheeks; a small, brown moustache, and a
well-shaped, round chin.&nbsp; His expression was concentrated,
meditative, under the inspecting light of the lamp I held up to
his face; such as a man thinking hard in solitude might
wear.&nbsp; My sleeping-suit was just right for his size.&nbsp; A
well-knit young fellow of twenty-five at most.&nbsp; He caught
his lower lip with the edge of white, even teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, replacing the lamp in the
binnacle.&nbsp; The warm, heavy tropical night closed upon his
head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ship over there,&rdquo; he
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&nbsp; The <i>Sephora</i>.&nbsp; Did you
know of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea.&nbsp; I am the mate of
her&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused and corrected himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should say I <i>was</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&nbsp; Something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Very wrong indeed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve killed a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; Just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, on the passage.&nbsp; Weeks ago.&nbsp; Thirty-nine
south.&nbsp; When I say a man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fit of temper,&rdquo; I suggested, confidently.</p>
<p>The shadowy, dark head, like mine, seemed to nod imperceptibly
above the ghostly grey of my sleeping-suit.&nbsp; It was, in the
night, as though I had been faced by my own reflection in the
depths of a sombre and immense mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty thing to have to own up to for a Conway
boy,&rdquo; murmured my double, distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Conway boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said, as if startled.&nbsp; Then,
slowly . . . &ldquo;Perhaps you too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so; but being a couple of years older I had left before
he joined.&nbsp; After a quick interchange of dates a silence
fell; and I thought suddenly of my absurd mate with his terrific
whiskers and the &ldquo;Bless my soul&mdash;you don&rsquo;t say
so&rdquo; type of intellect.&nbsp; My double gave me an inkling
of his thoughts by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s a parson in Norfolk.&nbsp; Do you see
me before a judge and jury on that charge?&nbsp; For myself I
can&rsquo;t see the necessity.&nbsp; There are fellows that an
angel from heaven&mdash;And I am not that.&nbsp; He was one of
those creatures that are just simmering all the time with a silly
sort of wickedness.&nbsp; Miserable devils that have no business
to live at all.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t do his duty and
wouldn&rsquo;t let anybody else do theirs.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s
the good of talking!&nbsp; You know well enough the sort of
ill-conditioned snarling cur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appealed to me as if our experiences had been as identical
as our clothes.&nbsp; And I knew well enough the pestiferous
danger of such a character where there are no means of legal
repression.&nbsp; And I knew well enough also that my double
there was no homicidal ruffian.&nbsp; I did not think of asking
him for details, and he told me the story roughly in brusque,
disconnected sentences.&nbsp; I needed no more.&nbsp; I saw it
all going on as though I were myself inside that other
sleeping-suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened while we were setting a reefed foresail, at
dusk.&nbsp; Reefed foresail!&nbsp; You understand the sort of
weather.&nbsp; The only sail we had left to keep the ship
running; so you may guess what it had been like for days.&nbsp;
Anxious sort of job, that.&nbsp; He gave me some of his cursed
insolence at the sheet.&nbsp; I tell you I was overdone with this
terrific weather that seemed to have no end to it.&nbsp;
Terrific, I tell you&mdash;and a deep ship.&nbsp; I believe the
fellow himself was half crazed with funk.&nbsp; It was no time
for gentlemanly reproof, so I turned round and felled him like an
ox.&nbsp; He up and at me.&nbsp; We closed just as an awful sea
made for the ship.&nbsp; All hands saw it coming and took to the
rigging, but I had him by the throat, and went on shaking him
like a rat, the men above us yelling, &ldquo;Look out! look
out!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then a crash as if the sky had fallen on my
head.&nbsp; They say that for over ten minutes hardly anything
was to be seen of the ship&mdash;just the three masts and a bit
of the forecastle head and of the poop all awash driving along in
a smother of foam.&nbsp; It was a miracle that they found us,
jammed together behind the forebits.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s clear that
I meant business, because I was holding him by the throat still
when they picked us up.&nbsp; He was black in the face.&nbsp; It
was too much for them.&nbsp; It seems they rushed us aft
together, gripped as we were, screaming &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;
like a lot of lunatics, and broke into the cuddy.&nbsp; And the
ship running for her life, touch and go all the time, any minute
her last in a sea fit to turn your hair grey only a-looking at
it.&nbsp; I understand that the skipper, too, started raving like
the rest of them.&nbsp; The man had been deprived of sleep for
more than a week, and to have this sprung on him at the height of
a furious gale nearly drove him out of his mind.&nbsp; I wonder
they didn&rsquo;t fling me overboard after getting the carcass of
their precious ship-mate out of my fingers.&nbsp; They had rather
a job to separate us, I&rsquo;ve been told.&nbsp; A sufficiently
fierce story to make an old judge and a respectable jury sit up a
bit.&nbsp; The first thing I heard when I came to myself was the
maddening howling of that endless gale, and on that the voice of
the old man.&nbsp; He was hanging on to my bunk, staring into my
face out of his sou&rsquo;wester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Leggatt, you have killed a man.&nbsp; You
can act no longer as chief mate of this ship.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His care to subdue his voice made it sound monotonous.&nbsp;
He rested a hand on the end of the skylight to steady himself
with, and all that time did not stir a limb, so far as I could
see.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice little tale for a quiet tea-party,&rdquo;
he concluded in the same tone.</p>
<p>One of my hands, too, rested on the end of the skylight;
neither did I stir a limb, so far as I knew.&nbsp; We stood less
than a foot from each other.&nbsp; It occurred to me that if old
&ldquo;Bless my soul&mdash;you don&rsquo;t say so&rdquo; were to
put his head up the companion and catch sight of us, he would
think he was seeing double, or imagine himself come upon a scene
of weird witchcraft; the strange captain having a quiet
confabulation by the wheel with his own grey ghost.&nbsp; I
became very much concerned to prevent anything of the sort.&nbsp;
I heard the other&rsquo;s soothing undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s a parson in Norfolk,&rdquo; it
said.&nbsp; Evidently he had forgotten he had told me this
important fact before.&nbsp; Truly a nice little tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better slip down into my stateroom now,&rdquo;
I said, moving off stealthily.&nbsp; My double followed my
movements; our bare feet made no sound; I let him in, closed the
door with care, and, after giving a call to the second mate,
returned on deck for my relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much sign of any wind yet,&rdquo; I remarked when
he approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; Not much,&rdquo; he assented, sleepily,
in his hoarse voice, with just enough deference, no more, and
barely suppressing a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all you have to look out for.&nbsp;
You have got your orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paced a turn or two on the poop and saw him take up his
position face forward with his elbow in the ratlines of the
mizzen-rigging before I went below.&nbsp; The mate&rsquo;s faint
snoring was still going on peacefully.&nbsp; The cuddy lamp was
burning over the table on which stood a vase with flowers, a
polite attention from the ship&rsquo;s provision
merchant&mdash;the last flowers we should see for the next three
months at the very least.&nbsp; Two bunches of bananas hung from
the beam symmetrically, one on each side of the
rudder-casing.&nbsp; Everything was as before in the
ship&mdash;except that two of her captain&rsquo;s sleeping-suits
were simultaneously in use, one motionless in the cuddy, the
other keeping very still in the captain&rsquo;s stateroom.</p>
<p>It must be explained here that my cabin had the form of the
capital letter L the door being within the angle and opening into
the short part of the letter.&nbsp; A couch was to the left, the
bed-place to the right; my writing-desk and the
chronometers&rsquo; table faced the door.&nbsp; But any one
opening it, unless he stepped right inside, had no view of what I
call the long (or vertical) part of the letter.&nbsp; It
contained some lockers surmounted by a bookcase; and a few
clothes, a thick jacket or two, caps, oilskin coat, and such
like, hung on hooks.&nbsp; There was at the bottom of that part a
door opening into my bath-room, which could be entered also
directly from the saloon.&nbsp; But that way was never used.</p>
<p>The mysterious arrival had discovered the advantage of this
particular shape.&nbsp; Entering my room, lighted strongly by a
big bulkhead lamp swung on gimbals above my writing-desk, I did
not see him anywhere till he stepped out quietly from behind the
coats hung in the recessed part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard somebody moving about, and went in there at
once,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>I, too, spoke under my breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody is likely to come in here without knocking and
getting permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.&nbsp; His face was thin and the sunburn faded, as
though he had been ill.&nbsp; And no wonder.&nbsp; He had been, I
heard presently, kept under arrest in his cabin for nearly seven
weeks.&nbsp; But there was nothing sickly in his eyes or in his
expression.&nbsp; He was not a bit like me, really; yet, as we
stood leaning over my bed-place, whispering side by side, with
our dark heads together and our backs to the door, anybody bold
enough to open it stealthily would have been treated to the
uncanny sight of a double captain busy talking in whispers with
his other self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this doesn&rsquo;t tell me how you came to hang
on to our side-ladder,&rdquo; I inquired, in the hardly audible
murmurs we used, after he had told me something more of the
proceedings on board the <i>Sephora</i> once the bad weather was
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we sighted Java Head I had had time to think all
those matters out several times over.&nbsp; I had six weeks of
doing nothing else, and with only an hour or so every evening for
a tramp on the quarter-deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whispered, his arms folded on the side of my bed-place,
staring through the open port.&nbsp; And I could imagine
perfectly the manner of this thinking out&mdash;a stubborn if not
a steadfast operation; something of which I should have been
perfectly incapable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckoned it would be dark before we closed with the
land,&rdquo; he continued, so low that I had to strain my
hearing, near as we were to each other, shoulder touching
shoulder almost.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I asked to speak to the old
man.&nbsp; He always seemed very sick when he came to see
me&mdash;as if he could not look me in the face.&nbsp; You know,
that foresail saved the ship.&nbsp; She was too deep to have run
long under bare poles.&nbsp; And it was I that managed to set it
for him.&nbsp; Anyway, he came.&nbsp; When I had him in my
cabin&mdash;he stood by the door looking at me as if I had the
halter round my neck already&mdash;I asked him right away to
leave my cabin door unlocked at night while the ship was going
through Sunda Straits.&nbsp; There would be the Java coast within
two or three miles, off Angier Point.&nbsp; I wanted nothing
more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a prize for swimming my second year in
the Conway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can believe it,&rdquo; I breathed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God only knows why they locked me in every night.&nbsp;
To see some of their faces you&rsquo;d have thought they were
afraid I&rsquo;d go about at night strangling people.&nbsp; Am I
a murdering brute?&nbsp; Do I look it?&nbsp; By Jove! if I had
been he wouldn&rsquo;t have trusted himself like that into my
room.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll say I might have chucked him aside and
bolted out, there and then&mdash;it was dark already.&nbsp; Well,
no.&nbsp; And for the same reason I wouldn&rsquo;t think of
trying to smash the door.&nbsp; There would have been a rush to
stop me at the noise, and I did not mean to get into a confounded
scrimmage.&nbsp; Somebody else might have got killed&mdash;for I
would not have broken out only to get chucked back, and I did not
want any more of that work.&nbsp; He refused, looking more sick
than ever.&nbsp; He was afraid of the men, and also of that old
second mate of his who had been sailing with him for
years&mdash;a grey-headed old humbug; and his steward, too, had
been with him devil knows how long&mdash;seventeen years or
more&mdash;a dogmatic sort of loafer who hated me like poison,
just because I was the chief mate.&nbsp; No chief mate ever made
more than one voyage in the <i>Sephora</i>, you know.&nbsp; Those
two old chaps ran the ship.&nbsp; Devil only knows what the
skipper wasn&rsquo;t afraid of (all his nerve went to pieces
altogether in that hellish spell of bad weather we had)&mdash;of
what the law would do to him&mdash;of his wife, perhaps.&nbsp;
Oh, yes! she&rsquo;s on board.&nbsp; Though I don&rsquo;t think
she would have meddled.&nbsp; She would have been only too glad
to have me out of the ship in any way.&nbsp; The &lsquo;brand of
Cain&rsquo; business, don&rsquo;t you see.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
right.&nbsp; I was ready enough to go off wandering on the face
of the earth&mdash;and that was price enough to pay for an Abel
of that sort.&nbsp; Anyhow, he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This thing must take its course.&nbsp; I represent the law
here.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was shaking like a leaf.&nbsp; &lsquo;So
you won&rsquo;t?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then
I hope you will be able to sleep on that,&rsquo; I said, and
turned my back on him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder that <i>you</i>
can,&rsquo; cries he, and locks the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after that, I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Not very
well.&nbsp; That was three weeks ago.&nbsp; We have had a slow
passage through the Java Sea; drifted about Carimata for ten
days.&nbsp; When we anchored here they thought, I suppose, it was
all right.&nbsp; The nearest land (and that&rsquo;s five miles)
is the ship&rsquo;s destination; the consul would soon set about
catching me; and there would have been no object in bolting to
these islets there.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s a
drop of water on them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how it was, but
to-night that steward, after bringing me my supper, went out to
let me eat it, and left the door unlocked.&nbsp; And I ate
it&mdash;all there was, too.&nbsp; After I had finished I
strolled out on the quarterdeck.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that I
meant to do anything.&nbsp; A breath of fresh air was all I
wanted, I believe.&nbsp; Then a sudden temptation came over
me.&nbsp; I kicked off my slippers and was in the water before I
had made up my mind fairly.&nbsp; Somebody heard the splash and
they raised an awful hullabaloo.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
gone!&nbsp; Lower the boats!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s committed
suicide!&nbsp; No, he&rsquo;s swimming.&rsquo;&nbsp; Certainly I
was swimming.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not so easy for a swimmer like me
to commit suicide by drowning.&nbsp; I landed on the nearest
islet before the boat left the ship&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; I heard
them pulling about in the dark, hailing, and so on, but after a
bit they gave up.&nbsp; Everything quieted down and the anchorage
became as still as death.&nbsp; I sat down on a stone and began
to think.&nbsp; I felt certain they would start searching for me
at daylight.&nbsp; There was no place to hide on those stony
things&mdash;and if there had been, what would have been the
good?&nbsp; But now I was clear of that ship, I was not going
back.&nbsp; So after a while I took off all my clothes, tied them
up in a bundle with a stone inside, and dropped them in the deep
water on the outer side of that islet.&nbsp; That was suicide
enough for me.&nbsp; Let them think what they liked, but I
didn&rsquo;t mean to drown myself.&nbsp; I meant to swim till I
sank&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not the same thing.&nbsp; I struck
out for another of these little islands, and it was from that one
that I first saw your riding-light.&nbsp; Something to swim
for.&nbsp; I went on easily, and on the way I came upon a flat
rock a foot or two above water.&nbsp; In the daytime, I dare say,
you might make it out with a glass from your poop.&nbsp; I
scrambled up on it and rested myself for a bit.&nbsp; Then I made
another start.&nbsp; That last spell must have been over a
mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His whisper was getting fainter and fainter, and all the time
he stared straight out through the port-hole, in which there was
not even a star to be seen.&nbsp; I had not interrupted
him.&nbsp; There was something that made comment impossible in
his narrative, or perhaps in himself; a sort of feeling, a
quality, which I can&rsquo;t find a name for.&nbsp; And when he
ceased, all I found was a futile whisper: &ldquo;So you swam for
our light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;straight for it.&nbsp; It was something to
swim for.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t see any stars low down because
the coast was in the way, and I couldn&rsquo;t see the land,
either.&nbsp; The water was like glass.&nbsp; One might have been
swimming in a confounded thousand-feet deep cistern with no place
for scrambling out anywhere; but what I didn&rsquo;t like was the
notion of swimming round and round like a crazed bullock before I
gave out; and as I didn&rsquo;t mean to go back . . . No.&nbsp;
Do you see me being hauled back, stark naked, off one of these
little islands by the scruff of the neck and fighting like a wild
beast?&nbsp; Somebody would have got killed for certain, and I
did not want any of that.&nbsp; So I went on.&nbsp; Then your
ladder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you hail the ship?&rdquo; I asked, a
little louder.</p>
<p>He touched my shoulder lightly.&nbsp; Lazy footsteps came
right over our heads and stopped.&nbsp; The second mate had
crossed from the other side of the poop and might have been
hanging over the rail, for all we knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t hear us talking&mdash;could
he?&rdquo;&nbsp; My double breathed into my very ear,
anxiously.</p>
<p>His anxiety was an answer, a sufficient answer, to the
question I had put to him.&nbsp; An answer containing all the
difficulty of that situation.&nbsp; I closed the port-hole
quietly, to make sure.&nbsp; A louder word might have been
overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he whispered then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My second mate.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t know much more
of the fellow than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I told him a little about myself.&nbsp; I had been
appointed to take charge while I least expected anything of the
sort, not quite a fortnight ago.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know either
the ship or the people.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t had the time in port
to look about me or size anybody up.&nbsp; And as to the crew,
all they knew was that I was appointed to take the ship
home.&nbsp; For the rest, I was almost as much of a stranger on
board as himself, I said.&nbsp; And at the moment I felt it most
acutely.&nbsp; I felt that it would take very little to make me a
suspect person in the eyes of the ship&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>He had turned about meantime; and we, the two strangers in the
ship, faced each other in identical attitudes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladder&mdash;&rdquo; he murmured, after a
silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought of finding a
ladder hanging over at night in a ship anchored out here!&nbsp; I
felt just then a very unpleasant faintness.&nbsp; After the life
I&rsquo;ve been leading for nine weeks, anybody would have got
out of condition.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t capable of swimming round
as far as your rudder-chains.&nbsp; And, lo and behold! there was
a ladder to get hold of.&nbsp; After I gripped it I said to
myself, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good?&rsquo;&nbsp; When I saw a
man&rsquo;s head looking over I thought I would swim away
presently and leave him shouting&mdash;in whatever language it
was.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mind being looked at.&nbsp; I&mdash;I
liked it.&nbsp; And then you speaking to me so quietly&mdash;as
if you had expected me&mdash;made me hold on a little
longer.&nbsp; It had been a confounded lonely time&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t mean while swimming.&nbsp; I was glad to talk a
little to somebody that didn&rsquo;t belong to the
<i>Sephora</i>.&nbsp; As to asking for the captain, that was a
mere impulse.&nbsp; It could have been no use, with all the ship
knowing about me and the other people pretty certain to be round
here in the morning.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I wanted to
be seen, to talk with somebody, before I went on.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what I would have said. . . . &lsquo;Fine night,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; or something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will be round here presently?&rdquo;
I asked with some incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite likely,&rdquo; he said, faintly.</p>
<p>He looked extremely haggard all of a sudden.&nbsp; His head
rolled on his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; We shall see then.&nbsp; Meantime get
into that bed,&rdquo; I whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Want help?&nbsp;
There.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a rather high bed-place with a set of drawers
underneath.&nbsp; This amazing swimmer really needed the lift I
gave him by seizing his leg.&nbsp; He tumbled in, rolled over on
his back, and flung one arm across his eyes.&nbsp; And then, with
his face nearly hidden, he must have looked exactly as I used to
look in that bed.&nbsp; I gazed upon my other self for a while
before drawing across carefully the two green serge curtains
which ran on a brass rod.&nbsp; I thought for a moment of pinning
them together for greater safety, but I sat down on the couch,
and once there I felt unwilling to rise and hunt for a pin.&nbsp;
I would do it in a moment.&nbsp; I was extremely tired, in a
peculiarly intimate way, by the strain of stealthiness, by the
effort of whispering and the general secrecy of this
excitement.&nbsp; It was three o&rsquo;clock by now and I had
been on my feet since nine, but I was not sleepy; I could not
have gone to sleep.&nbsp; I sat there, fagged out, looking at the
curtains, trying to clear my mind of the confused sensation of
being in two places at once, and greatly bothered by an
exasperating knocking in my head.&nbsp; It was a relief to
discover suddenly that it was not in my head at all, but on the
outside of the door.&nbsp; Before I could collect myself the
words &ldquo;Come in&rdquo; were out of my mouth, and the steward
entered with a tray, bringing in my morning coffee.&nbsp; I had
slept, after all, and I was so frightened that I shouted,
&ldquo;This way!&nbsp; I am here, steward,&rdquo; as though he
had been miles away.&nbsp; He put down the tray on the table next
the couch and only then said, very quietly, &ldquo;I can see you
are here, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt him give me a keen look, but I
dared not meet his eyes just then.&nbsp; He must have wondered
why I had drawn the curtains of my bed before going to sleep on
the couch.&nbsp; He went out, hooking the door open as usual.</p>
<p>I heard the crew washing decks above me.&nbsp; I knew I would
have been told at once if there had been any wind.&nbsp; Calm, I
thought, and I was doubly vexed.&nbsp; Indeed, I felt dual more
than ever.&nbsp; The steward reappeared suddenly in the
doorway.&nbsp; I jumped up from the couch so quickly that he gave
a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close your port, sir&mdash;they are washing
decks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is closed,&rdquo; I said, reddening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he did not move from
the doorway and returned my stare in an extraordinary, equivocal
manner for a time.&nbsp; Then his eyes wavered, all his
expression changed, and in a voice unusually gentle, almost
coaxingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in to take the empty cup away,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;&nbsp; I turned my back on him while
he popped in and out.&nbsp; Then I unhooked and closed the door
and even pushed the bolt.&nbsp; This sort of thing could not go
on very long.&nbsp; The cabin was as hot as an oven, too.&nbsp; I
took a peep at my double, and discovered that he had not moved,
his arm was still over his eyes; but his chest heaved; his hair
was wet; his chin glistened with perspiration.&nbsp; I reached
over him and opened the port.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must show myself on deck,&rdquo; I reflected.</p>
<p>Of course, theoretically, I could do what I liked, with no one
to say nay to me within the whole circle of the horizon; but to
lock my cabin door and take the key away I did not dare.&nbsp;
Directly I put my head out of the companion I saw the group of my
two officers, the second mate barefooted, the chief mate in long
india-rubber boots, near the break of the poop, and the steward
half-way down the poop-ladder talking to them eagerly.&nbsp; He
happened to catch sight of me and dived, the second ran down on
the main-deck shouting some order or other, and the chief mate
came to meet me, touching his cap.</p>
<p>There was a sort of curiosity in his eye that I did not
like.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether the steward had told them
that I was &ldquo;queer&rdquo; only, or downright drunk, but I
know the man meant to have a good look at me.&nbsp; I watched him
coming with a smile which, as he got into point-blank range, took
effect and froze his very whiskers.&nbsp; I did not give him time
to open his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Square the yards by lifts and braces before the hands
go to breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first particular order I had given on board that
ship; and I stayed on deck to see it executed, too.&nbsp; I had
felt the need of asserting myself without loss of time.&nbsp;
That sneering young cub got taken down a peg or two on that
occasion, and I also seized the opportunity of having a good look
at the face of every foremast man as they filed past me to go to
the after braces.&nbsp; At breakfast time, eating nothing myself,
I presided with such frigid dignity that the two mates were only
too glad to escape from the cabin as soon as decency permitted;
and all the time the dual working of my mind distracted me almost
to the point of insanity.&nbsp; I was constantly watching myself,
my secret self, as dependent on my actions as my own personality,
sleeping in that bed, behind that door which faced me as I sat at
the head of the table.&nbsp; It was very much like being mad,
only it was worse because one was aware of it.</p>
<p>I had to shake him for a solid minute, but when at last he
opened his eyes it was in the full possession of his senses, with
an inquiring look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well so far,&rdquo; I whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now you must vanish into the bath-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so, as noiseless as a ghost, and I then rang for the
steward, and facing him boldly, directed him to tidy up my
stateroom while I was having my bath&mdash;&ldquo;and be quick
about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; As my tone admitted of no excuses, he
said, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and ran off to fetch his dust-pan
and brushes.&nbsp; I took a bath and did most of my dressing,
splashing, and whistling softly for the steward&rsquo;s
edification, while the secret sharer of my life stood drawn up
bolt upright in that little space, his face looking very sunken
in daylight, his eyelids lowered under the stern, dark line of
his eyebrows drawn together by a slight frown.</p>
<p>When I left him there to go back to my room the steward was
finishing dusting.&nbsp; I sent for the mate and engaged him in
some insignificant conversation.&nbsp; It was, as it were,
trifling with the terrific character of his whiskers; but my
object was to give him an opportunity for a good look at my
cabin.&nbsp; And then I could at last shut, with a clear
conscience, the door of my stateroom and get my double back into
the recessed part.&nbsp; There was nothing else for it.&nbsp; He
had to sit still on a small folding stool, half smothered by the
heavy coats hanging there.&nbsp; We listened to the steward going
into the bath-room out of the saloon, filling the water-bottles
there, scrubbing the bath, setting things to rights, whisk, bang,
clatter&mdash;out again into the saloon&mdash;turn the
key&mdash;click.&nbsp; Such was my scheme for keeping my second
self invisible.&nbsp; Nothing better could be contrived under the
circumstances.&nbsp; And there we sat; I at my writing-desk ready
to appear busy with some papers, he behind me, out of sight of
the door.&nbsp; It would not have been prudent to talk in
daytime; and I could not have stood the excitement of that queer
sense of whispering to myself.&nbsp; Now and then glancing over
my shoulder, I saw him far back there, sitting rigidly on the low
stool, his bare feet close together, his arms folded, his head
hanging on his breast&mdash;and perfectly still.&nbsp; Anybody
would have taken him for me.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by it myself.&nbsp; Every moment I had to
glance over my shoulder.&nbsp; I was looking at him when a voice
outside the door said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; . . . I kept my eyes on him, and so, when
the voice outside the door announced, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
ship&rsquo;s boat coming our way, sir,&rdquo; I saw him give a
start&mdash;the first movement he had made for hours.&nbsp; But
he did not raise his bowed head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; Get the ladder over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated.&nbsp; Should I whisper something to him?&nbsp;
But what?&nbsp; His immobility seemed to have been never
disturbed.&nbsp; What could I tell him he did not know already? .
. . Finally I went on deck.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> skipper of the <i>Sephora</i>
had a thin red whisker all round his face, and the sort of
complexion that goes with hair of that colour; also the
particular, rather smeary shade of blue in the eyes.&nbsp; He was
not exactly a showy figure; his shoulders were high, his stature
but middling&mdash;one leg slightly more bandy than the
other.&nbsp; He shook hands, looking vaguely around.&nbsp; A
spiritless tenacity was his main characteristic, I judged.&nbsp;
I behaved with a politeness which seemed to disconcert him.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was shy.&nbsp; He mumbled to me as if he were ashamed
of what he was saying; gave his name (it was something like
Archbold&mdash;but at this distance of years I hardly am sure),
his ship&rsquo;s name, and a few other particulars of that sort,
in the manner of a criminal making a reluctant and doleful
confession.&nbsp; He had had terrible weather on the passage
out&mdash;terrible&mdash;terrible&mdash;wife aboard, too.</p>
<p>By this time we were seated in the cabin and the steward
brought in a tray with a bottle and glasses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thanks!&nbsp; No.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never took liquor.&nbsp;
Would have some water, though.&nbsp; He drank two
tumblerfuls.&nbsp; Terrible thirsty work.&nbsp; Ever since
daylight had been exploring the islands round his ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that for&mdash;fun?&rdquo; I asked, with an
appearance of polite interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; He sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Painful
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he persisted in his mumbling and I wanted my double to hear
every word, I hit upon the notion of informing him that I
regretted to say I was hard of hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a young man, too!&rdquo; he nodded, keeping his
smeary blue, unintelligent eyes fastened upon me.&nbsp; What was
the cause of it&mdash;some disease? he inquired, without the
least sympathy and as if he thought that, if so, I&rsquo;d got no
more than I deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; disease,&rdquo; I admitted in a cheerful tone
which seemed to shock him.&nbsp; But my point was gained, because
he had to raise his voice to give me his tale.&nbsp; It is not
worth while to record that version.&nbsp; It was just over two
months since all this had happened, and he had thought so much
about it that he seemed completely muddled as to its bearings,
but still immensely impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you think of such a thing happening on board
your own ship?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had the <i>Sephora</i> for these
fifteen years.&nbsp; I am a well-known shipmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was densely distressed&mdash;and perhaps I should have
sympathised with him if I had been able to detach my mental
vision from the unsuspected sharer of my cabin as though he were
my second self.&nbsp; There he was on the other side of the
bulkhead, four or five feet from us, no more, as we sat in the
saloon.&nbsp; I looked politely at Captain Archbold (if that was
his name), but it was the other I saw, in a grey sleeping-suit,
seated on a low stool, his bare feet close together, his arms
folded, and every word said between us falling into the ears of
his dark head bowed on his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been at sea now, man and boy, for
seven-and-thirty years, and I&rsquo;ve never heard of such a
thing happening in an English ship.&nbsp; And that it should be
my ship.&nbsp; Wife on board, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was hardly listening to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that the
heavy sea which, you told me, came aboard just then might have
killed the man?&nbsp; I have seen the sheer weight of a sea kill
a man very neatly, by simply breaking his neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he uttered, impressively, fixing his
smeary blue eyes on me.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sea!&nbsp; No man killed
by the sea ever looked like that.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seemed
positively scandalised at my suggestion.&nbsp; And as I gazed at
him, certainly not prepared for anything original on his part, he
advanced his head close to mine and thrust his tongue out at me
so suddenly that I couldn&rsquo;t help starting back.</p>
<p>After scoring over my calmness in this graphic way he nodded
wisely.&nbsp; If I had seen the sight, he assured me, I would
never forget it as long as I lived.&nbsp; The weather was too bad
to give the corpse a proper sea burial.&nbsp; So next day at dawn
they took it up on the poop, covering its face with a bit of
bunting; he read a short prayer, and then, just as it was, in its
oilskins and long boots, they launched it amongst those
mountainous seas that seemed ready every moment to swallow up the
ship herself and the terrified lives on board of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reefed foresail saved you,&rdquo; I threw in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under God&mdash;it did,&rdquo; he exclaimed
fervently.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was by a special mercy, I firmly
believe, that it stood some of those hurricane
squalls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the setting of that sail which&mdash;&rdquo; I
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s own hand in it,&rdquo; he interrupted
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing less could have done it.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I hardly dared give the
order.&nbsp; It seemed impossible that we could touch anything
without losing it, and then our last hope would have been
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terror of that gale was on him yet.&nbsp; I let him go on
for a bit, then said, casually&mdash;as if returning to a minor
subject:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very anxious to give up your mate to the shore
people, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was.&nbsp; To the law.&nbsp; His obscure tenacity on that
point had in it something incomprehensible and a little awful;
something, as it were, mystical, quite apart from his anxiety
that he should not be suspected of &ldquo;countenancing any
doings of that sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seven-and-thirty virtuous years
at sea, of which over twenty of immaculate command, and the last
fifteen in the <i>Sephora</i>, seemed to have laid him under some
pitiless obligation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know,&rdquo; he went on, groping shamefacedly
amongst his feelings, &ldquo;I did not engage that young
fellow.&nbsp; His people had some interest with my owners.&nbsp;
I was in a way forced to take him on.&nbsp; He looked very smart,
very gentlemanly, and all that.&nbsp; But do you know&mdash;I
never liked him, somehow.&nbsp; I am a plain man.&nbsp; You see,
he wasn&rsquo;t exactly the sort for the chief mate of a ship
like the <i>Sephora</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had become so connected in thoughts and impressions with the
secret sharer of my cabin that I felt as if I, personally, were
being given to understand that I, too, was not the sort that
would have done for the chief mate of a ship like the
<i>Sephora</i>.&nbsp; I had no doubt of it in my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all the style of man.&nbsp; You
understand,&rdquo; he insisted, superfluously, looking hard at
me.</p>
<p>I smiled urbanely.&nbsp; He seemed at a loss for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must report a suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suicide!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll have to
write to my owners directly I get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you manage to recover him before
to-morrow,&rdquo; I assented, dispassionately. . . &ldquo;I mean,
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mumbled something which I really did not catch, and I
turned my ear to him in a puzzled manner.&nbsp; He fairly
bawled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The land&mdash;I say, the mainland is at least seven
miles off my anchorage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lack of excitement, of curiosity, of surprise, of any sort
of pronounced interest, began to arouse his distrust.&nbsp; But
except for the felicitous pretence of deafness I had not tried to
pretend anything.&nbsp; I had felt utterly incapable of playing
the part of ignorance properly, and therefore was afraid to
try.&nbsp; It is also certain that he had brought some ready-made
suspicions with him, and that he viewed my politeness as a
strange and unnatural phenomenon.&nbsp; And yet how else could I
have received him?&nbsp; Not heartily!&nbsp; That was impossible
for psychological reasons, which I need not state here.&nbsp; My
only object was to keep off his inquiries.&nbsp; Surlily?&nbsp;
Yes, but surliness might have provoked a point-blank
question.&nbsp; From its novelty to him and from its nature,
punctilious courtesy was the manner best calculated to restrain
the man.&nbsp; But there was the danger of his breaking through
my defence bluntly.&nbsp; I could not, I think, have met him by a
direct lie, also for psychological (not moral) reasons.&nbsp; If
he had only known how afraid I was of his putting my feeling of
identity with the other to the test!&nbsp; But, strangely
enough&mdash;(I thought of it only afterward)&mdash;I believe
that he was not a little disconcerted by the reverse side of that
weird situation, by something in me that reminded him of the man
he was seeking&mdash;suggested a mysterious similitude to the
young fellow he had distrusted and disliked from the first.</p>
<p>However that might have been, the silence was not very
prolonged.&nbsp; He took another oblique step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I had no more than a two-mile pull to your
ship.&nbsp; Not a bit more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quite enough, too, in this awful heat,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>Another pause full of mistrust followed.&nbsp; Necessity, they
say, is mother of invention, but fear, too, is not barren of
ingenious suggestions.&nbsp; And I was afraid he would ask me
point-blank for news of my other self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice little saloon, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I remarked,
as if noticing for the first time the way his eyes roamed from
one closed door to the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;And very well fitted
out too.&nbsp; Here, for instance,&rdquo; I continued, reaching
over the back of my seat negligently and flinging the door open,
&ldquo;is my bath-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made an eager movement, but hardly gave it a glance.&nbsp;
I got up, shut the door of the bath-room, and invited him to have
a look round, as if I were very proud of my accommodation.&nbsp;
He had to rise and be shown round, but he went through the
business without any raptures whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll have a look at my stateroom,&rdquo;
I declared, in a voice as loud as I dared to make it, crossing
the cabin to the starboard side with purposely heavy steps.</p>
<p>He followed me in and gazed around.&nbsp; My intelligent
double had vanished.&nbsp; I played my part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very convenient&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nice.&nbsp; Very comf. . . &rdquo;&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t finish, and went out brusquely as if to escape from
some unrighteous wiles of mine.&nbsp; But it was not to be.&nbsp;
I had been too frightened not to feel vengeful; I felt I had him
on the run, and I meant to keep him on the run.&nbsp; My polite
insistence must have had something menacing in it, because he
gave in suddenly.&nbsp; And I did not let him off a single item;
mate&rsquo;s room, pantry, storerooms, the very sail-locker which
was also under the poop&mdash;he had to look into them all.&nbsp;
When at last I showed him out on the quarter-deck he drew a long,
spiritless sigh, and mumbled dismally that he must really be
going back to his ship now.&nbsp; I desired my mate, who had
joined us, to see to the captain&rsquo;s boat.</p>
<p>The man of whiskers gave a blast on the whistle which he used
to wear hanging round his neck, and yelled,
&ldquo;<i>Sephoras</i> away!&rdquo;&nbsp; My double down there in
my cabin must have heard, and certainly could not feel more
relieved than I.&nbsp; Four fellows came running out from
somewhere forward and went over the side, while my own men,
appearing on deck too, lined the rail.&nbsp; I escorted my
visitor to the gangway ceremoniously, and nearly overdid
it.&nbsp; He was a tenacious beast.&nbsp; On the very ladder he
lingered, and in that unique, guiltily conscientious manner of
sticking to the point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say . . . you . . . you don&rsquo;t think
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I covered his voice loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. . . . I am delighted.&nbsp;
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had an idea of what he meant to say, and just saved myself
by the privilege of defective hearing.&nbsp; He was too shaken
generally to insist, but my mate, close witness of that parting,
looked mystified and his face took on a thoughtful cast.&nbsp; As
I did not want to appear as if I wished to avoid all
communication with my officers, he had the opportunity to address
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a very nice man.&nbsp; His boat&rsquo;s crew told
our chaps a very extraordinary story, if what I am told by the
steward is true.&nbsp; I suppose you had it from the captain,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I had a story from the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very horrible affair&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beats all these tales we hear about murders in Yankee
ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it beats them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think it resembles them in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul&mdash;you don&rsquo;t say so!&nbsp; But
of course I&rsquo;ve no acquaintance whatever with American
ships, not I, so I couldn&rsquo;t go against your
knowledge.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s horrible enough for me. . . . But the
queerest part is that those fellows seemed to have some idea the
man was hidden aboard here.&nbsp; They had really.&nbsp; Did you
ever hear of such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preposterous&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were walking to and fro athwart the quarterdeck.&nbsp; No
one of the crew forward could be seen (the day was Sunday), and
the mate pursued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some little dispute about it.&nbsp; Our chaps
took offence.&nbsp; &lsquo;As if we would harbour a thing like
that,&rsquo; they said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to
look for him in our coal-hole?&rsquo;&nbsp; Quite a tiff.&nbsp;
But they made it up in the end.&nbsp; I suppose he did drown
himself.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no doubt in the matter, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left him suddenly.&nbsp; I felt I was producing a bad
impression, but with my double down there it was most trying to
be on deck.&nbsp; And it was almost as trying to be below.&nbsp;
Altogether a nerve-trying situation.&nbsp; But on the whole I
felt less torn in two when I was with him.&nbsp; There was no one
in the whole ship whom I dared take into my confidence.&nbsp;
Since the hands had got to know his story, it would have been
impossible to pass him off for any one else, and an accidental
discovery was to be dreaded now more than ever. . . .</p>
<p>The steward being engaged in laying the table for dinner, we
could talk only with our eyes when I first went down.&nbsp; Later
in the afternoon we had a cautious try at whispering.&nbsp; The
Sunday quietness of the ship was against us; the stillness of air
and water around her was against us; the elements, the men were
against us&mdash;everything was against us in our secret
partnership; time itself&mdash;for this could not go on
forever.&nbsp; The very trust in Providence was, I suppose,
denied to his guilt.&nbsp; Shall I confess that this thought cast
me down very much?&nbsp; And as to the chapter of accidents which
counts for so much in the book of success, I could only hope that
it was closed.&nbsp; For what favourable accident could be
expected?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear everything?&rdquo; were my first words as
soon as we took up our position side by side, leaning over my
bed-place.</p>
<p>He had.&nbsp; And the proof of it was his earnest whisper,
&ldquo;The man told you he hardly dared to give the
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understood the reference to be to that saving foresail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; He was afraid of it being lost in the
setting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you he never gave the order.&nbsp; He may
think he did, but he never gave it.&nbsp; He stood there with me
on the break of the poop after the maintopsail blew away, and
whimpered about our last hope&mdash;positively whimpered about it
and nothing else&mdash;and the night coming on!&nbsp; To hear
one&rsquo;s skipper go on like that in such weather was enough to
drive any fellow out of his mind.&nbsp; It worked me up into a
sort of desperation.&nbsp; I just took it into my own hands and
went away from him, boiling, and&mdash;&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s
the use telling you?&nbsp; <i>You</i> know! . . . Do you think
that if I had not been pretty fierce with them I should have got
the men to do anything?&nbsp; Not it!&nbsp; The
bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n perhaps?&nbsp; Perhaps!&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t
a heavy sea&mdash;it was a sea gone mad!&nbsp; I suppose the end
of the world will be something like that; and a man may have the
heart to see it coming once and be done with it&mdash;but to have
to face it day after day&mdash;I don&rsquo;t blame anybody.&nbsp;
I was precious little better than the rest.&nbsp; Only&mdash;I
was an officer of that old coal-waggon, anyhow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite understand,&rdquo; I conveyed that sincere
assurance into his ear.&nbsp; He was out of breath with
whispering; I could hear him pant slightly.&nbsp; It was all very
simple.&nbsp; The same strung-up force which had given
twenty-four men a chance, at least, for their lives, had, in a
sort of recoil, crushed an unworthy mutinous existence.</p>
<p>But I had no leisure to weigh the merits of the
matter&mdash;footsteps in the saloon, a heavy knock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough wind to get under way with,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was the call of a new claim upon my
thoughts and even upon my feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn the hands up,&rdquo; I cried through the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on deck directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was going out to make the acquaintance of my ship.&nbsp;
Before I left the cabin our eyes met&mdash;the eyes of the only
two strangers on board.&nbsp; I pointed to the recessed part
where the little camp-stool awaited him and laid my finger on my
lips.&nbsp; He made a gesture&mdash;somewhat vague&mdash;a little
mysterious, accompanied by a faint smile, as if of regret.</p>
<p>This is not the place to enlarge upon the sensations of a man
who feels for the first time a ship move under his feet to his
own independent word.&nbsp; In my case they were not
unalloyed.&nbsp; I was not wholly alone with my command; for
there was that stranger in my cabin.&nbsp; Or rather, I was not
completely and wholly with her.&nbsp; Part of me was
absent.&nbsp; That mental feeling of being in two places at once
affected me physically as if the mood of secrecy had penetrated
my very soul.&nbsp; Before an hour had elapsed since the ship had
begun to move, having occasion to ask the mate (he stood by my
side) to take a compass bearing of the Pagoda, I caught myself
reaching up to his ear in whispers.&nbsp; I say I caught myself,
but enough had escaped to startle the man.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
describe it otherwise than by saying that he shied.&nbsp; A
grave, preoccupied manner, as though he were in possession of
some perplexing intelligence, did not leave him henceforth.&nbsp;
A little later I moved away from the rail to look at the compass
with such a stealthy gait that the helmsman noticed it&mdash;and
I could not help noticing the unusual roundness of his
eyes.&nbsp; These are trifling instances, though it&rsquo;s to no
commander&rsquo;s advantage to be suspected of ludicrous
eccentricities.&nbsp; But I was also more seriously
affected.&nbsp; There are to a seaman certain words, gestures,
that should in given conditions come as naturally, as
instinctively as the winking of a menaced eye.&nbsp; A certain
order should spring on to his lips without thinking; a certain
sign should get itself made, so to speak, without
reflection.&nbsp; But all unconscious alertness had abandoned
me.&nbsp; I had to make an effort of will to recall myself back
(from the cabin) to the conditions of the moment.&nbsp; I felt
that I was appearing an irresolute commander to those people who
were watching me more or less critically.</p>
<p>And, besides, there were the scares.&nbsp; On the second day
out, for instance, coming off the deck in the afternoon (I had
straw slippers on my bare feet) I stopped at the open pantry door
and spoke to the steward.&nbsp; He was doing something there with
his back to me.&nbsp; At the sound of my voice he nearly jumped
out of his skin, as the saying is, and incidentally broke a
cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; I
asked, astonished.</p>
<p>He was extremely confused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beg your pardon,
sir.&nbsp; I made sure you were in your cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; I could have sworn I had heard you
moving in there not a moment ago.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s most
extraordinary . . . very sorry, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I passed on with an inward shudder.&nbsp; I was so identified
with my secret double that I did not even mention the fact in
those scanty, fearful whispers we exchanged.&nbsp; I suppose he
had made some slight noise of some kind or other.&nbsp; It would
have been miraculous if he hadn&rsquo;t at one time or
another.&nbsp; And yet, haggard as he appeared, he looked always
perfectly self-controlled, more than calm&mdash;almost
invulnerable.&nbsp; On my suggestion he remained almost entirely
in the bathroom, which, upon the whole, was the safest
place.&nbsp; There could be really no shadow of an excuse for any
one ever wanting to go in there, once the steward had done with
it.&nbsp; It was a very tiny place.&nbsp; Sometimes he reclined
on the floor, his legs bent, his head sustained on one
elbow.&nbsp; At others I would find him on the camp-stool,
sitting in his grey sleeping-suit and with his cropped dark hair
like a patient, unmoved convict.&nbsp; At night I would smuggle
him into my bed-place, and we would whisper together, with the
regular footfalls of the officer of the watch passing and
repassing over our heads.&nbsp; It was an infinitely miserable
time.&nbsp; It was lucky that some tins of fine preserves were
stowed in a locker in my stateroom; hard bread I could always get
hold of; and so he lived on stewed chicken, pat&eacute; de foie
gras, asparagus, cooked oysters, sardines&mdash;on all sorts of
abominable sham delicacies out of tins.&nbsp; My early morning
coffee he always drank; and it was all I dared do for him in that
respect.</p>
<p>Every day there was the horrible manoeuvring to go through so
that my room and then the bath-room should be done in the usual
way.&nbsp; I came to hate the sight of the steward, to abhor the
voice of that harmless man.&nbsp; I felt that it was he who would
bring on the disaster of discovery.&nbsp; It hung like a sword
over our heads.</p>
<p>The fourth day out, I think (we were then working down the
east side of the Gulf of Siam, tack for tack, in light winds and
smooth water)&mdash;the fourth day, I say, of this miserable
juggling with the unavoidable, as we sat at our evening meal,
that man, whose slightest movement I dreaded, after putting down
the dishes ran up on deck busily.&nbsp; This could not be
dangerous.&nbsp; Presently he came down again; and then it
appeared that he had remembered a coat of mine which I had thrown
over a rail to dry after having been wetted in a shower which had
passed over the ship in the afternoon.&nbsp; Sitting stolidly at
the head of the table I became terrified at the sight of the
garment on his arm.&nbsp; Of course he made for my door.&nbsp;
There was no time to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steward,&rdquo; I thundered.&nbsp; My nerves were so
shaken that I could not govern my voice and conceal my
agitation.&nbsp; This was the sort of thing that made my
terrifically whiskered mate tap his forehead with his
forefinger.&nbsp; I had detected him using that gesture while
talking on deck with a confidential air to the carpenter.&nbsp;
It was too far to hear a word, but I had no doubt that this
pantomime could only refer to the strange new captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the pale-faced steward turned
resignedly to me.&nbsp; It was this maddening course of being
shouted at, checked without rhyme or reason, arbitrarily chased
out of my cabin, suddenly called into it, sent flying out of his
pantry on incomprehensible errands, that accounted for the
growing wretchedness of his expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going with that coat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your room, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there another shower coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&nbsp; Shall I
go up again and see, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! never mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My object was attained, as of course my other self in there
would have heard everything that passed.&nbsp; During this
interlude my two officers never raised their eyes off their
respective plates; but the lip of that confounded cub, the second
mate, quivered visibly.</p>
<p>I expected the steward to hook my coat on and come out at
once.&nbsp; He was very slow about it; but I dominated my
nervousness sufficiently not to shout after him.&nbsp; Suddenly I
became aware (it could be heard plainly enough) that the fellow
for some reason or other was opening the door of the
bath-room.&nbsp; It was the end.&nbsp; The place was literally
not big enough to swing a cat in.&nbsp; My voice died in my
throat and I went stony all over.&nbsp; I expected to hear a yell
of surprise and terror, and made a movement, but had not the
strength to get on my legs.&nbsp; Everything remained
still.&nbsp; Had my second self taken the poor wretch by the
throat?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what I would have done next
moment if I had not seen the steward come out of my room, close
the door, and then stand quietly by the sideboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saved,&rdquo; I thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, no!&nbsp;
Lost!&nbsp; Gone!&nbsp; He was gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laid my knife and fork down and leaned back in my
chair.&nbsp; My head swam.&nbsp; After a while, when sufficiently
recovered to speak in a steady voice, I instructed my mate to put
the ship round at eight o&rsquo;clock himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come on deck,&rdquo; I went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll turn in, and unless the wind shifts I
don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed before midnight.&nbsp; I feel a
bit seedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did look middling bad a little while ago,&rdquo;
the chief mate remarked without showing any great concern.</p>
<p>They both went out, and I stared at the steward clearing the
table.&nbsp; There was nothing to be read on that wretched
man&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; But why did he avoid my eyes I asked
myself.&nbsp; Then I thought I should like to hear the sound of
his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; Startled as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you hang up that coat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the bath-room, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; The usual anxious
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not quite dry yet, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time longer I sat in the cuddy.&nbsp; Had my double
vanished as he had come?&nbsp; But of his coming there was an
explanation, whereas his disappearance would be inexplicable. . .
. I went slowly into my dark room, shut the door, lighted the
lamp, and for a time dared not turn round.&nbsp; When at last I
did I saw him standing bolt-upright in the narrow recessed
part.&nbsp; It would not be true to say I had a shock, but an
irresistible doubt of his bodily existence flitted through my
mind.&nbsp; Can it be, I asked myself, that he is not visible to
other eyes than mine?&nbsp; It was like being haunted.&nbsp;
Motionless, with a grave face, he raised his hands slightly at me
in a gesture which meant clearly, &ldquo;Heavens! what a narrow
escape!&rdquo;&nbsp; Narrow indeed.&nbsp; I think I had come
creeping quietly as near insanity as any man who has not actually
gone over the border.&nbsp; That gesture restrained me, so to
speak.</p>
<p>The mate with the terrific whiskers was now putting the ship
on the other tack.&nbsp; In the moment of profound silence which
follows upon the hands going to their stations I heard on the
poop his raised voice: &ldquo;Hard alee!&rdquo; and the distant
shout of the order repeated on the maindeck.&nbsp; The sails, in
that light breeze, made but a faint fluttering noise.&nbsp; It
ceased.&nbsp; The ship was coming round slowly; I held my breath
in the renewed stillness of expectation; one wouldn&rsquo;t have
thought that there was a single living soul on her decks.&nbsp; A
sudden brisk shout, &ldquo;Mainsail haul!&rdquo; broke the spell,
and in the noisy cries and rush overhead of the men running away
with the main-brace we two, down in my cabin, came together in
our usual position by the bed-place.</p>
<p>He did not wait for my question.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard him
fumbling here and just managed to squat myself down in the
bath,&rdquo; he whispered to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fellow only
opened the door and put his arm in to hang the coat up.&nbsp; All
the same&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; I whispered back, even
more appalled than before at the closeness of the shave, and
marvelling at that something unyielding in his character which
was carrying him through so finely.&nbsp; There was no agitation
in his whisper.&nbsp; Whoever was being driven distracted, it was
not he.&nbsp; He was sane.&nbsp; And the proof of his sanity was
continued when he took up the whispering again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would never do for me to come to life
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was something that a ghost might have said.&nbsp; But what
he was alluding to was his old captain&rsquo;s reluctant
admission of the theory of suicide.&nbsp; It would obviously
serve his turn&mdash;if I had understood at all the view which
seemed to govern the unalterable purpose of his action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must maroon me as soon as ever you can get amongst
these islands off the Cambodje shore,&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maroon you!&nbsp; We are not living in a boy&rsquo;s
adventure tale,&rdquo; I protested.&nbsp; His scornful whispering
took me up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t indeed!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing of
a boy&rsquo;s tale in this.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s nothing else
for it.&nbsp; I want no more.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t suppose I am
afraid of what can be done to me?&nbsp; Prison or gallows or
whatever they may please.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t see me coming
back to explain such things to an old fellow in a wig and twelve
respectable tradesmen, do you?&nbsp; What can they know whether I
am guilty or not&mdash;or of <i>what</i> I am guilty,
either?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my affair.&nbsp; What does the Bible
say?&nbsp; &lsquo;Driven off the face of the earth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Very well.&nbsp; I am off the face of the earth now.&nbsp; As I
came at night so I shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t? . . . Not naked like a soul on the Day of
Judgment.&nbsp; I shall freeze on to this sleeping-suit.&nbsp;
The Last Day is not yet&mdash;and you have understood
thoroughly.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt suddenly ashamed of myself.&nbsp; I may say truly that
I understood&mdash;and my hesitation in letting that man swim
away from my ship&rsquo;s side had been a mere sham sentiment, a
sort of cowardice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done now till next night,&rdquo; I
breathed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ship is on the off-shore tack and
the wind may fail us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as I know that you understand,&rdquo; he
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But of course you do.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
great satisfaction to have got somebody to understand.&nbsp; You
seem to have been there on purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the same
whisper, as if we two whenever we talked had to say things to
each other which were not fit for the world to hear, he added,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very wonderful.&rdquo;&nbsp; We remained side
by side talking in our secret way&mdash;but sometimes silent or
just exchanging a whispered word or two at long intervals.&nbsp;
And as usual he stared through the port.&nbsp; A breath of wind
came now and again into our faces.&nbsp; The ship might have been
moored in dock, so gently and on an even keel she slipped through
the water, that did not murmur even at our passage, shadowy and
silent like a phantom sea.</p>
<p>At midnight I went on deck, and to my mate&rsquo;s great
surprise put the ship round on the other tack.&nbsp; His terrible
whiskers flitted round me in silent criticism.&nbsp; I certainly
should not have done it if it had been only a question of getting
out of that sleepy gulf as quickly as possible.&nbsp; I believe
he told the second mate, who relieved him, that it was a great
want of judgment.&nbsp; The other only yawned.&nbsp; That
intolerable cub shuffled about so sleepily and lolled against the
rails in such a slack, improper fashion that I came down on him
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you properly awake yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&nbsp; I am awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, be good enough to hold yourself as if you
were.&nbsp; And keep a look-out.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s any
current we&rsquo;ll be closing with some islands before
daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The east side of the gulf is fringed with islands, some
solitary, others in groups.&nbsp; On the blue background of the
high coast they seem to float on silvery patches of calm water,
arid and grey, or dark green and rounded like clumps of evergreen
bushes, with the larger ones, a mile or two long, showing the
outlines of ridges, ribs of grey rock under the dank mantle of
matted leafage.&nbsp; Unknown to trade, to travel, almost to
geography, the manner of life they harbour is an unsolved
secret.&nbsp; There must be villages&mdash;settlements of
fishermen at least&mdash;on the largest of them, and some
communication with the world is probably kept up by native
craft.&nbsp; But all that forenoon, as we headed for them, fanned
along by the faintest of breezes, I saw no sign of man or canoe
in the field of the telescope I kept on pointing at the scattered
group.</p>
<p>At noon I gave no orders for a change of course, and the
mate&rsquo;s whiskers became much concerned and seemed to be
offering themselves unduly to my notice.&nbsp; At last I
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to stand right in.&nbsp; Quite in&mdash;as
far as I can take her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stare of extreme surprise imparted an air of ferocity also
to his eyes, and he looked truly terrific for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not doing well in the middle of the
gulf,&rdquo; I continued, casually.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am going to
look for the land breezes to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&nbsp; Do you mean, sir, in the dark
amongst the lot of all them islands and reefs and
shoals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;if there are any regular land breezes at all
on this coast one must get close inshore to find them,
mustn&rsquo;t one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed again under his
breath.&nbsp; All that afternoon he wore a dreamy, contemplative
appearance which in him was a mark of perplexity.&nbsp; After
dinner I went into my stateroom as if I meant to take some
rest.&nbsp; There we two bent our dark heads over a half-unrolled
chart lying on my bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be
Koh-ring.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been looking at it ever since
sunrise.&nbsp; It has got two hills and a low point.&nbsp; It
must be inhabited.&nbsp; And on the coast opposite there is what
looks like the mouth of a biggish river&mdash;with some town, no
doubt, not far up.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the best chance for you that
I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything.&nbsp; Koh-ring let it be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked thoughtfully at the chart as if surveying chances
and distances from a lofty height&mdash;and following with his
eyes his own figure wandering on the blank land of Cochin-China,
and then passing off that piece of paper clean out of sight into
uncharted regions.&nbsp; And it was as if the ship had two
captains to plan her course for her.&nbsp; I had been so worried
and restless running up and down that I had not had the patience
to dress that day.&nbsp; I had remained in my sleeping-suit, with
straw slippers and a soft floppy hat.&nbsp; The closeness of the
heat in the gulf had been most oppressive, and the crew were used
to see me wandering in that airy attire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will clear the south point as she heads now,&rdquo;
I whispered into his ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Goodness only knows when,
though, but certainly after dark.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll edge her in to
half a mile, as far as I may be able to judge in the
dark&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; he murmured, warningly&mdash;and I
realised suddenly that all my future, the only future for which I
was fit, would perhaps go irretrievably to pieces in any mishap
to my first command.</p>
<p>I could not stop a moment longer in the room.&nbsp; I motioned
him to get out of sight and made my way on the poop.&nbsp; That
unplayful cub had the watch.&nbsp; I walked up and down for a
while thinking things out, then beckoned him over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send a couple of hands to open the two quarterdeck
ports,&rdquo; I said, mildly.</p>
<p>He actually had the impudence, or else so forgot himself in
his wonder at such an incomprehensible order, as to repeat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the quarter-deck ports!&nbsp; What for,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only reason you need concern yourself about is
because I tell you to do so.&nbsp; Have them open wide and
fastened properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reddened and went off, but I believe made some jeering
remark to the carpenter as to the sensible practice of
ventilating a ship&rsquo;s quarter-deck.&nbsp; I know he popped
into the mate&rsquo;s cabin to impart the fact to him because the
whiskers came on deck, as it were by chance, and stole glances at
me from below&mdash;for signs of lunacy or drunkenness, I
suppose.</p>
<p>A little before supper, feeling more restless than ever, I
rejoined, for a moment, my second self.&nbsp; And to find him
sitting so quietly was surprising, like something against nature,
inhuman.</p>
<p>I developed my plan in a hurried whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stand in as close as I dare and then put her
round.&nbsp; I shall presently find means to smuggle you out of
here into the sail-locker, which communicates with the
lobby.&nbsp; But there is an opening, a sort of square for
hauling the sails out, which gives straight on the quarter-deck
and which is never closed in fine weather, so as to give air to
the sails.&nbsp; When the ship&rsquo;s way is deadened in stays
and all the hands are aft at the main-braces you shall have a
clear road to slip out and get overboard through the open
quarter-deck port.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had them both fastened
up.&nbsp; Use a rope&rsquo;s end to lower yourself into the water
so as to avoid a splash&mdash;you know.&nbsp; It could be heard
and cause some beastly complication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept silent for a while, then whispered, &ldquo;I
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be there to see you go,&rdquo; I began
with an effort.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rest . . . I only hope I have
understood, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have.&nbsp; From first to last&rdquo;&mdash;and for
the first time there seemed to be a faltering, something strained
in his whisper.&nbsp; He caught hold of my arm, but the ringing
of the supper bell made me start.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t, though;
he only released his grip.</p>
<p>After supper I didn&rsquo;t come below again till well past
eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The faint, steady breeze was loaded
with dew; and the wet, darkened sails held all there was of
propelling power in it.&nbsp; The night, clear and starry,
sparkled darkly, and the opaque, lightless patches shifting
slowly against the low stars were the drifting islets.&nbsp; On
the port bow there was a big one more distant and shadowily
imposing by the great space of sky it eclipsed.</p>
<p>On opening the door I had a back view of my very own self
looking at a chart.&nbsp; He had come out of the recess and was
standing near the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite dark enough,&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>He stepped back and leaned against my bed with a level, quiet
glance.&nbsp; I sat on the couch.&nbsp; We had nothing to say to
each other.&nbsp; Over our heads the officer of the watch moved
here and there.&nbsp; Then I heard him move quickly.&nbsp; I knew
what that meant.&nbsp; He was making for the companion; and
presently his voice was outside my door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are drawing in pretty fast, sir.&nbsp; Land looks
rather close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am coming
on deck directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I waited till he was gone out of the cuddy, then rose.&nbsp;
My double moved too.&nbsp; The time had come to exchange our last
whispers, for neither of us was ever to hear each other&rsquo;s
natural voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; I opened a drawer and took out three
sovereigns.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take this, anyhow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got
six and I&rsquo;d give you the lot, only I must keep a little
money to buy some fruit and vegetables for the crew from native
boats as we go through Sunda Straits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; I urged him, whispering
desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one can tell what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled and slapped meaningly the only pocket of the
sleeping-jacket.&nbsp; It was not safe, certainly.&nbsp; But I
produced a large old silk handkerchief of mine, and tying the
three pieces of gold in a corner, pressed it on him.&nbsp; He was
touched, I suppose, because he took it at last and tied it
quickly round his waist under the jacket, on his bare skin.</p>
<p>Our eyes met; several seconds elapsed, till, our glances still
mingled, I extended my hand and turned the lamp out.&nbsp; Then I
passed through the cuddy, leaving the door of my room wide open.
. . . . &ldquo;Steward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still lingering in the pantry in the greatness of his
zeal, giving a rub-up to a plated cruet stand the last thing
before going to bed.&nbsp; Being careful not to wake up the mate,
whose room was opposite, I spoke in an undertone.</p>
<p>He looked round anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get me a little hot water from the
galley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, sir, the galley fire&rsquo;s been out for
some time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fled up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I whispered, loudly, into the
saloon&mdash;too loudly, perhaps, but I was afraid I
couldn&rsquo;t make a sound.&nbsp; He was by my side in an
instant&mdash;the double captain slipped past the
stairs&mdash;through a tiny dark passage . . . a sliding
door.&nbsp; We were in the sail-locker, scrambling on our knees
over the sails.&nbsp; A sudden thought struck me.&nbsp; I saw
myself wandering barefooted, bareheaded, the sun beating on my
dark poll.&nbsp; I snatched off my floppy hat and tried hurriedly
in the dark to ram it on my other self.&nbsp; He dodged and
fended off silently.&nbsp; I wonder what he thought had come to
me before he understood and suddenly desisted.&nbsp; Our hands
met gropingly, lingered united in a steady, motionless clasp for
a second. . . . No word was breathed by either of us when they
separated.</p>
<p>I was standing quietly by the pantry door when the steward
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir.&nbsp; Kettle barely warm.&nbsp; Shall I
light the spirit-lamp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I came out on deck slowly.&nbsp; It was now a matter of
conscience to shave the land as close as possible&mdash;for now
he must go overboard whenever the ship was put in stays.&nbsp;
Must!&nbsp; There could be no going back for him.&nbsp; After a
moment I walked over to leeward and my heart flew into my mouth
at the nearness of the land on the bow.&nbsp; Under any other
circumstances I would not have held on a minute longer.&nbsp; The
second mate had followed me anxiously.</p>
<p>I looked on till I felt I could command my voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She will weather,&rdquo; I said then in a quiet
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you going to try that, sir?&rdquo; he
stammered out incredulously.</p>
<p>I took no notice of him and raised my tone just enough to be
heard by the helmsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her good full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good full, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind fanned my cheek, the sails slept, the world was
silent.&nbsp; The strain of watching the dark loom of the land
grow bigger and denser was too much for me.&nbsp; I had shut my
eyes&mdash;because the ship must go closer.&nbsp; She must!&nbsp;
The stillness was intolerable.&nbsp; Were we standing still?</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes the second view started my heart with a
thump.&nbsp; The black southern hill of Koh-ring seemed to hang
right over the ship like a towering fragment of the everlasting
night.&nbsp; On that enormous mass of blackness there was not a
gleam to be seen, not a sound to be heard.&nbsp; It was gliding
irresistibly toward us and yet seemed already within reach of the
hand.&nbsp; I saw the vague figures of the watch grouped in the
waist, gazing in awed silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going on, sir,&rdquo; inquired an unsteady
voice at my elbow.</p>
<p>I ignored it.&nbsp; I had to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her full.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t check her way.&nbsp;
That won&rsquo;t do now,&rdquo; I said, warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the sails very well,&rdquo; the
helmsman answered me, in strange, quavering tones.</p>
<p>Was she close enough?&nbsp; Already she was, I won&rsquo;t say
in the shadow of the land, but in the very blackness of it,
already swallowed up as it were, gone too close to be recalled,
gone from me altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give the mate a call,&rdquo; I said to the young man
who stood at my elbow as still as death.&nbsp; &ldquo;And turn
all hands up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My tone had a borrowed loudness reverberated from the height
of the land.&nbsp; Several voices cried out together: &ldquo;We
are all on deck, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then stillness again, with the great shadow gliding closer,
towering higher, without a light, without a sound.&nbsp; Such a
hush had fallen on the ship that she might have been a bark of
the dead floating in slowly under the very gate of Erebus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&nbsp; Where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the mate moaning at my elbow.&nbsp; He was
thunderstruck, and as it were deprived of the moral support of
his whiskers.&nbsp; He clapped his hands and absolutely cried
out, &ldquo;Lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; I said, sternly.</p>
<p>He lowered his tone, but I saw the shadowy gesture of his
despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are we doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for the land wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made as if to tear his hair, and addressed me
recklessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will never get out.&nbsp; You have done it,
sir.&nbsp; I knew it&rsquo;d end in something like this.&nbsp;
She will never weather, and you are too close now to stay.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll drift ashore before she&rsquo;s round.&nbsp; O my
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I caught his arm as he was raising it to batter his poor
devoted head, and shook it violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ashore already,&rdquo; he wailed, trying to
tear himself away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she? . . . Keep good full there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good full, sir,&rdquo; cried the helmsman in a
frightened, thin, child-like voice.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t let go the mate&rsquo;s arm and went on shaking
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ready about, do you hear?&nbsp; You go
forward&rdquo;&mdash;shake&mdash;&ldquo;and stop
there&rdquo;&mdash;shake&mdash;&ldquo;and hold your
noise&rdquo;&mdash;shake&mdash;&ldquo;and see these head-sheets
properly overhauled&rdquo;&mdash;shake, shake&mdash;shake.</p>
<p>And all the time I dared not look toward the land lest my
heart should fail me.&nbsp; I released my grip at last and he ran
forward as if fleeing for dear life.</p>
<p>I wondered what my double there in the sail-locker thought of
this commotion.&nbsp; He was able to hear everything&mdash;and
perhaps he was able to understand why, on my conscience, it had
to be thus close&mdash;no less.&nbsp; My first order &ldquo;Hard
alee!&rdquo; re-echoed ominously under the towering shadow of
Koh-ring as if I had shouted in a mountain gorge.&nbsp; And then
I watched the land intently.&nbsp; In that smooth water and light
wind it was impossible to feel the ship coming-to.&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; I could not feel her.&nbsp; And my second self was
making now ready to slip out and lower himself overboard.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was gone already . . .?</p>
<p>The great black mass brooding over our very mastheads began to
pivot away from the ship&rsquo;s side silently.&nbsp; And now I
forgot the secret stranger ready to depart, and remembered only
that I was a total stranger to the ship.&nbsp; I did not know
her.&nbsp; Would she do it?&nbsp; How was she to be handled?</p>
<p>I swung the mainyard and waited helplessly.&nbsp; She was
perhaps stopped, and her very fate hung in the balance, with the
black mass of Koh-ring like the gate of the everlasting night
towering over her taffrail.&nbsp; What would she do now?&nbsp;
Had she way on her yet?&nbsp; I stepped to the side swiftly, and
on the shadowy water I could see nothing except a faint
phosphorescent flash revealing the glassy smoothness of the
sleeping surface.&nbsp; It was impossible to tell&mdash;and I had
not learned yet the feel of my ship.&nbsp; Was she moving?&nbsp;
What I needed was something easily seen, a piece of paper, which
I could throw overboard and watch.&nbsp; I had nothing on
me.&nbsp; To run down for it I didn&rsquo;t dare.&nbsp; There was
no time.&nbsp; All at once my strained, yearning stare
distinguished a white object floating within a yard of the
ship&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; White on the black water.&nbsp; A
phosphorescent flash passed under it.&nbsp; What was that thing?
. . . I recognised my own floppy hat.&nbsp; It must have fallen
off his head . . . and he didn&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p>Now I had what I wanted&mdash;the saving mark for my
eyes.&nbsp; But I hardly thought of my other self, now gone from
the ship, to be hidden forever from all friendly faces, to be a
fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, with no brand of the curse
on his sane forehead to stay a slaying hand . . . too proud to
explain.</p>
<p>And I watched the hat&mdash;the expression of my sudden pity
for his mere flesh.&nbsp; It had been meant to save his homeless
head from the dangers of the sun.&nbsp; And
now&mdash;behold&mdash;it was saving the ship, by serving me for
a mark to help out the ignorance of my strangeness.&nbsp;
Ha!&nbsp; It was drifting forward, warning me just in time that
the ship had gathered sternway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shift the helm,&rdquo; I said in a low voice to the
seaman standing still like a statue.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes glistened wildly in the binnacle light as
he jumped round to the other side and spun round the wheel.</p>
<p>I walked to the break of the poop.&nbsp; On the overshadowed
deck all hands stood by the forebraces waiting for my
order.&nbsp; The stars ahead seemed to be gliding from right to
left.&nbsp; And all was so still in the world that I heard the
quiet remark &ldquo;She&rsquo;s round,&rdquo; passed in a tone of
intense relief between two seamen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go and haul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreyards ran round with a great noise, amidst cheery
cries.&nbsp; And now the frightful whisker&rsquo;s made
themselves heard giving various orders.&nbsp; Already the ship
was drawing ahead.&nbsp; And I was alone with her.&nbsp; Nothing!
no one in the world should stand now between us, throwing a
shadow on the way of silent knowledge and mute affection, the
perfect communion of a seaman with his first command.</p>
<p>Walking to the taffrail, I was in time to make out, on the
very edge of a darkness thrown by a towering black mass like the
very gateway of Erebus&mdash;yes, I was in time to catch an
evanescent glimpse of my white hat left behind to mark the spot
where the secret sharer of my cabin and of my thoughts, as though
he were my second self, had lowered himself into the water to
take his punishment: a free man, a proud swimmer striking out for
a new destiny.</p>

161</span>FREYA OF THE SEVEN ISLES<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A STORY OF SHALLOW WATERS</span></h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day&mdash;and that day was many
years ago now&mdash;I received a long, chatty letter from one of
my old chums and fellow-wanderers in Eastern waters.&nbsp; He was
still out there, but settled down, and middle-aged; I imagined
him&mdash;grown portly in figure and domestic in his habits; in
short, overtaken by the fate common to all except to those who,
being specially beloved by the gods, get knocked on the head
early.&nbsp; The letter was of the reminiscent &ldquo;do you
remember&rdquo; kind&mdash;a wistful letter of backward
glances.&nbsp; And, amongst other things, &ldquo;surely you
remember old Nelson,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Remember old Nelson!&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; And to begin with,
his name was not Nelson.&nbsp; The Englishmen in the Archipelago
called him Nelson because it was more convenient, I suppose, and
he never protested.&nbsp; It would have been mere pedantry.&nbsp;
The true form of his name was Nielsen.&nbsp; He had come out East
long before the advent of telegraph cables, had served English
firms, had married an English girl, had been one of us for years,
trading and sailing in all directions through the Eastern
Archipelago, across and around, transversely, diagonally,
perpendicularly, in semi-circles, and zigzags, and figures of
eights, for years and years.</p>
<p>There was no nook or cranny of these tropical waters that the
enterprise of old Nelson (or Nielsen) had not penetrated in an
eminently pacific way.&nbsp; His tracks, if plotted out, would
have covered the map of the Archipelago like a cobweb&mdash;all
of it, with the sole exception of the Philippines.&nbsp; He would
never approach that part, from a strange dread of Spaniards, or,
to be exact, of the Spanish authorities.&nbsp; What he imagined
they could do to him it is impossible to say.&nbsp; Perhaps at
some time in his life he had read some stories of the
Inquisition.</p>
<p>But he was in general afraid of what he called
&ldquo;authorities&rdquo;; not the English authorities, which he
trusted and respected, but the other two of that part of the
world.&nbsp; He was not so horrified at the Dutch as he was at
the Spaniards, but he was even more mistrustful of them.&nbsp;
Very mistrustful indeed.&nbsp; The Dutch, in his view, were
capable of &ldquo;playing any ugly trick on a man&rdquo; who had
the misfortune to displease them.&nbsp; There were their laws and
regulations, but they had no notion of fair play in applying
them.&nbsp; It was really pitiable to see the anxious
circumspection of his dealings with some official or other, and
remember that this man had been known to stroll up to a village
of cannibals in New Guinea in a quiet, fearless manner (and note
that he was always fleshy all his life, and, if I may say so, an
appetising morsel) on some matter of barter that did not amount
perhaps to fifty pounds in the end.</p>
<p>Remember old Nelson!&nbsp; Rather!&nbsp; Truly, none of us in
my generation had known him in his active days.&nbsp; He was
&ldquo;retired&rdquo; in our time.&nbsp; He had bought, or else
leased, part of a small island from the Sultan of a little group
called the Seven Isles, not far north from Banka.&nbsp; It was, I
suppose, a legitimate transaction, but I have no doubt that had
he been an Englishman the Dutch would have discovered a reason to
fire him out without ceremony.&nbsp; In this connection the real
form of his name stood him in good stead.&nbsp; In the character
of an unassuming Dane whose conduct was most correct, they let
him be.&nbsp; With all his money engaged in cultivation he was
naturally careful not to give even the shadow of offence, and it
was mostly for prudential reasons of that sort that he did not
look with a favourable eye on Jasper Allen.&nbsp; But of that
later.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; One remembered well enough old
Nelson&rsquo;s big, hospitable bungalow erected on a shelving
point of land, his portly form, costumed generally in a white
shirt and trousers (he had a confirmed habit of taking off his
alpaca jacket on the slightest provocation), his round blue eyes,
his straggly, sandy-white moustache sticking out all ways like
the quills of the fretful porcupine, his propensity to sit down
suddenly and fan himself with his hat.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no
use concealing the fact that what one remembered really was his
daughter, who at that time came out to live with him&mdash;and be
a sort of Lady of the Isles.</p>
<p>Freya Nelson (or Nielsen) was the kind of girl one
remembers.&nbsp; The oval of her face was perfect; and within
that fascinating frame the most happy disposition of line and
feature, with an admirable complexion, gave an impression of
health, strength, and what I might call unconscious
self-confidence&mdash;a most pleasant and, as it were, whimsical
determination.&nbsp; I will not compare her eyes to violets,
because the real shade of their colour was peculiar, not so dark
and more lustrous.&nbsp; They were of the wide-open kind, and
looked at one frankly in every mood.&nbsp; I never did see the
long, dark eyelashes lowered&mdash;I dare say Jasper Allen did,
being a privileged person&mdash;but I have no doubt that the
expression must have been charming in a complex way.&nbsp; She
could&mdash;Jasper told me once with a touchingly imbecile
exultation&mdash;sit on her hair.&nbsp; I dare say, I dare
say.&nbsp; It was not for me to behold these wonders; I was
content to admire the neat and becoming way she used to do it up
so as not to conceal the good shape of her head.&nbsp; And this
wealth of hair was so glossy that when the screens of the west
verandah were down, making a pleasant twilight there, or in the
shade of the grove of fruit-trees near the house, it seemed to
give out a golden light of its own.</p>
<p>She dressed generally in a white frock, with a skirt of
walking length, showing her neat, laced, brown boots.&nbsp; If
there was any colour about her costume it was just a bit of blue
perhaps.&nbsp; No exertion seemed to distress her.&nbsp; I have
seen her land from the dinghy after a long pull in the sun (she
rowed herself about a good deal) with no quickened breath and not
a single hair out of its place.&nbsp; In the morning when she
came out on the verandah for the first look westward, Sumatra
way, over the sea, she seemed as fresh and sparkling as a
dewdrop.&nbsp; But a dewdrop is evanescent, and there was nothing
evanescent about Freya.&nbsp; I remember her round, solid arms
with the fine wrists, and her broad, capable hands with tapering
fingers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether she was actually born at sea, but I
do know that up to twelve years of age she sailed about with her
parents in various ships.&nbsp; After old Nelson lost his wife it
became a matter of serious concern for him what to do with the
girl.&nbsp; A kind lady in Singapore, touched by his dumb grief
and deplorable perplexity, offered to take charge of Freya.&nbsp;
This arrangement lasted some six years, during which old Nelson
(or Nielsen) &ldquo;retired&rdquo; and established, himself on
his island, and then it was settled (the kind lady going away to
Europe) that his daughter should join him.</p>
<p>As the first and most important preparation for that event the
old fellow ordered from his Singapore agent a Steyn and
Ebhart&rsquo;s &ldquo;upright grand.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was then
commanding a little steamer in the island trade, and it fell to
my lot to take it out to him, so I know something of
Freya&rsquo;s &ldquo;upright grand.&rdquo;&nbsp; We landed the
enormous packing-case with difficulty on a flat piece of rock
amongst some bushes, nearly knocking the bottom out of one of my
boats in the course of that nautical operation.&nbsp; Then, all
my crew assisting, engineers and firemen included, by the
exercise of much anxious ingenuity, and by means of rollers,
levers, tackles, and inclined planes of soaped planks, toiling in
the sun like ancient Egyptians at the building of a pyramid, we
got it as far as the house and up on to the edge of the west
verandah&mdash;which was the actual drawing-room of the
bungalow.&nbsp; There, the case being ripped off cautiously, the
beautiful rosewood monster stood revealed at last.&nbsp; In
reverent excitement we coaxed it against the wall and drew the
first free breath of the day.&nbsp; It was certainly the heaviest
movable object on that islet since the creation of the
world.&nbsp; The volume of sound it gave out in that bungalow
(which acted as a sounding-board) was really astonishing.&nbsp;
It thundered sweetly right over the sea.&nbsp; Jasper Allen told
me that early of a morning on the deck of the <i>Bonito</i> (his
wonderfully fast and pretty brig) he could hear Freya playing her
scales quite distinctly.&nbsp; But the fellow always anchored
foolishly close to the point, as I told him more than once.&nbsp;
Of course, these seas are almost uniformly serene, and the Seven
Isles is a particularly calm and cloudless spot as a rule.&nbsp;
But still, now and again, an afternoon thunderstorm over Banka,
or even one of these vicious thick squalls, from the distant
Sumatra coast, would make a sudden sally upon the group,
enveloping it for a couple of hours in whirlwinds and
bluish-black murk of a particularly sinister aspect.&nbsp; Then,
with the lowered rattan-screens rattling desperately in the wind
and the bungalow shaking all over, Freya would sit down to the
piano and play fierce Wagner music in the flicker of blinding
flashes, with thunderbolts falling all round, enough to make your
hair stand on end; and Jasper would remain stock still on the
verandah, adoring the back view of her supple, swaying figure,
the miraculous sheen of her fair head, the rapid hands on the
keys, the white nape of her neck&mdash;while the brig, down at
the point there, surged at her cables within a hundred yards of
nasty, shiny, black rock-heads.&nbsp; Ugh!</p>
<p>And this, if you please, for no reason but that, when he went
on board at night and laid his head on the pillow, he should feel
that he was as near as he could conveniently get to his Freya
slumbering in the bungalow.&nbsp; Did you ever!&nbsp; And, mind,
this brig was the home to be&mdash;their home&mdash;the floating
paradise which he was gradually fitting out like a yacht to sail
his life blissfully away in with Freya.&nbsp; Imbecile!&nbsp; But
the fellow was always taking chances.</p>
<p>One day, I remember I watched with Freya on the verandah the
brig approaching the point from the northward.&nbsp; I suppose
Jasper made the girl out with his long glass.&nbsp; What does he
do?&nbsp; Instead of standing on for another mile and a half
along the shoals and then tacking for the anchorage in a proper
and seamanlike manner, he spies a gap between two disgusting old
jagged reefs, puts the helm down suddenly, and shoots the brig
through, with all her sails shaking and rattling, so that we
could hear the racket on the verandah.&nbsp; I drew my breath
through my teeth, I can tell you, and Freya swore.&nbsp;
Yes!&nbsp; She clenched her capable fists and stamped with her
pretty brown boot and said &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
looking at me with a little heightened colour&mdash;not
much&mdash;she remarked, &ldquo;I forgot you were there,&rdquo;
and laughed.&nbsp; To be sure, to be sure.&nbsp; When Jasper was
in sight she was not likely to remember that anybody else in the
world was there.&nbsp; In my concern at this mad trick I
couldn&rsquo;t help appealing to her sympathetic common
sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a fool?&rdquo; I said with feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect idiot,&rdquo; she agreed warmly, looking at me
straight with her wide-open, earnest eyes and the dimple of a
smile on her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; I pointed out to her, &ldquo;just to
save twenty minutes or so in meeting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We heard the anchor go down, and then she became very resolute
and threatening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll teach him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went into her own room and shut the door, leaving me alone
on the verandah with my instructions.&nbsp; Long before the
brig&rsquo;s sails were furled, Jasper came up three steps at a
time, forgetting to say how d&rsquo;ye do, and looking right and
left eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Freya?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t she here just
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I explained to him that he was to be deprived of Miss
Freya&rsquo;s presence for a whole hour, &ldquo;just to teach
him,&rdquo; he said I had put her up to it, no doubt, and that he
feared he would have yet to shoot me some day.&nbsp; She and I
were getting too thick together.&nbsp; Then he flung himself into
a chair, and tried to talk to me about his trip.&nbsp; But the
funny thing was that the fellow actually suffered.&nbsp; I could
see it.&nbsp; His voice failed him, and he sat there dumb,
looking at the door with the face of a man in pain.&nbsp; Fact. .
. . And the next still funnier thing was that the girl calmly
walked out of her room in less than ten minutes.&nbsp; And then I
left.&nbsp; I mean to say that I went away to seek old Nelson (or
Nielsen) on the back verandah, which was his own special nook in
the distribution of that house, with the kind purpose of engaging
him in conversation lest he should start roaming about and
intrude unwittingly where he was not wanted just then.</p>
<p>He knew that the brig had arrived, though he did not know that
Jasper was already with his daughter.&nbsp; I suppose he
didn&rsquo;t think it was possible in the time.&nbsp; A father
naturally wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He suspected that Allen was sweet
on his girl; the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea, most
of the traders in the Archipelago, and all sorts and conditions
of men in the town of Singapore were aware of it.&nbsp; But he
was not capable of appreciating how far the girl was gone on the
fellow.&nbsp; He had an idea that Freya was too sensible to ever
be gone on anybody&mdash;I mean to an unmanageable extent.&nbsp;
No; it was not that which made him sit on the back verandah and
worry himself in his unassuming manner during Jasper&rsquo;s
visits.&nbsp; What he worried about were the Dutch
&ldquo;authorities.&rdquo;&nbsp; For it is a fact that the Dutch
looked askance at the doings of Jasper Allen, owner and master of
the brig <i>Bonito</i>.&nbsp; They considered him much too
enterprising in his trading.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that he
ever did anything illegal; but it seems to me that his immense
activity was repulsive to their stolid character and slow-going
methods.&nbsp; Anyway, in old Nelson&rsquo;s opinion, the captain
of the <i>Bonito</i> was a smart sailor, and a nice young man,
but not a desirable acquaintance upon the whole.&nbsp; Somewhat
compromising, you understand.&nbsp; On the other hand, he did not
like to tell Jasper in so many words to keep away.&nbsp; Poor old
Nelson himself was a nice fellow.&nbsp; I believe he would have
shrunk from hurting the feelings even of a mop-headed cannibal,
unless, perhaps, under very strong provocation.&nbsp; I mean the
feelings, not the bodies.&nbsp; As against spears, knives,
hatchets, clubs, or arrows, old Nelson had proved himself capable
of taking his own part.&nbsp; In every other respect he had a
timorous soul.&nbsp; So he sat on the back verandah with a
concerned expression, and whenever the voices of his daughter and
Jasper Allen reached him, he would blow out his cheeks and let
the air escape with a dismal sound, like a much tried man.</p>
<p>Naturally I derided his fears which he, more or less, confided
to me.&nbsp; He had a certain regard for my judgment, and a
certain respect, not for my moral qualities, however, but for the
good terms I was supposed to be on with the Dutch
&ldquo;authorities.&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew for a fact that his
greatest bugbear, the Governor of Banka&mdash;a charming,
peppery, hearty, retired rear-admiral&mdash;had a distinct liking
for him.&nbsp; This consoling assurance which I used always to
put forward, made old Nelson (or Nielsen) brighten up for a
moment; but in the end he would shake his head doubtfully, as
much as to say that this was all very well, but that there were
depths in the Dutch official nature which no one but himself had
ever fathomed.&nbsp; Perfectly ridiculous.</p>
<p>On this occasion I am speaking of, old Nelson was even fretty;
for while I was trying to entertain him with a very funny and
somewhat scandalous adventure which happened to a certain
acquaintance of ours in Saigon, he exclaimed suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil he wants to turn up here for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly he had not heard a word of the anecdote.&nbsp; And
this annoyed me, because the anecdote was really good.&nbsp; I
stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you know what Jasper Allen is turning up here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first open allusion I had ever made to the true
state of affairs between Jasper and his daughter.&nbsp; He took
it very calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Freya is a sensible girl!&rdquo; he murmured
absently, his mind&rsquo;s eye obviously fixed on the
&ldquo;authorities.&rdquo;&nbsp; No; Freya was no fool.&nbsp; He
was not concerned about that.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t mind it in
the least.&nbsp; The fellow was just company for her; he amused
the girl; nothing more.</p>
<p>When the perspicacious old chap left off mumbling, all was
still in the house.&nbsp; The other two were amusing themselves
very quietly, and no doubt very heartily.&nbsp; What more
absorbing and less noisy amusement could they have found than to
plan their future?&nbsp; Side by side on the verandah they must
have been looking at the brig, the third party in that
fascinating game.&nbsp; Without her there would have been no
future.&nbsp; She was the fortune and the home, and the great
free world for them.&nbsp; Who was it that likened a ship to a
prison?&nbsp; May I be ignominiously hanged at a yardarm if
that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; The white sails of that craft were the
white wings&mdash;pinions, I believe, would be the more poetical
style&mdash;well, the white pinions, of their soaring love.&nbsp;
Soaring as regards Jasper.&nbsp; Freya, being a woman, kept a
better hold of the mundane connections of this affair.</p>
<p>But Jasper was elevated in the true sense of the word ever
since the day when, after they had been gazing at the brig in one
of those decisive silences that alone establish a perfect
communion between creatures gifted with speech, he proposed that
she should share the ownership of that treasure with him.&nbsp;
Indeed, he presented the brig to her altogether.&nbsp; But then
his heart was in the brig since the day he bought her in Manilla
from a certain middle-aged Peruvian, in a sober suit of black
broadcloth, enigmatic and sententious, who, for all I know, might
have stolen her on the South American coast, whence he said he
had come over to the Philippines &ldquo;for family
reasons.&rdquo;&nbsp; This &ldquo;for family reasons&rdquo; was
distinctly good.&nbsp; No true <i>caballero</i> would care to
push on inquiries after such a statement.</p>
<p>Indeed, Jasper was quite the <i>caballero</i>.&nbsp; The brig
herself was then all black and enigmatical, and very dirty; a
tarnished gem of the sea, or, rather, a neglected work of
art.&nbsp; For he must have been an artist, the obscure builder
who had put her body together on lovely lines out of the hardest
tropical timber fastened with the purest copper.&nbsp; Goodness
only knows in what part of the world she was built.&nbsp; Jasper
himself had not been able to ascertain much of her history from
his sententious, saturnine Peruvian&mdash;if the fellow was a
Peruvian, and not the devil himself in disguise, as Jasper
jocularly pretended to believe.&nbsp; My opinion is that she was
old enough to have been one of the last pirates, a slaver
perhaps, or else an opium clipper of the early days, if not an
opium smuggler.</p>
<p>However that may be, she was as sound as on the day she first
took the water, sailed like a witch, steered like a little boat,
and, like some fair women of adventurous life famous in history,
seemed to have the secret of perpetual youth; so that there was
nothing unnatural in Jasper Allen treating her like a
lover.&nbsp; And that treatment restored the lustre of her
beauty.&nbsp; He clothed her in many coats of the very best white
paint so skilfully, carefully, artistically put on and kept clean
by his badgered crew of picked Malays, that no costly enamel such
as jewellers use for their work could have looked better and felt
smoother to the touch.&nbsp; A narrow gilt moulding defined her
elegant sheer as she sat on the water, eclipsing easily the
professional good looks of any pleasure yacht that ever came to
the East in those days.&nbsp; For myself, I must say I prefer a
moulding of deep crimson colour on a white hull.&nbsp; It gives a
stronger relief besides being less expensive; and I told Jasper
so.&nbsp; But no, nothing less than the best gold-leaf would do,
because no decoration could be gorgeous enough for the future
abode of his Freya.</p>
<p>His feelings for the brig and for the girl were as
indissolubly united in his heart as you may fuse two precious
metals together in one crucible.&nbsp; And the flame was pretty
hot, I can assure you.&nbsp; It induced in him a fierce inward
restlessness both of activity and desire.&nbsp; Too fine in face,
with a lateral wave in his chestnut hair, spare, long-limbed,
with an eager glint in his steely eyes and quick, brusque
movements, he made me think sometimes of a flashing sword-blade
perpetually leaping out of the scabbard.&nbsp; It was only when
he was near the girl, when he had her there to look at, that this
peculiarly tense attitude was replaced by a grave devout
watchfulness of her slightest movements and utterances.&nbsp; Her
cool, resolute, capable, good-humoured self-possession seemed to
steady his heart.&nbsp; Was it the magic of her face, of her
voice, of her glances which calmed him so?&nbsp; Yet these were
the very things one must believe which had set his imagination
ablaze&mdash;if love begins in imagination.&nbsp; But I am no man
to discuss such mysteries, and it strikes me that we have
neglected poor old Nelson inflating his cheeks in a state of
worry on the back verandah.</p>
<p>I pointed out to him that, after all, Jasper was not a very
frequent visitor.&nbsp; He and his brig worked hard all over the
Archipelago.&nbsp; But all old Nelson said, and he said it
uneasily, was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Heemskirk won&rsquo;t turn up here while the
brig&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting up a scare about Heemskirk now!&nbsp; Heemskirk! . . .
Really, one hadn&rsquo;t the patience&mdash;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span>, pray, who was Heemskirk?&nbsp;
You shall see at once how unreasonable this dread of Heemskirk. .
. . Certainly, his nature was malevolent enough.&nbsp; That was
obvious, directly you heard him laugh.&nbsp; Nothing gives away
more a man&rsquo;s secret disposition than the unguarded ring of
his laugh.&nbsp; But, bless my soul! if we were to start at every
evil guffaw like a hare at every sound, we shouldn&rsquo;t be fit
for anything but the solitude of a desert, or the seclusion of a
hermitage.&nbsp; And even there we should have to put up with the
unavoidable company of the devil.</p>
<p>However, the devil is a considerable personage, who has known
better days and has moved high up in the hierarchy of Celestial
Host; but in the hierarchy of mere earthly Dutchmen, Heemskirk,
whose early days could not have been very splendid, was merely a
naval officer forty years of age, of no particular connections or
ability to boast of.&nbsp; He was commanding the <i>Neptun</i>, a
little gunboat employed on dreary patrol duty up and down the
Archipelago, to look after the traders.&nbsp; Not a very exalted
position truly.&nbsp; I tell you, just a common middle-aged
lieutenant of some twenty-five years&rsquo; service and sure to
be retired before long&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>He never bothered his head very much as to what was going on
in the Seven Isles group till he learned from some talk in Mintok
or Palembang, I suppose, that there was a pretty girl living
there.&nbsp; Curiosity, I presume, caused him to go poking around
that way, and then, after he had once seen Freya, he made a
practice of calling at the group whenever he found himself within
half a day&rsquo;s steaming from it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say that Heemskirk was a typical Dutch
naval officer.&nbsp; I have seen enough of them not to fall into
that absurd mistake.&nbsp; He had a big, clean-shaven face; great
flat, brown cheeks, with a thin, hooked nose and a small, pursy
mouth squeezed in between.&nbsp; There were a few silver threads
in his black hair, and his unpleasant eyes were nearly black,
too.&nbsp; He had a surly way of casting side glances without
moving his head, which was set low on a short, round neck.&nbsp;
A thick, round trunk in a dark undress jacket with gold
shoulder-straps, was sustained by a straddly pair of thick, round
legs, in white drill trousers.&nbsp; His round skull under a
white cap looked as if it were immensely thick too, but there
were brains enough in it to discover and take advantage
maliciously of poor old Nelson&rsquo;s nervousness before
everything that was invested with the merest shred of
authority.</p>
<p>Heemskirk would land on the point and perambulate silently
every part of the plantation as if the whole place belonged to
him, before her went to the house.&nbsp; On the verandah he would
take the best chair, and would stay for tiffin or dinner, just
simply stay on, without taking the trouble to invite himself by
so much as a word.</p>
<p>He ought to have been kicked, if only for his manner to Miss
Freya.&nbsp; Had he been a naked savage, armed with spears and
poisoned arrows, old Nelson (or Nielsen) would have gone for him
with his bare fists.&nbsp; But these gold
shoulder-straps&mdash;Dutch shoulder-straps at that&mdash;were
enough to terrify the old fellow; so he let the beggar treat him
with heavy contempt, devour his daughter with his eyes, and drink
the best part of his little stock of wine.</p>
<p>I saw something of this, and on one occasion I tried to pass a
remark on the subject.&nbsp; It was pitiable to see the trouble
in old Nelson&rsquo;s round eyes.&nbsp; At first he cried out
that the lieutenant was a good friend of his; a very good
fellow.&nbsp; I went on staring at him pretty hard, so that at
last he faltered, and had to own that, of course, Heemskirk was
not a very genial person outwardly, but all the same at bottom. .
. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet met a genial Dutchman out
here,&rdquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Geniality, after all, is
not of much consequence, but don&rsquo;t you
see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nelson looked suddenly so frightened at what I was going to
say that I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to go on.&nbsp; Of course, I
was going to tell him that the fellow was after his girl.&nbsp;
That just describes it exactly.&nbsp; What Heemskirk might have
expected or what he thought he could do, I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; For all I can tell, he might have imagined himself
irresistible, or have taken Freya for what she was not, on
account of her lively, assured, unconstrained manner.&nbsp; But
there it is.&nbsp; He was after that girl.&nbsp; Nelson could see
it well enough.&nbsp; Only he preferred to ignore it.&nbsp; He
did not want to be told of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I want is to live in peace and quietness with the
Dutch authorities,&rdquo; he mumbled shamefacedly.</p>
<p>He was incurable.&nbsp; I was sorry for him, and I really
think Miss Freya was sorry for her father, too.&nbsp; She
restrained herself for his sake, and as everything she did she
did it simply, unaffectedly, and even good humouredly.&nbsp; No
small effort that, because in Heemskirk&rsquo;s attentions there
was an insolent touch of scorn, hard to put up with.&nbsp;
Dutchmen of that sort are over-bearing to their inferiors, and
that officer of the king looked upon old Nelson and Freya as
quite beneath him in every way.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I felt sorry for Freya.&nbsp; She was not
the sort of girl to take anything tragically.&nbsp; One could
feel for her and sympathise with her difficulty, but she seemed
equal to any situation.&nbsp; It was rather admiration she
extorted by her competent serenity.&nbsp; It was only when Jasper
and Heemskirk were together at the bungalow, as it happened now
and then, that she felt the strain, and even then it was not for
everybody to see.&nbsp; My eyes alone could detect a faint shadow
on the radiance of her personality.&nbsp; Once I could not help
saying to her appreciatively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word you are wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let it pass with a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great thing is to prevent Jasper becoming
unreasonable,&rdquo; she said; and I could see real concern
lurking in the quiet depths of her frank eyes gazing straight at
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will help to keep him quiet, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we must keep him quiet,&rdquo; I declared,
understanding very well the nature of her anxiety.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a lunatic, too, when he&rsquo;s
roused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is!&rdquo; she assented, in a soft tone; for it was
our joke to speak of Jasper abusively.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I have
tamed him a bit.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s quite a good boy
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would squash Heemskirk like a blackbeetle all the
same,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that
wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she added quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Imagine
the state poor papa would get into.&nbsp; Besides, I mean to be
mistress of the dear brig and sail about these seas, not go off
wandering ten thousand miles away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner you are on board to look after the man and
the brig the better,&rdquo; I said seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
need you to steady them both a bit.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
Jasper will ever get sobered down till he has carried you off
from this island.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t see him when he is away
from you, as I do.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s in a state of perpetual
elation which almost frightens me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this she smiled again, and then looked serious.&nbsp; For
it could not be unpleasant to her to be told of her power, and
she had some sense of her responsibility.&nbsp; She slipped away
from me suddenly, because Heemskirk, with old Nelson in
attendance at his elbow, was coming up the steps of the
verandah.&nbsp; Directly his head came above the level of the
floor his ill-natured black eyes shot glances here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your girl, Nelson?&rdquo; he asked, in a
tone as if every soul in the world belonged to him.&nbsp; And
then to me: &ldquo;The goddess has flown, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nelson&rsquo;s Cove&mdash;as we used to call it&mdash;was
crowded with shipping that day.&nbsp; There was first my steamer,
then the <i>Neptun</i> gunboat further out, and the
<i>Bonito</i>, brig, anchored as usual so close inshore that it
looked as if, with a little skill and judgment, one could shy a
hat from the verandah on to her scrupulously holystoned
quarter-deck.&nbsp; Her brasses flashed like gold, her white
body-paint had a sheen like a satin robe.&nbsp; The rake of her
varnished spars and the big yards, squared to a hair, gave her a
sort of martial elegance.&nbsp; She was a beauty.&nbsp; No wonder
that in possession of a craft like that and the promise of a girl
like Freya, Jasper lived in a state of perpetual elation fit,
perhaps, for the seventh heaven, but not exactly safe in a world
like ours.</p>
<p>I remarked politely to Heemskirk that, with three guests in
the house, Miss Freya had no doubt domestic matters to attend
to.&nbsp; I knew, of course, that she had gone to meet Jasper at
a certain cleared spot on the banks of the only stream on
Nelson&rsquo;s little island.&nbsp; The commander of the
<i>Neptun</i> gave me a dubious black look, and began to make
himself at home, flinging his thick, cylindrical carcass into a
rocking-chair, and unbuttoning his coat.&nbsp; Old Nelson sat
down opposite him in a most unassuming manner, staring anxiously
with his round eyes and fanning himself with his hat.&nbsp; I
tried to make conversation to while the time away; not an easy
task with a morose, enamoured Dutchman constantly looking from
one door to another and answering one&rsquo;s advances either
with a jeer or a grunt.</p>
<p>However, the evening passed off all right.&nbsp; Luckily,
there is a degree of bliss too intense for elation.&nbsp; Jasper
was quiet and concentrated silently in watching Freya.&nbsp; As
we went on board our respective ships I offered to give his brig
a tow out next morning.&nbsp; I did it on purpose to get him away
at the earliest possible moment.&nbsp; So in the first cold light
of the dawn we passed by the gunboat lying black and still
without a sound in her at the mouth of the glassy cove.&nbsp; But
with tropical swiftness the sun had climbed twice its diameter
above the horizon before we had rounded the reef and got abreast
of the point.&nbsp; On the biggest boulder there stood Freya, all
in white and, in her helmet, like a feminine and martial statue
with a rosy face, as I could see very well with my glasses.&nbsp;
She fluttered an expressive handkerchief, and Jasper, running up
the main rigging of the white and warlike brig, waved his hat in
response.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards we parted, I to the northward
and Jasper heading east with a light wind on the quarter, for
Banjermassin and two other ports, I believe it was, that
trip.</p>
<p>This peaceful occasion was the last on which I saw all these
people assembled together; the charmingly fresh and resolute
Freya, the innocently round-eyed old Nelson, Jasper, keen, long
limbed, lean faced, admirably self-contained, in his manner,
because inconceivably happy under the eyes of his Freya; all
three tall, fair, and blue-eyed in varied shades, and amongst
them the swarthy, arrogant, black-haired Dutchman, shorter nearly
by a head, and so much thicker than any of them that he seemed to
be a creature capable of inflating itself, a grotesque specimen
of mankind from some other planet.</p>
<p>The contrast struck me all at once as we stood in the lighted
verandah, after rising from the dinner-table.&nbsp; I was
fascinated by it for the rest of the evening, and I remember the
impression of something funny and ill-omened at the same time in
it to this day.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">few</span> weeks later, coming early one
morning into Singapore, from a journey to the southward, I saw
the brig lying at anchor in all her usual symmetry and splendour
of aspect as though she had been taken out of a glass case and
put delicately into the water that very moment.</p>
<p>She was well out in the roadstead, but I steamed in and took
up my habitual berth close in front of the town.&nbsp; Before we
had finished breakfast a quarter-master came to tell me that
Captain Allen&rsquo;s boat was coming our way.</p>
<p>His smart gig dashed alongside, and in two bounds he was up
our accommodation-ladder and shaking me by the hand with his
nervous grip, his eyes snapping inquisitively, for he supposed I
had called at the Seven Isles group on my way.&nbsp; I reached
into my pocket for a nicely folded little note, which he grabbed
out of my hand without ceremony and carried off on the bridge to
read by himself.&nbsp; After a decent interval I followed him up
there, and found him pacing to and fro; for the nature of his
emotions made him restless even in his most thoughtful
moments.</p>
<p>He shook his head at me triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall be
counting the days now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understood what he meant.&nbsp; I knew that those young
people had settled already on a runaway match without official
preliminaries.&nbsp; This was really a logical decision.&nbsp;
Old Nelson (or Nielsen) would never have agreed to give up Freya
peaceably to this compromising Jasper.&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp; What
would the Dutch authorities say to such a match!&nbsp; It sounds
too ridiculous for words.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s nothing in the
world more selfishly hard than a timorous man in a fright about
his &ldquo;little estate,&rdquo; as old Nelson used to call it in
apologetic accents.&nbsp; A heart permeated by a particular sort
of funk is proof against sense, feeling, and ridicule.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a flint.</p>
<p>Jasper would have made his request all the same and then taken
his own way; but it was Freya who decided that nothing should be
said, on the ground that, &ldquo;Papa would only worry himself to
distraction.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was capable of making himself ill,
and then she wouldn&rsquo;t have the heart to leave him.&nbsp;
Here you have the sanity of feminine outlook and the frankness of
feminine reasoning.&nbsp; And for the rest, Miss Freya could read
&ldquo;poor dear papa&rdquo; in the way a woman reads a
man&mdash;like an open book.&nbsp; His daughter once gone, old
Nelson would not worry himself.&nbsp; He would raise a great
outcry, and make no end of lamentable fuss, but that&rsquo;s not
the same thing.&nbsp; The real agonies of indecision, the anguish
of conflicting feelings would be spared to him.&nbsp; And as he
was too unassuming to rage, he would, after a period of
lamentation, devote himself to his &ldquo;little estate,&rdquo;
and to keeping on good terms with the authorities.</p>
<p>Time would do the rest.&nbsp; And Freya thought she could
afford to wait, while ruling over her own home in the beautiful
brig and over the man who loved her.&nbsp; This was the life for
her who had learned to walk on a ship&rsquo;s deck.&nbsp; She was
a ship-child, a sea-girl if ever there was one.&nbsp; And of
course she loved Jasper and trusted him; but there was a shade of
anxiety in her pride.&nbsp; It is very fine and romantic to
possess for your very own a finely tempered and trusty
sword-blade, but whether it is the best weapon to counter with
the common cudgel-play of Fate&mdash;that&rsquo;s another
question.</p>
<p>She knew that she had the more substance of the two&mdash;you
needn&rsquo;t try any cheap jokes, I am not talking of their
weights.&nbsp; She was just a little anxious while he was away,
and she had me who, being a tried confidant, took the liberty to
whisper frequently &ldquo;The sooner the better.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
there was a peculiar vein of obstinacy in Miss Freya, and her
reason for delay was characteristic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not before my
twenty-first birthday; so that there shall be no mistake in
people&rsquo;s minds as to me being old enough to know what I am
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper&rsquo;s feelings were in such subjection that he had
never even remonstrated against the decree.&nbsp; She was just
splendid, whatever she did or said, and there was an end of it
for him.&nbsp; I believe that he was subtle enough to be even
flattered at bottom&mdash;at times.&nbsp; And then to console him
he had the brig which seemed pervaded by the spirit of Freya,
since whatever he did on board was always done under the supreme
sanction of his love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon begin to count the
days,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eleven months more.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll have to crowd three trips into that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t come to grief trying to do too
much,&rdquo; I admonished him.&nbsp; But he dismissed my caution
with a laugh and an elated gesture.&nbsp; Pooh!&nbsp; Nothing,
nothing could happen to the brig, he cried, as if the flame of
his heart could light up the dark nights of uncharted seas, and
the image of Freya serve for an unerring beacon amongst hidden
shoals; as if the winds had to wait on his future, the stars
fight for it in their courses; as if the magic of his passion had
the power to float a ship on a drop of dew or sail her through
the eye of a needle&mdash;simply because it was her magnificent
lot to be the servant of a love so full of grace as to make all
the ways of the earth safe, resplendent, and easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I said, after he had finished
laughing at my innocent enough remark, &ldquo;I suppose you will
be off to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was what he meant to do.&nbsp; He had not gone at
daylight only because he expected me to come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only fancy what has happened yesterday,&rdquo; he
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mate left me suddenly.&nbsp; Had
to.&nbsp; And as there&rsquo;s nobody to be found at a short
notice I am going to take Schultz with me.&nbsp; The notorious
Schultz!&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you jump out of your skin?&nbsp; I
tell you I went and unearthed Schultz late last evening, after no
end of trouble.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am your man, captain,&rsquo; he
says, in that wonderful voice of his, &lsquo;but I am sorry to
confess I have practically no clothes to my back.&nbsp; I have
had to sell all my wardrobe to get a little food from day to
day.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a voice that man has got.&nbsp; Talk about
moving stones!&nbsp; But people seem to get used to it.&nbsp; I
had never seen him before, and, upon my word, I felt suddenly
tears rising to my eyes.&nbsp; Luckily it was dusk.&nbsp; He was
sitting very quiet under a tree in a native compound as thin as a
lath, and when I peered down at him all he had on was an old
cotton singlet and a pair of ragged pyjamas.&nbsp; I bought him
six white suits and two pairs of canvas shoes.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
clear the ship without a mate.&nbsp; Must have somebody.&nbsp; I
am going on shore presently to sign him on, and I shall take him
with me as I go back on board to get under way.&nbsp; Now, I am a
lunatic&mdash;am I not?&nbsp; Mad, of course.&nbsp; Come
on!&nbsp; Lay it on thick.&nbsp; Let yourself go.&nbsp; I like to
see you get excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He so evidently expected me to scold that I took especial
pleasure in exaggerating the calmness of my attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst that can be brought up against
Schultz,&rdquo; I began, folding my arms and speaking
dispassionately, &ldquo;is an awkward habit of stealing the
stores of every ship he has ever been in.&nbsp; He will do
it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s really all that&rsquo;s wrong.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t credit absolutely that story Captain Robinson tells
of Schultz conspiring in Chantabun with some ruffians in a
Chinese junk to steal the anchor off the starboard bow of the
<i>Bohemian Girl</i> schooner.&nbsp; Robinson&rsquo;s story is
too ingenious altogether.&nbsp; That other tale of the engineers
of the <i>Nan-Shan</i> finding Schultz at midnight in the
engine-room busy hammering at the brass bearings to carry them
off for sale on shore seems to me more authentic.&nbsp; Apart
from this little weakness, let me tell you that Schultz is a
smarter sailor than many who never took a drop of drink in their
lives, and perhaps no worse morally than some men you and I know
who have never stolen the value of a penny.&nbsp; He may not be a
desirable person to have on board one&rsquo;s ship, but since you
have no choice he may be made to do, I believe.&nbsp; The
important thing is to understand his psychology.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t give him any money till you have done with him.&nbsp;
Not a cent, if he begs ever so.&nbsp; For as sure as Fate the
moment you give him any money he will begin to steal.&nbsp; Just
remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I enjoyed Jasper&rsquo;s incredulous surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil he will!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
on earth for?&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you trying to pull my leg, old
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; You must understand
Schultz&rsquo;s psychology.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s neither a loafer nor
a cadger.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not likely to wander about looking for
somebody to stand him drinks.&nbsp; But suppose he goes on shore
with five dollars, or fifty for that matter, in his pocket?&nbsp;
After the third or fourth glass he becomes fuddled and
charitable.&nbsp; He either drops his money all over the place,
or else distributes the lot around; gives it to any one who will
take it.&nbsp; Then it occurs to him that the night is young yet,
and that he may require a good many more drinks for himself and
his friends before morning.&nbsp; So he starts off cheerfully for
his ship.&nbsp; His legs never get affected nor his head either
in the usual way.&nbsp; He gets aboard and simply grabs the first
thing that seems to him suitable&mdash;the cabin lamp, a coil of
rope, a bag of biscuits, a drum of oil&mdash;and converts it into
money without thinking twice about it.&nbsp; This is the process
and no other.&nbsp; You have only to look out that he
doesn&rsquo;t get a start.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound his psychology,&rdquo; muttered Jasper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But a man with a voice like his is fit to talk to the
angels.&nbsp; Is he incurable do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that I thought so.&nbsp; Nobody had prosecuted him yet,
but no one would employ him any longer.&nbsp; His end would be, I
feared, to starve in some hole or other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; reflected Jasper.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
<i>Bonito</i> isn&rsquo;t trading to any ports of
civilisation.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll make it easier for him to keep
straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was true.&nbsp; The brig&rsquo;s business was on
uncivilised coasts, with obscure rajahs dwelling in nearly
unknown bays; with native settlements up mysterious rivers
opening their sombre, forest-lined estuaries among a welter of
pale green reefs and dazzling sand-banks, in lonely straits of
calm blue water all aglitter with sunshine.&nbsp; Alone, far from
the beaten tracks, she glided, all white, round dark, frowning
headlands, stole out, silent like a ghost, from behind points of
land stretching out all black in the moonlight; or lay hove-to,
like a sleeping sea-bird, under the shadow of some nameless
mountain waiting for a signal.&nbsp; She would be glimpsed
suddenly on misty, squally days dashing disdainfully aside the
short aggressive waves of the Java Sea; or be seen far, far away,
a tiny dazzling white speck flying across the brooding purple
masses of thunderclouds piled up on the horizon.&nbsp; Sometimes,
on the rare mail tracks, where civilisation brushes against wild
mystery, when the na&iuml;ve passengers crowding along the rail
exclaimed, pointing at her with interest: &ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s
a yacht!&rdquo; the Dutch captain, with a hostile glance, would
grunt contemptuously: &ldquo;Yacht!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
only English Jasper.&nbsp; A pedlar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good seaman you say,&rdquo; ejaculated Jasper, still
in the matter of the hopeless Schultz with the wonderfully
touching voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First rate.&nbsp; Ask any one.&nbsp; Quite worth
having&mdash;only impossible,&rdquo; I declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall have his chance to reform in the brig,&rdquo;
said Jasper, with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will be no
temptations either to drink or steal where I am going to this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t press him for anything more definite on that
point.&nbsp; In fact, intimate as we were, I had a pretty clear
notion of the general run of his business.</p>
<p>But as we are going ashore in his gig he asked suddenly:
&ldquo;By the way, do you know where Heemskirk is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I eyed him covertly, and was reassured.&nbsp; He had asked the
question, not as a lover, but as a trader.&nbsp; I told him that
I had heard in Palembang that the <i>Neptun</i> was on duty down
about Flores and Sumbawa.&nbsp; Quite out of his way.&nbsp; He
expressed his satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that fellow, when
he gets on the Borneo coast, amuses himself by knocking down my
beacons.&nbsp; I have had to put up a few to help me in and out
of the rivers.&nbsp; Early this year a Celebes trader becalmed in
a prau was watching him at it.&nbsp; He steamed the gunboat full
tilt at two of them, one after another, smashing them to pieces,
and then lowered a boat on purpose to pull out a third, which I
had a lot of trouble six months ago to stick up in the middle of
a mudflat for a tide mark.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of anything
more provoking&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t quarrel with the beggar,&rdquo; I
observed casually, yet disliking that piece of news
strongly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quarrel?&rdquo; cried Jasper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to quarrel.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to hurt a
single hair of his ugly head.&nbsp; My dear fellow, when I think
of Freya&rsquo;s twenty-first birthday, all the world&rsquo;s my
friend, Heemskirk included.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a nasty, spiteful
amusement, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We parted rather hurriedly on the quay, each of us having his
own pressing business to attend to.&nbsp; I would have been very
much cut up had I known that this hurried grasp of the hand with
&ldquo;So long, old boy.&nbsp; Good luck to you!&rdquo; was the
last of our partings.</p>
<p>On his return to the Straits I was away, and he was gone again
before I got back.&nbsp; He was trying to achieve three trips
before Freya&rsquo;s twenty-first birthday.&nbsp; At
Nelson&rsquo;s Cove I missed him again by only a couple of
days.&nbsp; Freya and I talked of &ldquo;that lunatic&rdquo; and
&ldquo;perfect idiot&rdquo; with great delight and infinite
appreciation.&nbsp; She was very radiant, with a more pronounced
gaiety, notwithstanding that she had just parted from
Jasper.&nbsp; But this was to be their last separation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do get aboard as soon as you can, Miss Freya,&rdquo; I
entreated.</p>
<p>She looked me straight in the face, her colour a little
heightened and with a sort of solemn ardour&mdash;if there was a
little catch in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes!&nbsp; The very next day after her twenty-first
birthday.&nbsp; I was pleased at this hint of deep feeling.&nbsp;
It was as if she had grown impatient at last of the self-imposed
delay.&nbsp; I supposed that Jasper&rsquo;s recent visit had told
heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; I said approvingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall be much easier in my mind when I know you have
taken charge of that lunatic.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you lose a
minute.&nbsp; He, of course, will be on time&mdash;unless heavens
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Unless&mdash;&rdquo; she repeated in a
thoughtful whisper, raising her eyes to the evening sky without a
speck of cloud anywhere.&nbsp; Silent for a time, we let our eyes
wander over the waters below, looking mysteriously still in the
twilight, as if trustfully composed for a long, long dream in the
warm, tropical night.&nbsp; And the peace all round us seemed
without limits and without end.</p>
<p>And then we began again to talk Jasper over in our usual
strain.&nbsp; We agreed that he was too reckless in many
ways.&nbsp; Luckily, the brig was equal to the situation.&nbsp;
Nothing apparently was too much for her.&nbsp; A perfect darling
of a ship, said Miss Freya.&nbsp; She and her father had spent an
afternoon on board.&nbsp; Jasper had given them some tea.&nbsp;
Papa was grumpy. . . . I had a vision of old Nelson under the
brig&rsquo;s snowy awnings, nursing his unassuming vexation, and
fanning himself with his hat.&nbsp; A comedy father. . . . As a
new instance of Jasper&rsquo;s lunacy, I was told that he was
distressed at his inability to have solid silver handles fitted
to all the cabin doors.&nbsp; &ldquo;As if I would have let
him!&rdquo; commented Miss Freya, with amused indignation.&nbsp;
Incidentally, I learned also that Schultz, the nautical
kleptomaniac with the pathetic voice, was still hanging on to his
job, with Miss Freya&rsquo;s approval.&nbsp; Jasper had confided
to the lady of his heart his purpose of straightening out the
fellow&rsquo;s psychology.&nbsp; Yes, indeed.&nbsp; All the world
was his friend because it breathed the same air with Freya.</p>
<p>Somehow or other, I brought Heemskirk&rsquo;s name into
conversation, and, to my great surprise, startled Miss
Freya.&nbsp; Her eyes expressed something like distress, while
she bit her lip as if to contain an explosion of laughter.&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Heemskirk was at the bungalow at the same
time with Jasper, but he arrived the day after.&nbsp; He left the
same day as the brig, but a few hours later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nuisance he must have been to you two,&rdquo; I
said feelingly.</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed at me a sort of frightened merriment, and
suddenly she exploded into a clear burst of laughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I echoed it heartily, but not with the game charming tone:
&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! . . . Isn&rsquo;t he grotesque?&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the ludicrousness of old Nelson&rsquo;s
inanely fierce round eyes in association with his conciliatory
manner to the lieutenant presenting itself to my mind brought on
another fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks,&rdquo; I spluttered, &ldquo;he
looks&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;amongst you three . . . like an
unhappy black-beetle.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave out another ringing peal, ran off into her own room,
and slammed the door behind her, leaving me profoundly
astounded.&nbsp; I stopped laughing at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo; asked old Nelson&rsquo;s
voice, half way down the steps.</p>
<p>He came up, sat down, and blew out his cheeks, looking
inexpressibly fatuous.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t want to laugh any
more.&nbsp; And what on earth, I asked myself, have we been
laughing at in this uncontrollable fashion.&nbsp; I felt suddenly
depressed.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.&nbsp; Freya had started it.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s
overwrought, I thought.&nbsp; And really one couldn&rsquo;t
wonder at it.</p>
<p>I had no answer to old Nelson&rsquo;s question, but he was too
aggrieved at Jasper&rsquo;s visit to think of anything
else.&nbsp; He as good as asked me whether I wouldn&rsquo;t
undertake to hint to Jasper that he was not wanted at the Seven
Isles group.&nbsp; I declared that it was not necessary.&nbsp;
From certain circumstances which had come to my knowledge lately,
I had reason to think that he would not be much troubled by
Jasper Allen in the future.</p>
<p>He emitted an earnest &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; which nearly
set me laughing again, but he did not brighten up
proportionately.&nbsp; It seemed Heemskirk had taken special
pains to make himself disagreeable.&nbsp; The lieutenant had
frightened old Nelson very much by expressing a sinister wonder
at the Government permitting a white man to settle down in that
part at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is against our declared
policy,&rdquo; he had remarked.&nbsp; He had also charged him
with being in reality no better than an Englishman.&nbsp; He had
even tried to pick a quarrel with him for not learning to speak
Dutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I was too old to learn now,&rdquo; sighed
out old Nelson (or Nielsen) dismally.&nbsp; &ldquo;He said I
ought to have learned Dutch long before.&nbsp; I had been making
my living in Dutch dependencies.&nbsp; It was disgraceful of me
not to speak Dutch, he said.&nbsp; He was as savage with me as if
I had been a Chinaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was plain he had been viciously badgered.&nbsp; He did not
mention how many bottles of his best claret he had offered up on
the altar of conciliation.&nbsp; It must have been a generous
libation.&nbsp; But old Nelson (or Nielsen) was really
hospitable.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t mind that; and I only regretted
that this virtue should be lavished on the lieutenant-commander
of the <i>Neptun</i>.&nbsp; I longed to tell him that in all
probability he would be relieved from Heemskirk&rsquo;s
visitations also.&nbsp; I did not do so only from the fear
(absurd, I admit) of arousing some sort of suspicion in his
mind.&nbsp; As if with this guileless comedy father such a thing
were possible!</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the last words on the subject of Heemskirk
were spoken by Freya, and in that very sense.&nbsp; The
lieutenant was turning up persistently in old Nelson&rsquo;s
conversation at dinner.&nbsp; At last I muttered a half audible
&ldquo;Damn the lieutenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could see that the
girl was getting exasperated, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he wasn&rsquo;t well at all&mdash;was he,
Freya?&rdquo; old Nelson went on moaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps it
was that which made him so snappish, hey, Freya?&nbsp; He looked
very bad when he left us so suddenly.&nbsp; His liver must be in
a bad state, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he will end by getting over it,&rdquo; said Freya
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;And do leave off worrying about him,
papa.&nbsp; Very likely you won&rsquo;t see much of him for a
long time to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look she gave me in exchange for my discreet smile had no
hidden mirth in it.&nbsp; Her eyes seemed hollowed, her face gone
wan in a couple of hours.&nbsp; We had been laughing too
much.&nbsp; Overwrought!&nbsp; Overwrought by the approach of the
decisive moment.&nbsp; After all, sincere, courageous, and
self-reliant as she was, she must have felt both the passion and
the compunction of her resolve.&nbsp; The very strength of love
which had carried her up to that point must have put her under a
great moral strain, in which there might have been a little
simple remorse, too.&nbsp; For she was honest&mdash;and there,
across the table, sat poor old Nelson (or Nielsen) staring at
her, round-eyed and so pathetically comic in his fierce aspect as
to touch the most lightsome heart.</p>
<p>He retired early to his room to soothe himself for a
night&rsquo;s rest by perusing his account-books.&nbsp; We two
remained on the verandah for another hour or so, but we exchanged
only languid phrases on things without importance, as though we
had been emotionally jaded by our long day&rsquo;s talk on the
only momentous subject.&nbsp; And yet there was something she
might have told a friend.&nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We
parted silently.&nbsp; She distrusted my masculine lack of common
sense, perhaps. . . . O!&nbsp; Freya!</p>
<p>Going down the precipitous path to the landing-stage, I was
confronted in the shadows of boulders and bushes by a draped
feminine figure whose appearance startled me at first.&nbsp; It
glided into my way suddenly from behind a piece of rock.&nbsp;
But in a moment it occurred to me that it could be no one else
but Freya&rsquo;s maid, a half-caste Malacca Portuguese.&nbsp;
One caught fleeting glimpses of her olive face and dazzling white
teeth about the house.&nbsp; I had observed her at times from a
distance, as she sat within call under the shade of some fruit
trees, brushing and plaiting her long raven locks.&nbsp; It
seemed to be the principal occupation of her leisure hours.&nbsp;
We had often exchanged nods and smiles&mdash;and a few words,
too.&nbsp; She was a pretty creature.&nbsp; And once I had
watched her approvingly make funny and expressive grimaces behind
Heemskirk&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; I understood (from Jasper) that she
was in the secret, like a comedy camerista.&nbsp; She was to
accompany Freya on her irregular way to matrimony and &ldquo;ever
after&rdquo; happiness.&nbsp; Why should she be roaming by night
near the cove&mdash;unless on some love affair of her own&mdash;I
asked myself.&nbsp; But there was nobody suitable within the
Seven Isles group, as far as I knew.&nbsp; It flashed upon me
that it was myself she had been lying in wait for.</p>
<p>She hesitated, muffled from head to foot, shadowy and
bashful.&nbsp; I advanced another pace, and how I felt is
nobody&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked, very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows I am here,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody can see us,&rdquo; I whispered back.</p>
<p>The murmur of words &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so
frightened&rdquo; reached me.&nbsp; Just then forty feet above
our head, from the yet lighted verandah, unexpected and
startling, Freya&rsquo;s voice rang out in a clear, imperious
call:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antonia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a stifled exclamation, the hesitating girl vanished out
of the path.&nbsp; A bush near by rustled; then silence.&nbsp; I
waited wondering.&nbsp; The lights on the verandah went
out.&nbsp; I waited a while longer then continued down the path
to my boat, wondering more than ever.</p>
<p>I remember the occurrences of that visit especially, because
this was the last time I saw the Nelson bungalow.&nbsp; On
arriving at the Straits I found cable messages which made it
necessary for me to throw up my employment at a moment&rsquo;s
notice and go home at once.&nbsp; I had a desperate scramble to
catch the mailboat which was due to leave next day, but I found
time to write two short notes, one to Freya, the other to
Jasper.&nbsp; Later on I wrote at length, this time to Allen
alone.&nbsp; I got no answer.&nbsp; I hunted up then his brother,
or, rather, half-brother, a solicitor in the city, a sallow,
calm, little man who looked at me over his spectacles
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Jasper was the only child of his father&rsquo;s second
marriage, a transaction which had failed to commend itself to the
first, grown-up family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard for ages,&rdquo; I repeated,
with secret annoyance.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I ask what &lsquo;for
ages&rsquo; means in this connection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that I don&rsquo;t care whether I ever hear
from him or not,&rdquo; retorted the little man of law, turning
nasty suddenly.</p>
<p>I could not blame Jasper for not wasting his time in
correspondence with such an outrageous relative.&nbsp; But why
didn&rsquo;t he write to me&mdash;a decent sort of friend, after
all; enough of a friend to find for his silence the excuse of
forgetfulness natural to a state of transcendental bliss?&nbsp; I
waited indulgently, but nothing ever came.&nbsp; And the East
seemed to drop out of my life without an echo, like a stone
falling into a well of prodigious depth.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">suppose</span> praiseworthy motives are
a sufficient justification almost for anything.&nbsp; What could
be more commendable in the abstract than a girl&rsquo;s
determination that &ldquo;poor papa&rdquo; should not be worried,
and her anxiety that the man of her choice should be kept by any
means from every occasion of doing something rash, something
which might endanger the whole scheme of their happiness?</p>
<p>Nothing could be more tender and more prudent.&nbsp; We must
also remember the girl&rsquo;s self-reliant temperament, and the
general unwillingness of women&mdash;I mean women of
sense&mdash;to make a fuss over matters of that sort.</p>
<p>As has been said already, Heemskirk turned up some time after
Jasper&rsquo;s arrival at Nelson&rsquo;s Cove.&nbsp; The sight of
the brig lying right under the bungalow was very offensive to
him.&nbsp; He did not fly ashore before his anchor touched the
ground as Jasper used to do.&nbsp; On the contrary, he hung about
his quarter-deck mumbling to himself; and when he ordered his
boat to be manned it was in an angry voice.&nbsp; Freya&rsquo;s
existence, which lifted Jasper out of himself into a blissful
elation, was for Heemskirk a cause of secret torment, of hours of
exasperated brooding.</p>
<p>While passing the brig he hailed her harshly and asked if the
master was on board.&nbsp; Schultz, smart and neat in a spotless
white suit, leaned over the taffrail, finding the question
somewhat amusing.&nbsp; He looked humorously down into
Heemskirk&rsquo;s boat, and answered, in the most amiable
modulations of his beautiful voice: &ldquo;Captain Allen is up at
the house, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his expression changed suddenly
at the savage growl: &ldquo;What the devil are you grinning
at?&rdquo; which acknowledged that information.</p>
<p>He watched Heemskirk land and, instead of going to the house,
stride away by another path into the grounds.</p>
<p>The desire-tormented Dutchman found old Nelson (or Nielsen) at
his drying-sheds, very busy superintending the manipulation of
his tobacco crop, which, though small, was of excellent quality,
and enjoying himself thoroughly.&nbsp; But Heemskirk soon put a
stop to this simple happiness.&nbsp; He sat down by the old chap,
and by the sort of talk which he knew was best calculated for the
purpose, reduced him before long to a state of concealed and
perspiring nervousness.&nbsp; It was a horrid talk of
&ldquo;authorities,&rdquo; and old Nelson tried to defend
himself.&nbsp; If he dealt with English traders it was because he
had to dispose of his produce somehow.&nbsp; He was as
conciliatory as he knew how to be, and this very thing seemed to
excite Heemskirk, who had worked himself up into a heavily
breathing state of passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the worst of them all is that Allen,&rdquo; he
growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your particular friend&mdash;eh?&nbsp; You
have let in a lot of these Englishmen into this part.&nbsp; You
ought never to have been allowed to settle here.&nbsp;
Never.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s he doing here now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nelson (or Nielsen), becoming very agitated, declared that
Jasper Allen was no particular friend of his.&nbsp; No friend at
all&mdash;at all.&nbsp; He had bought three tons of rice from him
to feed his workpeople on.&nbsp; What sort of evidence of
friendship was that?&nbsp; Heemskirk burst out at last with the
thought that had been gnawing at his vitals:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Sell three tons of rice and flirt three days
with that girl of yours.&nbsp; I am speaking to you as a friend,
Nielsen.&nbsp; This won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; You are only on
sufferance here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nelson was taken aback at first, but recovered pretty
quickly.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t do!&nbsp; Certainly!&nbsp; Of course,
it wouldn&rsquo;t do!&nbsp; The last man in the world.&nbsp; But
his girl didn&rsquo;t care for the fellow, and was too sensible
to fall in love with any one.&nbsp; He was very earnest in
impressing on Heemskirk his own feeling of absolute
security.&nbsp; And the lieutenant, casting doubting glances
sideways, was yet willing to believe him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much you know about it,&rdquo; he grunted
nevertheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do know,&rdquo; insisted old Nelson, with the
greater desperation because he wanted to resist the doubts
arising in his own mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;My own daughter!&nbsp; In
my own house, and I not to know!&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; It would be a
good joke, lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be carrying on considerably,&rdquo;
remarked Heemskirk moodily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose they are
together now,&rdquo; he added, feeling a pang which changed what
he meant for a mocking smile into a strange grimace.</p>
<p>The harassed Nelson shook his hand at him.&nbsp; He was at
bottom shocked at this insistence, and was even beginning to feel
annoyed at the absurdity of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&nbsp; Pooh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what,
lieutenant: you go to the house and have a drop of
gin-and-bitters before dinner.&nbsp; Ask for Freya.&nbsp; I must
see the last of this tobacco put away for the night, but
I&rsquo;ll be along presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heemskirk was not insensible to this suggestion.&nbsp; It
answered to his secret longing, which was not a longing for
drink, however.&nbsp; Old Nelson shouted solicitously after his
broad back a recommendation to make himself comfortable, and that
there was a box of cheroots on the verandah.</p>
<p>It was the west verandah that old Nelson meant, the one which
was the living-room of the house, and had split-rattan screens of
the very finest quality.&nbsp; The east verandah, sacred to his
own privacy, puffing out of cheeks, and other signs of perplexed
thinking, was fitted with stout blinds of sailcloth.&nbsp; The
north verandah was not a verandah at all, really.&nbsp; It was
more like a long balcony.&nbsp; It did not communicate with the
other two, and could only be approached by a passage inside the
house.&nbsp; Thus it had a privacy which made it a convenient
place for a maiden&rsquo;s meditations without words, and also
for the discourses, apparently without sense, which, passing
between a young man and a maid, become pregnant with a diversity
of transcendental meanings.</p>
<p>This north verandah was embowered with climbing plants.&nbsp;
Freya, whose room opened out on it, had furnished it as a sort of
boudoir for herself, with a few cane chairs and a sofa of the
same kind.&nbsp; On this sofa she and Jasper sat as close
together as is possible in this imperfect world where neither can
a body be in two places at once nor yet two bodies can be in one
place at the same time.&nbsp; They had been sitting together all
the afternoon, and I won&rsquo;t say that their talk had been
without sense.&nbsp; Loving him with a little judicious anxiety
lest in his elation he should break his heart over some mishap,
Freya naturally would talk to him soberly.&nbsp; He, nervous and
brusque when away from her, appeared always as if overcome by her
visibility, by the great wonder of being palpably loved.&nbsp; An
old man&rsquo;s child, having lost his mother early, thrown out
to sea out of the way while very young, he had not much
experience of tenderness of any kind.</p>
<p>In this private, foliage-embowered verandah, and at this late
hour of the afternoon, he bent down a little, and, possessing
himself of Freya&rsquo;s hands, was kissing them one after
another, while she smiled and looked down at his head with the
eyes of approving compassion.&nbsp; At that same moment Heemskirk
was approaching the house from the north.</p>
<p>Antonia was on the watch on that side.&nbsp; But she did not
keep a very good watch.&nbsp; The sun was setting; she knew that
her young mistress and the captain of the <i>Bonito</i> were
about to separate.&nbsp; She was walking to and fro in the dusky
grove with a flower in her hair, and singing softly to herself,
when suddenly, within a foot of her, the lieutenant appeared from
behind a tree.&nbsp; She bounded aside like a startled fawn, but
Heemskirk, with a lucid comprehension of what she was there for,
pounced upon her, and, catching her arm, clapped his other thick
hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you try to make a noise I&rsquo;ll twist your
neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This ferocious figure of speech terrified the girl
sufficiently.&nbsp; Heemskirk had seen plainly enough on the
verandah Freya&rsquo;s golden head with another head very close
to it.&nbsp; He dragged the unresisting maid with him by a
circuitous way into the compound, where he dismissed her with a
vicious push in the direction of the cluster of bamboo huts for
the servants.</p>
<p>She was very much like the faithful camerista of Italian
comedy, but in her terror she bolted away without a sound from
that thick, short, black-eyed man with a cruel grip of fingers
like a vice.&nbsp; Quaking all over at a distance, extremely
scared and half inclined to laugh, she saw him enter the house at
the back.</p>
<p>The interior of the bungalow was divided by two passages
crossing each other in the middle.&nbsp; At that point Heemskirk,
by turning his head slightly to the left as he passed, secured
the evidence of &ldquo;carrying on&rdquo; so irreconcilable with
old Nelson&rsquo;s assurances that it made him stagger, with a
rush of blood to his head.&nbsp; Two white figures, distinct
against the light, stood in an unmistakable attitude.&nbsp;
Freya&rsquo;s arms were round Jasper&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; Their
faces were characteristically superimposed on each other, and
Heemskirk went on, his throat choked with a sudden rising of
curses, till on the west verandah he stumbled blindly against a
chair and then dropped into another as though his legs had been
swept from under him.&nbsp; He had indulged too long in the habit
of appropriating Freya to himself in his thoughts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is that how you entertain your visitors&mdash;you . . .
&rdquo; he thought, so outraged that he could not find a
sufficiently degrading epithet.</p>
<p>Freya struggled a little and threw her head back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has come in,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
Jasper, holding her clasped closely to his breast, and looking
down into her face, suggested casually:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freya tried to disengage herself, but she had not the heart
absolutely to push him away with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s Heemskirk,&rdquo; she breathed out
at him.</p>
<p>He, plunging into her eyes in a quiet rapture, was provoked to
a vague smile by the sound of the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ass is always knocking down my beacons outside the
river,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp; He attached no other meaning to
Heemskirk&rsquo;s existence; but Freya was asking herself whether
the lieutenant had seen them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go, kid,&rdquo; she ordered in a peremptory
whisper.&nbsp; Jasper obeyed, and, stepping back at once,
continued his contemplation of her face under another
angle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must go and see,&rdquo; she said to herself
anxiously.</p>
<p>She instructed him hurriedly to wait a moment after she was
gone and then to slip on to the back verandah and get a quiet
smoke before he showed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay late this evening,&rdquo; was her last
recommendation before she left him.</p>
<p>Then Freya came out on the west verandah with her light, rapid
step.&nbsp; While going through the doorway she managed to shake
down the folds of the looped-up curtains at the end of the
passage so as to cover Jasper&rsquo;s retreat from the
bower.&nbsp; Directly she appeared Heemskirk jumped up as if to
fly at her.&nbsp; She paused and he made her an exaggerated low
bow.</p>
<p>It irritated Freya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you, Mr. Heemskirk.&nbsp; How do
you do?&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke in her usual tone.&nbsp; Her face
was not plainly visible to him in the dusk of the deep
verandah.&nbsp; He dared not trust himself to speak, his rage at
what he had seen was so great.&nbsp; And when she added with
serenity: &ldquo;Papa will be coming in before long,&rdquo; he
called her horrid names silently, to himself, before he spoke
with contorted lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen your father already.&nbsp; We had a talk in
the sheds.&nbsp; He told me some very interesting things.&nbsp;
Oh, very&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freya sat down.&nbsp; She thought: &ldquo;He has seen us, for
certain.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was not ashamed.&nbsp; What she was
afraid of was some foolish or awkward complication.&nbsp; But she
could not conceive how much her person had been appropriated by
Heemskirk (in his thoughts).&nbsp; She tried to be
conversational.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are coming now from Palembang, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Oh, yes!&nbsp; I come from
Palembang.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; You know what your father
said?&nbsp; He said he was afraid you were having a very dull
time of it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you are going to cruise in the
Moluccas,&rdquo; continued Freya, who wanted to impart some
useful information to Jasper if possible.&nbsp; At the same time
she was always glad to know that those two men were a few hundred
miles apart when not under her eye.</p>
<p>Heemskirk growled angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Moluccas,&rdquo; glaring in the direction of
her shadowy figure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your father thinks it&rsquo;s
very quiet for you here.&nbsp; I tell you what, Miss Freya.&nbsp;
There isn&rsquo;t such a quiet spot on earth that a woman
can&rsquo;t find an opportunity of making a fool of
somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freya thought: &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t let him provoke
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Presently the Tamil boy, who was Nelson&rsquo;s
head servant, came in with the lights.&nbsp; She addressed him at
once with voluble directions where to put the lamps, told him to
bring the tray with the gin and bitters, and to send Antonia into
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have to leave you to yourself, Mr. Heemskirk,
for a while,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>And she went to her room to put on another frock.&nbsp; She
made a quick change of it because she wished to be on the
verandah before her father and the lieutenant met again.&nbsp;
She relied on herself to regulate that evening&rsquo;s
intercourse between these two.&nbsp; But Antonia, still scared
and hysterical, exhibited a bruise on her arm which roused
Freya&rsquo;s indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He jumped on me out of the bush like a tiger,&rdquo;
said the girl, laughing nervously with frightened eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brute!&rdquo; thought Freya.&nbsp; &ldquo;He meant
to spy on us, then.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was enraged, but the
recollection of the thick Dutchman in white trousers wide at the
hips and narrow at the ankles, with his shoulder-straps and black
bullet head, glaring at her in the light of the lamps, was so
repulsively comical that she could not help a smiling
grimace.&nbsp; Then she became anxious.&nbsp; The absurdities of
three men were forcing this anxiety upon her: Jasper&rsquo;s
impetuosity, her father&rsquo;s fears, Heemskirk&rsquo;s
infatuation.&nbsp; She was very tender to the first two, and she
made up her mind to display all her feminine diplomacy.&nbsp; All
this, she said to herself, will be over and done with before very
long now.</p>
<p>Heemskirk on the verandah, lolling in a chair, his legs
extended and his white cap reposing on his stomach, was lashing
himself into a fury of an atrocious character altogether
incomprehensible to a girl like Freya.&nbsp; His chin was resting
on his chest, his eyes gazed stonily at his shoes.&nbsp; Freya
examined him from behind the curtain.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
stir.&nbsp; He was ridiculous.&nbsp; But this absolute stillness
was impressive.&nbsp; She stole back along the passage to the
east verandah, where Jasper was sitting quietly in the dark,
doing what he was told, like a good boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psst,&rdquo; she hissed.&nbsp; He was by her side in a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that beetle,&rdquo; she whispered
uneasily.&nbsp; Under the impression of Heemskirk&rsquo;s
sinister immobility she had half a mind to let Jasper know that
they had been seen.&nbsp; But she was by no means certain that
Heemskirk would tell her father&mdash;and at any rate not that
evening.&nbsp; She concluded rapidly that the safest thing would
be to get Jasper out of the way as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he been doing?&rdquo; asked Jasper in a calm
undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing!&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; He sits there looking
cross.&nbsp; But you know how he&rsquo;s always worrying
papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s quite unreasonable,&rdquo;
pronounced Jasper judicially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said in a doubtful
tone.&nbsp; Something of old Nelson&rsquo;s dread of the
authorities had rubbed off on the girl since she had to live with
it day after day.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
Papa&rsquo;s afraid of being reduced to beggary, as he says, in
his old days.&nbsp; Look here, kid, you had better clear out
to-morrow, first thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper had hoped for another afternoon with Freya, an
afternoon of quiet felicity with the girl by his side and his
eyes on his brig, anticipating a blissful future.&nbsp; His
silence was eloquent with disappointment, and Freya understood it
very well.&nbsp; She, too, was disappointed.&nbsp; But it was her
business to be sensible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t have a moment to ourselves with that
beetle creeping round the house,&rdquo; she argued in a low,
hurried voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the good of your
staying?&nbsp; And he won&rsquo;t go while the brig&rsquo;s
here.&nbsp; You know he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be reported for loitering,&rdquo; murmured
Jasper with a vexed little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you get under way at daylight,&rdquo; recommended
Freya under her breath.</p>
<p>He detained her after the manner of lovers.&nbsp; She
expostulated without struggling because it was hard for her to
repulse him.&nbsp; He whispered into her ear while he put his
arms round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time we two meet, next time I hold you like this,
it shall be on board.&nbsp; You and I, in the brig&mdash;all the
world, all the life&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he flashed out:
&ldquo;I wonder I can wait!&nbsp; I feel as if I must carry you
off now, at once.&nbsp; I could run with you in my
hands&mdash;down the path&mdash;without stumbling&mdash;without
touching the earth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still.&nbsp; She listened to the passion in his
voice.&nbsp; She was saying to herself that if she were to
whisper the faintest yes, if she were but to sigh lightly her
consent, he would do it.&nbsp; He was capable of doing
it&mdash;without touching the earth.&nbsp; She closed her eyes
and smiled in the dark, abandoning herself in a delightful
giddiness, for an instant, to his encircling arm.&nbsp; But
before he could be tempted to tighten his grasp she was out of
it, a foot away from him and in full possession of herself.</p>
<p>That was the steady Freya.&nbsp; She was touched by the deep
sigh which floated up to her from the white figure of Jasper, who
did not stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a mad kid,&rdquo; she said tremulously.&nbsp;
Then with a change of tone: &ldquo;No one could carry me
off.&nbsp; Not even you.&nbsp; I am not the sort of girl that
gets carried off.&rdquo;&nbsp; His white form seemed to shrink a
little before the force of that assertion and she relented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it enough for you to know that you
have&mdash;that you have carried me away?&rdquo; she added in a
tender tone.</p>
<p>He murmured an endearing word, and she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve said I would
come&mdash;and I shall come of my own free will.&nbsp; You shall
wait for me on board.&nbsp; I shall get up the side&mdash;by
myself, and walk up to you on the deck and say: &lsquo;Here I am,
kid.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then&mdash;and then I shall be carried
off.&nbsp; But it will be no man who will carry me off&mdash;it
will be the brig, your brig&mdash;our brig. . . . I love the
beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard an inarticulate sound, something like a moan wrung
out by pain or delight, and glided away.&nbsp; There was that
other man on the other verandah, that dark, surly Dutchman who
could make trouble between Jasper and her father, bring about a
quarrel, ugly words, and perhaps a physical collision.&nbsp; What
a horrible situation!&nbsp; But, even putting aside that awful
extremity, she shrank from having to live for some three months
with a wretched, tormented, angry, distracted, absurd man.&nbsp;
And when the day came, the day and the hour, what should she do
if her father tried to detain her by main force&mdash;as was,
after all, possible?&nbsp; Could she actually struggle with him
hand to hand?&nbsp; But it was of lamentations and entreaties
that she was really afraid.&nbsp; Could she withstand them?&nbsp;
What an odious, cruel, ridiculous position would that be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll say
nothing,&rdquo; she thought as she came out quickly on the west
verandah, and, seeing that Heemskirk did not move, sat down on a
chair near the doorway and kept her eyes on him.&nbsp; The
outraged lieutenant had not changed his attitude; only his cap
had fallen off his stomach and was lying on the floor.&nbsp; His
thick black eyebrows were knitted by a frown, while he looked at
her out of the corners of his eyes.&nbsp; And their sideways
glance in conjunction with the hooked nose, the whole bulky,
ungainly, sprawling person, struck Freya as so comically moody
that, inwardly discomposed as she was, she could not help
smiling.&nbsp; She did her best to give that smile a conciliatory
character.&nbsp; She did not want to provoke Heemskirk
needlessly.</p>
<p>And the lieutenant, perceiving that smile, was
mollified.&nbsp; It never entered his head that his outward
appearance, a naval officer, in uniform, could appear ridiculous
to that girl of no position&mdash;the daughter of old
Nielsen.&nbsp; The recollection of her arms round Jasper&rsquo;s
neck still irritated and excited him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
hussy!&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Smiling&mdash;eh?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s how you are amusing yourself.&nbsp; Fooling your
father finely, aren&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You have a taste for that
sort of fun&mdash;have you?&nbsp; Well, we shall
see&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not alter his position, but on his
pursed-up lips there also appeared a smile of surly and
ill-omened amusement, while his eyes returned to the
contemplation of his boots.</p>
<p>Freya felt hot with indignation.&nbsp; She sat radiantly fair
in the lamplight, her strong, well-shaped hands lying one on top
of the other in her lap. . . &ldquo;Odious creature,&rdquo; she
thought.&nbsp; Her face coloured with sudden anger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have scared my maid out of her senses,&rdquo; she said
aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;What possessed you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thinking so deeply of her that the sound of her voice,
pronouncing these unexpected words, startled him extremely.&nbsp;
He jerked up his head and looked so bewildered that Freya
insisted impatiently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean Antonia.&nbsp; You have bruised her arm.&nbsp;
What did you do it for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to quarrel with me?&rdquo; he asked
thickly, with a sort of amazement.&nbsp; He blinked like an
owl.&nbsp; He was funny.&nbsp; Freya, like all women, had a keen
sense of the ridiculous in outward appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no; I don&rsquo;t think I do.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
could not help herself.&nbsp; She laughed outright, a clear,
nervous laugh in which Heemskirk joined suddenly with a harsh
&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voices and footsteps were heard in the passage, and Jasper,
with old Nelson, came out.&nbsp; Old Nelson looked at his
daughter approvingly, for he liked the lieutenant to be kept in
good humour.&nbsp; And he also joined sympathetically in the
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, lieutenant, we shall have some
dinner,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands cheerily.&nbsp; Jasper
had gone straight to the balustrade.&nbsp; The sky was full of
stars, and in the blue velvety night the cove below had a denser
blackness, in which the riding-lights of the brig and of the
gunboat glimmered redly, like suspended sparks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Next
time this riding-light glimmers down there, I&rsquo;ll be waiting
for her on the quarter-deck to come and say &lsquo;Here I
am,&rsquo;&rdquo; Jasper thought; and his heart seemed to grow
bigger in his chest, dilated by an oppressive happiness that
nearly wrung out a cry from him.&nbsp; There was no wind.&nbsp;
Not a leaf below him stirred, and even the sea was but a still
uncomplaining shadow.&nbsp; Far away on the unclouded sky the
pale lightning, the heat-lightning of the tropics, played
tremulously amongst the low stars in short, faint, mysteriously
consecutive flashes, like incomprehensible signals from some
distant planet.</p>
<p>The dinner passed off quietly.&nbsp; Freya sat facing her
father, calm but pale.&nbsp; Heemskirk affected to talk only to
old Nelson.&nbsp; Jasper&rsquo;s behaviour was exemplary.&nbsp;
He kept his eyes under control, basking in the sense of
Freya&rsquo;s nearness, as people bask in the sun without looking
up to heaven.&nbsp; And very soon after dinner was over, mindful
of his instructions, he declared that it was time for him to go
on board his ship.</p>
<p>Heemskirk did not look up.&nbsp; Ensconced in the
rocking-chair, and puffing at a cheroot, he had the air of
meditating surlily over some odious outbreak.&nbsp; So at least
it seemed to Freya.&nbsp; Old Nelson said at once:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stroll down with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had begun
a professional conversation about the dangers of the New Guinea
coast, and wanted to relate to Jasper some experience of his own
&ldquo;over there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jasper was such a good
listener!&nbsp; Freya made as if to accompany them, but her
father frowned, shook his head, and nodded significantly towards
the immovable Heemskirk blotting out smoke with half-closed eyes
and protruded lips.&nbsp; The lieutenant must not be left
alone.&nbsp; Take offence, perhaps.</p>
<p>Freya obeyed these signs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps it is better
for me to stay,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; Women are not generally
prone to review their own conduct, still less to condemn
it.&nbsp; The embarrassing masculine absurdities are in the main
responsible for its ethics.&nbsp; But, looking at Heemskirk,
Freya felt regret and even remorse.&nbsp; His thick bulk in
repose suggested the idea of repletion, but as a matter of fact
he had eaten very little.&nbsp; He had drunk a great deal,
however.&nbsp; The fleshy lobes of his unpleasant big ears with
deeply folded rims were crimson.&nbsp; They quite flamed in the
neighbourhood of the flat, sallow cheeks.&nbsp; For a
considerable time he did not raise his heavy brown eyelids.&nbsp;
To be at the mercy of such a creature was humiliating; and Freya,
who always ended by being frank with herself, thought
regretfully: &ldquo;If only I had been open with papa from the
first!&nbsp; But then what an impossible life he would have led
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Men were absurd in many ways; lovably
like Jasper, impracticably like her father, odiously like that
grotesquely supine creature in the chair.&nbsp; Was it possible
to talk him over?&nbsp; Perhaps it was not necessary?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t talk to him,&rdquo; she
thought.&nbsp; And when Heemskirk, still without looking at her,
began resolutely to crush his half-smoked cheroot on the
coffee-tray, she took alarm, glided towards the piano, opened it
in tremendous haste, and struck the keys before she sat down.</p>
<p>In an instant the verandah, the whole carpetless wooden
bungalow raised on piles, became filled with an uproarious,
confused resonance.&nbsp; But through it all she heard, she felt
on the floor the heavy, prowling footsteps of the lieutenant
moving to and fro at her back.&nbsp; He was not exactly drunk,
but he was sufficiently primed to make the suggestions of his
excited imagination seem perfectly feasible and even clever;
beautifully, unscrupulously clever.&nbsp; Freya, aware that he
had stopped just behind her, went on playing without turning her
head.&nbsp; She played with spirit, brilliantly, a fierce piece
of music, but when his voice reached her she went cold all
over.&nbsp; It was the voice, not the words.&nbsp; The insolent
familiarity of tone dismayed her to such an extent that she could
not understand at first what he was saying.&nbsp; His utterance
was thick, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected. . . . Of course I suspected something of
your little goings on.&nbsp; I am not a child.&nbsp; But from
suspecting to seeing&mdash;seeing, you
understand&mdash;there&rsquo;s an enormous difference.&nbsp; That
sort of thing. . . . Come!&nbsp; One isn&rsquo;t made of
stone.&nbsp; And when a man has been worried by a girl as I have
been worried by you, Miss Freya&mdash;sleeping and waking, then,
of course. . . . But I am a man of the world.&nbsp; It must be
dull for you here . . . I say, won&rsquo;t you leave off this
confounded playing . . .?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last was the only sentence really which she made
out.&nbsp; She shook her head negatively, and in desperation put
on the loud pedal, but she could not make the sound of the piano
cover his raised voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only, I am surprised that you should. . . . An English
trading skipper, a common fellow.&nbsp; Low, cheeky lot,
infesting these islands.&nbsp; I would make short work of such
trash!&nbsp; While you have here a good friend, a gentleman ready
to worship at your feet&mdash;your pretty feet&mdash;an officer,
a man of family.&nbsp; Strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; But what of
that!&nbsp; You are fit for a prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freya did not turn her head.&nbsp; Her face went stiff with
horror and indignation.&nbsp; This adventure was altogether
beyond her conception of what was possible.&nbsp; It was not in
her character to jump up and run away.&nbsp; It seemed to her,
too, that if she did move there was no saying what might
happen.&nbsp; Presently her father would be back, and then the
other would have to leave off.&nbsp; It was best to
ignore&mdash;to ignore.&nbsp; She went on playing loudly and
correctly, as though she were alone, as if Heemskirk did not
exist.&nbsp; That proceeding irritated him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&nbsp; You may deceive your father,&rdquo; he
bawled angrily, &ldquo;but I am not to be made a fool of!&nbsp;
Stop this infernal noise . . . Freya . . . Hey!&nbsp; You
Scandinavian Goddess of Love!&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; Do you
hear?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you are&mdash;of love.&nbsp; But
the heathen gods are only devils in disguise, and that&rsquo;s
what you are, too&mdash;a deep little devil.&nbsp; Stop it, I
say, or I will lift you off that stool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing behind her, he devoured her with his eyes, from the
golden crown of her rigidly motionless head to the heels of her
shoes, the line of her shapely shoulders, the curves of her fine
figure swaying a little before the keyboard.&nbsp; She had on a
light dress; the sleeves stopped short at the elbows in an edging
of lace.&nbsp; A satin ribbon encircled her waist.&nbsp; In an
access of irresistible, reckless hopefulness he clapped both his
hands on that waist&mdash;and then the irritating music stopped
at last.&nbsp; But, quick as she was in springing away from the
contact (the round music-stool going over with a crash),
Heemskirk&rsquo;s lips, aiming at her neck, landed a hungry,
smacking kiss just under her ear.&nbsp; A deep silence reigned
for a time.&nbsp; And then he laughed rather feebly.</p>
<p>He was disconcerted somewhat by her white, still face, the big
light violet eyes resting on him stonily.&nbsp; She had not
uttered a sound.&nbsp; She faced him, steadying herself on the
corner of the piano with one extended hand.&nbsp; The other went
on rubbing with mechanical persistency the place his lips had
touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; he said,
offended.&nbsp; &ldquo;Startled you?&nbsp; Look here: don&rsquo;t
let us have any of that nonsense.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean to
say a kiss frightens you so much as all that. . . . I know
better. . . . I don&rsquo;t mean to be left out in the
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been gazing into her face with such strained intentness
that he could no longer see it distinctly.&nbsp; Everything round
him was rather misty.&nbsp; He forgot the overturned stool,
caught his foot against it, and lurched forward slightly, saying
in an ingratiating tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bad fun, really.&nbsp; You try a few
kisses to begin with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said no more, because his head received a terrific
concussion, accompanied by an explosive sound.&nbsp; Freya had
swung her round, strong arm with such force that the impact of
her open palm on his flat cheek turned him half round.&nbsp;
Uttering a faint, hoarse yell, the lieutenant clapped both his
hands to the left side of his face, which had taken on suddenly a
dusky brick-red tinge.&nbsp; Freya, very erect, her violet eyes
darkened, her palm still tingling from the blow, a sort of
restrained determined smile showing a tiny gleam of her white
teeth, heard her father&rsquo;s rapid, heavy tread on the path
below the verandah.&nbsp; Her expression lost its pugnacity and
became sincerely concerned.&nbsp; She was sorry for her
father.&nbsp; She stooped quickly to pick up the music-stool, as
if anxious to obliterate the traces. . . . But that was no
good.&nbsp; She had resumed her attitude, one hand resting
lightly on the piano, before old Nelson got up to the top of the
stairs.</p>
<p>Poor father!&nbsp; How furious he will be&mdash;how
upset!&nbsp; And afterwards, what tremors, what
unhappiness!&nbsp; Why had she not been open with him from the
first?&nbsp; His round, innocent stare of amazement cut her to
the quick.&nbsp; But he was not looking at her.&nbsp; His stare
was directed to Heemskirk, who, with his back to him and with his
hands still up to his face, was hissing curses through his teeth,
and (she saw him in profile) glaring at her balefully with one
black, evil eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked old Nelson, very
much bewildered.</p>
<p>She did not answer him.&nbsp; She thought of Jasper on the
deck of the brig, gazing up at the lighted bungalow, and she felt
frightened.&nbsp; It was a mercy that one of them at least was on
board out of the way.&nbsp; She only wished he were a hundred
miles off.&nbsp; And yet she was not certain that she did.&nbsp;
Had Jasper been mysteriously moved that moment to reappear on the
verandah she would have thrown her consistency, her firmness, her
self-possession, to the winds, and flown into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo; insisted the
unsuspecting Nelson, getting quite excited.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only
this minute you were playing a tune, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freya, unable to speak in her apprehension of what was coming
(she was also fascinated by that black, evil, glaring eye), only
nodded slightly at the lieutenant, as much as to say: &ldquo;Just
look at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed old Nelson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
see.&nbsp; What on earth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime he had cautiously approached Heemskirk, who, bursting
into incoherent imprecations, was stamping with both feet where
he stood.&nbsp; The indignity of the blow, the rage of baffled
purpose, the ridicule of the exposure, and the impossibility of
revenge maddened him to a point when he simply felt he must howl
with fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; he howled, stamping across the
verandah as though he meant to drive his foot through the floor
at every step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is his face hurt?&rdquo; asked the astounded old
Nelson.&nbsp; The truth dawned suddenly upon his innocent
mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he cried, enlightened.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Get some brandy, quick, Freya. . . . You are subject to
it, lieutenant?&nbsp; Fiendish, eh?&nbsp; I know, I know!&nbsp;
Used to go crazy all of a sudden myself in the time. . . . And
the little bottle of laudanum from the medicine-chest, too,
Freya.&nbsp; Look sharp. . . . Don&rsquo;t you see he&rsquo;s got
a toothache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, indeed, what other explanation could have presented
itself to the guileless old Nelson, beholding this cheek nursed
with both hands, these wild glances, these stampings, this
distracted swaying of the body?&nbsp; It would have demanded a
preternatural acuteness to hit upon the true cause.&nbsp; Freya
had not moved.&nbsp; She watched Heemskirk&rsquo;s savagely
inquiring, black stare directed stealthily upon herself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Aha, you would like to be let off!&rdquo; she said to
herself.&nbsp; She looked at him unflinchingly, thinking it
out.&nbsp; The temptation of making an end of it all without
further trouble was irresistible.&nbsp; She gave an almost
imperceptible nod of assent, and glided away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up that brandy!&rdquo; old Nelson shouted, as she
disappeared in the passage.</p>
<p>Heemskirk relieved his deeper feelings by a sudden string of
curses in Dutch and English which he sent after her.&nbsp; He
raved to his heart&rsquo;s content, flinging to and fro the
verandah and kicking chairs out of his way; while Nelson (or
Nielsen), whose sympathy was profoundly stirred by these
evidences of agonising pain, hovered round his dear (and dreaded)
lieutenant, fussing like an old hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, dear me!&nbsp; Is it so bad?&nbsp; I know well
what it is.&nbsp; I used to frighten my poor wife
sometimes.&nbsp; Do you get it often like this,
lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heemskirk shouldered him viciously out of his way, with a
short, insane laugh.&nbsp; But his staggering host took it in
good part; a man beside himself with excruciating toothache is
not responsible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go into my room, lieutenant,&rdquo; he suggested
urgently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Throw yourself on my bed.&nbsp; We will
get something to ease you in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seized the poor sufferer by the arm and forced him gently
onwards to the very bed, on which Heemskirk, in a renewed access
of rage, flung himself down with such force that he rebounded
from the mattress to the height of quite a foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed the scared Nelson, and
incontinently ran off to hurry up the brandy and the laudanum,
very angry that so little alacrity was shown in relieving the
tortures of his precious guest.&nbsp; In the end he got these
things himself.</p>
<p>Half an hour later he stood in the inner passage of the house,
surprised by faint, spasmodic sounds of a mysterious nature,
between laughter and sobs.&nbsp; He frowned; then went straight
towards his daughter&rsquo;s room and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>Freya, her glorious fair hair framing her white face and
rippling down a dark-blue dressing-gown, opened it partly.</p>
<p>The light in the room was dim.&nbsp; Antonia, crouching in a
corner, rocked herself backwards and forwards, uttering feeble
moans.&nbsp; Old Nelson had not much experience in various kinds
of feminine laughter, but he was certain there had been laughter
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very unfeeling, very unfeeling!&rdquo; he said, with
weighty displeasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is there so amusing in a
man being in pain?&nbsp; I should have thought a woman&mdash;a
young girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was so funny,&rdquo; murmured Freya, whose eyes
glistened strangely in the semi-obscurity of the passage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And then, you know, I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; she
added, in an unsteady voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny!&rdquo; repeated old Nelson, amazed at this
evidence of callousness in one so young.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t like him!&nbsp; Do you mean to say that, because you
don&rsquo;t like him, you&mdash;Why, it&rsquo;s simply
cruel!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s about the worst sort
of pain there is?&nbsp; Dogs have been known to go mad with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly seemed to have gone mad,&rdquo; Freya said
with an effort, as if she were struggling with some hidden
feeling.</p>
<p>But her father was launched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know how he is.&nbsp; He notices
everything.&nbsp; He is a fellow to take offence for the least
little thing&mdash;regular Dutchman&mdash;and I want to keep
friendly with him.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like this, my girl: if that
rajah of ours were to do something silly&mdash;and you know he is
a sulky, rebellious beggar&mdash;and the authorities took into
their heads that my influence over him wasn&rsquo;t good, you
would find yourself without a roof over your
head&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cried: &ldquo;What nonsense, father!&rdquo; in a not very
assured tone, and discovered that he was angry, angry enough to
achieve irony; yes, old Nelson (or Nielsen), irony!&nbsp; Just a
gleam of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, if you have means of your own&mdash;a
mansion, a plantation that I know nothing of&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
But he was not capable of sustained irony.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell
you they would bundle me out of here,&rdquo; he whispered
forcibly; &ldquo;without compensation, of course.&nbsp; I know
these Dutch.&nbsp; And the lieutenant&rsquo;s just the fellow to
start the trouble going.&nbsp; He has the ear of influential
officials.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t offend him for
anything&mdash;for anything&mdash;on no consideration whatever. .
. . What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only an inarticulate exclamation.&nbsp; If she ever had
a half-formed intention of telling him everything she had given
it up now.&nbsp; It was impossible, both out of regard for his
dignity and for the peace of his poor mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for him myself very much,&rdquo; old
Nelson&rsquo;s subdued undertone confessed in a sigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s easier now,&rdquo; he went on, after a
silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given him up my bed for the
night.&nbsp; I shall sleep on my verandah, in the hammock.&nbsp;
No; I can&rsquo;t say I like him either, but from that to laugh
at a man because he&rsquo;s driven crazy with pain is a long
way.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve surprised me, Freya.&nbsp; That side of
his face is quite flushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her shoulders shook convulsively under his hands, which he
laid on her paternally.&nbsp; His straggly, wiry moustache
brushed her forehead in a good-night kiss.&nbsp; She closed the
door, and went away from it to the middle of the room before she
allowed herself a tired-out sort of laugh, without buoyancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flushed!&nbsp; A little flushed!&rdquo; she repeated to
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope so, indeed!&nbsp; A
little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyelashes were wet.&nbsp; Antonia, in her corner, moaned
and giggled, and it was impossible to tell where the moans ended
and the giggles began.</p>
<p>The mistress and the maid had been somewhat hysterical, for
Freya, on fleeing into her room, had found Antonia there, and had
told her everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have avenged you, my girl,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>And then they had laughingly cried and cryingly laughed with
admonitions&mdash;&ldquo;Ssh, not so loud!&nbsp; Be quiet!&rdquo;
on one part, and interludes of &ldquo;I am so frightened. . . .
He&rsquo;s an evil man,&rdquo; on the other.</p>
<p>Antonia was very much afraid of Heemskirk.&nbsp; She was
afraid of him because of his personal appearance: because of his
eyes and his eyebrows, and his mouth and his nose and his
limbs.&nbsp; Nothing could be more rational.&nbsp; And she
thought him an evil man, because, to her eyes, he looked
evil.&nbsp; No ground for an opinion could be sounder.&nbsp; In
the dimness of the room, with only a nightlight burning at the
head of Freya&rsquo;s bed, the camerista crept out of her corner
to crouch at the feet of her mistress, supplicating in
whispers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the brig.&nbsp; Captain Allen.&nbsp; Let
us run away at once&mdash;oh, let us run away!&nbsp; I am so
frightened.&nbsp; Let us!&nbsp; Let us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I!&nbsp; Run away!&rdquo; thought Freya to herself,
without looking down at the scared girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the resolute mistress under the mosquito-net and the
frightened maid lying curled up on a mat at the foot of the bed
did not sleep very well that night.&nbsp; The person that did not
sleep at all was Lieutenant Heemskirk.&nbsp; He lay on his back
staring vindictively in the darkness.&nbsp; Inflaming images and
humiliating reflections succeeded each other in his mind, keeping
up, augmenting his anger.&nbsp; A pretty tale this to get
about!&nbsp; But it must not be allowed to get about.&nbsp; The
outrage had to be swallowed in silence.&nbsp; A pretty
affair!&nbsp; Fooled, led on, and struck by the girl&mdash;and
probably fooled by the father, too.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; Nielsen
was but another victim of that shameless hussy, that brazen minx,
that sly, laughing, kissing, lying . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he did not deceive me on purpose,&rdquo; thought
the tormented lieutenant.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I should like to pay
him off, all the same, for being such an
imbecile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, some day, perhaps.&nbsp; One thing he was firmly
resolved on: he had made up his mind to steal early out of the
house.&nbsp; He did not think he could face the girl without
going out of his mind with fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire and perdition!&nbsp; Ten thousand devils!&nbsp; I
shall choke here before the morning!&rdquo; he muttered to
himself, lying rigid on his back on old Nelson&rsquo;s bed, his
breast heaving for air.</p>
<p>He arose at daylight and started cautiously to open the
door.&nbsp; Faint sounds in the passage alarmed him, and
remaining concealed he saw Freya coming out.&nbsp; This
unexpected sight deprived him of all power to move away from the
crack of the door.&nbsp; It was the narrowest crack possible, but
commanding the view of the end of the verandah.&nbsp; Freya made
for that end hastily to watch the brig passing the point.&nbsp;
She wore her dark dressing-gown; her feet were bare, because,
having fallen asleep towards the morning, she ran out headlong in
her fear of being too late.&nbsp; Heemskirk had never seen her
looking like this, with her hair drawn back smoothly to the shape
of her head, and hanging in one heavy, fair tress down her back,
and with that air of extreme youth, intensity, and
eagerness.&nbsp; And at first he was amazed, and then he gnashed
his teeth.&nbsp; He could not face her at all.&nbsp; He muttered
a curse, and kept still behind the door.</p>
<p>With a low, deep-breathed &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; when she first saw
the brig already under way, she reached for Nelson&rsquo;s long
glass reposing on brackets high up the wall.&nbsp; The wide
sleeve of the dressing-gown slipped back, uncovering her white
arm as far as the shoulder.&nbsp; Heemskirk gripping the
door-handle, as if to crush it, felt like a man just risen to his
feet from a drinking bout.</p>
<p>And Freya knew that he was watching her.&nbsp; She knew.&nbsp;
She had seen the door move as she came out of the passage.&nbsp;
She was aware of his eyes being on her, with scornful bitterness,
with triumphant contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are there,&rdquo; she thought, levelling the long
glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, well, look on, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The green islets appeared like black shadows, the ashen sea
was smooth as glass, the clear robe of the colourless dawn, in
which even the brig appeared shadowy, had a hem of light in the
east.&nbsp; Directly Freya had made out Jasper on deck, with his
own long glass directed to the bungalow, she laid hers down and
raised both her beautiful white arms above her head.&nbsp; In
that attitude of supreme cry she stood still, glowing with the
consciousness of Jasper&rsquo;s adoration going out to her figure
held in the field of his glass away there, and warmed, too, by
the feeling of evil passion, the burning, covetous eyes of the
other, fastened on her back.&nbsp; In the fervour of her love, in
the caprice of her mind, and with that mysterious knowledge of
masculine nature women seem to be born to, she thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking on&mdash;you will&mdash;you must!&nbsp;
Then you shall see something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brought both her hands to her lips, then flung them out,
sending a kiss over the sea, as if she wanted to throw her heart
along with it on the deck of the brig.&nbsp; Her face was rosy,
her eyes shone.&nbsp; Her repeated, passionate gesture seemed to
fling kisses by the hundred again and again and again, while the
slowly ascending sun brought the glory of colour to the world,
turning the islets green, the sea blue, the brig below her
white&mdash;dazzlingly white in the spread of her
wings&mdash;with the red ensign streaming like a tiny flame from
the peak.</p>
<p>And each time she murmured with a rising inflexion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this&mdash;and this&mdash;and this&mdash;&rdquo;
till suddenly her arms fell.&nbsp; She had seen the ensign dipped
in response, and next moment the point below hid the hull of the
brig from her view.&nbsp; Then she turned away from the
balustrade, and, passing slowly before the door of her
father&rsquo;s room with her eyelids lowered, and an enigmatic
expression on her face, she disappeared behind the curtain.</p>
<p>But instead of going along the passage, she remained concealed
and very still on the other side to watch what would
happen.&nbsp; For some time the broad, furnished verandah
remained empty.&nbsp; Then the door of old Nelson&rsquo;s room
came open suddenly, and Heemskirk staggered out.&nbsp; His hair
was rumpled, his eyes bloodshot, his unshaven face looked very
dark.&nbsp; He gazed wildly about, saw his cap on a table,
snatched it up, and made for the stairs quietly, but with a
strange, tottering gait, like the last effort of waning
strength.</p>
<p>Shortly after his head had sunk below the level of the floor,
Freya came out from behind the curtain, with compressed, scheming
lips, and no softness at all in her luminous eyes.&nbsp; He could
not be allowed to sneak off scot free.&nbsp;
Never&mdash;never!&nbsp; She was excited, she tingled all over,
she had tasted blood!&nbsp; He must be made to understand that
she had been aware of having been watched; he must know that he
had been seen slinking off shamefully.&nbsp; But to run to the
front rail and shout after him would have been childish,
crude&mdash;undignified.&nbsp; And to shout&mdash;what?&nbsp;
What word?&nbsp; What phrase?&nbsp; No; it was impossible.&nbsp;
Then how? . . . She frowned, discovered it, dashed at the piano,
which had stood open all night, and made the rosewood monster
growl savagery in an irritated bass.&nbsp; She struck chords as
if firing shots after that straddling, broad figure in ample
white trousers and a dark uniform jacket with gold
shoulder-straps, and then she pursued him with the same thing she
had played the evening before&mdash;a modern, fierce piece of
love music which had been tried more than once against the
thunderstorms of the group.&nbsp; She accentuated its rhythm with
triumphant malice, so absorbed in her purpose that she did not
notice the presence of her father, who, wearing an old threadbare
ulster of a check pattern over his sleeping suit, had run out
from the back verandah to inquire the reason of this untimely
performance.&nbsp; He stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth? . . . Freya!&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice was
nearly drowned by the piano.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of
the lieutenant?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>She looked up at him as if her soul were lost in her music,
with unseeing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-a-t? . . . Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head slightly, and went on playing louder than
before.&nbsp; Old Nelson&rsquo;s innocently anxious gaze starting
from the open door of his room, explored the whole place high and
low, as if the lieutenant were something small which might have
been crawling on the floor or clinging to a wall.&nbsp; But a
shrill whistle coming somewhere from below pierced the ample
volume of sound rolling out of the piano in great, vibrating
waves.&nbsp; The lieutenant was down at the cove, whistling for
the boat to come and take him off to his ship.&nbsp; And he
seemed to be in a terrific hurry, too, for he whistled again
almost directly, waited for a moment, and then sent out a long,
interminable, shrill call as distressful to hear as though he had
shrieked without drawing breath.&nbsp; Freya ceased playing
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going on board,&rdquo; said old Nelson, perturbed by
the event.&nbsp; &ldquo;What could have made him clear out so
early?&nbsp; Queer chap.&nbsp; Devilishly touchy, too!&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was your conduct last night that
hurt his feelings?&nbsp; I noticed you, Freya.&nbsp; You as well
as laughed in his face, while he was suffering agonies from
neuralgia.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t the way to get yourself
liked.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s offended with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freya&rsquo;s hands now reposed passive on the keys; she bowed
her fair head, feeling a sudden discontent, a nervous lassitude,
as though she had passed through some exhausting crisis.&nbsp;
Old Nelson (or Nielsen), looking aggrieved, was revolving matters
of policy in his bald head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be right for me to go on board just to
inquire, some time this morning,&rdquo; he declared
fussily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they bring me my morning
tea?&nbsp; Do you hear, Freya?&nbsp; You have astonished me, I
must say.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think a young girl could be so
unfeeling.&nbsp; And the lieutenant thinks himself a friend of
ours, too!&nbsp; What?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Well, he calls himself a
friend, and that&rsquo;s something to a person in my
position.&nbsp; Certainly!&nbsp; Oh, yes, I must go on
board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; murmured Freya listlessly; then added,
in her thought: &ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> respect of the next seven weeks,
all that is necessary to say is, first, that old Nelson (or
Nielsen) failed in paying his politic call.&nbsp; The
<i>Neptun</i> gunboat of H.M. the King of the Netherlands,
commanded by an outraged and infuriated lieutenant, left the cove
at an unexpectedly early hour.&nbsp; When Freya&rsquo;s father
came down to the shore, after seeing his precious crop of tobacco
spread out properly in the sun, she was already steaming round
the point.&nbsp; Old Nelson regretted the circumstance for many
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t know in what disposition the man
went away,&rdquo; he lamented to his hard daughter.&nbsp; He was
amazed at her hardness.&nbsp; He was almost frightened by her
indifference.</p>
<p>Next, it must be recorded that the same day the gunboat
<i>Neptun</i>, steering east, passed the brig <i>Bonito</i>
becalmed in sight of Carimata, with her head to the eastward,
too.&nbsp; Her captain, Jasper Allen, giving himself up
consciously to a tender, possessive reverie of his Freya, did not
get out of his long chair on the poop to look at the
<i>Neptun</i> which passed so close that the smoke belching out
suddenly from her short black funnel rolled between the masts of
the Bonito, obscuring for a moment the sunlit whiteness of her
sails, consecrated to the service of love.&nbsp; Jasper did not
even turn his head for a glance.&nbsp; But Heemskirk, on the
bridge, had gazed long and earnestly at the brig from the
distance, gripping hard the brass rail in front of him, till, the
two ships closing, he lost all confidence in himself, and
retreating to the chartroom, pulled the door to with a
crash.&nbsp; There, his brows knitted, his mouth drawn on one
side in sardonic meditation, he sat through many still
hours&mdash;a sort of Prometheus in the bonds of unholy desire,
having his very vitals torn by the beak and claws of humiliated
passion.</p>
<p>That species of fowl is not to be shooed off as easily as a
chicken.&nbsp; Fooled, cheated, deceived, led on, outraged,
mocked at&mdash;beak and claws!&nbsp; A sinister bird!&nbsp; The
lieutenant had no mind to become the talk of the Archipelago, as
the naval officer who had had his face slapped by a girl.&nbsp;
Was it possible that she really loved that rascally trader?&nbsp;
He tried not to think, but, worse than thoughts, definite
impressions beset him in his retreat.&nbsp; He saw her&mdash;a
vision plain, close to, detailed, plastic, coloured, lighted
up&mdash;he saw her hanging round the neck of that fellow.&nbsp;
And he shut his eyes, only to discover that this was no
remedy.&nbsp; Then a piano began to play near by, very plainly;
and he put his fingers to his ears with no better effect.&nbsp;
It was not to be borne&mdash;not in solitude.&nbsp; He bolted out
of the chartroom, and talked of indifferent things somewhat
wildly with the officer of the watch on the bridge, to the
mocking accompaniment of a ghostly piano.</p>
<p>The last thing to be recorded is that Lieutenant Heemskirk
instead of pursuing his course towards Ternate, where he was
expected, went out of his way to call at Makassar, where no one
was looking for his arrival.&nbsp; Once there, he gave certain
explanations and laid a certain proposal before the governor, or
some other authority, and obtained permission to do what he
thought fit in these matters.&nbsp; Thereupon the <i>Neptun</i>,
giving up Ternate altogether, steamed north in view of the
mountainous coast of Celebes, and then crossing the broad straits
took up her station on the low coast of virgin forests, inviolate
and mute, in waters phosphorescent at night; deep blue in daytime
with gleaming green patches over the submerged reefs.&nbsp; For
days the <i>Neptun</i> could be seen moving smoothly up and down
the sombre face of the shore, or hanging about with a watchful
air near the silvery breaks of broad estuaries, under the great
luminous sky never softened, never veiled, and flooding the earth
with the everlasting sunshine of the tropics&mdash;that sunshine
which, in its unbroken splendour, oppresses the soul with an
inexpressible melancholy more intimate, more penetrating, more
profound than the grey sadness of the northern mists.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p>The trading brig <i>Bonito</i> appeared gliding round a sombre
forest-clad point of land on the silvery estuary of a great
river.&nbsp; The breath of air that gave her motion would not
have fluttered the flame of a torch.&nbsp; She stole out into the
open from behind a veil of unstirring leaves, mysteriously
silent, ghostly white, and solemnly stealthy in her imperceptible
progress; and Jasper, his elbow in the main rigging, and his head
leaning against his hand, thought of Freya.&nbsp; Everything in
the world reminded him of her.&nbsp; The beauty of the loved
woman exists in the beauties of Nature.&nbsp; The swelling
outlines of the hills, the curves of a coast, the free
sinuosities of a river are less suave than the harmonious lines
of her body, and when she moves, gliding lightly, the grace of
her progress suggests the power of occult forces which rule the
fascinating aspects of the visible world.</p>
<p>Dependent on things as all men are, Jasper loved his
vessel&mdash;the house of his dreams.&nbsp; He lent to her
something of Freya&rsquo;s soul.&nbsp; Her deck was the foothold
of their love.&nbsp; The possession of his brig appeased his
passion in a soothing certitude of happiness already
conquered.</p>
<p>The full moon was some way up, perfect and serene, floating in
air as calm and limpid as the glance of Freya&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
There was not a sound in the brig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she shall stand, by my side, on evenings like
this,&rdquo; he thought, with rapture.</p>
<p>And it was at that moment, in this peace, in this serenity,
under the full, benign gaze of the moon propitious to lovers, on
a sea without a wrinkle, under a sky without a cloud, as if all
Nature had assumed its most clement mood in a spirit of mockery,
that the gunboat <i>Neptun</i>, detaching herself from the dark
coast under which she had been lying invisible, steamed out to
intercept the trading brig <i>Bonito</i> standing out to sea.</p>
<p>Directly the gunboat had been made out emerging from her
ambush, Schultz, of the fascinating voice, had given signs of
strange agitation.&nbsp; All that day, ever since leaving the
Malay town up the river, he had shown a haggard face, going about
his duties like a man with something weighing on his mind.&nbsp;
Jasper had noticed it, but the mate, turning away, as though he
had not liked being looked at, had muttered shamefacedly of a
headache and a touch of fever.&nbsp; He must have had it very
badly when, dodging behind his captain he wondered aloud:
&ldquo;What can that fellow want with us?&rdquo; . . . A naked
man standing in a freezing blast and trying not to shiver could
not have spoken with a more harshly uncertain intonation.&nbsp;
But it might have been fever&mdash;a cold fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to make himself disagreeable, simply,&rdquo;
said Jasper, with perfect good humour.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has tried
it on me before.&nbsp; However, we shall soon see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, indeed, before long the two vessels lay abreast within
easy hail.&nbsp; The brig, with her fine lines and her white
sails, looked vaporous and sylph-like in the moonlight.&nbsp; The
gunboat, short, squat, with her stumpy dark spars naked like dead
trees, raised against the luminous sky of that resplendent night,
threw a heavy shadow on the lane of water between the two
ships.</p>
<p>Freya haunted them both like an ubiquitous spirit, and as if
she were the only woman in the world.&nbsp; Jasper remembered her
earnest recommendation to be guarded and cautious in all his acts
and words while he was away from her.&nbsp; In this quite
unforeseen encounter he felt on his ear the very breath of these
hurried admonitions customary to the last moment of their
partings, heard the half-jesting final whisper of the
&ldquo;Mind, kid, I&rsquo;d never forgive you!&rdquo; with a
quick pressure on his arm, which he answered by a quiet,
confident smile.&nbsp; Heemskirk was haunted in another
fashion.&nbsp; There were no whispers in it; it was more like
visions.&nbsp; He saw that girl hanging round the neck of a low
vagabond&mdash;that vagabond, the vagabond who had just answered
his hail.&nbsp; He saw her stealing bare-footed across a verandah
with great, clear, wide-open, eager eyes to look at a
brig&mdash;that brig.&nbsp; If she had shrieked, scolded, called
names! . . . But she had simply triumphed over him.&nbsp; That
was all.&nbsp; Led on (he firmly believed it), fooled, deceived,
outraged, struck, mocked at. . . . Beak and claws!&nbsp; The two
men, so differently haunted by Freya of the Seven Isles, were not
equally matched.</p>
<p>In the intense stillness, as of sleep, which had fallen upon
the two vessels, in a world that itself seemed but a delicate
dream, a boat pulled by Javanese sailors crossing the dark lane
of water came alongside the brig.&nbsp; The white warrant officer
in her, perhaps the gunner, climbed aboard.&nbsp; He was a short
man, with a rotund stomach and a wheezy voice.&nbsp; His
immovable fat face looked lifeless in the moonlight, and he
walked with his thick arms hanging away from his body as though
he had been stuffed.&nbsp; His cunning little eyes glittered like
bits of mica.&nbsp; He conveyed to Jasper, in broken English, a
request to come on board the <i>Neptun</i>.</p>
<p>Jasper had not expected anything so unusual.&nbsp; But after a
short reflection he decided to show neither annoyance, nor even
surprise.&nbsp; The river from which he had come had been
politically disturbed for a couple of years, and he was aware
that his visits there were looked upon with some suspicion.&nbsp;
But he did not mind much the displeasure of the authorities, so
terrifying to old Nelson.&nbsp; He prepared to leave the brig,
and Schultz followed him to the rail as if to say something, but
in the end stood by in silence.&nbsp; Jasper getting over the
side, noticed his ghastly face.&nbsp; The eyes of the man who had
found salvation in the brig from the effects of his peculiar
psychology looked at him with a dumb, beseeching expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Jasper asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how this will end?&rdquo; said he of the
beautiful voice, which had even fascinated the steady Freya
herself.&nbsp; But where was its charming timbre now?&nbsp; These
words had sounded like a raven&rsquo;s croak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are ill,&rdquo; said Jasper positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were dead!&rdquo; was the startling statement
uttered by Schultz talking to himself in the extremity of some
mysterious trouble.&nbsp; Jasper gave him a keen glance, but this
was not the time to investigate the morbid outbreak of a feverish
man.&nbsp; He did not look as though he were actually delirious,
and that for the moment must suffice.&nbsp; Schultz made a dart
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow means harm!&rdquo; he said
desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;He means harm to you, Captain
Allen.&nbsp; I feel it, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He choked with inexplicable emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Schultz.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t give him an
opening.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jasper cut him short and swung himself into
the boat.</p>
<p>On board the <i>Neptun</i> Heemskirk, standing straddle-legs
in the flood of moonlight, his inky shadow falling right across
the quarter-deck, made no sign at his approach, but secretly he
felt something like the heave of the sea in his chest at the
sight of that man.&nbsp; Jasper waited before him in silence.</p>
<p>Brought face to face in direct personal contact, they fell at
once into the manner of their casual meetings in old
Nelson&rsquo;s bungalow.&nbsp; They ignored each other&rsquo;s
existence&mdash;Heemskirk moodily; Jasper, with a perfectly
colourless quietness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on in that river you&rsquo;ve just
come out of?&rdquo; asked the lieutenant straight away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of the troubles, if you mean
that,&rdquo; Jasper answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve landed
there half a cargo of rice, for which I got nothing in exchange,
and went away.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no trade there now, but they
would have been starving in another week&mdash;if I hadn&rsquo;t
turned up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meddling!&nbsp; English meddling!&nbsp; And suppose the
rascals don&rsquo;t deserve anything better than to starve,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are women and children there, you know,&rdquo;
observed Jasper, in his even tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; When an Englishman talks of women and
children, you may be sure there&rsquo;s something fishy about the
business.&nbsp; Your doings will have to be
investigated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spoke in turn, as though they had been disembodied
spirits&mdash;mere voices in empty air; for they looked at each
other as if there had been nothing there, or, at most, with as
much recognition as one gives to an inanimate object, and no
more.&nbsp; But now a silence fell.&nbsp; Heemskirk had thought,
all at once: &ldquo;She will tell him all about it.&nbsp; She
will tell him while she hangs round his neck
laughing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the sudden desire to annihilate Jasper
on the spot almost deprived him of his senses by its
vehemence.&nbsp; He lost the power of speech, of vision.&nbsp;
For a moment he absolutely couldn&rsquo;t see Jasper.&nbsp; But
he heard him inquiring, as of the world at large:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I, then, to conclude that the brig is
detained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heemskirk made a recovery in a flush of malignant
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is.&nbsp; I am going to take her to Makassar in
tow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The courts will have to decide on the legality of
this,&rdquo; said Jasper, aware that the matter was becoming
serious, but with assumed indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the courts!&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; And as to
you, I shall keep you on board here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper&rsquo;s dismay at being parted from his ship was
betrayed by a stony immobility.&nbsp; It lasted but an
instant.&nbsp; Then he turned away and hailed the brig.&nbsp; Mr.
Schultz answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready to receive a tow-rope from the gunboat!&nbsp;
We are going to be taken to Makassar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that for, sir?&rdquo; came
an anxious cry faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindness, I suppose,&rdquo; Jasper, ironical, shouted
with great deliberation.&nbsp; &ldquo;We might have
been&mdash;becalmed in here&mdash;for days.&nbsp; And
hospitality.&nbsp; I am invited to stay&mdash;on board
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to this information was a loud ejaculation of
distress.&nbsp; Jasper thought anxiously: &ldquo;Why, the
fellow&rsquo;s nerve&rsquo;s gone to pieces;&rdquo; and with an
awkward uneasiness of a new sort, looked intently at the
brig.&nbsp; The thought that he was parted from her&mdash;for the
first time since they came together&mdash;shook the apparently
careless fortitude of his character to its very foundations,
which were deep.&nbsp; All that time neither Heemskirk nor even
his inky shadow had stirred in the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to send a boat&rsquo;s crew and an officer
on board your vessel,&rdquo; he announced to no one in
particular.&nbsp; Jasper, tearing himself away from the absorbed
contemplation of the brig, turned round, and, without passion,
almost without expression in his voice, entered his protest
against the whole of the proceedings.&nbsp; What he was thinking
of was the delay.&nbsp; He counted the days.&nbsp; Makassar was
actually on his way; and to be towed there really saved
time.&nbsp; On the other hand, there would be some vexing
formalities to go through.&nbsp; But the thing was too
absurd.&nbsp; &ldquo;The beetle&rsquo;s gone mad,&rdquo; he
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be released at once.&nbsp; And
if not, Mesman must enter into a bond for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mesman
was a Dutch merchant with whom Jasper had had many dealings, a
considerable person in Makassar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You protest?&nbsp; H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; Heemskirk
muttered, and for a little longer remained motionless, his legs
planted well apart, and his head lowered as though he were
studying his own comical, deeply-split shadow.&nbsp; Then he made
a sign to the rotund gunner, who had kept at hand, motionless,
like a vilely-stuffed specimen of a fat man, with a lifeless face
and glittering little eyes.&nbsp; The fellow approached, and
stood at attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will board the brig with a boat&rsquo;s
crew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya, mynherr!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have one of your men to steer her all the
time,&rdquo; went on Heemskirk, giving his orders in English,
apparently for Jasper&rsquo;s edification.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya, mynherr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will remain on deck and in charge all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya, mynherr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper felt as if, together with the command of the brig, his
very heart were being taken out of his breast.&nbsp; Heemskirk
asked, with a change of tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What weapons have you on board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one time all the ships trading in the China Seas had a
licence to carry a certain quantity of firearms for purposes of
defence.&nbsp; Jasper answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen rifles with their bayonets, which were on
board when I bought her, four years ago.&nbsp; They have been
declared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fore-cabin.&nbsp; Mate has the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will take possession of them,&rdquo; said Heemskirk
to the gunner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya, mynherr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this for?&nbsp; What do you mean to
imply?&rdquo; cried out Jasper; then bit his lip.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s monstrous!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Heemskirk raised for a moment a heavy, as if suffering,
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; he said to his gunner.&nbsp; The fat
man saluted, and departed.</p>
<p>During the next thirty hours the steady towing was interrupted
once.&nbsp; At a signal from the brig, made by waving a flag on
the forecastle, the gunboat was stopped.&nbsp; The badly-stuffed
specimen of a warrant-officer, getting into his boat, arrived on
board the <i>Neptun</i> and hurried straight into his
commander&rsquo;s cabin, his excitement at something he had to
communicate being betrayed by the blinking of his small
eyes.&nbsp; These two were closeted together for some time, while
Jasper at the taffrail tried to make out if anything out of the
common had occurred on board the brig.</p>
<p>But nothing seemed to be amiss on board.&nbsp; However, he
kept a look-out for the gunner; and, though he had avoided
speaking to anybody since he had finished with Heemskirk, he
stopped that man when he came out on deck again to ask how his
mate was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was feeling not very well when I left,&rdquo; he
explained.</p>
<p>The fat warrant-officer, holding himself as though the effort
of carrying his big stomach in front of him demanded a rigid
carriage, understood with difficulty.&nbsp; Not a single one of
his features showed the slightest animation, but his little eyes
blinked rapidly at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ya!&nbsp; The mate.&nbsp; Ya, ya!&nbsp; He is very
well.&nbsp; But, mein Gott, he is one very funny man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper could get no explanation of that remark, because the
Dutchman got into the boat hurriedly, and went back on board the
brig.&nbsp; But he consoled himself with the thought that very
soon all this unpleasant and rather absurd experience would be
over.&nbsp; The roadstead of Makassar was in sight already.&nbsp;
Heemskirk passed by him going on the bridge.&nbsp; For the first
time the lieutenant looked at Jasper with marked intention; and
the strange roll of his eyes was so funny&mdash;it had been long
agreed by Jasper and Freya that the lieutenant was funny&mdash;so
ecstatically gratified, as though he were rolling a tasty morsel
on his tongue, that Jasper could not help a broad smile.&nbsp;
And then he turned to his brig again.</p>
<p>To see her, his cherished possession, animated by something of
his Freya&rsquo;s soul, the only foothold of two lives on the
wide earth, the security of his passion, the companion of
adventure, the power to snatch the calm, adorable Freya to his
breast, and carry her off to the end of the world; to see this
beautiful thing embodying worthily his pride and his love, to see
her captive at the end of a tow-rope was not indeed a pleasant
experience.&nbsp; It had something nightmarish in it, as, for
instance, the dream of a wild sea-bird loaded with chains.</p>
<p>Yet what else could he want to look at?&nbsp; Her beauty would
sometimes come to his heart with the force of a spell, so that he
would forget where he was.&nbsp; And, besides, that sense of
superiority which the certitude of being loved gives to a young
man, that illusion of being set above the Fates by a tender look
in a woman&rsquo;s eyes, helped him, the first shock over, to go
through these experiences with an amused self-confidence.&nbsp;
For what evil could touch the elect of Freya?</p>
<p>It was now afternoon, the sun being behind the two vessels as
they headed for the harbour.&nbsp; &ldquo;The beetle&rsquo;s
little joke shall soon be over,&rdquo; thought Jasper, without
any great animosity.&nbsp; As a seaman well acquainted with that
part of the world, a casual glance was enough to tell him what
was being done.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;he
is going through Spermonde Passage.&nbsp; We shall be rounding
Tamissa reef presently.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again he returned to the
contemplation of his brig, that main-stay of his material and
emotional existence which would be soon in his hands again.&nbsp;
On a sea, calm like a millpond, a heavy smooth ripple undulated
and streamed away from her bows, for the powerful <i>Neptun</i>
was towing at great speed, as if for a wager.&nbsp; The Dutch
gunner appeared on the forecastle of the <i>Bonito</i>, and with
him a couple of men.&nbsp; They stood looking at the coast, and
Jasper lost himself in a loverlike trance.</p>
<p>The deep-toned blast of the gunboat&rsquo;s steam-whistle made
him shudder by its unexpectedness.&nbsp; Slowly he looked
about.&nbsp; Swift as lightning he leaped from where he stood,
bounding forward along the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be on Tamissa reef!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>High up on the bridge Heemskirk looked back over his shoulder
heavily; two seamen were spinning the wheel round, and the
<i>Neptun</i> was already swinging rapidly away from the edge of
the pale water over the danger.&nbsp; Ha! just in time.&nbsp;
Jasper turned about instantly to watch his brig; and, even before
he realised that&mdash;in obedience, it appears, to
Heemskirk&rsquo;s orders given beforehand to the gunner&mdash;the
tow-rope had been let go at the blast of the whistle, before he
had time to cry out or to move a limb, he saw her cast adrift and
shooting across the gunboat&rsquo;s stern with the impetus of her
speed.&nbsp; He followed her fine, gliding form with eyes growing
big with incredulity, wild with horror.&nbsp; The cries on board
of her came to him only as a dreadful and confused murmur through
the loud thumping of blood in his ears, while she held on.&nbsp;
She ran upright in a terrible display of her gift of speed, with
an incomparable air of life and grace.&nbsp; She ran on till the
smooth level of water in front of her bows seemed to sink down
suddenly as if sucked away; and, with a strange, violent tremor
of her mast-heads she stopped, inclined her lofty spars a little,
and lay still.&nbsp; She lay still on the reef, while the
<i>Neptun</i>, fetching a wide circle, continued at full speed up
Spermonde Passage, heading for the town.&nbsp; She lay still,
perfectly still, with something ill-omened and unnatural in her
attitude.&nbsp; In an instant the subtle melancholy of things
touched by decay had fallen on her in the sunshine; she was but a
speck in the brilliant emptiness of space, already lonely,
already desolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; yelled a voice from the bridge.</p>
<p>Jasper had started to run to his brig with a headlong impulse,
as a man dashes forward to pull away with his hands a living,
breathing, loved creature from the brink of destruction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hold him!&nbsp; Stick to him!&rdquo; vociferated the
lieutenant at the top of the bridge-ladder, while Jasper
struggled madly without a word, only his head emerging from the
heaving crowd of the <i>Neptun&rsquo;s</i> seamen, who had flung
themselves upon him obediently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold&mdash;I would
not have that fellow drown himself for anything now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper ceased struggling.</p>
<p>One by one they let go of him; they fell back gradually
farther and farther, in attentive silence, leaving him standing
unsupported in a widened, clear space, as if to give him plenty
of room to fall after the struggle.&nbsp; He did not even sway
perceptibly.&nbsp; Half an hour later, when the <i>Neptun</i>
anchored in front of the town, he had not stirred yet, had moved
neither head nor limb as much as a hair&rsquo;s breadth.&nbsp;
Directly the rumble of the gunboat&rsquo;s cable had ceased,
Heemskirk came down heavily from the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call a sampan&rdquo; he said, in a gloomy tone, as he
passed the sentry at the gangway, and then moved on slowly
towards the spot where Jasper, the object of many awed glances,
stood looking at the deck, as if lost in a brown study.&nbsp;
Heemskirk came up close, and stared at him thoughtfully, with his
fingers over his lips.&nbsp; Here he was, the favoured vagabond,
the only man to whom that infernal girl was likely to tell the
story.&nbsp; But he would not find it funny.&nbsp; The story how
Lieutenant Heemskirk&mdash;No, he would not laugh at it.&nbsp; He
looked as though he would never laugh at anything in his
life.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jasper looked up.&nbsp; His eyes, without any other
expression but bewilderment, met those of Heemskirk, observant
and sombre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone on the reef!&rdquo; he said, in a low, astounded
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;On-the-reef!&rdquo; he repeated still lower,
and as if attending inwardly to the birth of some awful and
amazing sensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the very top of high-water, spring tides,&rdquo;
Heemskirk struck in, with a vindictive, exulting violence which
flashed and expired.&nbsp; He paused, as if weary, fixing upon
Jasper his arrogant eyes, over which secret disenchantment, the
unavoidable shadow of all passion, seemed to pass like a
saddening cloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the very top,&rdquo; he
repeated, rousing himself in fierce reaction to snatch his laced
cap off his head with a horizontal, derisive flourish towards the
gangway.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now you may go ashore to the courts,
you damned Englishman!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> affair of the brig
<i>Bonito</i> was bound to cause a sensation in Makassar, the
prettiest, and perhaps the cleanest-looking of all the towns in
the Islands; which however knows few occasions for
excitement.&nbsp; The &ldquo;front,&rdquo; with its special
population, was soon aware that something had happened.&nbsp; A
steamer towing a sailing vessel had been observed far out to sea
for some time, and when the steamer came in alone, leaving the
other outside, attention was aroused.&nbsp; Why was that?&nbsp;
Her masts only could be seen&mdash;with furled
sails&mdash;remaining in the same place to the southward.&nbsp;
And soon the rumour ran all along the crowded seashore street
that there was a ship on Tamissa reef.&nbsp; That crowd
interpreted the appearance correctly.&nbsp; Its cause was beyond
their penetration, for who could associate a girl nine hundred
miles away with the stranding of a ship on Tamissa reef, or look
for the remote filiation of that event in the psychology of at
least three people, even if one of them, Lieutenant Heemskirk,
was at that very moment passing amongst them on his way to make
his verbal report?</p>
<p>No; the minds on the &ldquo;front&rdquo; were not competent
for that sort of investigation, but many hands there&mdash;brown
hands, yellow hands, white hands&mdash;were raised to shade the
eyes gazing out to sea.&nbsp; The rumour spread quickly.&nbsp;
Chinese shopkeepers came to their doors, more than one white
merchant, even, rose from his desk to go to the window.&nbsp;
After all, a ship on Tamissa was not an everyday
occurrence.&nbsp; And presently the rumour took a more definite
shape.&nbsp; An English trader&mdash;detained on suspicion at sea
by the <i>Neptun</i>&mdash;Heemskirk was towing him in to test a
case, and by some strange accident&mdash;</p>
<p>Later on the name came out.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
<i>Bonito</i>&mdash;what!&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; Yes&mdash;yes,
the <i>Bonito</i>.&nbsp; Look!&nbsp; You can see from here; only
two masts.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a brig.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t think that
man would ever let himself be caught.&nbsp; Heemskirk&rsquo;s
pretty smart, too.&nbsp; They say she&rsquo;s fitted out in her
cabin like a gentleman&rsquo;s yacht.&nbsp; That Allen is a sort
of gentleman too.&nbsp; An extravagant beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young man entered smartly Messrs. Mesman Brothers&rsquo;
office on the &ldquo;front,&rdquo; bubbling with some further
information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; that&rsquo;s the <i>Bonito</i> for
certain!&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t know the story I&rsquo;ve
heard just now.&nbsp; The fellow must have been feeding that
river with firearms for the last year or two.&nbsp; Well, it
seems he has grown so reckless from long impunity that he has
actually dared to sell the very ship&rsquo;s rifles this
time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fact.&nbsp; The rifles are not on
board.&nbsp; What impudence!&nbsp; Only, he didn&rsquo;t know
that there was one of our warships on the coast.&nbsp; But those
Englishmen are so impudent that perhaps he thought that nothing
would be done to him for it.&nbsp; Our courts do let off these
fellows too often, on some miserable excuse or other.&nbsp; But,
at any rate, there&rsquo;s an end of the famous
<i>Bonito</i>.&nbsp; I have just heard in the harbour-office that
she must have gone on at the very top of high-water; and she is
in ballast, too.&nbsp; No human power, they think, can move her
from where she is.&nbsp; I only hope it is so.&nbsp; It would be
fine to have the notorious <i>Bonito</i> stuck up there as a
warning to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. J. Mesman, a colonial-born Dutchman, a kind, paternal old
fellow, with a clean-shaven, quiet, handsome fade, and a head of
fine iron-grey hair curling a little on his collar, did not say a
word in defence of Jasper and the <i>Bonito</i>.&nbsp; He rose
from his arm-chair suddenly.&nbsp; His face was visibly
troubled.&nbsp; It had so happened that once, from a business
talk of ways and means, island trade, money matters, and so on,
Jasper had been led to open himself to him on the subject of
Freya; and the excellent man, who had known old Nelson years
before and even remembered something of Freya, was much
astonished and amused by the unfolding of the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well!&nbsp; Nelson!&nbsp; Yes; of
course.&nbsp; A very honest sort of man.&nbsp; And a little child
with very fair hair.&nbsp; Oh, yes!&nbsp; I have a distinct
recollection.&nbsp; And so she has grown into such a fine girl,
so very determined, so very&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And he laughed
almost boisterously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mind, when you have happily
eloped with your future wife, Captain Allen, you must come along
this way, and we shall welcome her here.&nbsp; A little
fair-headed child!&nbsp; I remember.&nbsp; I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was that knowledge which had brought trouble to his face at
the first news of the wreck.&nbsp; He took up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Mr. Mesman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to look for Allen.&nbsp; I think he must be
ashore.&nbsp; Does anybody know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one of those present knew.&nbsp; And Mr. Mesman went out on
the &ldquo;front&rdquo; to make inquiries.</p>
<p>The other part of the town, the part near the church and the
fort, got its information in another way.&nbsp; The first thing
disclosed to it was Jasper himself, walking rapidly, as though he
were pursued.&nbsp; And, as a matter of fact, a Chinaman,
obviously a sampan man, was following him at the same headlong
pace.&nbsp; Suddenly, while passing Orange House, Jasper swerved
and went in, or, rather, rushed in, startling Gomez, the hotel
clerk, very much.&nbsp; But a Chinaman beginning to make an
unseemly noise at the door claimed the immediate attention of
Gomez.&nbsp; His grievance was that the white man whom he had
brought on shore from the gunboat had not paid him his
boat-fare.&nbsp; He had pursued him so far, asking for it all the
way.&nbsp; But the white man had taken no notice whatever of his
just claim.&nbsp; Gomez satisfied the coolie with a few coppers,
and then went to look for Jasper, whom he knew very well.&nbsp;
He found him standing stiffly by a little round table.&nbsp; At
the other end of the verandah a few men sitting there had stopped
talking, and were looking at him in silence.&nbsp; Two
billiard-players, with cues in their hands, had come to the door
of the billiard-room and stared, too.</p>
<p>On Gomez coming up to him, Jasper raised one hand to point at
his own throat.&nbsp; Gomez noted the somewhat soiled state of
his white clothes, then took one look at his face, and fled away
to order the drink for which Jasper seemed to be asking.</p>
<p>Where he wanted to go&mdash;or what purpose&mdash;where he,
perhaps, only imagined himself to be going, when a sudden impulse
or the sight of a familiar place had made him turn into Orange
House&mdash;it is impossible to say.&nbsp; He was steadying
himself lightly with the tips of his fingers on the little
table.&nbsp; There were on that verandah two men whom he knew
well personally, but his gaze roaming incessantly as though he
were looking for a way of escape, passed and repassed over them
without a sign of recognition.&nbsp; They, on their side, looking
at him, doubted the evidence of their own eyes.&nbsp; It was not
that his face was distorted.&nbsp; On the contrary, it was still,
it was set.&nbsp; But its expression, somehow, was
unrecognisable.&nbsp; Can that be him? they wondered with
awe.</p>
<p>In his head there was a wild chaos of clear thoughts.&nbsp;
Perfectly clear.&nbsp; It was this clearness which was so
terrible in conjunction with the utter inability to lay hold of
any single one of them all.&nbsp; He was saying to himself, or to
them: &ldquo;Steady, steady.&rdquo;&nbsp; A China boy appeared
before him with a glass on a tray.&nbsp; He poured the drink down
his throat, and rushed out.&nbsp; His disappearance removed the
spell of wonder from the beholders.&nbsp; One of the men jumped
up and moved quickly to that side of the verandah from which
almost the whole of the roadstead could be seen.&nbsp; At the
very moment when Jasper, issuing from the door of the Orange
House, was passing under him in the street below, he cried to the
others excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Allen right enough!&nbsp; But where is his
brig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper heard these words with extraordinary loudness.&nbsp;
The heavens rang with them, as if calling him to account; for
those were the very words Freya would have to use.&nbsp; It was
an annihilating question; it struck his consciousness like a
thunderbolt and brought a sudden night upon the chaos of his
thoughts even as he walked.&nbsp; He did not check his
pace.&nbsp; He went on in the darkness for another three strides,
and then fell.</p>
<p>The good Mesman had to push on as far as the hospital before
he found him.&nbsp; The doctor there talked of a slight
heatstroke.&nbsp; Nothing very much.&nbsp; Out in three days. . .
. It must be admitted that the doctor was right.&nbsp; In three
days, Jasper Allen came out of the hospital and became visible to
the town&mdash;very visible indeed&mdash;and remained so for
quite a long time; long enough to become almost one of the sights
of the place; long enough to become disregarded at last; long
enough for the tale of his haunting visibility to be remembered
in the islands to this day.</p>
<p>The talk on the &ldquo;front&rdquo; and Jasper&rsquo;s
appearance in the Orange House stand at the beginning of the
famous <i>Bonito</i> case, and give a view of its two
aspects&mdash;the practical and the psychological.&nbsp; The case
for the courts and the case for compassion; that last terribly
evident and yet obscure.</p>
<p>It has, you must understand, remained obscure even for that
friend of mine who wrote me the letter mentioned in the very
first lines of this narrative.&nbsp; He was one of those in Mr.
Mesman&rsquo;s office, and accompanied that gentleman in his
search for Jasper.&nbsp; His letter described to me the two
aspects and some of the episodes of the case.&nbsp;
Heemskirk&rsquo;s attitude was that of deep thankfulness for not
having lost his own ship, and that was all.&nbsp; Haze over the
land was his explanation of having got so close to Tamissa
reef.&nbsp; He saved his ship, and for the rest he did not
care.&nbsp; As to the fat gunner, he deposed simply that he
thought at the time that he was acting for the best by letting go
the tow-rope, but admitted that he was greatly confused by the
suddenness of the emergency.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he had acted on very precise instructions
from Heemskirk, to whom through several years&rsquo; service
together in the East he had become a sort of devoted
henchman.&nbsp; What was most amazing in the detention of the
<i>Bonito</i> was his story how, proceeding to take possession of
the firearms as ordered, he discovered that there were no
firearms on board.&nbsp; All he found in the fore-cabin was an
empty rack for the proper number of eighteen rifles, but of the
rifles themselves never a single one anywhere in the ship.&nbsp;
The mate of the brig, who looked rather ill and behaved
excitedly, as though he were perhaps a lunatic, wanted him to
believe that Captain Allen knew nothing of this; that it was he,
the mate, who had recently sold these rifles in the dead of night
to a certain person up the river.&nbsp; In proof of this story he
produced a bag of silver dollars and pressed it on his, the
gunner&rsquo;s, acceptance.&nbsp; Then, suddenly flinging it down
on the deck, he beat his own head with both his fists and started
heaping shocking curses upon his own soul for an ungrateful
wretch not fit to live.</p>
<p>All this the gunner reported at once to his commanding
officer.</p>
<p>What Heemskirk intended by taking upon himself to detain the
<i>Bonito</i> it is difficult to say, except that he meant to
bring some trouble into the life of the man favoured by
Freya.&nbsp; He had been looking at Jasper with a desire to
strike that man of kisses and embraces to the earth.&nbsp; The
question was: How could he do it without giving himself
away?&nbsp; But the report of the gunner created a serious case
enough.&nbsp; Yet Allen had friends&mdash;and who could tell
whether he wouldn&rsquo;t somehow succeed in wriggling out of
it?&nbsp; The idea of simply towing the brig so much compromised
on to the reef came to him while he was listening to the fat
gunner in his cabin.&nbsp; There was but little risk of being
disapproved now.&nbsp; And it should be made to appear an
accident.</p>
<p>Going out on deck he had gloated upon his unconscious victim
with such a sinister roll of his eyes, such a queerly pursed
mouth, that Jasper could not help smiling.&nbsp; And the
lieutenant had gone on the bridge, saying to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait!&nbsp; I shall spoil the taste of those sweet
kisses for you.&nbsp; When you hear of Lieutenant Heemskirk in
the future that name won&rsquo;t bring a smile on your lips, I
swear.&nbsp; You are delivered into my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this possibility had come about without any planning, one
could almost say naturally, as if events had mysteriously shaped
themselves to fit the purposes of a dark passion.&nbsp; The most
astute scheming could not have served Heemskirk better.&nbsp; It
was given to him to taste a transcendental, an incredible
perfection of vengeance; to strike a deadly blow into that hated
person&rsquo;s heart, and to watch him afterwards walking about
with the dagger in his breast.</p>
<p>For that is what the state of Jasper amounted to.&nbsp; He
moved, acted, weary-eyed, keen-faced, lank and restless, with
brusque movements and fierce gestures; he talked incessantly in a
frenzied and fatigued voice, but within himself he knew that
nothing would ever give him back the brig, just as nothing can
heal a pierced heart.&nbsp; His soul, kept quiet in the stress of
love by the unflinching Freya&rsquo;s influence, was like a still
but overwound string.&nbsp; The shock had started it vibrating,
and the string had snapped.&nbsp; He had waited for two years in
a perfectly intoxicated confidence for a day that now would never
come to a man disarmed for life by the loss of the brig, and, it
seemed to him, made unfit for love to which he had no foothold to
offer.</p>
<p>Day after day he would traverse the length of the town, follow
the coast, and, reaching the point of land opposite that part of
the reef on which his brig lay stranded, look steadily across the
water at her beloved form, once the home of an exulting hope, and
now, in her inclined, desolated immobility, towering above the
lonely sea-horizon, a symbol of despair.</p>
<p>The crew had left her in due course in her own boats which
directly they reached the town were sequestrated by the harbour
authorities.&nbsp; The vessel, too, was sequestrated pending
proceedings; but these same authorities did not take the trouble
to set a guard on board.&nbsp; For, indeed, what could move her
from there?&nbsp; Nothing, unless a miracle; nothing, unless
Jasper&rsquo;s eyes, fastened on her tensely for hours together,
as though he hoped by the mere power of vision to draw her to his
breast.</p>
<p>All this story, read in my friend&rsquo;s very chatty letter,
dismayed me not a little.&nbsp; But it was really appalling to
read his relation of how Schultz, the mate, went about everywhere
affirming with desperate pertinacity that it was he alone who had
sold the rifles.&nbsp; &ldquo;I stole them,&rdquo; he
protested.&nbsp; Of course, no one would believe him.&nbsp; My
friend himself did not believe him, though he, of course, admired
this self-sacrifice.&nbsp; But a good many people thought it was
going too far to make oneself out a thief for the sake of a
friend.&nbsp; Only, it was such an obvious lie, too, that it did
not matter, perhaps.</p>
<p>I, who, in view of Schultz&rsquo;s psychology, knew how true
that must be, admit that I was appalled.&nbsp; So this was how a
perfidious destiny took advantage of a generous impulse!&nbsp;
And I felt as though I were an accomplice in this perfidy, since
I did to a certain extent encourage Jasper.&nbsp; Yet I had
warned him as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man seemed to have gone crazy on this point,&rdquo;
wrote my friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;He went to Mesman with his
story.&nbsp; He says that some rascally white man living amongst
the natives up that river made him drunk with some gin one
evening, and then jeered at him for never having any money.&nbsp;
Then he, protesting to us that he was an honest man and must be
believed, described himself as being a thief whenever he took a
drop too much, and told us that he went on board and passed the
rifles one by one without the slightest compunction to a canoe
which came alongside that night, receiving ten dollars apiece for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day he was ill with shame and grief, but had not
the courage to confess his lapse to his benefactor.&nbsp; When
the gunboat stopped the brig he felt ready to die with the
apprehension of the consequences, and would have died happily, if
he could have been able to bring the rifles back by the sacrifice
of his life.&nbsp; He said nothing to Jasper, hoping that the
brig would be released presently.&nbsp; When it turned out
otherwise and his captain was detained on board the gunboat, he
was ready to commit suicide from despair; only he thought it his
duty to live in order to let the truth be known.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am an honest man!&nbsp; I am an honest man!&rsquo; he repeated,
in a voice that brought tears to our eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must
believe me when I tell you that I am a thief&mdash;a vile, low,
cunning, sneaking thief as soon as I&rsquo;ve had a glass or
two.&nbsp; Take me somewhere where I may tell the truth on
oath.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we had at last convinced him that his story could
be of no use to Jasper&mdash;for what Dutch court, having once
got hold of an English trader, would accept such an explanation;
and, indeed, how, when, where could one hope to find proofs of
such a tale?&mdash;he made as if to tear his hair in handfuls,
but, calming down, said: &lsquo;Good-bye, then, gentlemen,&rsquo;
and went out of the room so crushed that he seemed hardly able to
put one foot before the other.&nbsp; That very night he committed
suicide by cutting his throat in the house of a half-caste with
whom he had been lodging since he came ashore from the
wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That throat, I thought with a shudder, which could produce the
tender, persuasive, manly, but fascinating voice which had
aroused Jasper&rsquo;s ready compassion and had secured
Freya&rsquo;s sympathy!&nbsp; Who could ever have supposed such
an end in store for the impossible, gentle Schultz, with his
idiosyncrasy of na&iuml;ve pilfering, so absurdly straightforward
that, even in the people who had suffered from it, it aroused
nothing more than a sort of amused exasperation?&nbsp; He was
really impossible.&nbsp; His lot evidently should have been a
half-starved, mysterious, but by no means tragic existence as a
mild-eyed, inoffensive beachcomber on the fringe of native
life.&nbsp; There are occasions when the irony of fate, which
some people profess to discover in the working out of our lives,
wears the aspect of crude and savage jesting.</p>
<p>I shook my head over the manes of Schultz, and went on with my
friend&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; It told me how the brig on the reef,
looted by the natives from the coast villages, acquired gradually
the lamentable aspect, the grey ghastliness of a wreck; while
Jasper, fading daily into a mere shadow of a man, strode
brusquely all along the &ldquo;front&rdquo; with horribly lively
eyes and a faint, fixed smile on his lips, to spend the day on a
lonely spit of sand looking eagerly at her, as though he had
expected some shape on board to rise up and make some sort of
sign to him over the decaying bulwarks.&nbsp; The Mesmans were
taking care of him as far as it was possible.&nbsp; The
<i>Bonito</i> case had been referred to Batavia, where no doubt
it would fade away in a fog of official papers. . . . It was
heartrending to read all this.&nbsp; That active and zealous
officer, Lieutenant Heemskirk, his air of sullen, darkly-pained
self-importance not lightened by the approval of his action
conveyed to him unofficially, had gone on to take up his station
in the Moluccas. . . .</p>
<p>Then, at the end of the bulky, kindly-meant epistle, dealing
with the island news of half a year at least, my friend wrote:
&ldquo;A couple of months ago old Nelson turned up here, arriving
by the mail-boat from Java.&nbsp; Came to see Mesman, it
seems.&nbsp; A rather mysterious visit, and extraordinarily
short, after coming all that way.&nbsp; He stayed just four days
at the Orange House, with apparently nothing in particular to do,
and then caught the south-going steamer for the Straits.&nbsp; I
remember people saying at one time that Allen was rather sweet on
old Nelson&rsquo;s daughter, the girl that was brought up by Mrs.
Harley and then went to live with him at the Seven Isles
group.&nbsp; Surely you remember old Nelson&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remember old Nelson!&nbsp; Rather!</p>
<p>The letter went on to inform me further that old Nelson, at
least, remembered me, since some time after his flying visit to
Makassar he had written to the Mesmans asking for my address in
London.</p>
<p>That old Nelson (or Nielsen), the note of whose personality
was a profound, echoless irresponsiveness to everything around
him, should wish to write, or find anything to write about to
anybody, was in itself a cause for no small wonder.&nbsp; And to
me, of all people!&nbsp; I waited with uneasy impatience for
whatever disclosure could come from that naturally benighted
intelligence, but my impatience had time to wear out before my
eyes beheld old Nelson&rsquo;s trembling, painfully-formed
handwriting, senile and childish at the same time, on an envelope
bearing a penny stamp and the postal mark of the Notting Hill
office.&nbsp; I delayed opening it in order to pay the tribute of
astonishment due to the event by flinging my hands above my
head.&nbsp; So he had come home to England, to be definitely
Nelson; or else was on his way home to Denmark, where he would
revert for ever to his original Nielsen!&nbsp; But old Nelson (or
Nielsen) out of the tropics seemed unthinkable.&nbsp; And yet he
was there, asking me to call.</p>
<p>His address was at a boarding-house in one of those Bayswater
squares, once of leisure, which nowadays are reduced to earning
their living.&nbsp; Somebody had recommended him there.&nbsp; I
started to call on him on one of those January days in London,
one of those wintry days composed of the four devilish elements,
cold, wet, mud, and grime, combined with a particular stickiness
of atmosphere that clings like an unclean garment to one&rsquo;s
very soul.&nbsp; Yet on approaching his abode I saw, like a
flicker far behind the soiled veil of the four elements, the
wearisome and splendid glitter of a blue sea with the Seven
Islets like minute specks swimming in my eye, the high red roof
of the bungalow crowning the very smallest of them all.&nbsp;
This visual reminiscence was profoundly disturbing.&nbsp; I
knocked at the door with a faltering hand.</p>
<p>Old Nelson (or Nielsen) got up from the table at which he was
sitting with a shabby pocket-book full of papers before
him.&nbsp; He took off his spectacles before shaking hands.&nbsp;
For a moment neither of us said a word; then, noticing me looking
round somewhat expectantly, he murmured some words, of which I
caught only &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hong Kong,&rdquo;
cast his eyes down, and sighed.</p>
<p>His moustache, sticking all ways out, as of yore, was quite
white now.&nbsp; His old cheeks were softly rounded, with some
colour in them; strangely enough, that something childlike always
noticeable in the general contour of his physiognomy had become
much more marked.&nbsp; Like his handwriting, he looked childish
and senile.&nbsp; He showed his age most in his unintelligently
furrowed, anxious forehead and in his round, innocent eyes, which
appeared to me weak and blinking and watery; or was it that they
were full of tears? . . .</p>
<p>To discover old Nelson fully informed upon any matter whatever
was a new experience.&nbsp; And after the first awkwardness had
worn off he talked freely, with, now and then, a question to
start him going whenever he lapsed into silence, which he would
do suddenly, clasping his hands on his waistcoat in an attitude
which would recall to me the east verandah, where he used to sit
talking quietly and puffing out his cheeks in what seemed now
old, very old days.&nbsp; He talked in a reasonable somewhat
anxious tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; We did not know anything for weeks.&nbsp;
Out of the way like that, we couldn&rsquo;t, of course.&nbsp; No
mail service to the Seven Isles.&nbsp; But one day I ran over to
Banka in my big sailing-boat to see whether there were any
letters, and saw a Dutch paper.&nbsp; But it looked only like a
bit of marine news: English brig <i>Bonito</i> gone ashore
outside Makassar roads.&nbsp; That was all.&nbsp; I took the
paper home with me and showed it to her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will
never forgive him!&rsquo; she cries with her old spirit.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you are a sensible
girl.&nbsp; The best man may lose a ship.&nbsp; But what about
your health?&rsquo;&nbsp; I was beginning to be frightened at her
looks.&nbsp; She would not let me talk even of going to Singapore
before.&nbsp; But, really, such a sensible girl couldn&rsquo;t
keep on objecting for ever.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do what you like,
papa,&rsquo; she says.&nbsp; Rather a job, that.&nbsp; Had to
catch a steamer at sea, but I got her over all right.&nbsp;
There, doctors, of course.&nbsp; Fever.&nbsp; An&aelig;mia.&nbsp;
Put her to bed.&nbsp; Two or three women very kind to her.&nbsp;
Naturally in our papers the whole story came out before
long.&nbsp; She reads it to the end, lying on the couch; then
hands the newspaper back to me, whispers &lsquo;Heemskirk,&rsquo;
and goes off into a faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blinked at me for quite a long time, his eyes running full
of tears again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day,&rdquo; he began, without any emotion in his
voice, &ldquo;she felt stronger, and we had a long talk.&nbsp;
She told me everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here old Nelson, with his eyes cast down, gave me the whole
story of the Heemskirk episode in Freya&rsquo;s words; then went
on in his rather jerky utterance, and looking up innocently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you have behaved
in the main like a sensible girl.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been
horrid,&rsquo; she cries, &lsquo;and he is breaking his heart
over there.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, she was too sensible not to see
she wasn&rsquo;t in a state to travel.&nbsp; But I went.&nbsp;
She told me to go.&nbsp; She was being looked after very
well.&nbsp; An&aelig;mia.&nbsp; Getting better, they
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did see him?&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I did see him,&rdquo; he started again,
talking in that reasonable voice as though he were arguing a
point.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did see him.&nbsp; I came upon him.&nbsp;
Eyes sunk an inch into his head; nothing but skin on the bones of
his face, a skeleton in dirty white clothes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what he looked like.&nbsp; How Freya . . . But she never
did&mdash;not really.&nbsp; He was sitting there, the only live
thing for miles along that coast, on a drift-log washed up on the
shore.&nbsp; They had clipped his hair in the hospital, and it
had not grown again.&nbsp; He stared, holding his chin in his
hand, and with nothing on the sea between him and the sky but
that wreck.&nbsp; When I came up to him he just moved his head a
bit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that you, old man?&rsquo; says he&mdash;like
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had seen him you would have understood at once
how impossible it was for Freya to have ever loved that
man.&nbsp; Well, well.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; She might
have&mdash;something.&nbsp; She was lonely, you know.&nbsp; But
really to go away with him!&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; Madness.&nbsp; She
was too sensible . . . I began to reproach him gently.&nbsp; And
by and by he turns on me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Write to you!&nbsp; What
about?&nbsp; Come to her!&nbsp; What with?&nbsp; If I had been a
man I would have carried her off, but she made a child, a happy
child, of me.&nbsp; Tell her that the day the only thing I had
belonging to me in the world perished on this reef I discovered
that I had no power over her. . . Has she come here with
you?&rsquo; he shouts, blazing at me suddenly with his hollow
eyes.&nbsp; I shook my head.&nbsp; Come with me, indeed!&nbsp;
An&aelig;mia!&nbsp; &lsquo;Aha!&nbsp; You see?&nbsp; Go away,
then, old man, and leave me alone here with that ghost,&rsquo; he
says, jerking his head at the wreck of his brig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad!&nbsp; It was getting dusk.&nbsp; I did not care to
stop any longer all by myself with that man in that lonely
place.&nbsp; I was not going to tell him of Freya&rsquo;s
illness.&nbsp; An&aelig;mia!&nbsp; What was the good?&nbsp;
Mad!&nbsp; And what sort of husband would he have made, anyhow,
for a sensible girl like Freya?&nbsp; Why, even my little
property I could not have left them.&nbsp; The Dutch authorities
would never have allowed an Englishman to settle there.&nbsp; It
was not sold then.&nbsp; My man Mahmat, you know, was looking
after it for me.&nbsp; Later on I let it go for a tenth of its
value to a Dutch half-caste.&nbsp; But never mind.&nbsp; It was
nothing to me then.&nbsp; Yes; I went away from him.&nbsp; I
caught the return mail-boat.&nbsp; I told everything to
Freya.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s mad,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;and, my
dear, the only thing he loved was his brig.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; she says to herself, looking
straight away&mdash;her eyes were nearly as hollow as
his&mdash;&lsquo;perhaps it is true.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I would
never allow him any power over me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nelson paused.&nbsp; I sat fascinated, and feeling a
little cold in that room with a blazing fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;she never
really cared for him.&nbsp; Much too sensible.&nbsp; I took her
away to Hong Kong.&nbsp; Change of climate, they said.&nbsp; Oh,
these doctors!&nbsp; My God!&nbsp; Winter time!&nbsp; There came
ten days of cold mists and wind and rain.&nbsp; Pneumonia.&nbsp;
But look here!&nbsp; We talked a lot together.&nbsp; Days and
evenings.&nbsp; Who else had she? . . . She talked a lot to me,
my own girl.&nbsp; Sometimes she would laugh a little.&nbsp; Look
at me and laugh a little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shuddered.&nbsp; He looked up vaguely, with a childish,
puzzled moodiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would say: &lsquo;I did not really mean to be a bad
daughter to you, papa.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I would say: &lsquo;Of
course, my dear.&nbsp; You could not have meant it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She would lie quiet and then say: &lsquo;I wonder?&rsquo;&nbsp;
And sometimes, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been really a coward,&rsquo; she
would tell me.&nbsp; You know, sick people they say things.&nbsp;
And so she would say too: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been conceited,
headstrong, capricious.&nbsp; I sought my own
gratification.&nbsp; I was selfish or afraid.&rsquo; . . . But
sick people, you know, they say anything.&nbsp; And once, after
lying silent almost all day, she said: &lsquo;Yes; perhaps, when
the day came I would not have gone.&nbsp; Perhaps!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Draw the
curtain, papa.&nbsp; Shut the sea out.&nbsp; It reproaches me
with my folly.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He gasped and paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he went on in a murmur.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very ill, very ill indeed.&nbsp; Pneumonia.&nbsp; Very
sudden.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed his finger at the carpet, while
the thought of the poor girl, vanquished in her struggle with
three men&rsquo;s absurdities, and coming at last to doubt her
own self, held me in a very anguish of pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see yourself,&rdquo; he began again in a downcast
manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;She could not have really . . . She
mentioned you several times.&nbsp; Good friend.&nbsp; Sensible
man.&nbsp; So I wanted to tell you myself&mdash;let you know the
truth.&nbsp; A fellow like that!&nbsp; How could it be?&nbsp; She
was lonely.&nbsp; And perhaps for a while . . . Mere
nothing.&nbsp; There could never have been a question of love for
my Freya&mdash;such a sensible girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; I cried, rising upon him wrathfully,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see that she died of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up too.&nbsp; &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he stammered, as if
angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;The doctors!&nbsp; Pneumonia.&nbsp; Low
state.&nbsp; The inflammation of the . . . They told me.&nbsp;
Pneu&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish the word.&nbsp; It ended in a sob.&nbsp; He
flung his arms out in a gesture of despair, giving up his ghastly
pretence with a low, heartrending cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought that she was so sensible!&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
