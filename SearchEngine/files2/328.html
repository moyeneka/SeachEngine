    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If my object in these pages were to present a complete scheme of counsels
      and maxims for the guidance of life, I should have to repeat the numerous
      rules&mdash;some of them excellent&mdash;which have been drawn up by
      thinkers of all ages, from Theognis and Solomon<a href="#linknote-1"
      name="linknoteref-1" id="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> down to La
      Rochefoucauld; and, in so doing, I should inevitably entail upon the
      reader a vast amount of well-worn commonplace. But the fact is that in
      this work I make still less claim to exhaust my subject than in any other
      of my writings.
    </p>

      1 (<a href="#linknoteref-1">return</a>)<br /> [ I refer to the proverbs and
      maxims ascribed, in the Old Testament, to the king of that name.]
    </p>
    <p>
      An author who makes no claims to completeness must also, in a great
      measure, abandon any attempt at systematic arrangement. For his double
      loss in this respect, the reader may console himself by reflecting that a
      complete and systematic treatment of such a subject as the guidance of
      life could hardly fail to be a very wearisome business. I have simply put
      down those of my thoughts which appear to be worth communicating&mdash;thoughts
      which, as far as I know, have not been uttered, or, at any rate, not just
      in the same form, by any one else; so that my remarks may be taken as a
      supplement to what has been already achieved in the immense field.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, by way of introducing some sort of order into the great variety
      of matters upon which advice will be given in the following pages, I shall
      distribute what I have to say under the following heads: (1) general
      rules; (2) our relation to ourselves; (3) our relation to others; and
      finally, (4) rules which concern our manner of life and our worldly
      circumstances. I shall conclude with some remarks on the changes which the
      various periods of life produce in us.

    <h2>
      SECTION 1.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first and foremost rule for the wise conduct of life seems to me to be
      contained in a view to which Aristotle parenthetically refers in the
      Nichomachean Ethics<i>:<a href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2"
      id="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> [Greek: o phronimoz to alupon dioke e
      ou to aedu] or, as it may be rendered, </i>not pleasure, but freedom from
      pain, is what the wise man will aim at<i>. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linknote-2" id="note-2"> Note --></a>
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      2 (<a href="#linknoteref-2">return</a>)<br /> [ vii. (12) 12.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth of this remark turns upon the negative character of happiness,&mdash;the
      fact that pleasure is only the negation of pain, and that pain is the
      positive element in life. Though I have given a detailed proof of this
      proposition in my chief work,<a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3"
      id="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> I may supply one more illustration of
      it here, drawn from a circumstance of daily occurrence. Suppose that, with
      the exception of some sore or painful spot, we are physically in a sound
      and healthy condition: the sore of this one spot, will completely absorb
      our attention, causing us to lose the sense of general well-being, and
      destroying all our comfort in life. In the same way, when all our affairs
      but one turn out as we wish, the single instance in which our aims are
      frustrated is a constant trouble to us, even though it be something quite
      trivial. We think a great deal about it, and very little about those other
      and more important matters in which we have been successful. In both these
      cases what has met with resistance is the will<i>; in the one case, as it
      is objectified in the organism, in the other, as it presents itself in the
      struggle of life; and in both, it is plain that the satisfaction of the
      will consists in nothing else than that it meets with no resistance. It
      is, therefore, a satisfaction which is not directly felt; at most, we can
      become conscious of it only when we reflect upon our condition. But that
      which checks or arrests the will is something positive; it proclaims its
      own presence. All pleasure consists in merely removing this check&mdash;in
      other words, in freeing us from its action; and hence pleasure is a state
      which can never last very long. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linknote-3" id="note-3"> Note --></a>
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      3 (<a href="#linknoteref-3">return</a>)<br /> [ Welt als Wille und
      Vorstellung<i>. Vol. I., p. 58.] </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the true basis of the above excellent rule quoted from Aristotle,
      which bids us direct our aim, not toward securing what is pleasurable and
      agreeable in life, but toward avoiding, as far as possible, its
      innumerable evils. If this were not the right course to take, that saying
      of Voltaire's, Happiness is but a dream and sorrow is real<i>, would be as
      false as it is, in fact, true. A man who desires to make up the book of
      his life and determine where the balance of happiness lies, must put down
      in his accounts, not the pleasures which he has enjoyed, but the evils
      which he has escaped. That is the true method of eudaemonology; for all
      eudaemonology must begin by recognizing that its very name is a euphemism,
      and that </i>to live happily<i> only means </i>to live less unhappily<i>&mdash;to
      live a tolerable life. There is no doubt that life is given us, not to be
      enjoyed, but to be overcome&mdash;to be got over. There are numerous
      expressions illustrating this&mdash;such as </i>degere vitam, vita defungi<i>;
      or in Italian, </i>si scampa cosi<i>; or in German, </i>man muss suchen
      durchzukommen; er wird schon durch die Welt kommen<i>, and so on. In old
      age it is indeed a consolation to think that the work of life is over and
      done with. The happiest lot is not to have experienced the keenest
      delights or the greatest pleasures, but to have brought life to a close
      without any very great pain, bodily or mental. To measure the happiness of
      a life by its delights or pleasures, is to apply a false standard. For
      pleasures are and remain something negative; that they produce happiness
      is a delusion, cherished by envy to its own punishment. Pain is felt to be
      something positive, and hence its absence is the true standard of
      happiness. And if, over and above freedom from pain, there is also an
      absence of boredom, the essential conditions of earthly happiness are
      attained; for all else is chimerical. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows from this that a man should never try to purchase pleasure at
      the cost of pain, or even at the risk of incurring it; to do so is to pay
      what is positive and real, for what is negative and illusory; while there
      is a net profit in sacrificing pleasure for the sake of avoiding pain. In
      either case it is a matter of indifference whether the pain follows the
      pleasure or precedes it. While it is a complete inversion of the natural
      order to try and turn this scene of misery into a garden of pleasure, to
      aim at joy and pleasure rather than at the greatest possible freedom from
      pain&mdash;and yet how many do it!&mdash;there is some wisdom in taking a
      gloomy view, in looking upon the world as a kind of Hell, and in confining
      one's efforts to securing a little room that shall not be exposed to the
      fire. The fool rushes after the pleasures of life and finds himself their
      dupe; the wise man avoids its evils; and even if, notwithstanding his
      precautions, he falls into misfortunes, that is the fault of fate, not of
      his own folly. As far as he is successful in his endeavors, he cannot be
      said to have lived a life of illusion; for the evils which he shuns are
      very real. Even if he goes too far out of his way to avoid evils, and
      makes an unnecessary sacrifice of pleasure, he is, in reality, not the
      worse off for that; for all pleasures are chimerical, and to mourn for
      having lost any of them is a frivolous, and even ridiculous proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure to recognize this truth&mdash;a failure promoted by optimistic
      ideas&mdash;is the source of much unhappiness. In moments free from pain,
      our restless wishes present, as it were in a mirror, the image of a
      happiness that has no counterpart in reality, seducing us to follow it; in
      doing so we bring pain upon ourselves, and that is something undeniably
      real. Afterwards, we come to look with regret upon that lost state of
      painlessness; it is a paradise which we have gambled away; it is no longer
      with us, and we long in vain to undo what has been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might well fancy that these visions of wishes fulfilled were the work
      of some evil spirit, conjured up in order to entice us away from that
      painless state which forms our highest happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A careless youth may think that the world is meant to be enjoyed, as
      though it were the abode of some real or positive happiness, which only
      those fail to attain who are not clever enough to overcome the
      difficulties that lie in the way. This false notion takes a stronger hold
      on him when he comes to read poetry and romance, and to be deceived by
      outward show&mdash;the hypocrisy that characterizes the world from
      beginning to end; on which I shall have something to say presently. The
      result is that his life is the more or less deliberate pursuit of positive
      happiness; and happiness he takes to be equivalent to a series of definite
      pleasures. In seeking for these pleasures he encounters danger&mdash;a
      fact which should not be forgotten. He hunts for game that does not exist;
      and so he ends by suffering some very real and positive misfortune&mdash;pain,
      distress, sickness, loss, care, poverty, shame, and all the thousand ills
      of life. Too late he discovers the trick that has been played upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the rule I have mentioned is observed, and a plan of life is
      adopted which proceeds by avoiding pain&mdash;in other words, by taking
      measures of precaution against want, sickness, and distress in all its
      forms, the aim is a real one, and something may be achieved which will be
      great in proportion as the plan is not disturbed by striving after the
      chimera of positive happiness. This agrees with the opinion expressed by
      Goethe in the Elective Affinities<i>, and there put into the mouth of
      Mittler&mdash;the man who is always trying to make other people happy:
      </i>To desire to get rid of an evil is a definite object, but to desire a
      better fortune than one has is blind folly<i>. The same truth is contained
      in that fine French proverb: </i>le mieux est l'ennemi du bien<i>&mdash;leave
      well alone. And, as I have remarked in my chief work,this is the
      leading thought underlying the philosophical system of the Cynics. For
      what was it led the Cynics to repudiate pleasure in every form, if it was
      not the fact that pain is, in a greater or less degree, always bound up
      with pleasure? To go out of the way of pain seemed to them so much easier
      than to secure pleasure. Deeply impressed as they were by the negative
      nature of pleasure and the positive nature of pain, they consistently
      devoted all their efforts to the avoidance of pain. The first step to that
      end was, in their opinion, a complete and deliberate repudiation of
      pleasure, as something which served only to entrap the victim in order
      that he might be delivered over to pain.<a href="#linknote-4"

      We are all born, as Schiller says, in Arcadia. In other words, we come
      into the world full of claims to happiness and pleasure, and we cherish
      the fond hope of making them good. But, as a rule, Fate soon teaches us,
      in a rough and ready way that we really possess nothing at all, but that
      everything in the world is at its command, in virtue of an unassailable
      right, not only to all we have or acquire, to wife or child, but even to
      our very limbs, our arms, legs, eyes<i> and ears, nay, even to the nose in
      the middle of our face. And in any case, after some little time, we learn
      by experience that happiness and pleasure are a </i>fata morgana<i>,
      which, visible from afar, vanish as we approach; that, on the other hand,
      suffering and pain are a reality, which makes its presence felt without
      any intermediary, and for its effect, stands in no need of illusion or the
      play of false hope. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the teaching of experience bears fruit in us, we soon give up the
      pursuit of pleasure and happiness, and think much more about making
      ourselves secure against the attacks of pain and suffering. We see that
      the best the world has to offer is an existence free from pain&mdash;a
      quiet, tolerable life; and we confine our claims to this, as to something
      we can more surely hope to achieve. For the safest way of not being very
      miserable is not to expect to be very happy. Merck, the friend of Goethe's
      youth, was conscious of this truth when he wrote: It is the wretched way
      people have of setting up a claim to happiness<i>&mdash;</i>and, that to,
      in a measure corresponding with their desires<i>&mdash;</i>that ruins
      everything in this world. A man will make progress if he can get rid of
      this claim,<a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="noteref-5_"><small>5</small></a>
      and desire nothing but what he sees before him<i>. Accordingly it is
      advisable to put very moderate limits upon our expectations of pleasure,
      possessions, rank, honor and so on; because it is just this striving and
      struggling to be happy, to dazzle the world, to lead a life full of
      pleasure, which entail great misfortune. It is prudent and wise, I say, to
      reduce one's claims, if only for the reason that it is extremely easy to
      be very unhappy; while to be very happy is not indeed difficult, but quite
      impossible. With justice sings the poet of life's wisdom: </i>

      The chief obstacle to our arriving at these salutary views is that
      hypocrisy of the world to which I have already alluded&mdash;an hypocrisy
      which should be early revealed to the young. Most of the glories of the
      world are mere outward show, like the scenes on a stage: there is nothing
      real about them. Ships festooned and hung with pennants, firing of cannon,
      illuminations, beating of drums and blowing of trumpets, shouting and
      applauding&mdash;these are all the outward sign, the pretence and
      suggestion,&mdash;as it were the hieroglyphic,&mdash;of joy<i>: but just
      there, joy is, as a rule, not to be found; it is the only guest who has
      declined to be present at the festival. Where this guest may really be
      found, he comes generally without invitation; he is not formerly
      announced, but slips in quietly by himself </i>sans facon<i>; often making
      his appearance under the most unimportant and trivial circumstances, and
      in the commonest company&mdash;anywhere, in short, but where the society
      is brilliant and distinguished. Joy is like the gold in the Australian
      mines&mdash;found only now and then, as it were, by the caprice of chance,
      and according to no rule or law; oftenest in very little grains, and very
      seldom in heaps. All that outward show which I have described, is only an
      attempt to make people believe that it is really joy which has come to the
      festival; and to produce this impression upon the spectators is, in fact,
      the whole object of it. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      With mourning<i> it is just the same. That long funeral procession, moving
      up so slowly; how melancholy it looks! what an endless row of carriages!
      But look into them&mdash;they are all empty; the coachmen of the whole
      town are the sole escort the dead man has to his grave. Eloquent picture
      of the friendship and esteem of the world! This is the falsehood, the
      hollowness, the hypocrisy of human affairs! </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Take another example&mdash;a roomful of guests in full dress, being
      received with great ceremony. You could almost believe that this is a
      noble and distinguished company; but, as a matter of fact, it is
      compulsion, pain and boredom who are the real guests. For where many are
      invited, it is a rabble&mdash;even if they all wear stars. Really good
      society is everywhere of necessity very small. In brilliant festivals and
      noisy entertainments, there is always, at bottom, a sense of emptiness
      prevalent. A false tone is there: such gatherings are in strange contrast
      with the misery and barrenness of our existence. The contrast brings the
      true condition into greater relief. Still, these gatherings are effective
      from the outside; and that is just their purpose. Chamfort<a
      href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8" id="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a>
      makes the excellent remark that society<i>&mdash;</i>les cercles, les
      salons, ce qu'on appelle le monde<i>&mdash;is like a miserable play, or a
      bad opera, without any interest in itself, but supported for a time by
      mechanical aid, costumes and scenery. </i>

      undermined; it offers many more opportunities for accidents; and accidents
      are always happening. The architecture of happiness follows a plan in this
      respect just the opposite of that adopted in every other case, where the
      broadest foundation offers the greatest security. Accordingly, to reduce
      your claims to the lowest possible degree, in comparison with your means,&mdash;of
      whatever kind these may be&mdash;is the surest way of avoiding extreme
      misfortune. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      To make extensive preparations for life&mdash;no matter what form they may
      take&mdash;is one of the greatest and commonest of follies. Such
      preparations presuppose, in the first place, a long life, the full and
      complete term of years appointed to man&mdash;and how few reach it! and
      even if it be reached, it is still too short for all the plans that have
      been made; for to carry them out requites more time than was thought
      necessary at the beginning. And then how many mischances and obstacles
      stand in the way! how seldom the goal is ever reached in human affairs!
    </p>
    <p>
      And lastly, even though the goal should be reached, the changes which Time
      works in us have been left out of the reckoning: we forget that the
      capacity whether for achievement or for enjoyment does not last a whole
      lifetime. So we often toil for things which are no longer suited to us
      when we attain them; and again, the years we spend in preparing for some
      work, unconsciously rob us of the power for carrying it out.

      How often it happens that a man is unable to enjoy the wealth which he
      acquired at so much trouble and risk, and that the fruits of his labor are

      he has won after so many years of toil and struggle. Fortune has come too
      late for him; or, contrarily, he has come too late for fortune,&mdash;when,
      for instance, he wants to achieve great things, say, in art or literature:
      the popular taste has changed, it may be; a new generation has grown up,
      which takes no interest in his work; others have gone a shorter way and
      got the start of him. These are the facts of life which Horace must have
      had in view, when he lamented the uselessness of all advice:&mdash;

      The cause of this commonest of all follies is that optical illusion of the
      mind from which everyone suffers, making life, at its beginning, seem of
      long duration; and at its end, when one looks back over the course of it,
      how short a time it seems! There is some advantage in the illusion; but
      for it, no great work would ever be done.

      Our life is like a journey on which, as we advance, the landscape takes a
      different view from that which it presented at first, and changes again,
      as we come nearer. This is just what happens&mdash;especially with our
      wishes. We often find something else, nay, something better than what we
      are looking for; and what we look for, we often find on a very different
      path from that on which we began a vain search. Instead of finding, as we
      expected, pleasure, happiness, joy, we get experience, insight, knowledge&mdash;a
      real and permanent blessing, instead of a fleeting and illusory one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the thought that runs through Wilkelm Meister<i>, like the bass in
      a piece of music. In this work of Goethe's, we have a novel of the </i>intellectual<i>
      kind, and, therefore, superior to all others, even to Sir Walter Scott's,
      which are, one and all, </i>ethical<i>; in other words, they treat of
      human nature only from the side of the will. So, too, in the </i>Zauberflöte<i>&mdash;that
      grotesque, but still significant, and even hieroglyphic&mdash;the same
      thought is symbolized, but in great, coarse lines, much in the way in
      which scenery is painted. Here the symbol would be complete if Tamino were
      in the end to be cured of his desire to possess Tainina, and received, in
      her stead, initiation into the mysteries of the Temple of Wisdom. It is
      quite right for Papageno, his necessary contrast, to succeed in getting
      his Papagena. </i>

      accustomed and content to exchange hope for insight; and, in the end, they
      can say, with Petrarch, that all they care for is to learn:&mdash;

      SECTION 4.

    <p>
      The mason employed on the building of a house may be quite ignorant of its
      general design; or at any rate, he may not keep it constantly in mind. So
      it is with man: in working through the days and hours of his life, he
      takes little thought of its character as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is any merit or importance attaching to a man's career, if he
      lays himself out carefully for some special work, it is all the more
      necessary and advisable for him to turn his attention now and then to its
      plan<i>, that is to say, the miniature sketch of its general outlines. Of
      course, to do that, he must have applied the maxim [Greek: Gnothi
      seauton]; he must have made some little progress in the art of
      understanding himself. He must know what is his real, chief, and foremost
      object in life,&mdash;what it is that he most wants in order to be happy;
      and then, after that, what occupies the second and third place in his
      thoughts; he must find out what, on the whole, his vocation really is&mdash;the
      part he has to play, his general relation to the world. If he maps out
      important work for himself on great lines, a glance at this miniature plan
      of his life will, more than anything else stimulate, rouse and ennoble
      him, urge him on to action and keep him from false paths. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, just as the traveler, on reaching a height, gets a connected view
      over the road he has taken, with its many turns and windings; so it is
      only when we have completed a period in our life, or approach the end of
      it altogether, that we recognize the true connection between all our
      actions,&mdash;what it is we have achieved, what work we have done. It is
      only then that we see the precise chain of cause and effect, and the exact
      value of all our efforts. For as long as we are actually engaged in the
      work of life, we always act in accordance with the nature of our
      character, under the influence of motive, and within the limits of our
      capacity,&mdash;in a word, from beginning to end, under a law of necessity<i>;
      at every moment we do just what appears to us right and proper. It is only
      afterwards, when we come to look back at the whole course of our life and
      its general result, that we see the why and wherefore of it all. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      When we are actually doing some great deed, or creating some immortal
      work, we are not conscious of it as such; we think only of satisfying
      present aims, of fulfilling the intentions we happen to have at the time,
      of doing the right thing at the moment. It is only when we come to view
      our life as a connected whole that our character and capacities show
      themselves in their true light; that we see how, in particular instances,
      some happy inspiration, as it were, led us to choose the only true path
      out of a thousand which might have brought us to ruin. It was our genius
      that guided us, a force felt in the affairs of the intellectual as in
      those of the world; and working by its defect just in the same way in
      regard to evil and disaster.

    <h2>
      SECTION 5. Another important element in the wise conduct of life is to
    </h2>
    <p>
      preserve a proper proportion between our thought for the present and our
      thought for the future; in order not to spoil the one by paying over-great
      attention to the other. Many live too long in the present&mdash;frivolous
      people, I mean; others, too much in the future, ever anxious and full of
      care. It is seldom that a man holds the right balance between the two
      extremes. Those who strive and hope and live only in the future, always
      looking ahead and impatiently anticipating what is coming, as something
      which will make them happy when they get it, are, in spite of their very
      clever airs, exactly like those donkeys one sees in Italy, whose pace may
      be hurried by fixing a stick on their heads with a wisp of hay at the end
      of it; this is always just in front of them, and they keep on trying to
      get it. Such people are in a constant state of illusion as to their whole
      existence; they go on living ad interim<i>, until at last they die. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, therefore, of always thinking about our plans and anxiously
      looking to the future, or of giving ourselves up to regret for the past,
      we should never forget that the present is the only reality, the only
      certainty; that the future almost always turns out contrary to our
      expectations; that the past, too, was very different from what we suppose
      it to have been. But the past and the future are, on the whole, of less
      consequence than we think. Distance, which makes objects look small to the
      outward eye, makes them look big to the eye of thought. The present alone
      is true and actual; it is the only time which possesses full reality, and
      our existence lies in it exclusively. Therefore we should always be glad
      of it, and give it the welcome it deserves, and enjoy every hour that is
      bearable by its freedom from pain and annoyance with a full consciousness
      of its value. We shall hardly be able to do this if we make a wry face
      over the failure of our hopes in the past or over our anxiety for the
      future. It is the height of folly to refuse the present hour of happiness,
      or wantonly to spoil it by vexation at by-gones or uneasiness about what
      is to come. There is a time, of course, for forethought, nay, even for
      repentance; but when it is over let us think of what is past as of
      something to which we have said farewell, of necessity subduing our hearts&mdash;

  [Greek: alla ta men protuchthai easomen achnumenoi per

      and of the future as of that which lies beyond our power, in the lap of

    </p>
    <p>
      But in regard to the present let us remember Seneca's advice, and live
      each day as if it were our whole life,&mdash;singulas dies singulas vitas
      puta<i>: let us make it as agreeable as possible, it is the only real time
      we have. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Only those evils which are sure to come at a definite date have any right
      to disturb us; and how few there are which fulfill this description. For
      evils are of two kinds; either they are possible only, at most probable;
      or they are inevitable. Even in the case of evils which are sure to
      happen, the time at which they will happen is uncertain. A man who is
      always preparing for either class of evil will not have a moment of peace
      left him. So, if we are not to lose all comfort in life through the fear
      of evils, some of which are uncertain in themselves, and others, in the
      time at which they will occur, we should look upon the one kind as never
      likely to happen, and the other as not likely to happen very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the less our peace of mind is disturbed by fear, the more likely it
      is to be agitated by desire and expectation. This is the true meaning of
      that song of Goethe's which is such a favorite with everyone: Ich hab'
      mein' Sach' auf nichts gestellt<i>. It is only after a man has got rid of
      all pretension, and taken refuge in mere unembellished existence, that he
      is able to attain that peace of mind which is the foundation of human
      happiness. Peace of mind! that is something essential to any enjoyment of
      the present moment; and unless its separate moments are enjoyed, there is
      an end of life's happiness as a whole. We should always collect that </i>To-day<i>
      comes only once, and never returns. We fancy that it will come again
      to-morrow; but </i>To-morrow<i> is another day, which, in its turn, comes
      once only. We are apt to forget that every day is an integral, and
      therefore irreplaceable portion of life, and to look upon life as though
      it were a collective idea or name which does not suffer if one of the
      individuals it covers is destroyed. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      We should be more likely to appreciate and enjoy the present, if, in those
      good days when we are well and strong, we did not fail to reflect how, in
      sickness and sorrow, every past hour that was free from pain and privation
      seemed in our memory so infinitely to be envied&mdash;as it were, a lost
      paradise, or some one who was only then seen to have acted as a friend.
      But we live through our days of happiness without noticing them; it is
      only when evil comes upon us that we wish them back. A thousand gay and
      pleasant hours are wasted in ill-humor; we let them slip by unenjoyed, and
      sigh for them in vain when the sky is overcast. Those present moments that
      are bearable, be they never so trite and common,&mdash;passed by in
      indifference, or, it may be, impatiently pushed away,&mdash;those are the
      moments we should honor; never failing to remember that the ebbing tide is
      even how hurrying them into the past, where memory will store them
      transfigured and shining with an imperishable light,&mdash;in some
      after-time, and above all, when our days are evil, to raise the veil and
      present them as the object of our fondest regret.

    <h2>
      SECTION 6. Limitations always make for happiness<i>. We are happy in </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      proportion as our range of vision, our sphere of work, our points of
      contact with the world, are restricted and circumscribed. We are more
      likely to feel worried and anxious if these limits are wide; for it means
      that our cares, desires and terrors are increased and intensified. That is
      why the blind are not so unhappy as we might be inclined to suppose;
      otherwise there would not be that gentle and almost serene expression of
      peace in their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason why limitation makes for happiness is that the second half
      of life proves even more dreary that the first. As the years wear on, the
      horizon of our aims and our points of contact with the world become more
      extended. In childhood our horizon is limited to the narrowest sphere
      about us; in youth there is already a very considerable widening of our
      view; in manhood it comprises the whole range of our activity, often
      stretching out over a very distant sphere,&mdash;the care, for instance,
      of a State or a nation; in old age it embraces posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even in the affairs of the intellect, limitation is necessary if we
      are to be happy. For the less the will is excited, the less we suffer. We
      have seen that suffering is something positive, and that happiness is only
      a negative condition. To limit the sphere of outward activity is to
      relieve the will of external stimulus: to limit the sphere of our
      intellectual efforts is to relieve the will of internal sources of
      excitement. This latter kind of limitation is attended by the disadvantage
      that it opens the door to boredom, which is a direct source of countless
      sufferings; for to banish boredom, a man will have recourse to any means
      that may be handy&mdash;dissipation, society, extravagance, gaming, and
      drinking, and the like, which in their turn bring mischief, ruin and
      misery in their train. Difficiles in otio quies<i>&mdash;it is difficult
      to keep quiet if you have nothing to do. That limitation in the sphere of
      outward activity is conducive, nay, even necessary to human happiness,
      such as it is, may be seen in the fact that the only kind of poetry which
      depicts men in a happy state of life&mdash;Idyllic poetry, I mean,&mdash;always
      aims, as an intrinsic part of its treatment, at representing them in very
      simple and restricted circumstances. It is this feeling, too, which is at
      the bottom of the pleasure we take in what are called </i>genre<i>
      pictures. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Simplicity<i>, therefore, as far as it can be attained, and even </i>monotony<i>,
      in our manner of life, if it does not mean that we are bored, will
      contribute to happiness; just because, under such circumstances, life, and
      consequently the burden which is the essential concomitant of life, will
      be least felt. Our existence will glide on peacefully like a stream which
      no waves or whirlpools disturb. </i>

      SECTION 7. Whether we are in a pleasant or a painful state depends,
    </h2>
    <p>
      ultimately, upon the kind of matter that pervades and engrosses our
      consciousness. In this respect, purely intellectual occupation, for the
      mind that is capable of it, will, as a rule, do much more in the way of
      happiness than any form of practical life, with its constant alternations
      of success and failure, and all the shocks and torments it produces. But
      it must be confessed that for such occupation a pre-eminent amount of
      intellectual capacity is necessary. And in this connection it may be noted
      that, just as a life devoted to outward activity will distract and divert
      a man from study, and also deprive him of that quiet concentration of mind
      which is necessary for such work; so, on the other hand, a long course of
      thought will make him more or less unfit for the noisy pursuits of real
      life. It is advisable, therefore, to suspend mental work for a while, if
      circumstances happen which demand any degree of energy in affairs of a
      practical nature.

      SECTION 8. To live a life that shall be entirely prudent and discreet,

    <p>
      and to draw from experience all the instruction it contains, it is
      requisite to be constantly thinking back,&mdash;to make a kind of
      recapitulation of what we have done, of our impressions and sensations, to
      compare our former with our present judgments&mdash;what we set before us

      Experience of the world may be looked upon as a kind of text, to which
      reflection and knowledge form the commentary. Where there is great deal of
      reflection and intellectual knowledge, and very little experience, the
      result is like those books which have on each page two lines of text to
      forty lines of commentary. A great deal of experience with little
      reflection and scant knowledge, gives us books like those of the editio

      The advice here given is on a par with a rule recommended by Pythagoras,&mdash;to
      review, every night before going to sleep, what we have done during the
      day. To live at random, in the hurly-burly of business or pleasure,
      without ever reflecting upon the past,&mdash;to go on, as it were, pulling
      cotton off the reel of life,&mdash;is to have no clear idea of what we are
      about; and a man who lives in this state will have chaos in his emotions
      and certain confusion in his thoughts; as is soon manifest by the abrupt
      and fragmentary character of his conversation, which becomes a kind of
      mincemeat. A man will be all the more exposed to this fate in proportion
      as he lives a restless life in the world, amid a crowd of various
      impressions and with a correspondingly small amount of activity on the
      part of his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this connection it will be in place to observe that, when events
      and circumstances which have influenced us pass away in the course of
      time, we are unable to bring back and renew the particular mood or state
      of feeling which they aroused in us: but we can remember what we were led
      to say and do in regard to them; and thus form, as it were, the result,
      expression and measure of those events. We should, therefore, be careful
      to preserve the memory of our thoughts at important points in our life;
      and herein lies the great advantage of keeping a journal.

      For while a man cannot reckon with certainty upon anyone but himself, the

      All society necessarily involves, as the first condition of its existence,
      mutual accommodation and restraint upon the part of its members. This
      means that the larger it is, the more insipid will be its tone. A man can
      be himself<i> only so long as he is alone; and if he does not love
      solitude, he will not love freedom; for it is only when he is alone that
      he is really free. Constraint is always present in society, like a
      companion of whom there is no riddance; and in proportion to the greatness
      of a man's individuality, it will be hard for him to bear the sacrifices
      which all intercourse with others demands, Solitude will be welcomed or
      endured or avoided, according as a man's personal value is large or small,&mdash;the
      wretch feeling, when he is alone, the whole burden of his misery; the
      great intellect delighting in its greatness; and everyone, in short, being
      just what he is. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, if a man stands high in Nature's lists, it is natural and
      inevitable that he should feel solitary. It will be an advantage to him if
      his surroundings do not interfere with this feeling; for if he has to see
      a great deal of other people who are not of like character with himself,
      they will exercise a disturbing influence upon him, adverse to his peace
      of mind; they will rob him, in fact, of himself, and give him nothing to
      compensate for the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while Nature sets very wide differences between man and man in respect
      both of morality and of intellect, society disregards and effaces them;
      or, rather, it sets up artificial differences in their stead,&mdash;gradations
      of rank and position, which are very often diametrically opposed to those
      which Nature establishes. The result of this arrangement is to elevate
      those whom Nature has placed low, and to depress the few who stand high.
      These latter, then, usually withdraw from society, where, as soon as it is
      at all numerous, vulgarity reigns supreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      What offends a great intellect in society is the equality of rights,
      leading to equality of pretensions, which everyone enjoys; while at the
      same time, inequality of capacity means a corresponding disparity of
      social power. So-called good society<i> recognizes every kind of claim but
      that of intellect, which is a contraband article; and people are expected
      to exhibit an unlimited amount of patience towards every form of folly and
      stupidity, perversity and dullness; whilst personal merit has to beg
      pardon, as it were, for being present, or else conceal itself altogether.
      Intellectual superiority offends by its very existence, without any desire
      to do so. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of what is called good society is not only that it offers us the
      companionship of people who are unable to win either our praise or our
      affection, but that it does not allow of our being that which we naturally
      are; it compels us, for the sake of harmony, to shrivel up, or even alter
      our shape altogether. Intellectual conversation, whether grave or
      humorous, is only fit for intellectual society; it is downright abhorrent
      to ordinary people, to please whom it is absolutely necessary to be
      commonplace and dull. This demands an act of severe self-denial; we have
      to forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to become like other
      people. No doubt their company may be set down against our loss in this
      respect; but the more a man is worth, the more he will find that what he
      gains does not cover what he loses, and that the balance is on the debit
      side of the account; for the people with whom he deals are generally
      bankrupt,&mdash;that is to say, there is nothing to be got from their
      society which can compensate either for its boredom, annoyance and
      disagreeableness, or for the self-denial which it renders necessary.
      Accordingly, most society is so constituted as to offer a good profit to
      anyone who will exchange it for solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is this all. By way of providing a substitute for real&mdash;I mean
      intellectual&mdash;superiority, which is seldom to be met with, and
      intolerable when it is found, society has capriciously adopted a false
      kind of superiority, conventional in its character, and resting upon
      arbitrary principles,&mdash;a tradition, as it were, handed down in the
      higher circles, and, like a password, subject to alteration; I refer to
      bon-ton<i> fashion. Whenever this kind of superiority comes into collision
      with the real kind, its weakness is manifest. Moreover, the presence of
      </i>good tone<i> means the absence of </i>good sense<i>. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No man can be in perfect accord<i> with any one but himself&mdash;not even
      with a friend or the partner of his life; differences of individuality and
      temperament are always bringing in some degree of discord, though it may
      be a very slight one. That genuine, profound peace of mind, that perfect
      tranquillity of soul, which, next to health, is the highest blessing the
      earth can give, is to be attained only in solitude, and, as a permanent
      mood, only in complete retirement; and then, if there is anything great
      and rich in the man's own self, his way of life is the happiest that may
      be found in this wretched world. </i>

    <p>
      Let me speak plainly. However close the bond of friendship, love, marriage&mdash;a
      man, ultimately, looks to himself, to his own welfare alone; at most, to
      his child's too. The less necessity there is for you to come into contact
      with mankind in general, in the relations whether of business or of
      personal intimacy, the better off you are. Loneliness and solitude have
      their evils, it is true; but if you cannot feel them all at once, you can
      at least see where they lie; on the other hand, society is insidious<i> in
      this respect; as in offering you what appears to be the pastime of
      pleasing social intercourse, it works great and often irreparable
      mischief. The young should early be trained to bear being left alone; for
      it is a source of happiness and peace of mind. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows from this that a man is best off if he be thrown upon his own
      resources and can be all in all to himself; and Cicero goes so far as to
      say that a man who is in this condition cannot fail to be very happy&mdash;nemo
      potest non beatissimus esse qui est totus aptus ex sese, quique in se uno
      ponit omnia.<i><a href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a>
      The more a man has in himself, the less others can be to him. The feeling
      of self-sufficiency! it is that which restrains those whose personal value
      is in itself great riches, from such considerable sacrifices as are
      demanded by intercourse with the world, let alone, then, from actually
      practicing self-denial by going out of their way to seek it. Ordinary
      people are sociable and complaisant just from the very opposite feeling;&mdash;to
      bear others' company is easier for them than to bear their own. Moreover,
      respect is not paid in this world to that which has real merit; it is
      reserved for that which has none. So retirement is at once a proof and a
      result of being distinguished by the possession of meritorious qualities.
      It will therefore show real wisdom on the part of any one who is worth
      anything in himself, to limit his requirements as may be necessary, in
      order to preserve or extend his freedom, and,&mdash;since a man must come
      into some relations with his fellow-men&mdash;to admit them to his
      intimacy as little as possible. </i>

      I have said that people are rendered sociable by their ability to endure
      solitude, that is to say, their own society. They become sick of
      themselves. It is this vacuity of soul which drives them to intercourse
      with others,&mdash;to travels in foreign countries. Their mind is wanting
      in elasticity; it has no movement of its own, and so they try to give it
      some,&mdash;by drink, for instance. How much drunkenness is due to this
      cause alone! They are always looking for some form of excitement, of the
      strongest kind they can bear&mdash;the excitement of being with people of
      like nature with themselves; and if they fail in this, their mind sinks by
      its own weight, and they fall into a grievous lethargy.<a

      man, in the full sense of the word,&mdash;a man par excellence<i>&mdash;does

      that we can more easily bear up under evils which fall upon a great many
      people besides ourselves. As boredom seems to be an evil of this kind,
      people band together to offer it a common resistance. The love of life is
      at bottom only the fear of death; and, in the same way, the social impulse
      does not rest directly upon the love of society, but upon the fear of
      solitude; it is not alone the charm of being in others' company that
      people seek, it is the dreary oppression of being alone&mdash;the monotony
      of their own consciousness&mdash;that they would avoid. They will do
      anything to escape it,&mdash;even tolerate bad companions, and put up with
      the feeling of constraint which all society involves, in this case a very
      burdensome one. But if aversion to such society conquers the aversion to
      being alone, they become accustomed to solitude and hardened to its
      immediate effects. They no longer find solitude to be such a very bad
      thing, and settle down comfortably to it without any hankering after
      society;&mdash;and this, partly because it is only indirectly that they
      need others' company, and partly because they have become accustomed to
      the benefits of being alone.]

      Ordinary society is, in this respect, very like the kind of music to be
      obtained from an orchestra composed of Russian horns. Each horn has only
      one note; and the music is produced by each note coming in just at the
      right moment. In the monotonous sound of a single horn, you have a precise
      illustration of the effect of most people's minds. How often there seems
      to be only one thought there! and no room for any other. It is easy to see
      why people are so bored; and also why they are sociable, why they like to
      go about in crowds&mdash;why mankind is so gregarious<i>. It is the
      monotony of his own nature that makes a man find solitude intolerable.
      </i>Omnis stultitia laborat fastidio sui<i>: folly is truly its own

      A man of intellect is like an artist who gives a concert without any help
      from anyone else, playing on a single instrument&mdash;a piano, say, which
      is a little orchestra in itself. Such a man is a little world in himself;
      and the effect produced by various instruments together, he produces
      single-handed, in the unity of his own consciousness. Like the piano, he
      has no place in a symphony: he is a soloist and performs by himself,&mdash;in
      solitude, it may be; or, if in company with other instruments, only as
      principal; or for setting the tone, as in singing. However, those who are
      fond of society from time to time may profit by this simile, and lay it
      down as a general rule that deficiency of quality in those we meet may be
      to some extent compensated by an increase in quantity. One man's company
      may be quite enough, if he is clever; but where you have only ordinary
      people to deal with, it is advisable to have a great many of them, so that
      some advantage may accrue by letting them all work together,&mdash;on the
      analogy of the horns; and may Heaven grant you patience for your task!

      That mental vacuity and barrenness of soul to which I have alluded, is
      responsible for another misfortune. When men of the better class form a
      society for promoting some noble or ideal aim, the result almost always is
      that the innumerable mob of humanity comes crowding in too, as it always
      does everywhere, like vermin&mdash;their object being to try and get rid
      of boredom, or some other defect of their nature; and anything that will
      effect that, they seize upon at once, without the slightest
      discrimination. Some of them will slip into that society, or push
      themselves in, and then either soon destroy it altogether, or alter it so
      much that in the end it comes to have a purpose the exact opposite of that
      which it had at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the only point of view from which the social impulse may be
      regarded. On cold days people manage to get some warmth by crowding
      together; and you can warm your mind in the same way&mdash;by bringing it
      into contact with others. But a man who has a great deal of intellectual
      warmth in himself will stand in no need of such resources. I have written
      a little fable illustrating this: it may be found elsewhere.<a
      href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a>
      As a general rule, it may be said that a man's sociability stands very
      nearly in inverse ratio to his intellectual value: to say that "so and so"
      is very unsociable, is almost tantamount to saying that he is a man of
      great capacity.

      passage to which Schopenhauer refers is </i>Parerga<i>: vol. ii. § 413
      (4th edition). The fable is of certain porcupines, who huddled together
      for warmth on a cold day; but as they began to prick one another with
      their quills, they were obliged to disperse. However the cold drove them
      together again, when just the same thing happened. At last, after many
      turns of huddling and dispersing, they discovered that they would be best
      off by remaining at a little distance from one another. In the same way,
      the need of society drives the human porcupines together&mdash;only to be
      mutually repelled by the many prickly and disagreeable qualities of their
      nature. The moderate distance which they at last discover to be the only
      tolerable condition of intercourse, is the code of politeness and fine
      manners; and those who transgress it are roughly told&mdash;in the English
      phrase&mdash;</i>to keep their distance<i>. By this arrangement the mutual
      need of warmth is only very moderately satisfied,&mdash;but then people do
      not get pricked. A man who has some heat in himself prefers to remain
      outside, where he will neither prick other people nor get pricked
      himself.] </i>

      Solitude is doubly advantageous to such a man. Firstly, it allows him to
      be with himself, and, secondly, it prevents him being with others&mdash;an
      advantage of great moment; for how much constraint, annoyance, and even
      danger there is in all intercourse with the world. Tout notre mal<i>, says
      La Bruyère, </i>vient de ne pouvoir être seul<i>. It is really a very
      risky, nay, a fatal thing, to be sociable; because it means contact with
      natures, the great majority of which are bad morally, and dull or
      perverse, intellectually. To be unsociable is not to care about such
      people; and to have enough in oneself to dispense with the necessity of
      their company is a great piece of good fortune; because almost all our
      sufferings spring from having to do with other people; and that destroys
      the peace of mind, which, as I have said, comes next after health in the
      elements of happiness. Peace of mind is impossible without a considerable
      amount of solitude. The Cynics renounced all private property in order to
      attain the bliss of having nothing to trouble them; and to renounce
      society with the same object is the wisest thing a man can do. Bernardin
      de Saint Pierre has the very excellent and pertinent remark that to be
      sparing in regard to food is a means of health; in regard to society, a
      means of tranquillity&mdash;</i>la diète des ailmens nous rend la santé du
      corps, et celle des hommes la tranquillité de l'âme.<i> To be soon on
      friendly, or even affectionate, terms with solitude is like winning a gold
      mine; but this is not something which everybody can do. The prime reason
      for social intercourse is mutual need; and as soon as that is satisfied,
      boredom drives people together once more. If it were not for these two
      reasons, a man would probably elect to remain alone; if only because
      solitude is the sole condition of life which gives full play to that
      feeling of exclusive importance which every man has in his own eyes,&mdash;as
      if he were the only person in the world! a feeling which, in the throng
      and press of real life, soon shrivels up to nothing, getting, at every
      step, a painful </i>démenti<i>. From this point of view it may be said
      that solitude is the original and natural state of man, where, like
      another Adam, he is as happy as his nature will allow. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, had Adam no father or mother? There is another sense in which
      solitude is not the natural state; for, at his entrance into the world, a
      man finds himself with parents, brothers, sisters, that is to say, in
      society, and not alone. Accordingly it cannot be said that the love of
      solitude is an original characteristic of human nature; it is rather the
      result of experience and reflection, and these in their turn depend upon
      the development of intellectual power, and increase with the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking generally, sociability stands in inverse ratio with age. A little
      child raises a piteous cry of fright if it is left alone for only a few
      minutes; and later on, to be shut up by itself is a great punishment.
      Young people soon get on very friendly terms with one another; it is only
      the few among them of any nobility of mind who are glad now and then to be
      alone;&mdash;but to spend the whole day thus would be disagreeable. A
      grown-up man can easily do it; it is little trouble to him to be much
      alone, and it becomes less and less trouble as he advances in years. An
      old man who has outlived all his friends, and is either indifferent or
      dead to the pleasures of life, is in his proper element in solitude; and
      in individual cases the special tendency to retirement and seclusion will
      always be in direct proportion to intellectual capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this tendency is not, as I have said, a purely natural one; it does
      not come into existence as a direct need of human nature; it is rather the
      effect of the experience we go through, the product of reflection upon
      what our needs really are; proceeding, more especially, from the insight
      we attain into the wretched stuff of which most people are made, whether
      you look at their morals or their intellects. The worst of it all is that,
      in the individual, moral and intellectual shortcomings are closely
      connected and play into each other's hands, so that all manner of
      disagreeable results are obtained, which make intercourse with most people
      not only unpleasant but intolerable. Hence, though the world contains many
      things which are thoroughly bad, the worst thing in it is society. Even
      Voltaire, that sociable Frenchman, was obliged to admit that there are
      everywhere crowds of people not worth talking to: la terre est couverte de
      gens qui ne méritent pas qu'on leur parle<i>. And Petrarch gives a similar
      reason for wishing to be alone&mdash;that tender spirit! so strong and
      constant in his love of seclusion. The streams, the plains and woods know
      well, he says, how he has tried to escape the perverse and stupid people
      who have missed the way to heaven:&mdash; </i>

      He pursues the same strain in that delightful book of his, DeVita

      celebrated work on </i>Solitude<i>. It is the secondary and indirect
      character of the love of seclusion to which Chamfort alludes in the
      following passage, couched in his sarcastic vein: </i>On dit quelquefois

      You will find a similar sentiment expressed by the Persian poet Sadi, in
      his Garden of Roses. Since that time<i>, he says, </i>we have taken leave
      of society, preferring the path of seclusion; for there is safety in
      solitude<i>. Angelus Silesius,<a href="#linknote-18" name="linknoteref-18"
      id="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> a very gentle and Christian writer,
      confesses to the same feeling, in his own mythical language. Herod, he
      says, is the common enemy; and when, as with Joseph, God warns us of
      danger, we fly from the world to solitude, from Bethlehem to Egypt; or
      else suffering and death await us!&mdash; </i>

      he says, </i>che in terra hanno voluto gustare vita celeste, dissero con
      una voce, "ecce elongavi fugiens et mansi in solitudine<i>"&mdash;those
      who in this world have desired a foretaste of the divine life, have always
      proclaimed with one voice: </i>

      And in the work from which I have already quoted, Sadi says of himself: In
      disgust with my friends at Damascus, I withdrew into the desert about
      Jerusalem, to seek the society of the beasts of the field<i>. In short,
      the same thing has been said by all whom Prometheus has formed out of
      better clay. What pleasure could they find in the company of people with
      whom their only common ground is just what is lowest and least noble in
      their own nature&mdash;the part of them that is commonplace, trivial and
      vulgar? What do they want with people who cannot rise to a higher level,
      and for whom nothing remains but to drag others down to theirs? for this
      is what they aim at. It is an aristocratic feeling that is at the bottom
      of this propensity to seclusion and solitude. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rascals are always sociable&mdash;more's the pity! and the chief sign that
      a man has any nobility in his character is the little pleasure he takes in
      others' company. He prefers solitude more and more, and, in course of
      time, comes to see that, with few exceptions, the world offers no choice
      beyond solitude on one side and vulgarity on the other. This may sound a
      hard thing to say; but even Angelus Silesius, with all his Christian
      feelings of gentleness and love, was obliged to admit the truth of it.
      However painful solitude may be, he says, be careful not to be vulgar; for
      then you may find a desert everywhere:&mdash;

      It is natural for great minds&mdash;the true teachers of humanity&mdash;to
      care little about the constant company of others; just as little as the
      schoolmaster cares for joining in the gambols of the noisy crowd of boys
      which surround him. The mission of these great minds is to guide mankind
      over the sea of error to the haven of truth&mdash;to draw it forth from
      the dark abysses of a barbarous vulgarity up into the light of culture and
      refinement. Men of great intellect live in the world without really
      belonging to it; and so, from their earliest years, they feel that there
      is a perceptible difference between them and other people. But it is only
      gradually, with the lapse of years, that they come to a clear
      understanding of their position. Their intellectual isolation is then
      reinforced by actual seclusion in their manner of life; they let no one
      approach who is not in some degree emancipated from the prevailing
      vulgarity.

      From what has been said it is obvious that the love of solitude is not a
      direct, original impulse in human nature, but rather something secondary
      and of gradual growth. It is the more distinguishing feature of nobler
      minds, developed not without some conquest of natural desires, and now and

    </p>
    <p>
      To be alone is the fate of all great minds&mdash;a fate deplored at times,
      but still always chosen as the less grievous of two evils. As the years
      increase, it always becomes easier to say, Dare to be wise&mdash;sapere
      aude<i>. And after sixty, the inclination to be alone grows into a kind of
      real, natural instinct; for at that age everything combines in favor of
      it. The strongest impulse&mdash;the love of woman's society&mdash;has
      little or no effect; it is the sexless condition of old age which lays the
      foundation of a certain self-sufficiency, and that gradually absorbs all
      desire for others' company. A thousand illusions and follies are overcome;
      the active years of life are in most cases gone; a man has no more
      expectations or plans or intentions. The generation to which he belonged
      has passed away, and a new race has sprung up which looks upon him as
      essentially outside its sphere of activity. And then the years pass more
      quickly as we become older, and we want to devote our remaining time to
      the intellectual rather than to the practical side of life. For, provided
      that the mind retains its faculties, the amount of knowledge and
      experience we have acquired, together with the facility we have gained in
      the use of our powers, makes it then more than ever easy and interesting
      to us to pursue the study of any subject. A thousand things become clear
      which were formerly enveloped in obscurity, and results are obtained which
      give a feeling of difficulties overcome. From long experience of men, we
      cease to expect much from them; we find that, on the whole, people do not
      gain by a nearer acquaintance; and that&mdash;apart from a few rare and
      fortunate exceptions&mdash;we have come across none but defective
      specimens of human nature which it is advisable to leave in peace. We are
      no more subject to the ordinary illusions of life; and as, in individual
      instances, we soon see what a man is made of, we seldom feel any
      inclination to come into closer relations with him. Finally, isolation&mdash;our
      own society&mdash;has become a habit, as it were a second nature to us,
      more especially if we have been on friendly terms with it from our youth
      up. The love of solitude which was formerly indulged only at the expense
      of our desire for society, has now come to be the simple quality of our
      natural disposition&mdash;the element proper to our life, as water to a
      fish. This is why anyone who possesses a unique individuality&mdash;unlike
      others and therefore necessarily isolated&mdash;feels that, as he becomes
      older, his position is no longer so burdensome as when he was young. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      For, as a matter of fact, this very genuine privilege of old age is one
      which can be enjoyed only if a man is possessed of a certain amount of
      intellect; it will be appreciated most of all where there is real mental
      power; but in some degree by every one. It is only people of very barren
      and vulgar nature who will be just as sociable in their old age as they
      were in their youth. But then they become troublesome to a society to
      which they are no longer suited, and, at most, manage to be tolerated;
      whereas, they were formerly in great request.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another aspect of this inverse proportion between age and
      sociability&mdash;the way in which it conduces to education. The younger
      that people are, the more in every respect they have to learn; and it is
      just in youth that Nature provides a system of mutual education, so that
      mere intercourse with others, at that time of life, carries instruction
      with it. Human society, from this point of view, resembles a huge academy
      of learning, on the Bell and Lancaster system, opposed to the system of
      education by means of books and schools, as something artificial and
      contrary to the institutions of Nature. It is therefore a very suitable
      arrangement that, in his young days, a man should be a very diligent
      student at the place of learning provided by Nature herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is nothing in life which has not some drawback&mdash;nihil est
      ab omni parte beatum<i>, as Horace says; or, in the words of an Indian
      proverb, </i>no lotus without a stalk<i>. Seclusion, which has so many
      advantages, has also its little annoyances and drawbacks, which are small,
      however, in comparison with those of society; hence anyone who is worth
      much in himself will get on better without other people than with them.
      But amongst the disadvantages of seclusion there is one which is not so
      easy to see as the rest. It is this: when people remain indoors all day,
      they become physically very sensitive to atmospheric changes, so that
      every little draught is enough to make them ill; so with our temper; a
      long course of seclusion makes it so sensitive that the most trivial
      incidents, words, or even looks, are sufficient to disturb or to vex and
      offend us&mdash;little things which are unnoticed by those who live in the
      turmoil of life. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you find human society disagreeable and feel yourself justified in
      flying to solitude, you can be so constituted as to be unable to bear the
      depression of it for any length of time, which will probably be the case
      if you are young. Let me advise you, then, to form the habit of taking
      some of your solitude with you into society, to learn to be to some extent
      alone even though you are in company; not to say at once what you think,
      and, on the other hand, not to attach too precise a meaning to what others
      say; rather, not to expect much of them, either morally or intellectually,
      and to strengthen yourself in the feeling of indifference to their
      opinion, which is the surest way of always practicing a praiseworthy
      toleration. If you do that, you will not live so much with other people,
      though you may appear to move amongst them: your relation to them will be
      of a purely objective character. This precaution will keep you from too
      close contact with society, and therefore secure you against being
      contaminated or even outraged by it.<a href="#linknote-21"
      name="linknoteref-21" id="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> Society is in
      this respect like a fire&mdash;the wise man warming himself at a proper
      distance from it; not coming too close, like the fool, who, on getting
      scorched, runs away and shivers in solitude, loud in his complaint that
      the fire burns.

      So much for the envy which we may feel towards others. As regards the envy
      which we may excite in them, it should always be remembered that no form
      of hatred is so implacable as the hatred that comes from envy; and
      therefore we should always carefully refrain from doing anything to rouse
      it; nay, as with many another form of vice, it is better altogether to
      renounce any pleasure there may be in it, because of the serious nature of
      its consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristocracies are of three kinds: (1) of birth and rank; (2) of wealth;
      and (3) of intellect. The last is really the most distinguished of the
      three, and its claim to occupy the first position comes to be recognized,
      if it is only allowed time to work. So eminent a king as Frederick the
      Great admitted it&mdash;les âmes privilegiées rangent à l'égal des
      souverains<i>, as he said to his chamberlain, when the latter expressed
      his surprise that Voltaire should have a seat at the table reserved for
      kings and princes, whilst ministers and generals were relegated to the
      chamberlain's. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one of these aristocracies is surrounded by a host of envious
      persons. If you belong to one of them, they will be secretly embittered
      against you; and unless they are restrained by fear, they will always be
      anxious to let you understand that you are no better than they<i>. It is
      by their anxiety to let you know this, that they betray how greatly they
      are conscious that the opposite is the truth. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The line of conduct to be pursued if you are exposed to envy, is to keep
      the envious persons at a distance, and, as far as possible, avoid all
      contact with them, so that there may be a wide gulf fixed between you and
      them; if this cannot be done, to bear their attacks with the greatest
      composure. In the latter case, the very thing that provokes the attack
      will also neutralize it. This is what appears to be generally done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The members of one of these aristocracies usually get on very well with
      those of another, and there is no call for envy between them, because
      their several privileges effect an equipoise.

      you proceed to carry it out; and even after you have thoroughly turned it
      over in your mind, make some concession to the incompetency of human
      judgment; for it may always happen that circumstances which cannot be
      investigated or foreseen, will come in and upset the whole of your
      calculation. This is a reflection that will always influence the negative
      side of the balance&mdash;a kind of warning to refrain from unnecessary
      action in matters of importance&mdash;quieta non movere.<i> But having
      once made up your mind and begun your work, you must let it run its course

      possible danger: free your mind from the subject altogether, and refuse to
      go into it again, secure in the thought that you gave it mature attention
      at the proper time. This is the same advice as is given by an Italian
      proverb&mdash;</i>legala bene e poi lascia la andare<i>&mdash;which Goethe
      has translated thus: See well to your girths, and then ride on boldly.<a

      And if, notwithstanding that, you fail, it is because human affairs are
      the sport of chance and error. Socrates, the wisest of men, needed the
      warning voice of his good genius, or [Greek: daimonion], to enable him to
      do what was right in regard to his own personal affairs, or at any rate,
      to avoid mistakes; which argues that the human intellect is incompetent
      for the purpose. There is a saying&mdash;which is reported to have
      originated with one of the Popes&mdash;that when misfortune happens to us,
      the blame of it, at least in some degree, attaches to ourselves. If this
      is not true absolutely and in every instance, it is certainly true in the
      great majority of cases. It even looks as if this truth had a great deal
      to do with the effort people make as far as possible to conceal their
      misfortunes, and to put the best face they can upon them, for fear lest
      their misfortunes may show how much they are to blame.

      In the case of a misfortune which has already happened and therefore
      cannot be altered, you should not allow yourself to think that it might
      have been otherwise; still less, that it might have been avoided by such
      and such means; for reflections of this kind will only add to your
      distress and make it intolerable, so that you will become a tormentor to
      yourself&mdash;[Greek: heautontimoroumeaeos]. It is better to follow the
      example of King David; who, as long as his son lay on the bed of sickness,
      assailed Jehovah with unceasing supplications and entreaties for his
      recovery; but when he was dead, snapped his fingers and thought no more of
      it. If you are not light-hearted enough for that, you can take refuge in
      fatalism, and have the great truth revealed to you that everything which
      happens is the result of necessity, and therefore inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      However good this advice may be, it is one-sided and partial. In relieving
      and quieting us for the moment, it is no doubt effective enough; but when
      our misfortunes have resulted&mdash;as is usually the case&mdash;from our
      own carelessness or folly, or, at any rate, partly by our own fault, it is
      a good thing to consider how they might have been avoided, and to consider
      it often in spite of its being a tender subject&mdash;a salutary form of
      self-discipline, which will make us wiser and better men for the future.
      If we have made obvious mistakes, we should not try, as we generally do,
      to gloss them over, or to find something to excuse or extenuate them; we
      should admit to ourselves that we have committed faults, and open our eyes
      wide to all their enormity, in order that we may firmly resolve to avoid
      them in time to come. To be sure, that means a great deal of
      self-inflicted pain, in the shape of discontent, but it should be
      remembered that to spare the rod is to spoil the child&mdash;[Greek: ho

    <h2>
      SECTION 13. In all matters affecting our weal or woe, we should be
    </h2>
    <p>
      careful not to let our imagination run away with us, and build no castles
      in the air. In the first place, they are expensive to build, because we
      have to pull them down again immediately, and that is a source of grief.
      We should be still more on our guard against distressing our hearts by
      depicting possible misfortunes. If these were misfortunes of a purely
      imaginary kind, or very remote and unlikely, we should at once see, on
      awaking from our dream, that the whole thing was mere illusion; we should
      rejoice all the more in a reality better than our dreams, or at most, be
      warned against misfortunes which, though very remote, were still possible.
      These, however, are not the sort of playthings in which imagination
      delights; it is only in idle hours that we build castles in the air, and
      they are always of a pleasing description. The matter which goes to form
      gloomy dreams are mischances which to some extent really threaten us,
      though it be from some distance; imagination makes us look larger and
      nearer and more terrible than they are in reality. This is a kind of dream
      which cannot be so readily shaken off on awaking as a pleasant one; for a
      pleasant dream is soon dispelled by reality, leaving, at most, a feeble
      hope lying in the lap of possibility. Once we have abandoned ourselves to
      a fit of the blues, visions are conjured up which do not so easily vanish
      again; for it is always just possible that the visions may be realized.
      But we are not always able to estimate the exact degree of possibility:
      possibility may easily pass into probability; and thus we deliver
      ourselves up to torture. Therefore we should be careful not to be
      over-anxious on any matter affecting our weal or our woe, not to carry our
      anxiety to unreasonable or injudicious limits; but coolly and
      dispassionately to deliberate upon the matter, as though it were an
      abstract question which did not touch us in particular. We should give no
      play to imagination here; for imagination is not judgment&mdash;it only
      conjures up visions, inducing an unprofitable and often very painful mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rule on which I am here insisting should be most carefully observed
      towards evening. For as darkness makes us timid and apt to see terrifying
      shapes everywhere, there is something similar in the effect of indistinct
      thought; and uncertainty always brings with it a sense of danger. Hence,
      towards evening, when our powers of thought and judgment are relaxed,&mdash;at
      the hour, as it were, of subjective darkness,&mdash;the intellect becomes
      tired, easily confused, and unable to get at the bottom of things; and if,
      in that state, we meditate on matters of personal interest to ourselves,
      they soon assume a dangerous and terrifying aspect. This is mostly the
      case at night, when we are in bed; for then the mind is fully relaxed, and
      the power of judgment quite unequal to its duties; but imagination is
      still awake. Night gives a black look to everything, whatever it may be.
      This is why our thoughts, just before we go to sleep, or as we lie awake
      through the hours of the night, are usually such confusions and
      perversions of facts as dreams themselves; and when our thoughts at that
      time are concentrated upon our own concerns, they are generally as black
      and monstrous as possible. In the morning all such nightmares vanish like
      dreams: as the Spanish proverb has it, noche tinta, bianco el dia<i>&mdash;the
      night is colored, the day is white. But even towards nightfall, as soon as
      the candles are lit, the mind, like the eye, no longer sees things so
      clearly as by day: it is a time unsuited to serious meditation, especially
      on unpleasant subjects. The morning is the proper time for that&mdash;as
      indeed for all efforts without exception, whether mental or bodily. For
      the morning is the youth of the day, when everything is bright, fresh, and
      easy of attainment; we feel strong then, and all our faculties are
      completely at our disposal. Do not shorten the morning by getting up late,
      or waste it in unworthy occupations or in talk; look upon it as the
      quintessence of life, as to a certain extent sacred. Evening is like old
      age: we are languid, talkative, silly. Each day is a little life: every
      waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth,
      every going to rest and sleep a little death. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But condition of health, sleep, nourishment, temperature, weather,
      surroundings, and much else that is purely external, have, in general, an
      important influence upon our mood and therefore upon our thoughts. Hence
      both our view of any matter and our capacity for any work are very much
      subject to time and place. So it is best to profit by a good mood&mdash;for
      how seldom it comes!&mdash;

      We are not always able to form new ideas about; our surroundings, or to
      command original thoughts: they come if they will, and when they will. And
      so, too, we cannot always succeed in completely considering some personal
      matter at the precise time at which we have determined beforehand to
      consider it, and just when we set ourselves to do so. For the peculiar
      train of thought which is favorable to it may suddenly become active
      without any special call being made upon it, and we may then follow it up
      with keen interest. In this way reflection, too, chooses its own time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reining-in of the imagination which I am recommending, will also
      forbid us to summon up the memory of the past misfortune, to paint a dark
      picture of the injustice or harm that has been done us, the losses we have
      sustained, the insults, slights and annoyances to which we have been
      exposed: for to do that is to rouse into fresh life all those hateful
      passions long laid asleep&mdash;the anger and resentment which disturb and
      pollute our nature. In an excellent parable, Proclus, the Neoplatonist,
      points out how in every town the mob dwells side by side with those who
      are rich and distinguished: so, too, in every man, be he never so noble
      and dignified, there is, in the depth of his nature, a mob of low and
      vulgar desires which constitute him an animal. It will not do to let this
      mob revolt or even so much as peep forth from its hiding-place; it is
      hideous of mien, and its rebel leaders are those flights of imagination
      which I have been describing. The smallest annoyance, whether it comes
      from our fellow-men or from the things around us, may swell up into a
      monster of dreadful aspect, putting us at our wits' end&mdash;and all
      because we go on brooding over our troubles and painting them in the most
      glaring colors and on the largest scale. It is much better to take a very
      calm and prosaic view of what is disagreeable; for that is the easiest way
      of bearing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you hold small objects close to your eyes, you limit your field of
      vision and shut out the world. And, in the same way, the people or the
      things which stand nearest, even though they are of the very smallest
      consequence, are apt to claim an amount of attention much beyond their
      due, occupying us disagreeably, and leaving no room for serious thoughts
      and affairs of importance. We ought to work against this tendency.

    <h2>
      SECTION 14. The sight of things which do not belong to us is very apt
    </h2>
    <p>
      to raise the thought: Ah, if that were only mine<i>! making us sensible of
      our privation. Instead of that we should do better by more frequently
      putting to ourselves the opposite case: </i>Ah, if that were not mine<i>.
      What I mean is that we should sometimes try to look upon our possessions
      in the light in which they would appear if we had lost them; whatever they
      may be, property, health, friends, a wife or child or someone else we
      love, our horse or our dog&mdash;it is usually only when we have lost them
      that we begin to find out their value. But if we come to look at things in
      the way I recommend, we shall be doubly the gainers; we shall at once get
      more pleasure out of them than we did before, and we shall do everything
      in our power to prevent the loss of them; for instance, by not risking our
      property, or angering our friends, or exposing our wives to temptation, or
      being careless about our children's health, and so on. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      We often try to banish the gloom and despondency of the present by
      speculating upon our chances of success in the future; a process which
      leads us to invent a great many chimerical hopes. Every one of them
      contains the germ of illusion, and disappointment is inevitable when our
      hopes are shattered by the hard facts of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is less hurtful to take the chances of misfortune as a theme for
      speculation; because, in doing so, we provide ourselves at once with
      measures of precaution against it, and a pleasant surprise when it fails
      to make its appearance. Is it not a fact that we always feel a marked
      improvement in our spirits when we begin to get over a period of anxiety?
      I may go further and say that there is some use in occasionally looking
      upon terrible misfortunes&mdash;such as might happen to us&mdash;as though
      they had actually happened, for then the trivial reverses which
      subsequently come in reality, are much easier to bear. It is a source of
      consolation to look back upon those great misfortunes which never
      happened. But in following out this rule, care must be taken not to
      neglect what I have said in the preceding section.

    <h2>
      SECTION 15. The things which engage our attention&mdash;whether they are
    </h2>
    <p>
      matters of business or ordinary events&mdash;are of such diverse kinds,
      that, if taken quite separately and in no fixed order or relation, they
      present a medley of the most glaring contrasts, with nothing in common,
      except that they one and all affect us in particular. There must be a
      corresponding abruptness in the thoughts and anxieties which these various
      matters arouse in us, if our thoughts are to be in keeping with their
      various subjects. Therefore, in setting about anything, the first step is
      to withdraw our attention from everything else: this will enable us to
      attend to each matter at its own time, and to enjoy or put up with it,
      quite apart from any thought of our remaining interests. Our thoughts must
      be arranged, as it were, in little drawers, so that we may open one
      without disturbing any of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way we can keep the heavy burden of anxiety from weighing upon us
      so much as to spoil the little pleasures of the present, or from robbing
      us of our rest; otherwise the consideration of one matter will interfere
      with every other, and attention to some important business may lead us to
      neglect many affairs which happen to be of less moment. It is most
      important for everyone who is capable of higher and nobler thoughts to
      keep their mind from being so completely engrossed with private affairs
      and vulgar troubles as to let them take up all his attention and crowd out
      worthier matter; for that is, in a very real sense, to lose sight of the
      true end of life&mdash;propter vitam vivendi perdere causas<i>. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course for this&mdash;as for so much else&mdash;self-control is
      necessary; without it, we cannot manage ourselves in the way I have
      described. And self-control may not appear so very difficult, if we
      consider that every man has to submit to a great deal of very severe
      control on the part of his surroundings, and that without it no form of
      existence is possible. Further, a little self-control at the right moment
      may prevent much subsequent compulsion at the hands of others; just as a
      very small section of a circle close to the centre may correspond to a
      part near the circumference a hundred times as large. Nothing will protect
      us from external compulsion so much as the control of ourselves; and, as
      Seneca says, to submit yourself to reason is the way to make everything
      else submit to you&mdash;si tibi vis omnia subjicere, te subjice rationi<i>.
      Self-control, too, is something which we have in our own power; and if the
      worst comes to the worst, and it touches us in a very sensitive part, we
      can always relax its severity. But other people will pay no regard to our
      feelings, if they have to use compulsion, and we shall be treated without
      pity or mercy. Therefore it will be prudent to anticipate compulsion by
      self-control. </i>

      feeling wretched. This is what Horace means when he recommends us to study
      carefully and inquire diligently what will best promote a tranquil life&mdash;not

    <h2>
      SECTION 17. Life consists in movement, says Aristotle; and he is
    </h2>
    <p>
      obviously right. We exist, physically, because our organism is the seat of
      constant motion; and if we are to exist intellectually, it can only be by
      means of continual occupation&mdash;no matter with what so long as it is
      some form of practical or mental activity. You may see that this is so by
      the way in which people who have no work or nothing to think about,
      immediately begin to beat the devil's tattoo with their knuckles or a
      stick or anything that comes handy. The truth is, that our nature is
      essentially restless<i> in its character: we very soon get tired of having
      nothing to do; it is intolerable boredom. This impulse to activity should
      be regulated, and some sort of method introduced into it, which of itself
      will enhance the satisfaction we obtain. Activity!&mdash;doing something,
      if possible creating something, at any rate learning something&mdash;how
      fortunate it is that men cannot exist without that! A man wants to use his
      strength, to see, if he can, what effect it will produce; and he will get
      the most complete satisfaction of this desire if he can make or construct
      something&mdash;be it a book or a basket. There is a direct pleasure in
      seeing work grow under one's hands day by day, until at last it is
      finished. This is the pleasure attaching to a work of art or a manuscript,
      or even mere manual labor; and, of course, the higher the work, the
      greater pleasure it will give. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point of view, those are happiest of all who are conscious of
      the power to produce great works animated by some significant purpose: it
      gives a higher kind of interest&mdash;a sort of rare flavor&mdash;to the
      whole of their life, which, by its absence from the life of the ordinary
      man, makes it, in comparison, something very insipid. For richly endowed
      natures, life and the world have a special interest beyond the mere
      everyday personal interest which so many others share; and something
      higher than that&mdash;a formal interest. It is from life and the world
      that they get the material for their works; and as soon as they are freed
      from the pressure of personal needs, it is to the diligent collection of
      material that they devote their whole existence. So with their intellect:
      it is to some extent of a two-fold character, and devoted partly to the
      ordinary affairs of every day&mdash;those matters of will which are common
      to them and the rest of mankind, and partly to their peculiar work&mdash;the
      pure and objective contemplation of existence. And while, on the stage of
      the world, most men play their little part and then pass away, the genius
      lives a double life, at once an actor and a spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let everyone, then, do something, according to the measure of his
      capacities. To have no regular work, no set sphere of activity&mdash;what
      a miserable thing it is! How often long travels undertaken for pleasure
      make a man downright unhappy; because the absence of anything that can be
      called occupation forces him, as it were, out of his right element.
      Effort, struggles with difficulties! that is as natural to a man as
      grubbing in the ground is to a mole. To have all his wants satisfied is
      something intolerable&mdash;the feeling of stagnation which comes from
      pleasures that last too long. To overcome difficulties is to experience
      the full delight of existence, no matter where the obstacles are
      encountered; whether in the affairs of life, in commerce or business; or
      in mental effort&mdash;the spirit of inquiry that tries to master its
      subject. There is always something pleasurable in the struggle and the
      victory. And if a man has no opportunity to excite himself, he will do
      what he can to create one, and according to his individual bent, he will
      hunt or play Cup and Ball: or led on by this unsuspected element in his
      nature, he will pick a quarrel with some one, or hatch a plot or intrigue,
      or take to swindling and rascally courses generally&mdash;all to put an
      end to a state of repose which is intolerable. As I have remarked,
      difficilis in otio quies<i>&mdash;it is difficult to keep quiet if you
      have nothing to do. </i>

    <h2>
      SECTION 18. A man should avoid being led on by the phantoms of his
    </h2>
    <p>
      imagination. This is not the same thing as to submit to the guidance of
      ideas clearly thought out: and yet these are rules of life which most
      people pervert. If you examine closely into the circumstances which, in
      any deliberation, ultimately turn the scale in favor of some particular
      course, you will generally find that the decision is influenced, not by
      any clear arrangement of ideas leading to a formal judgment, but by some
      fanciful picture which seems to stand for one of the alternatives in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of Voltaire's or Diderot's romances,&mdash;I forget the precise
      reference,&mdash;the hero, standing like a young Hercules at the parting
      of ways, can see no other representation of Virtue than his old tutor
      holding a snuff-box in his left hand, from which he takes a pinch and
      moralizes; whilst Vice appears in the shape of his mother's chambermaid.
      It is in youth, more especially, that the goal of our efforts comes to be
      a fanciful picture of happiness, which continues to hover before our eyes
      sometimes for half and even for the whole of our life&mdash;a sort of
      mocking spirit; for when we think our dream is to be realized, the picture
      fades away, leaving us the knowledge that nothing of what it promised is
      actually accomplished. How often this is so with the visions of
      domesticity&mdash;the detailed picture of what our home will be like; or,
      of life among our fellow-citizens or in society; or, again, of living in
      the country&mdash;the kind of house we shall have, its surroundings, the
      marks of honor and respect that will be paid to us, and so on,&mdash;whatever
      our hobby may be; chaque fou a sa marotte<i>. It is often the same, too,
      with our dreams about one we love. And this is all quite natural; for the
      visions we conjure up affect us directly, as though they were real
      objects; and so they exercise a more immediate influence upon our will
      than an abstract idea, which gives merely a vague, general outline, devoid
      of details; and the details are just the real part of it. We can be only
      indirectly affected by an abstract idea, and yet it is the abstract idea
      alone which will do as much as it promises; and it is the function of
      education to teach us to put our trust in it. Of course the abstract idea
      must be occasionally explained&mdash;paraphrased, as it were&mdash;by the
      aid of pictures; but discreetly, </i>cum grano salis<i>. </i>

      SECTION 19. The preceding rule may be taken as a special case of the
    </h2>
    <p>
      more general maxim, that a man should never let himself be mastered by the
      impressions of the moment, or indeed by outward appearances at all, which
      are incomparably more powerful in their effects than the mere play of
      thought or a train of ideas; not because these momentary impressions are
      rich in virtue of the data they supply,&mdash;it is often just the
      contrary,&mdash;but because they are something palpable to the senses and
      direct in their working; they forcibly invade our mind, disturbing our
      repose and shattering our resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to understand that the thing which lies before our very eyes
      will produce the whole of its effect at once, but that time and leisure
      are necessary for the working of thought and the appreciation of argument,
      as it is impossible to think of everything at one and the same moment.
      This is why we are so allured by pleasure, in spite of all our
      determination to resist it; or so much annoyed by a criticism, even though
      we know that its author it totally incompetent to judge; or so irritated
      by an insult, though it comes from some very contemptible quarter. In the
      same way, to mention no other instances, ten reasons for thinking that
      there is no danger may be outweighed by one mistaken notion that it is
      actually at hand. All this shows the radical unreason of human nature.
      Women frequently succumb altogether to this predominating influence of
      present impressions, and there are few men so overweighted with reason as
      to escape suffering from a similar cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is impossible to resist the effects of some external influence by
      the mere play of thought, the best thing to do is to neutralize it by some
      contrary influence; for example, the effect of an insult may be overcome
      by seeking the society of those who have a good opinion of us; and the
      unpleasant sensation of imminent danger may be avoided by fixing our
      attention on the means of warding it off.

    <h2>
      SECTION 20. In the first part of this work I have insisted upon the
    </h2>
    <p>
      great value of health<i> as the chief and most important element in
      happiness. Let me emphasize and confirm what I have there said by giving a
      few general rules as to its preservation. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The way to harden the body is to impose a great deal of labor and effort
      upon it in the days of good health,&mdash;to exercise it, both as a whole
      and in its several parts, and to habituate it to withstand all kinds of
      noxious influences. But on the appearance of an illness or disorder,
      either in the body as a whole or in many of its parts, a contrary course
      should be taken, and every means used to nurse the body, or the part of it
      which is affected, and to spare it any effort; for what is ailing and
      debilitated cannot be hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The muscles may be strengthened by a vigorous use of them; but not so the
      nerves; they are weakened by it. Therefore, while exercising the muscles
      in every way that is suitable, care should be taken to spare the nerves as
      much as possible. The eyes, for instance, should be protected from too
      strong a light,&mdash;especially when it is reflected light,&mdash;from
      any straining of them in the dark, or from the long-continued examination
      of minute objects; and the ears from too loud sounds. Above all, the brain
      should never be forced, or used too much, or at the wrong time; let it
      have a rest during digestion; for then the same vital energy which forms
      thoughts in the brain has a great deal of work to do elsewhere,&mdash;I
      mean in the digestive organs, where it prepares chyme and chyle. For
      similar reasons, the brain should never be used during, or immediately
      after, violent muscular exercise. For the motor nerves are in this respect
      on a par with the sensory nerves; the pain felt when a limb is wounded has
      its seat in the brain; and, in the same way, it is not really our legs and
      arms which work and move,&mdash;it is the brain, or, more strictly, that
      part of it which, through the medium of the spine, excites the nerves in
      the limbs and sets them in motion. Accordingly, when our arms and legs
      feel tired, the true seat of this feeling is in the brain. This is why it
      is only in connection with those muscles which are set in motion
      consciously and voluntarily,&mdash;in other words, depend for their action
      upon the brain,&mdash;that any feeling of fatigue can arise; this is not
      the case with those muscles which work involuntarily, like the heart. It
      is obvious, then, that injury is done to the brain if violent muscular
      exercise and intellectual exertion are forced upon it at the same moment,
      or at very short intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I say stands in no contradiction with the fact that at the beginning
      of a walk, or at any period of a short stroll, there often comes a feeling
      of enhanced intellectual vigor. The parts of the brain that come into play
      have had no time to become tired; and besides, slight muscular exercise
      conduces to activity of the respiratory organs, and causes a purer and
      more oxydated supply of arterial blood to mount to the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is most important to allow the brain the full measure of sleep which is
      required to restore it; for sleep is to a man's whole nature what winding
      up is to a clock.<a href="#linknote-30" name="linknoteref-30"
      id="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> This measure will vary directly with
      the development and activity of the brain; to overstep the measure is mere
      waste of time, because if that is done, sleep gains only so much in length
      as it loses in depth.<a href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31"

      It should be clearly understood that thought is nothing but the organic
      function of the brain; and it has to obey the same laws in regard to
      exertion and repose as any other organic function. The brain can be ruined
      by overstrain, just like the eyes. As the function of the stomach is to
      digest, so it is that of the brain to think. The notion of a soul<i>,&mdash;as
      something elementary and immaterial, merely lodging in the brain and
      needing nothing at all for the performance of its essential function,
      which consists in always and unweariedly </i>thinking<i>&mdash;has
      undoubtedly driven many people to foolish practices, leading to a
      deadening of the intellectual powers; Frederick the Great, even, once
      tried to form the habit of doing without sleep altogether. It would be
      well if professors of philosophy refrained from giving currency to a
      notion which is attended by practical results of a pernicious character;
      but then this is just what professorial philosophy does, in its
      old-womanish endeavor to keep on good terms with the catechism. A man
      should accustom himself to view his intellectual capacities in no other
      light than that of physiological functions, and to manage them accordingly&mdash;nursing
      or exercising them as the case may be; remembering that every kind of
      physical suffering, malady or disorder, in whatever part of the body it
      occurs, has its effect upon the mind. The best advice that I know on this
      subject is given by Cabanis in his </i>Rapports du physique et du moral de

      Through neglect of this rule, many men of genius and great scholars have
      become weak-minded and childish, or even gone quite mad, as they grew old.
      To take no other instances, there can be no doubt that the celebrated
      English poets of the early part of this century, Scott, Wordsworth,
      Southey, became intellectually dull and incapable towards the end of their
      days, nay, soon after passing their sixtieth year; and that their
      imbecility can be traced to the fact that, at that period of life, they
      were all led on? by the promise of high pay, to treat literature as a
      trade and to write for money. This seduced them into an unnatural abuse of
      their intellectual powers; and a man who puts his Pegasus into harness,

      that which is exacted by the abuse of other kinds of power.

      CHAPTER III. &mdash; OUR RELATION TO OTHERS.&mdash;
    </h2>
    <p>
      SECTION 21.
    </p>
    <p>
      In making his way through life, a man will find it useful to be ready and
      able to do two things: to look ahead and to overlook: the one will protect
      him from loss and injury, the other from disputes and squabbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who has to live amongst men should absolutely discard any person
      who has his due place in the order of nature, even though he is very
      wicked or contemptible or ridiculous. He must accept him as an unalterable
      fact&mdash;unalterable, because the necessary outcome of an eternal,
      fundamental principle; and in bad cases he should remember the words of
      Mephistopheles: es muss auch solche Käuze geben<a href="#linknote-33"
      name="linknoteref-33" id="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a><i>&mdash;there
      must be fools and rogues in the world. If he acts otherwise, he will be
      committing an injustice, and giving a challenge of life and death to the
      man he discards. No one can alter his own peculiar individuality, his
      moral character, his intellectual capacity, his temperament or physique;
      and if we go so far as to condemn a man from every point of view, there
      will be nothing left him but to engage us in deadly conflict; for we are
      practically allowing him the right to exist only on condition that he
      becomes another man&mdash;which is impossible; his nature forbids it. </i>

    <p>
      So if you have to live amongst men, you must allow everyone the right to
      exist in accordance with the character he has, whatever it turns out to
      be: and all you should strive to do is to make use of this character in
      such a way as its kind and nature permit, rather than to hope for any
      alteration in it, or to condemn it off-hand for what it is. This is the
      true sense of the maxim&mdash;Live and let live. That, however, is a task
      which is difficult in proportion as it is right; and he is a happy man who
      can once for all avoid having to do with a great many of his fellow
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art of putting up with people may be learned by practicing patience on
      inanimate objects, which, in virtue of some mechanical or general physical
      necessity, oppose a stubborn resistance to our freedom of action&mdash;a
      form of patience which is required every day. The patience thus gained may
      be applied to our dealings with men, by accustoming ourselves to regard
      their opposition, wherever we encounter it, as the inevitable outcome of
      their nature, which sets itself up against us in virtue of the same rigid
      law of necessity as governs the resistance of inanimate objects. To become
      indignant at their conduct is as foolish as to be angry with a stone
      because it rolls into your path. And with many people the wisest thing you
      can do, is to resolve to make use of those whom you cannot alter.

    <h2>
      SECTION 22. It is astonishing how easily and how quickly similarity,
    </h2>
    <p>
      or difference of mind and disposition, makes itself felt between one man
      and another as soon as they begin to talk: every little trifle shows it.
      When two people of totally different natures are conversing, almost
      everything said by the one will, in a greater or less degree, displease
      the other, and in many cases produce positive annoyance; even though the
      conversation turn upon the most out-of-the-way subject, or one in which
      neither of the parties has any real interest. People of similar nature, on
      the other hand, immediately come to feel a kind of general agreement; and
      if they are cast very much in the same mould, complete harmony or even
      unison will flow from their intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      This explain two circumstances. First of all, it shows why it is that
      common, ordinary people are so sociable and find good company wherever
      they go. Ah! those good, dear, brave people. It is just the contrary with
      those who are not of the common run; and the less they are so, the more
      unsociable they become; so that if, in their isolation, they chance to
      come across some one in whose nature they can find even a single
      sympathetic chord, be it never so minute, they show extraordinary pleasure
      in his society. For one man can be to another only so much as the other is
      to him. Great minds are like eagles, and build their nest in some lofty
      solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, we are enabled to understand how it is that people of like
      disposition so quickly get on with one another, as though they were drawn
      together by magnetic force&mdash;kindred souls greeting each other from
      afar. Of course the most frequent opportunity of observing this is
      afforded by people of vulgar tastes and inferior intellect, but only
      because their name is legion; while those who are better off in this
      respect and of a rarer nature, are not often to be met with: they are
      called rare because you can seldom find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the case of a large number of people who have formed themselves into
      a league for the purpose of carrying out some practical object; if there
      be two rascals among them, they will recognize each other as readily as if
      they bore a similar badge, and will at once conspire for some misfeasance
      or treachery. In the same way, if you can imagine&mdash;per impossible<i>&mdash;a
      large company of very intelligent and clever people, amongst whom there
      are only two blockheads, these two will be sure to be drawn together by a
      feeling of sympathy, and each of them will very soon secretly rejoice at
      having found at least one intelligent person in the whole company. It is
      really quite curious to see how two such men, especially if they are
      morally and intellectually of an inferior type, will recognize each other
      at first sight; with what zeal they will strive to become intimate; how
      affably and cheerily they will run to greet each other, just as though
      they were old friends;&mdash;it is all so striking that one is tempted to
      embrace the Buddhist doctrine of metempsychosis and presume that they were
      on familiar terms in some former state of existence. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, in spite of all this general agreement, men are kept apart who
      might come together; or, in some cases, a passing discord springs up
      between them. This is due to diversity of mood. You will hardly ever see
      two people exactly in the same frame of mind; for that is something which
      varies with their condition of life, occupation, surroundings, health, the
      train of thought they are in at the moment, and so on. These differences
      give rise to discord between persons of the most harmonious disposition.
      To correct the balance properly, so as to remove the disturbance&mdash;to
      introduce, as it were, a uniform temperature,&mdash;is a work demanding a
      very high degree of culture. The extent to which uniformity of mood is
      productive of good-fellowship may be measured by its effects upon a large
      company. When, for instance, a great many people are gathered together and
      presented with some objective interest which works upon all alike and
      influences them in a similar way, no matter what it be&mdash;a common
      danger or hope, some great news, a spectacle, a play, a piece of music, or
      anything of that kind&mdash;you will find them roused to a mutual
      expression of thought, and a display of sincere interest. There will be a
      general feeling of pleasure amongst them; for that which attracts their
      attention produces a unity of mood by overpowering all private and
      personal interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in default of some objective interest of the kind I have mentioned,
      recourse is usually had to something subjective. A bottle of wine is not
      an uncommon means of introducing a mutual feeling of fellowship; and even
      tea and coffee are used for a like end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discord which so easily finds its way into all society as an effect of
      the different moods in which people happen to be for the moment, also in
      part explains why it is that memory always idealizes, and sometimes almost
      transfigures, the attitude we have taken up at any period of the past&mdash;a
      change due to our inability to remember all the fleeting influences which
      disturbed us on any given occasion. Memory is in this respect like the
      lens of a camera obscura<i>: it contracts everything within its range, and
      so produces a much finer picture than the actual landscape affords. And,
      in the case of a man, absence always goes some way towards securing this
      advantageous light; for though the idealizing tendency of the memory
      requires times to complete its work, it begins it at once. Hence it is a
      prudent thing to see your friends and acquaintances only at considerable
      intervals of time; and on meeting them again, you will observe that memory
      has been at work. </i>

      SECTION 23. No man can see over his own height.<i> Let me explain what
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot see in another man any more than you have in yourself; and your
      own intelligence strictly determines the extent to which he comes within
      its grasp. If your intelligence is of a very low order, mental qualities
      in another, even though they be of the highest kind, will have no effect
      at all upon you; you will see nothing in their possessor except the
      meanest side of his individuality&mdash;in other words, just those parts
      of his character and disposition which are weak and defective. Your whole
      estimate of the man will be confined to his defects, and his higher mental
      qualities will no more exist for you than colors exist for those who
      cannot see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intellect is invisible to the man who has none. In any attempt to
      criticise another's work, the range of knowledge possessed by the critic
      is as essential a part of his verdict as the claims of the work itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence intercourse with others involves a process of leveling down. The
      qualities which are present in one man, and absent in another, cannot come
      into play when they meet; and the self-sacrifice which this entails upon
      one of the parties, calls forth no recognition from the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider how sordid, how stupid, in a word, how vulgar<i> most men are,
      and you will see that it is impossible to talk to them without becoming
      vulgar yourself for the time being. Vulgarity is in this respect like
      electricity; it is easily distributed. You will then fully appreciate the
      truth and propriety of the expression, </i>to make yourself cheap<i>; and
      you will be glad to avoid the society of people whose only possible point
      of contact with you is just that part of your nature of which you have
      least reason to be proud. So you will see that, in dealing with fools and
      blockheads, there is only one way of showing your intelligence&mdash;by
      having nothing to do with them. That means, of course, that when you go
      into society, you may now and then feel like a good dancer who gets an
      invitation to a ball, and on arriving, finds that everyone is lame:&mdash;with
      whom is he to dance? </i>

      difficult to feel deep veneration and great affection for one and the same

      love that we want from our fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their love is always selfish, though in very different ways; and the means
      used to gain it are not always of a kind to make us proud. A man is loved
      by others mainly in the degree in which he moderates his claim on their
      good feeling and intelligence: but he must act genuinely in the matter and
      without dissimulation&mdash;not merely out of forbearance, which is at
      bottom a kind of contempt. This calls to mind a very true observation of
      Helvetius<a href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34" id="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a>:
      the amount of intellect necessary to please us, is a most accurate measure

      Now with veneration the case is just the opposite; it is wrung from men
      reluctantly, and for that very reason mostly concealed. Hence, as compared
      with love, veneration gives more real satisfaction; for it is connected
      with personal value, and the same is not directly true of love, which is
      subjective in its nature, whilst veneration is objective. To be sure, it
      is more useful to be loved than to be venerated.

      interests them but themselves. They always think of their own case as soon
      as ever any remark is made, and their whole attention is engrossed and
      absorbed by the merest chance reference to anything which affects them
      personally, be it never so remote: with the result that they have no power
      left for forming an objective view of things, should the conversation take
      that turn; neither can they admit any validity in arguments which tell
      against their interest or their vanity. Hence their attention is easily
      distracted. They are so readily offended, insulted or annoyed, that in
      discussing any impersonal matter with them, no care is too great to avoid
      letting your remarks bear the slightest possible reference to the very
      worthy and sensitive individuals whom you have before you; for anything
      you may say will perhaps hurt their feelings. People really care about
      nothing that does not affect them personally. True and striking
      observations, fine, subtle and witty things are lost upon them: they
      cannot understand or feel them. But anything that disturbs their petty
      vanity in the most remote and indirect way, or reflects prejudicially upon

      And in some people this feeling reaches such a pass that, if they are
      talking with anyone, and he exhibits, or does not sufficiently conceal,
      his intelligence and discernment, they look upon it as a downright insult;
      although for the moment they hide their ill will, and the unsuspecting
      author of it afterwards ruminates in vain upon their conduct, and racks
      his brain to discover what he could possibly have done to excite their
      malice and hatred.

    <p>
      But it is just as easy to flatter and win them over; and this is why their
      judgment is usually corrupt, and why their opinions are swayed, not by
      what is really true and right, but by the favor of the party or class to
      which they belong. And the ultimate reason of it all is, that in such
      people force of will greatly predominates over knowledge; and hence their
      meagre intellect is wholly given up to the service of the will, and can
      never free itself from that service for a moment.

      Astrology furnishes a magnificent proof of this miserable subjective
      tendency in men, which leads them to see everything only as bearing upon
      themselves, and to think of nothing that is not straightway made into a
      personal matter. The aim of astrology is to bring the motions of the
      celestial bodies into relation with the wretched Ego<i> and to establish a
      connection between a comet in the sky and squabbles and rascalities on
      earth.<a href="#linknote-35" name="linknoteref-35" id="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a>

      Therefore it is well not to be too indulgent or charitable with anyone.
      You may take it as a general rule that you will not lose a friend by
      refusing him a loan, but that you are very likely to do so by granting it;
      and, for similar reasons, you will not readily alienate people by being
      somewhat proud and careless in your behaviour; but if you are very kind
      and complaisant towards them, you will often make them arrogant and
      intolerable, and so a breach will ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one thing that, more than any other, throws people absolutely off
      their balance&mdash;the thought that you are dependent upon them. This is
      sure to produce an insolent and domineering manner towards you. There are
      some people, indeed, who become rude if you enter into any kind of
      relation with them; for instance, if you have occasion to converse with
      them frequently upon confidential matters, they soon come to fancy that
      they can take liberties with you, and so they try and transgress the laws
      of politeness. This is why there are so few with whom you care to become
      more intimate, and why you should avoid familiarity with vulgar people. If
      a man comes to think that I am more dependent upon him than he is upon me,
      he at once feels as though I had stolen something from him; and his
      endeavor will be to have his vengeance and get it back. The only way to
      attain superiority in dealing with men, is to let it be seen that you are
      independent of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this view it is advisable to let everyone of your acquaintance&mdash;whether
      man or woman&mdash;feel now and then that you could very well dispense
      with their company. This will consolidate friendship. Nay, with most
      people there will be no harm in occasionally mixing a grain of disdain
      with your treatment of them; that will make them value your friendship all
      the more. Chi non istima vien stimato<i>, as a subtle Italian proverb has
      it&mdash;to disregard is to win regard. But if we really think very highly
      of a person, we should conceal it from him like a crime. This is not a
      very gratifying thing to do, but it is right. Why, a dog will not bear
      being treated too kindly, let alone a man! </i>

    <h2>
      SECTION 29. It is often the case that people of noble character and
    </h2>
    <p>
      great mental gifts betray a strange lack of worldly wisdom and a
      deficiency in the knowledge of men, more especially when they are young;
      with the result that it is easy to deceive or mislead them; and that, on
      the other hand, natures of the commoner sort are more ready and successful
      in making their way in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason of this is that, when a man has little or no experience, he
      must judge by his own antecedent notions; and in matters demanding
      judgment, an antecedent notion is never on the same level as experience.
      For, with the commoner sort of people, an antecedent notion means just
      their own selfish point of view. This is not the case with those whose
      mind and character are above the ordinary; for it is precisely in this
      respect&mdash;their unselfishness&mdash;that they differ from the rest of
      mankind; and as they judge other people's thoughts and actions by their
      own high standard, the result does not always tally with their
      calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if, in the end, a man of noble character comes to see, as the effect
      of his own experience, or by the lessons he learns from others, what it is
      that may be expected of men in general,&mdash;namely, that five-sixths of
      them are morally and intellectually so constituted that, if circumstances
      do not place you in relation with them, you had better get out of their
      way and keep as far as possible from having anything to do with them,&mdash;still,
      he will scarcely ever attain an adequate notion of their wretchedly mean
      and shabby nature: all his life long he will have to be extending and
      adding to the inferior estimate he forms of them; and in the meantime he
      will commit a great many mistakes and do himself harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, after he has really taken to heart the lessons that have been
      taught him, it will occasionally happen that, when he is in the society of
      people whom he does not know, he will be surprised to find how thoroughly
      reasonable they all appear to be, both in their conversation and in their
      demeanor&mdash;in fact, quite honest, sincere, virtuous and trustworthy
      people, and at the same time shrewd and clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that ought not to perplex him. Nature is not like those bad poets,
      who, in setting a fool or a knave before us, do their work so clumsily,
      and with such evident design, that you might almost fancy you saw the poet
      standing behind each of his characters, and continually disavowing their
      sentiments, and telling you in a tone of warning: This is a knave; that is
      a fool; do not mind what he says<i>. But Nature goes to work like
      Shakespeare and Goethe, poets who make every one of their characters&mdash;even
      if it is the devil himself!&mdash;appear to be quite in the right for the
      moment that they come before us in their several parts; the characters are
      described so objectively that they excite our interest and compel us to
      sympathize with their point of view; for, like the works of Nature, every
      one of these characters is evolved as the result of some hidden law or
      principle, which makes all they say and do appear natural and therefore
      necessary. And you will always be the prey or the plaything of the devils
      and fools in this world, if you expect to see them going about with horns
      or jangling their bells. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And it should be borne in mind that, in their intercourse with others,
      people are like the moon, or like hunchbacks; they show you only one of
      their sides. Every man has an innate talent for mimicry,&mdash;for making
      a mask out of his physiognomy, so that he can always look as if he really
      were what he pretends to be; and since he makes his calculations always
      within the lines of his individual nature, the appearance he puts on suits
      him to a nicety, and its effect is extremely deceptive. He dons his mask
      whenever his object is to flatter himself into some one's good opinion;
      and you may pay just as much attention to it as if it were made of wax or
      cardboard, never forgetting that excellent Italian proverb: non é si
      tristo cane che non meni la coda<i>,&mdash;there is no dog so bad but that
      he will wag his tail. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case it is well to take care not to form a highly favorable opinion
      of a person whose acquaintance you have only recently made, for otherwise
      you are very likely to be disappointed; and then you will be ashamed of
      yourself and perhaps even suffer some injury. And while I am on the
      subject, there is another fact that deserves mention. It is this. A man
      shows his character just in the way in which he deals with trifles,&mdash;for
      then he is off his guard. This will often afford a good opportunity of
      observing the boundless egoism of man's nature, and his total lack of
      consideration for others; and if these defects show themselves in small
      things, or merely in his general demeanor, you will find that they also
      underlie his action in matters of importance, although he may disguise the
      fact. This is an opportunity which should not be missed. If in the little
      affairs of every day,&mdash;the trifles of life, those matters to which
      the rule de minimis non<i> applies,&mdash;a man is inconsiderate and seeks
      only what is advantageous or convenient to himself, to the prejudice of
      others' rights; if he appropriates to himself that which belongs to all
      alike, you may be sure there is no justice in his heart, and that he would
      be a scoundrel on a wholesale scale, only that law and compulsion bind his
      hands. Do not trust him beyond your door. He who is not afraid to break
      the laws of his own private circle, will break those of the State when he
      can do so with impunity. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the average man were so constituted that the good in him outweighed the
      bad, it would be more advisable to rely upon his sense of justice,
      fairness, gratitude, fidelity, love or compassion, than to work upon his
      fears; but as the contrary is the case, and it is the bad that outweighs
      the good, the opposite course is the more prudent one.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any person with whom we are associated or have to do, exhibits
      unpleasant or annoying qualities, we have only to ask ourselves whether or
      not this person is of so much value to us that we can put up with frequent
      and repeated exhibitions of the same qualities in a somewhat aggravated
      form.<a href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36" id="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a>
      In case of an affirmative answer to this question, there will not be much
      to be said, because talking is very little use. We must let the matter
      pass, with or without some notice; but we should nevertheless remember
      that we are thereby exposing ourselves to a repetition of the offence. If
      the answer is in the negative, we must break with our worthy friend at
      once and forever; or in the case of a servant, dismiss him. For he will
      inevitably repeat the offence, or do something tantamount to it, should
      the occasion return, even though for the moment he is deep and sincere in
      his assurances of the contrary. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that
      a man cannot forget,&mdash;but not himself, his own character<i>. For
      character is incorrigible; because all a man's actions emanate from an
      inward principle, in virtue of which he must always do the same thing
      under like circumstances; and he cannot do otherwise. Let me refer to my
      prize essay on the so-called </i>Freedom of the Will<i>, the perusal of
      which will dissipate any delusions the reader may have on this subject.

      To become reconciled to a friend with whom you have broken, is a form of
      weakness; and you pay the penalty of it when he takes the first
      opportunity of doing precisely the very thing which brought about the
      breach; nay, he does it the more boldly, because he is secretly conscious
      that you cannot get on without him. This is also applicable to servants
      whom you have dismissed, and then taken into your service again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the same reason, you should just as little expect people to continue
      to act in a similar way under altered circumstances. The truth is that men
      alter their demeanor and sentiments just as fast as their interest
      changes; and their resign in this respect is a bill drawn for short
      payment that the man must be still more short-sighted who accepts the bill
      without protesting it. Accordingly, suppose you want to know how a man
      will behave in an office into which you think of putting him; you should
      not build upon expectations, on his promises or assurances. For, even
      allowing that he is quite sincere, he is speaking about a matter of which
      he has no knowledge. The only way to calculate how he will behave, is to
      consider the circumstances in which he will be placed, and the extent to
      which they will conflict with his character.

    <p>
      If you wish to get a clear and profound insight&mdash;and it is very
      needful&mdash;into the true but melancholy elements of which most men are
      made, you will find in a very instructive thing to take the way they
      behave in the pages of literature as a commentary to their doings in
      practical life, and vice versa.<i> The experience thus gained will be very
      useful in avoiding wrong ideas, whether about yourself or about others.
      But if you come across any special trait of meanness or stupidity&mdash;in
      life or in literature,&mdash;you must be careful not to let it annoy or
      distress you, but to look upon it merely as an addition to your knowledge&mdash;a
      new fact to be considered in studying the character of humanity. Your
      attitude towards it will be that of the mineralogist who stumbles upon a
      very characteristic specimen of a mineral. </i>

    <p>
      Of course there are some facts which are very exceptional, and it is
      difficult to understand how they arise, and how it is that there come to
      be such enormous differences between man and man; but, in general, what
      was said long ago is quite true, and the world is in a very bad way. In
      savage countries they eat one another, in civilized they deceive one
      another; and that is what people call the way of the world! What are
      States and all the elaborate systems of political machinery, and the rule
      of force, whether in home or in foreign affairs,&mdash;what are they but
      barriers against the boundless iniquity of mankind? Does not all history
      show that whenever a king is firmly planted on a throne, and his people
      reach some degree of prosperity, he uses it to lead his army, like a band
      of robbers, against adjoining countries? Are not almost all wars
      ultimately undertaken for purposes of plunder? In the most remote
      antiquity, and to some extent also in the Middle Ages, the conquered
      became slaves,&mdash;in other words, they had to work for those who
      conquered them; and where is the difference between that and paying
      war-taxes, which represent the product of our previous work?

      All war, says Voltaire, is a matter of robbery; and the Germans should

      himself, to go his own ways; everyone needs to be guided by a preconceived
      plan, and to follow certain general rules. But if this is carried too far,
      and a man tries to take on a character which is not natural or innate in
      him, but it artificially acquired and evolved merely by a process of
      reasoning, he will very soon discover that Nature cannot be forced, and
      that if you drive it out, it will return despite your efforts:&mdash;

      To understand a rule governing conduct towards others, even to discover it
      for oneself and to express it neatly, is easy enough; and still, very soon
      afterwards, the rule may be broken in practice. But that is no reason for
      despair; and you need not fancy that as it is impossible to regulate your
      life in accordance with abstract ideas and maxims, it is better to live
      just as you please. Here, as in all theoretical instruction that aims at a
      practical result, the first thing to do is to understand the rule; the
      second thing is to learn the practice of it. The theory may be understand
      at once by an effort of reason, and yet the practice of it acquired only
      in course of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pupil may lean the various notes on an instrument of music, or the
      different position in fencing; and when he makes a mistake, as he is sure
      to do, however hard he tries, he is apt to think it will be impossible to
      observe the rules, when he is set to read music at sight or challenged to
      a furious duel. But for all that, gradual practice makes him perfect,
      through a long series of slips, blunders and fresh efforts. It is just the
      same in other things; in learning to write and speak Latin, a man will
      forget the grammatical rules; it is only by long practice that a blockhead
      turns into a courtier, that a passionate man becomes shrewd and
      worldly-wise, or a frank person reserved, or a noble person ironical. But
      though self-discipline of this kind is the result of long habit, it always
      works by a sort of external compulsion, which Nature never ceases to
      resist and sometimes unexpectedly overcomes. The difference between action
      in accordance with abstract principles, and action as the result of
      original, innate tendency, is the same as that between a work of art, say
      a watch&mdash;where form and movement are impressed upon shapeless and
      inert matter&mdash;and a living organism, where form and matter are one,
      and each is inseparable from the other.

      There is a maxim attributed to the Emperor Napoleon, which expresses this
      relation between acquired and innate character, and confirms what I have

      universal application, whether in the physical or in the moral sphere. The
      only exception I can think of to this rule is aventurine,<a
      href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37" id="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a>

      And in this connection let me utter a word of protest against any and
      every form of affectation<i>. It always arouses contempt; in the first
      place, because it argues deception, and the deception is cowardly, for it
      is based on fear; and, secondly, it argues self-condemnation, because it
      means that a man is trying to appear what he is not, and therefore
      something which he things better than he actually is. To affect a quality,
      and to plume yourself upon it, is just to confess that you have not got
      it. Whether it is courage, or learning, or intellect, or wit, or success
      with women, or riches, or social position, or whatever else it may be that
      a man boasts of, you may conclude by his boasting about it that that is
      precisely the direction in which he is rather weak; for if a man really
      possesses any faculty to the full, it will not occur to him to make a
      great show of affecting it; he is quite content to know that he has it.
      That is the application of the Spanish proverb: </i>herradura que
      chacolotea clavo le falta<i>&mdash;a clattering hoof means a nail gone. To
      be sure, as I said at first, no man ought to let the reins go quite loose,
      and show himself just as he is; for there are many evil and bestial sides
      to our nature which require to be hidden away out of sight; and this
      justifies the negative attitude of dissimulation, but it does not justify
      a positive feigning of qualities which are not there. It should also be
      remembered that affectation is recognized at once, even before it is clear
      what it is that is being affected. And, finally, affectation cannot last
      very long, and one day the mask will fall off. </i>Nemo potest personam

      SECTION 31. A man bears the weight of his own body without knowing it,
    </h2>
    <p>
      but he soon feels the weight of any other, if he tries to move it; in the
      same way, a man can see other people's shortcoming's and vices, but he is
      blind to his own. This arrangement has one advantage: it turns other
      people into a kind of mirror, in which a man can see clearly everything
      that is vicious, faulty, ill-bred and loathsome in his own nature; only,
      it is generally the old story of the dog barking at is own image; it is
      himself that he sees and not another dog, as he fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who criticises others, works at the reformation of himself. Those who
      form the secret habit of scrutinizing other people's general behavior, and
      passing severe judgment upon what they do and leave undone, thereby
      improve themselves, and work out their own perfection: for they will have
      sufficient sense of justice, or at any rate enough pride and vanity, to
      avoid in their own case that which they condemn so harshly elsewhere. But
      tolerant people are just the opposite, and claim for themselves the same
      indulgence that they extend to others&mdash;hanc veniam damus petimusque
      vicissim<i>. It is all very well for the Bible to talk about the mote in
      another's eye and the beam in one's own. The nature of the eye is to look
      not at itself but at other things; and therefore to observe and blame
      faults in another is a very suitable way of becoming conscious of one's
      own. We require a looking-glass for the due dressing of our morals. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The same rule applies in the case of style and fine writing. If, instead
      of condemning, you applaud some new folly in these matters, you will
      imitate it. That is just why literary follies have such vogue in Germany.
      The Germans are a very tolerant people&mdash;everybody can see that! Their
      maxim is&mdash;Hanc veniam damns petimusque vicissim.<i> </i>

    </h2>
    <p>
      the relations prevailing amongst mankind, and the alliances to which these
      relations lead, are at bottom and essentially, ideal<i> in their nature;
      that is to say, that they rest upon similarity of disposition or
      sentiment, or taste, or intellectual power, and so on. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But, later on, he finds out that it is a real<i> foundation which
      underlies these alliances; that they are based upon some </i>material<i>
      interest. This is the true foundation of almost all alliances: nay, most
      men have no notion of an alliance resting upon any other basis.
      Accordingly we find that a man is always measured by the office he holds,
      or by his occupation, nationality, or family relations&mdash;in a word, by
      the position and character which have been assigned him in the
      conventional arrangements of life, where he is ticketed and treated as so
      much goods. Reference to what he is in himself, as a man&mdash;to the
      measure of his own personal qualities&mdash;is never made unless for
      convenience' sake: and so that view of a man is something exceptional, to
      be set aside and ignored, the moment that anyone finds it disagreeable;
      and this is what usually happens. But the more of personal worth a man
      has, the less pleasure he will take in these conventional arrangements;
      and he will try to withdraw from the sphere in which they apply. The
      reason why these arrangements exist at all, is simply that in this world
      of ours misery and need are the chief features: therefore it is everywhere
      the essential and paramount business of life to devise the means of
      alleviating them. </i>

    <h2>
      SECTION 33. As paper-money circulates in the world instead of real
    </h2>
    <p>
      coin, so, is the place of true esteem and genuine friendship, you have the
      outward appearance of it&mdash;a mimic show made to look as much like the
      real thing as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it may be asked whether there are any people who really
      deserve the true coin. For my own part, I should certainly pay more
      respect to an honest dog wagging his tail than to a hundred such
      demonstrations of human regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      True and genuine friendship presupposes a strong sympathy with the weal
      and woe of another&mdash;purely objective in its character and quite
      disinterested; and this in its turn means an absolute identification of
      self with the object of friendship. The egoism of human nature is so
      strongly antagonistic to any such sympathy, that true friendship belongs
      to that class of things&mdash;the sea-serpent, for instance,&mdash;with
      regard to which no one knows whether they are fabulous or really exist
      somewhere or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, in many cases, there is a grain of true and genuine friendship in
      the relation of man to man, though generally, of course, some secret
      personal interest is at the bottom of them&mdash;some one among the many
      forms that selfishness can take. But in a world where all is imperfect,
      this grain of true feeling is such an ennobling influence that it gives
      some warrant for calling those relations by the name of friendship, for
      they stand far above the ordinary friendships that prevail amongst
      mankind. The latter are so constituted that, were you to hear how your
      dear friends speak of you behind your back, you would never say another
      word to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the case where it would be a real help to you if your friend
      were to make some great sacrifice to serve you, there is no better means
      of testing the genuineness of his feelings than the way in which he
      receives the news of a misfortune that has just happened to you. At that
      moment the expression of his features will either show that his one
      thought is that of true and sincere sympathy for you; or else the absolute
      composure of his countenance, or the passing trace of something other than
      sympathy, will confirm the well-known maxim of La Rochefoucauld: Dans
      l'adversite de nos meilleurs amis, nous trouvons toujours quelque chose
      qui ne nous deplait pas<i>. Indeed, at such a moment, the ordinary
      so-called friend will find it hard to suppress the signs of a slight smile
      of pleasure. There are few ways by which you can make more certain of
      putting people into a good humor than by telling them of some trouble that
      has recently befallen you, or by unreservedly disclosing some personal
      weakness of yours. How characteristic this is of humanity! </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Distance and long absence are always prejudicial to friendship, however
      disinclined a man may be to admit. Our regard for people whom we do not
      see&mdash;even though they be our dearest friends&mdash;gradually dries up
      in the course of years, and they become abstract notions; so that our
      interest in them grows to be more and more intellectual,&mdash;nay, it is
      kept up only as a kind of tradition; whilst we retain a lively and deep
      interest in those who are constantly before our eyes, even if they be only
      pet animals. This shows how much men are limited by their senses, and how
      true is the remark that Goethe makes in Tasso<i> about the dominant
      influence of the present moment:&mdash; </i>

      (1584-1658) was a Spanish prose writer and Jesuit, whose works deal
      chiefly with the observation of character in the various phenomena of
      life. Schopenhauer, among others, had a great admiration for his worldly
      philosophy, and translated his </i>Oraculo manual<i>&mdash;a system of
      rules for the conduct of life&mdash;into German. The same book was
      translated into English towards the close of the seventeenth century.]

    <p>
      To show your intelligence and discernment is only an indirect way of
      reproaching other people for being dull and incapable. And besides, it is
      natural for a vulgar man to be violently agitated by the sight of
      opposition in any form; and in this case envy comes in as the secret cause
      of his hostility. For it is a matter of daily observation that people take
      the greatest pleasure in that which satisfies their vanity; and vanity
      cannot be satisfied without comparison with others. Now, there is nothing
      of which a man is prouder than of intellectual ability, for it is this
      that gives him his commanding place in the animal world. It is an
      exceedingly rash thing to let any one see that you are decidedly superior
      to him in this respect, and to let other people see it too; because he
      will then thirst for vengeance, and generally look about for an
      opportunity of taking it by means of insult, because this is to pass from
      the sphere of intellect<i> to that of </i>will<i>&mdash;and there, all are
      on an equal footing as regards the feeling of hostility. Hence, while rank
      and riches may always reckon upon deferential treatment in society, that
      is something which intellectual ability can never expect; to be ignored is
      the greatest favor shown to it; and if people notice it at all, it is
      because they regard it as a piece of impertinence, or else as something to
      which its possessor has no legitimate right, and upon which he dares to
      pride himself; and in retaliation and revenge for his conduct, people
      secretly try and humiliate him in some other way; and if they wait to do
      this, it is only for a fitting opportunity. A man may be as humble as
      possible in his demeanor, and yet hardly ever get people to overlook his
      crime in standing intellectually above them. In the </i>Garden of Roses<i>,
      Sadi makes the remark:&mdash;</i>You should know that foolish people are a
      hundredfold more averse to meeting the wise than the wise are indisposed
      for the company of the foolish<i>. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it is a real recommendation to be stupid. For just as
      warmth is agreeable to the body, so it does the mind good to feel its
      superiority; and a man will seek company likely to give him this feeling,
      as instinctively as he will approach the fireplace or walk in the sun if
      he wants to get warm. But this means that he will be disliked on account
      of his superiority; and if a man is to be liked, he must really be
      inferior in point of intellect; and the same thing holds good of a woman
      in point of beauty. To give proof of real and unfeigned inferiority to
      some of the people you meet&mdash;that is a very difficult business
      indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider how kindly and heartily a girl who is passably pretty will
      welcome one who is downright ugly. Physical advantages are not thought so
      much of in the case of man, though I suppose you would rather a little man
      sat next to you than one who was bigger than yourself. This is why,
      amongst men, it is the dull and ignorant, and amongst women, the ugly, who
      are always popular and in request.<a href="#linknote-42"
      name="linknoteref-42" id="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> It is likely
      to be said of such people that they are extremely good-natured, because
      every one wants to find a pretext for caring about them&mdash;a pretext
      which will blind both himself and other people to the real reason why he
      likes them. This is also why mental superiority of any sort always tends
      to isolate its possessor; people run away from him out of pure hatred, and
      say all manner of bad things about him by way of justifying their action.
      Beauty, in the case of women, has a similar effect: very pretty girls have
      no friends of their own sex, and they even find it hard to get another
      girl to keep them company. A handsome woman should always avoid applying
      for a position as companion, because the moment she enters the room, her
      prospective mistress will scowl at her beauty, as a piece of folly with
      which, both for her own and for her daughter's sake, she can very well
      dispense. But if the girl has advantages of rank, the case is very
      different; because rank, unlike personal qualities which work by the force
      of mere contrast, produces its effect by a process of reflection; much in
      the same way as the particular hue of a person's complexion depends upon
      the prevailing tone of his immediate surroundings.

      that account, the possession of great ability should be carefully

      affairs of life,&mdash;an egoism so repulsive that some such device is
      necessary for the purpose of concealing its ugliness. The relation which

      It is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to be
      rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and willful incivility, is just as
      insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire. For politeness is like a
      counter&mdash;an avowedly false coin, with which it is foolish to be
      stingy. A sensible man will be generous in the use of it. It is customary
      in every country to end a letter with the words:&mdash;your most obedient
      servant<i>&mdash;</i>votre très-humble serviteur<i>&mdash;</i>suo
      devotissimo servo<i>. (The Germans are the only people who suppress the
      word </i>servant<i>&mdash;</i>Diener<i>&mdash;because, of course, it is
      not true!) However, to carry politeness to such an extent as to damage
      your prospects, is like giving money where only counters are expected.

      Wax, a substance naturally hard and brittle, can be made soft by the
      application of a little warmth, so that it will take any shape you please.
      In the same way, by being polite and friendly, you can make people pliable
      and obliging, even though they are apt to be crabbed and malevolent. Hence
      politeness is to human nature what warmth is to wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it is no easy matter to be polite; in so far, I mean, as it
      requires us to show great respect for everybody, whereas most people
      deserve none at all; and again in so far as it demands that we should
      feign the most lively interest in people, when we must be very glad that
      we have nothing to do with them. To combine politeness with pride is a

      immensely proud of ourselves; and, on the other hand, if we had arrived at
      any clear notion of the judgment which, in his heart, one man generally
      passes upon another. If most people resent the slightest hint that any
      blame attaches to them, you may imagine their feelings if they were to
      overhear what their acquaintance say about them. You should never lose
      sight of the fact that ordinary politeness is only a grinning mask: if it
      shifts its place a little, or is removed for a moment, there is no use
      raising a hue and cry. When a man is downright rude, it is as though he
      had taken off all his clothes, and stood before you in puris naturalibus<i>.
      Like most men in this condition, he does not present a very attractive
      appearance. </i>

      SECTION 42. You should regard all your private affairs as secrets,
    </h2>
    <p>
      and, in respect of them, treat your acquaintances, even though you are on
      good terms with them, as perfect strangers, letting them know nothing more
      than they can see for themselves. For in course of time, and under altered
      circumstances, you may find it a disadvantage that they know even the most
      harmless things about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as a general rule, it is more advisable to show your intelligence by
      saying nothing than by speaking out; for silence is a matter of prudence,
      whilst speech has something in it of vanity. The opportunities for
      displaying the one or the other quality occur equally often; but the
      fleeting satisfaction afforded by speech is often preferred to the
      permanent advantage secured by silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling of relief which lively people experience in speaking aloud
      when no one is listening, should not be indulged, lest it grow into a
      habit; for in this way thought establishes such very friendly terms with
      speech, that conversation is apt to become a process of thinking aloud.
      Prudence exacts that a wide gulf should be fixed between what we think and
      what we say.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times we fancy that people are utterly unable to believe in the truth
      of some statement affecting us personally, whereas it never occurs to them
      to doubt it; but if we give them the slightest opportunity of doubting it,
      they find it absolutely impossible to believe it any more. We often betray
      ourselves into revealing something, simply because we suppose that people
      cannot help noticing it,&mdash;just as a man will throw himself down from
      a great height because he loses his head, in other words, because he
      fancies that he cannot retain a firm footing any longer; the torment of
      his position is so great, that he thinks it better to put an end to it at
      once. This is the kind of insanity which is called acrophobia<i>. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But it should not be forgotten how clever people are in regard to affairs
      which do not concern them, even though they show no particularly sign of
      acuteness in other matters. This is a kind of algebra in which people are
      very proficient: give them a single fact to go upon, and they will solve
      the most complicated problems. So, if you wish to relate some event that
      happened long ago, without mentioning any names, or otherwise indicating
      the persons to whom you refer, you should be very careful not to introduce
      into your narrative anything that might point, however distantly, to some
      definite fact, whether it is a particular locality, or a date, or the name
      of some one who was only to a small extent implicated, or anything else
      that was even remotely connected with the event; for that at once gives
      people something positive to go upon, and by the aid of their talent for
      this sort of algebra, they will discover all the rest. Their curiosity in
      these matters becomes a kind of enthusiasm: their will spurs on their
      intellect, and drives it forward to the attainment of the most remote
      results. For however unsusceptible and different people may be to general
      and universal truths, they are very ardent in the matter of particular
      details.

    <p>
      In keeping with what I have said, it will be found that all those who
      profess to give instructions in the wisdom of life are specially urgent in
      commending the practice of silence, and assign manifold reasons why it
      should be observed; so it is not necessary for me to enlarge upon the
      subject any further. However, I may just add one or two little known
      Arabian proverbs, which occur to me as peculiarly appropriate:&mdash;

      However varied the forms that human destiny may take, the same elements
      are always present; and so life is everywhere much of a piece, whether it
      passed in the cottage or in the palace, in the barrack or in the cloister.
      Alter the circumstance as much as you please! point to strange adventures,
      successes, failures! life is like a sweet-shop, where there is a great
      variety of things, odd in shape and diverse in color&mdash;one and all
      made from the same paste. And when men speak of some one's success, the
      lot of the man who has failed is not so very different as it seems. The
      inequalities in the world are like the combinations in a kaleidoscope; at
      every turn a fresh picture strikes the eye; and yet, in reality, you see
      only the same bits of glass as you saw before.

    <h2>
      SECTION 48. An ancient writer says, very truly, that there are three
    </h2>
    <p>
      great powers in the world; Sagacity, Strength<i>, and </i>Luck<i>,&mdash;[Greek:
      sunetos, kratos, tuchu.] I think the last is the most efficacious. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A man's life is like the voyage of a ship, where luck&mdash;secunda aut
      adversa fortuna<i>&mdash;acts the part of the wind, and speeds the vessel
      on its way or drives it far out of its course. All that the man can do for
      himself is of little avail; like the rudder, which, if worked hard and
      continuously, may help in the navigation of the ship; and yet all may be
      lost again by a sudden squall. But if the wind is only in the right
      quarter, the ship will sail on so as not to need any steering. The power
      of luck is nowhere better expressed than in a certain Spanish proverb:
      </i>Da Ventura a tu hijo, y echa lo en el mar<i>&mdash;give your son luck
      and throw him into the sea. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, chance, it may be said, is a malignant power, and as little as
      possible should be left to its agency. And yet where is there any giver
      who, in dispensing gifts, tells us quite clearly that we have no right to
      them, and that we owe them not to any merit on our part, but wholly to the
      goodness and grace of the giver&mdash;at the same time allowing us to
      cherish the joyful hope of receiving, in all humility, further undeserved
      gifts from the same hands&mdash;where is there any giver like that, unless
      it be Chance<i>? who understands the kingly art of showing the recipient
      that all merit is powerless and unavailing against the royal grace and
      favor. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      On looking back over the course of his life,&mdash;that labyrinthine way
      of error<i>,&mdash;a man must see many points where luck failed him and
      misfortune came; and then it is easy to carry self-reproach to an unjust
      excess. For the course of a man's life is in no wise entirely of his own
      making; it is the product of two factors&mdash;the series of things that
      happened, and his own resolves in regard to them, and these two are
      constantly interacting upon and modifying each other. And besides these,
      another influence is at work in the very limited extent of a man's
      horizon, whether it is that he cannot see very far ahead in respect of the
      plans he will adopt, or that he is still less able to predict the course
      of future events: his knowledge is strictly confined to present plans and
      present events. Hence, as long as a man's goal is far off, he cannot steer
      straight for it; he must be content to make a course that is approximately
      right; and in following the direction in which he thinks he ought to go,
      he will often have occasion to tack. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      All that a man can do is to form such resolves as from time to time accord
      with the circumstances in which he is placed, in the hope of thus managing
      to advance a step nearer towards the final goal. It is usually the case
      that the position in which we stand, and the object at which we aim,
      resemble two tendencies working with dissimilar strength in different
      directions; and the course of our life is represented by their diagonal,
      or resultant force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terence makes the remark that life is like a game at dice, where if the
      number that turns up is not precisely the one you want, you can still
      contrive to use it equally:&mdash;in vita est hominum quasi cum ludas
      tesseris; si illud quod maxime opus est jactu non cadit, illud quod
      cecidit forte, id arte ut corrigas<i>.<a href="#linknote-45"
      name="linknoteref-45" id="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> Or, to put the
      matter more shortly, life is a game of cards, when the cards are shuffled
      and dealt by fate. But for my present purpose, the most suitable simile
      would be that of a game of chess, where the plan we determined to follow
      is conditioned by the play of our rival,&mdash;in life, by the caprice of
      fate. We are compelled to modify our tactics, often to such an extent
      that, as we carry them out, hardly a single feature of the original plan
      can be recognized. </i>

      referring to a game something like backgammon.]
    </p>
    <p>
      But above and beyond all this, there is another influence that makes
      itself felt in our lives. It is a trite saying&mdash;only too frequently
      true&mdash;that we are often more foolish than we think. On the other
      hand, we are often wiser than we fancy ourselves to be. This, however, is
      a discovery which only those can make, of whom it is really true; and it
      takes them a long time to make it. Our brains are not the wisest part of
      us. In the great moments of life, when a man decides upon an important
      step, his action is directed not so much by any clear knowledge of the
      right thing to do, as by an inner impulse&mdash;you may almost call it an
      instinct&mdash;proceeding from the deepest foundations of his being. If,
      later on, he attempts to criticise his action by the light of hard and
      fast ideas of what is right in the abstract&mdash;those unprofitable ideas
      which are learnt by rote, or, it may be, borrowed from other people; if he
      begins to apply general rules, the principles which have guided others, to
      his own case, without sufficiently weighing the maxim that one man's meat
      is another's poison, then he will run great risk of doing himself an
      injustice. The result will show where the right course lay. It is only
      when a man has reached the happy age of wisdom that he is capable of just
      judgment in regard either to his own actions or to those of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that this impulse or instinct is the unconscious effect of a
      kind of prophetic dream which is forgotten when we awake&mdash;lending our
      life a uniformity of tone, a dramatic unity, such as could never result
      from the unstable moments of consciousness, when we are so easily led into
      error, so liable to strike a false note. It is in virtue of some such

      (Dialog. I. ch. 13) explained as "a natural power of the soule, set in the

      of the convent of the Conception at Agreda, a mystical writer of the
      seventeenth century, frequently consulted by Philip IV.,&mdash;and again
      in the Bolognese Dictionary of 1824, with a similar meaning, illustrated

      To act in accordance with abstract principles is a difficult matter, and a
      great deal of practice will be required before you can be even
      occasionally successful; it of tens happens that the principles do not fit
      in with your particular case. But every man has certain innate concrete
      principles<i>&mdash;a part, as it were, of the very blood that flows in
      his veins, the sum or result, in fact, of all his thoughts, feelings and
      volitions. Usually he has no knowledge of them in any abstract form; it is
      only when he looks back upon the course his life has taken, that he
      becomes aware of having been always led on by them&mdash;as though they
      formed an invisible clue which he had followed unawares. </i>

    <h2>
      SECTION 49. That Time works great changes, and that all things are
    </h2>
    <p>
      in their nature fleeting&mdash;these are truths that should never be
      forgotten. Hence, in whatever case you may be, it is well to picture to
      yourself the opposite: in prosperity, to be mindful of misfortune; in
      friendship, of enmity; in good weather, of days when the sky is overcast;
      in love, of hatred; in moments of trust, to imagine the betrayal that will
      make you regret your confidence; and so, too, when you are in evil plight,
      to have a lively sense of happier times&mdash;what a lasting source of
      true worldly wisdom were there! We should then always reflect, and not be
      so very easily deceived; because, in general, we should anticipate the
      very changes that the years will bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps in no form of knowledge is personal experience so indispensable as
      in learning to see that all things are unstable and transitory in this
      world. There is nothing that, in its own place and for the time it lasts,
      is not a product of necessity, and therefore capable of being fully
      justified; and it is this fact that makes circumstances of every year,
      every month, even of every day, seem as though they might maintain their
      right to last to all eternity. But we know that this can never be the
      case, and that in a world where all is fleeting, change alone endures. He
      is a prudent man who is not only undeceived by apparent stability, but is
      able to forecast the lines upon which movement will take place.<a

      a part in all human affairs that when a man tries to ward off a remote
      danger by present sacrifice, the danger often vanishes under some new and
      unforeseen development of events; and then the sacrifice, in addition to
      being a complete loss, brings about such an altered state of things as to
      be in itself a source of positive danger in the face of this new
      development. In taking measures of precaution, then, it is well not to
      look too far ahead, but to reckon with chance; and often to oppose a
      courageous front to a danger, in the hope that, like many a dark
      thunder-cloud, it may pass away without breaking.] </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But people generally think that present circumstances will last, and that
      matters will go on in the future as they have clone in the past. Their
      mistakes arises from the fact that they do not understand the cause of the
      things they see&mdash;causes which, unlike the effects they produce,
      contain in themselves the germ of future change. The effects are all that
      people know, and they hold fast to them on the supposition that those
      unknown causes, which were sufficient to bring them about, will also be
      able to maintain them as they are. This is a very common error; and the
      fact that it is common is not without its advantage, for it means that
      people always err in unison; and hence the calamity which results from the
      error affects all alike, and is therefore easy to bear; whereas, if a
      philosopher makes a mistake, he is alone in his error, and so at a double
      disadvantage.<a href="#linknote-48" name="linknoteref-48" id="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a>

    <p>
      But in saying that we should anticipate the effects of time, I mean that
      we should mentally forecast what they are likely to be; I do not mean that
      we should practically forestall them, by demanding the immediate
      performance of promises which time alone can fulfill. The man who makes
      his demand will find out that there is no worse or more exacting usurer
      than Time; and that, if you compel Time to give money in advance, you will
      have to pay a rate of interest more ruinous than any Jew would require. It
      is possible, for instance, to make a tree burst forth into leaf, blossom,
      or even bear fruit within a few days, by the application of unslaked lime
      and artificial heat; but after that the tree will wither away. So a young
      man may abuse his strength&mdash;it may be only for a few weeks&mdash;by
      trying to do at nineteen what he could easily manage at thirty, and Time
      may give him the loan for which he asks; but the interest he will have to
      pay comes out of the strength of his later years; nay, it is part of his
      very life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some kinds of illness in which entire restoration to health is
      possible only by letting the complaint run its natural course; after which
      it disappears without leaving any trace of its existence. But if the
      sufferer is very impatient, and, while he is still affected, insists that
      he is completely well, in this case, too, Time will grant the loan, and
      the complaint may be shaken off; but life-long weakness and chronic
      mischief will be the interest paid upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in time of war or general disturbance, a man may require ready
      money at once, and have to sell out his investments in land or consols for
      a third or even a still smaller fraction of the sum he would have received
      from them, if he could have waited for the market to right itself, which
      would have happened in due course; but he compels Time to grant him a
      loan, and his loss is the interest he has to pay. Or perhaps he wants to
      go on a long journey and requires the money: in one or two years he could
      lay by a sufficient sum out of his income, but he cannot afford to wait;
      and so he either borrows it or deducts it from his capital; in other
      words, he gets Time to lend him the money in advance. The interest he pays
      is a disordered state of his accounts, and permanent and increasing
      deficits, which he can never make good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is Time's usury; and all who cannot wait are its victims. There is no
      more thriftless proceeding than to try and mend the measured pace of Time.
      Be careful, then, not to become its debtor.

    <h2>
      SECTION 50. In the daily affairs of life, you will have very many
    </h2>
    <p>
      opportunities of recognizing a characteristic difference between ordinary
      people of prudence and discretion. In estimating the possibility of danger
      in connection with any undertaking, an ordinary man will confine his
      inquiries to the kind of risk that has already attended such undertakings
      in the past; whereas a prudent person will look ahead, and consider
      everything that might possibly happen in the future, having regard to a
      certain Spanish maxim: lo que no acaece en un ano, acaece en un rato<i>&mdash;a
      thing may not happen in a year, and yet may happen within two minutes.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference in question is, of course, quite natural; for it requires
      some amount of discernment to calculate possibilities; but a man need only
      have his senses about him to see what has already happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not omit to sacrifice to evil spirits. What I mean is, that a man
      should not hesitate about spending time, trouble, and money, or giving up
      his comfort, or restricting his aims and denying himself, if he can
      thereby shut the door on the possibility of misfortune. The most terrible
      misfortunes are also the most improbable and remote&mdash;the least likely
      to occur. The rule I am giving is best exemplified in the practice of
      insurance,&mdash;a public sacrifice made on the altar of anxiety.
      Therefore take out your policy of insurance!

      Almost every one in his turn has lamented over something which afterwards

    </p>
    <p>
      And, in general, it may be said that, if a man takes misfortunes quietly,
      it is because he knows that very many dreadful things may happen in the
      course of life; and so he looks upon the trouble of the moment as only a
      very small part of that which might come. This is the Stoic temper&mdash;never
      to be unmindful of the sad fate of humanity&mdash;condicionis humanoe
      oblitus<i>; but always to remember that our existence is full of woe and
      misery: and that the ills to which we are exposed are innumerable.
      Wherever he be, a man need only cast a look around, to revive the sense of
      human misery: there before his eyes he can see mankind struggling and
      floundering in torment,&mdash;all for the sake of a wretched existence,
      barren and unprofitable! </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If he remembers this, a man will not expect very much from life, but learn
      to accommodate himself to a world where all is relative and no perfect
      state exists;&mdash;always looking misfortune in the face, and if he
      cannot avoid it, meeting it with courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should never be forgotten that misfortune, be it great or small, is the
      element in which we live. But that is no reason why a man should indulge
      in fretful complaints, and, like Beresford,<a href="#linknote-50"
      name="linknoteref-50" id="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> pull a long
      face over the Miseries of Human Life<i>,&mdash;and not a single hour is
      free from them; or still less, call upon the Deity at every flea-bite&mdash;</i>in
      pulicis morsu Deum invocare<i>. Our aim should be to look well about us,
      to ward off misfortune by going to meet it, to attain such perfection and
      refinement in averting the disagreeable things of life,&mdash;whether they
      come from our fellow-men or from the physical world,&mdash;that, like a
      clever fox, we may slip out of the way of every mishap, great or small;
      remembering that a mishap is generally only our own awkwardness in
      disguise. </i>

    <p>
      The main reason why misfortune falls less heavily upon us, if we have
      looked upon its occurrence as not impossible, and, as the saying is,
      prepared ourselves for it, may be this: if, before this misfortune comes,
      we have quietly thought over it as something which may or may not happen,
      the whole of its extent and range is known to us, and we can, at least,
      determine how far it will affect us; so that, if it really arrives, it
      does not depress us unduly&mdash;its weight is not felt to be greater than
      it actually is. But if no preparation has been made to meet it, and it
      comes unexpectedly, the mind is in a state of terror for the moment and
      unable to measure the full extent of the calamity; it seems so
      far-reaching in its effects that the victim might well think there was no
      limit to them; in any case, its range is exaggerated. In the same way,
      darkness and uncertainty always increase the sense of danger. And, of
      course, if we have thought over the possibility of misfortune, we have
      also at the same time considered the sources to which we shall look for
      help and consolation; or, at any rate, we have accustomed ourselves to the
      idea of it.

      There is nothing that better fits us to endure the misfortunes of life

      necessity.<i><a href="#linknote-51" name="linknoteref-51" id="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a>

      phenomena which obey well-known rules and turn out exactly in accordance

      As long as the issue of any matter fraught with peril is still in doubt,
      and there is yet some possibility left that all may come right, no one
      should ever tremble or think of anything but resistance,&mdash;just as a
      man should not despair of the weather if he can see a bit of blue sky
      anywhere. Let our attitude be such that we should not quake even if the
      world fell in ruins about us:&mdash;

      Still, it is possible for courage to be carried to an excess and to
      degenerate into rashness. It may even be said that some amount of fear is
      necessary, if we are to exist at all in the world, and cowardice is only
      the exaggerated form of it. This truth has been very well expressed by
      Bacon, in his account of Terror Panicus<i>; and the etymological account
      which he gives of its meaning, is very superior to the ancient explanation
      preserved for us by Plutarch.<a href="#linknote-56" name="linknoteref-56"
      id="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> He connects the expression with </i>Pan<i>
      the personification of Nature;<a href="#linknote-57" name="linknoteref-57"
      id="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> and observes that fear is innate in
      every living thing, and, in fact, tends to its preservation, but that it
      is apt to come into play without due cause, and that man is especially
      exposed to it. The chief feature of this </i>Panie Terror<i> is that there
      is no clear notion of any definite danger bound up with it; that it
      presumes rather than knows that danger exists; and that, in case of need,
      it pleads fright itself as the reason for being afraid. </i>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE AGES OF LIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a very fine saying of Voltaire's to the effect that every age of
      life has its own peculiar mental character, and that a man will feel
      completely unhappy if his mind is not in accordance with his years:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Qui n'a pas l'esprit de son âge,
  De son âge atout le malheur<i>.
</i></pre>
    <p>
      It will, therefore, be a fitting close to our speculations upon the nature
      of happiness, if we glance at the chances which the various periods of
      life produce in us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our whole life long it is the present<i>, and the present alone, that we
      actually possess: the only difference is that at the beginning of life we
      look forward to a long future, and that towards the end we look back upon
      a long past; also that our temperament, but not our character, undergoes
      certain well-known changes, which make </i>the present<i> wear a different
      color at each period of life. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have elsewhere stated that in childhood we are more given to using our
      intellect<i> than our </i>will<i>; and I have explained why this is so.<a
      href="#linknote-58" name="linknoteref-58" id="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a>
      It is just for this reason that the first quarter of life is so happy: as
      we look back upon it in after years, it seems a sort of lost paradise. In
      childhood our relations with others are limited, our wants are few,&mdash;in
      a word, there is little stimulus for the will; and so our chief concern is
      the extension of our knowledge. The intellect&mdash;like the brain, which
      attains its full size in the seventh year,<a href="#linknote-59"
      name="linknoteref-59" id="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> is developed
      early, though it takes time to mature; and it explores the whole world of
      its surroundings in its constant search for nutriment: it is then that
      existence is in itself an ever fresh delight, and all things sparkle with
      the charm of novelty. </i>

      statement is not quite correct. The weight of the brain increases rapidly
      up to the seventh year, more slowly between the sixteenth and the
      twentieth year, still more slowly till between thirty and forty years of
      age, when it attains its maximum. At each decennial period after this, it
      is supposed to decrease in weight on the average, an ounce for every ten
      years.] </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why the years of childhood are like a long poem. For the function
      of poetry, as of all art, is to grasp the Idea<i>&mdash;in the Platonic
      sense; in other words, to apprehend a particular object in such a way as
      to perceive its essential nature, the characteristics it has in common
      with all other objects of the same kind; so that a single object appears
      as the representative of a class, and the results of one experience hold
      good for a thousand. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be thought that my remarks are opposed to fact, and that the child
      is never occupied with anything beyond the individual objects or events
      which are presented to it from time to time, and then only in so far as
      they interest and excite its will for the moment; but this is not really
      the case. In those early years, life&mdash;in the full meaning of the
      word, is something so new and fresh, and its sensations are so keen and
      unblunted by repetition, that, in the midst of all its pursuits and
      without any clear consciousness of what it is doing, the child is always
      silently occupied in grasping the nature of life itself,&mdash;in arriving
      at its fundamental character and general outline by means of separate
      scenes and experiences; or, to use Spinoza's phraseology, the child is
      learning to see the things and persons about it sub specie aeternitatis<i>,&mdash;as
      particular manifestations of universal law. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger we are, then, the more does every individual object represent
      for us the whole class to which it belongs; but as the years increase,
      this becomes less and less the case. That is the reason why youthful
      impressions are so different from those of old age. And that it also why
      the slight knowledge and experience gained in childhood and youth
      afterwards come to stand as the permanent rubric, or heading, for all the
      knowledge acquired in later life,&mdash;those early forms of knowledge
      passing into categories, as it were, under which the results of subsequent
      experience are classified; though a clear consciousness of what is being
      done, does not always attend upon the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the earliest years of a man's life lay the foundation of his
      view of the world, whether it be shallow or deep; and although this view
      may be extended and perfected later on, it is not materially altered. It
      is an effect of this purely objective and therefore poetical view of the
      world,&mdash;essential to the period of childhood and promoted by the as
      yet undeveloped state of the volitional energy&mdash;that, as children, we
      are concerned much more with the acquisition of pure knowledge than with
      exercising the power of will. Hence that grave, fixed look observable in
      so many children, of which Raphael makes such a happy use in his depiction
      of cherubs, especially in the picture of the Sistine Madonna<i>. The years
      of childhood are thus rendered so full of bliss that the memory of them is
      always coupled with longing and regret. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      While we thus eagerly apply ourselves to learning the outward aspect of
      things, as the primitive method of understanding the objects about us,
      education aims at instilling into us ideas<i>. But ideas furnish no
      information as to the real and essential nature of objects, which, as the
      foundation and true content of all knowledge, can be reached only by the
      process called </i>intuition<i>. This is a kind of knowledge which can in
      no wise be instilled into us from without; we must arrive at it by and for
      ourselves. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence a man's intellectual as well as his moral qualities proceed from the
      depths of his own nature, and are not the result of external influences;
      and no educational scheme&mdash;of Pestalozzi, or of any one else&mdash;can
      turn a born simpleton into a man of sense. The thing is impossible! He was
      born a simpleton, and a simpleton he will die.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the depth and intensity of this early intuitive knowledge of the
      external world that explain why the experiences of childhood take such a
      firm hold on the memory. When we were young, we were completely absorbed
      in our immediate surroundings; there was nothing to distract our attention
      from them; we looked upon the objects about us as though they were the
      only ones of their kind, as though, indeed, nothing else existed at all.
      Later on, when we come to find out how many things there are in the world,
      this primitive state of mind vanishes, and with it our patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said elsewhere<a href="#linknote-60" name="linknoteref-60"
      id="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> that the world, considered as object<i>,&mdash;in
      other words, as it is </i>presented<i> to us objectively,&mdash;wears in
      general a pleasing aspect; but that in the world, considered as </i>subject<i>,&mdash;that
      is, in regard to its inner nature, which is </i>will<i>,&mdash;pain and
      trouble predominate. I may be allowed to express the matter, briefly,
      thus: </i>the world is glorious to look at, but dreadful in reality<i>.

      Vorstellung<i>, Bk. II. c. 31, p. 426-7 (4th Edit.), to which the reader
      is referred for a detailed explanation of my meaning.] </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, we find that, in the years of childhood, the world is much
      better known to us on its outer or objective side, namely, as the
      presentation of will, than on the side of its inner nature, namely, as the
      will itself. Since the objective side wears a pleasing aspect, and the
      inner or subjective side, with its tale of horror, remains as yet unknown,
      the youth, as his intelligence develops, takes all the forms of beauty
      that he sees, in nature and in art, for so many objects of blissful
      existence; they are so beautiful to the outward eye that, on their inner
      side, they must, he thinks, be much more beautiful still. So the world
      lies before him like another Eden; and this is the Arcadia in which we are
      all born.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, this state of mind gives birth to a thirst for real life&mdash;the
      impulse to do and suffer&mdash;which drives a man forth into the
      hurly-burly of the world. There he learns the other side of existence&mdash;the
      inner side, the will, which is thwarted at every step. Then comes the
      great period of disillusion, a period of very gradual growth; but once it
      has fairly begun, a man will tell you that he has got over all his false
      notions&mdash;l'âge des illusions est passé<i>; and yet the process is
      only beginning, and it goes on extending its sway and applying more and
      more to the whole of life. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      So it may be said that in childhood, life looks like the scenery in a
      theatre, as you view it from a distance; and that in old age it is like
      the same scenery when you come up quite close to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, lastly, there is another circumstance that contributes to the
      happiness of childhood. As spring commences, the young leaves on the trees
      are similar in color and much the same in shape; and in the first years of
      life we all resemble one another and harmonize very well. But with puberty
      divergence begins; and, like the radii of a circle, we go further and
      further apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of youth, which forms the remainder of this earlier half of our
      existence&mdash;and how many advantages it has over the later half!&mdash;is
      troubled and made miserable by the pursuit of happiness, as though there
      were no doubt that it can be met with somewhere in life,&mdash;a hope that
      always ends in failure and leads to discontent. An illusory image of some
      vague future bliss&mdash;born of a dream and shaped by fancy&mdash;floats
      before our eyes; and we search for the reality in vain. So it is that the
      young man is generally dissatisfied with the position in which he finds
      himself, whatever it may be; he ascribes his disappointment solely to the
      state of things that meets him on his first introduction to life, when he
      had expected something very different; whereas it is only the vanity and
      wretchedness of human life everywhere that he is now for the first time
      experiencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a great advantage to a young man if his early training could
      eradicate the idea that the world has a great deal to offer him. But the
      usual result of education is to strengthen this delusion; and our first
      ideas of life are generally taken from fiction rather than from fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bright dawn of our youthful days, the poetry of life spreads out a
      gorgeous vision before us, and we torture ourselves by longing to see it
      realized. We might as well wish to grasp the rainbow! The youth expects
      his career to be like an interesting romance; and there lies the germ of
      that disappointment which I have been describing.<a href="#linknote-61"
      name="linknoteref-61" id="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> What lends a
      charm to all these visions is just the fact that they are visionary and
      not real, and that in contemplating them we are in the sphere of pure
      knowledge, which is sufficient in itself and free from the noise and
      struggle of life. To try and realize those visions is to make them an
      object of will<i>&mdash;a process which always involves pain.<a

    </p>
    <p>
      If the chief feature of the earlier half of life is a never-satisfied
      longing after happiness, the later half is characterized by the dread of
      misfortune. For, as we advance in years, it becomes in a greater or less
      degree clear that all happiness is chimerical in its nature, and that pain
      alone is real. Accordingly, in later years, we, or, at least, the more
      prudent amongst us, are more intent upon eliminating what is painful from
      our lives and making our position secure, than on the pursuit of positive
      pleasure. I may observe, by the way, that in old age, we are better able
      to prevent misfortunes from coming, and in youth better able to bear them
      when they come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my young days, I was always pleased to hear a ring at my door: ah!
      thought I, now for something pleasant. But in later life my feelings on
      such occasions were rather akin to dismay than to pleasure: heaven help
      me! thought I, what am I to do? A similar revulsion of feeling in regard
      to the world of men takes place in all persons of any talent or
      distinction. For that very reason they cannot be said properly to belong
      to the world; in a greater or less degree, according to the extent of
      their superiority, they stand alone. In their youth they have a sense of
      being abandoned by the world; but later on, they feel as though they had
      escaped it. The earlier feeling is an unpleasant one, and rests upon
      ignorance; the second is pleasurable&mdash;for in the meantime they have
      come to know what the world is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequence of this is that, as compared with the earlier, the later
      half of life, like the second part of a musical period, has less of
      passionate longing and more restfulness about it. And why is this the case
      Simply because, in youth, a man fancies that there is a prodigious amount
      of happiness and pleasure to be had in the world, only that it is
      difficult to come by it; whereas, when he becomes old, he knows that there
      is nothing of the kind; he makes his mind completely at ease on the
      matter, enjoys the present hour as well as he can, and even takes a
      pleasure in trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief result gained by experience of life is clearness of view<i>.
      This is what distinguishes the man of mature age, and makes the world wear
      such a different aspect from that which it presented in his youth or
      boyhood. It is only then that he sees things quite plain, and takes them
      for that which they really are: while in earlier years he saw a
      phantom-world, put together out of the whims and crotchets of his own
      mind, inherited prejudice and strange delusion: the real world was hidden
      from him, or the vision of it distorted. The first thing that experience
      finds to do is to free us from the phantoms of the brain&mdash;those false
      notions that have been put into us in youth. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent their entrance at all would, of course, be the best form of
      education, even though it were only negative in aim: but it would be a
      task full of difficulty. At first the child's horizon would have to be
      limited as much as possible, and yet within that limited sphere none but
      clear and correct notions would have to be given; only after the child had
      properly appreciated everything within it, might the sphere be gradually
      enlarged; care being always taken that nothing was left obscure, or half
      or wrongly understood. The consequence of this training would be that the
      child's notions of men and things would always be limited and simple in
      their character; but, on the other hand, they would be clear and correct,
      and only need to be extended, not to be rectified. The same line might be
      pursued on into the period of youth. This method of education would lay
      special stress upon the prohibition of novel reading; and the place of
      novels would be taken by suitable biographical literature&mdash;the life
      of Franklin, for instance, or Moritz' Anton Reiser<i>.<a

      In our early days we fancy that the leading events in our life, and the
      persons who are going to play an important part in it, will make their
      entrance to the sound of drums and trumpets; but when, in old age, we look
      back, we find that they all came in quite quietly, slipped in, as it were,

      From the point of view we have been taking up until now, life may be
      compared to a piece of embroidery, of which, during the first half of his
      time, a man gets a sight of the right side, and during the second half, of
      the wrong. The wrong side is not so pretty as the right, but it is more
      instructive; it shows the way in which the threads have been worked
      together.

      Intellectual superiority, even if it is of the highest kind, will not
      secure for a man a preponderating place in conversation until after he is
      forty years of age. For age and experience, though they can never be a
      substitute for intellectual talent, may far outweigh it; and even in a
      person of the meanest capacity, they give a certain counterpoise to the
      power of an extremely intellectual man, so long as the latter is young. Of
      course I allude here to personal superiority, not to the place a man may
      gain by his works.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on passing his fortieth year, any man of the slightest power of mind&mdash;any
      man, that is, who has more than the sorry share of intellect with which
      Nature has endowed five-sixths of mankind&mdash;will hardly fail to show
      some trace of misanthropy. For, as is natural, he has by that time
      inferred other people's character from an examination of his own; with the
      result that he has been gradually disappointed to find that in the
      qualities of the head or in those of the heart&mdash;and usually in both&mdash;he
      reaches a level to which they do not attain; so he gladly avoids having
      anything more to do with them. For it may be said, in general, that every
      man will love or hate solitude&mdash;in other Words, his own society&mdash;just
      in proportion as he is worth anything in himself. Kant has some remarks
      upon this kind of misanthropy in his Critique of the Faculty of Judgment<i>.<a

      In a young man, it is a bad sign, as well from an intellectual as from a
      moral point of view, if he is precocious in understanding the ways of the
      world, and in adapting himself to its pursuits; if he at once knows how to
      deal with men, and enters upon life, as it were, fully prepared. It argues
      a vulgar nature. On the other hand, to be surprised and astonished at the
      way people act, and to be clumsy and cross-grained in having to do with
      them, indicates a character of the nobler sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheerfulness and vivacity of youth are partly due to the fact that,
      when we are ascending the hill of life, death is not visible: it lies down
      at the bottom of the other side. But once we have crossed the top of the
      hill, death comes in view&mdash;death&mdash;which, until then, was known
      to us only by hearsay. This makes our spirits droop, for at the same time
      we begin to feel that our vital powers are on the ebb. A grave seriousness
      now takes the place of that early extravagance of spirit; and the change
      is noticeable even in the expression of a man's face. As long as we are
      young, people may tell us what they please! we look upon life as endless
      and use our time recklessly; but the older we become, the more we practice
      economy. For towards the close of life, every day we live gives us the
      same kind of sensation as the criminal experiences at every step on his
      way to be tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the standpoint of youth, life seems to stretch away into an endless
      future; from the standpoint of old age, to go back but a little way into
      the past; so that, at the beginning, life presents us with a picture in
      which the objects appear a great way off, as though we had reversed our
      telescope; while in the end everything seems so close. To see how short
      life is, a man must have grown old, that is to say, he must have lived
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, as the years increase, things look smaller, one and
      all; and Life, which had so firm and stable a base in the days of our
      youth, now seems nothing but a rapid flight of moments, every one of them
      illusory: we have come to see that the whole world is vanity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Time itself seems to go at a much slower pace when we are young; so that
      not only is the first quarter of life the happiest, it is also the longest
      of all; it leaves more memories behind it. If a man were put to it, he
      could tell you more out of the first quarter of his life than out of two
      of the remaining periods. Nay, in the spring of life, as in the spring of
      the year, the days reach a length that is positively tiresome; but in the
      autumn, whether of the year or of life, though they are short, they are
      more genial and uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why is it that to an old man his past life appears so short? For this
      reason: his memory is short; and so he fancies that his life has been
      short too. He no longer remembers the insignificant parts of it, and much
      that was unpleasant is now forgotten; how little, then, there is left!
      For, in general, a man's memory is as imperfect as his intellect; and he
      must make a practice of reflecting upon the lessons he has learned and the
      events he has experienced, if he does not want them both to sink gradually
      into the gulf of oblivion. Now, we are unaccustomed to reflect upon
      matters of no importance, or, as a rule, upon things that we have found
      disagreeable, and yet that is necessary if the memory of them is to be
      preserved. But the class of things that may be called insignificant is
      continually receiving fresh additions: much that wears an air of
      importance at first, gradually becomes of no consequence at all from the
      fact of its frequent repetition; so that in the end we actually lose count
      of the number of times it happens. Hence we are better able to remember
      the events of our early than of our later years. The longer we live, the
      fewer are the things that we can call important or significant enough to
      deserve further consideration, and by this alone can they be fixed in the
      memory; in other words, they are forgotten as soon as they are past. Thus
      it is that time runs on, leaving always fewer traces of its passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, if disagreeable things have happened to us, we do not care to
      ruminate upon them, least of all when they touch our vanity, as is usually
      the case; for few misfortunes fall upon us for which we can be held
      entirely blameless. So people are very ready to forget many things that
      are disagreeable, as well as many that are unimportant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from this double cause that our memory is so short; and a man's
      recollection of what has happened always becomes proportionately shorter,
      the more things that have occupied him in life. The things we did in years
      gone by, the events that happened long ago, are like those objects on the
      coast which, to the seafarer on his outward voyage, become smaller every
      minute, more unrecognizable and harder to distinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, it sometimes happens that memory and imagination will call up some
      long past scene as vividly as if it had occurred only yesterday; so that
      the event in question seems to stand very near to the present time. The
      reason of this is that it is impossible to call up all the intervening
      period in the same vivid way, as there is no one figure pervading it which
      can be taken in at a glance; and besides, most of the things that happened
      in that period are forgotten, and all that remains of it is the general
      knowledge that we have lived through it&mdash;a mere notion of abstract
      existence, not a direct vision of some particular experience. It is this
      that causes some single event of long ago to appear as though it took
      place but yesterday: the intervening time vanishes, and the whole of life
      looks incredibly short. Nay, there are occasional moments in old age when
      we can scarcely believe that we are so advanced in years, or that the long
      past lying behind us has had any real existence&mdash;a feeling which is
      mainly due to the circumstance that the present always seems fixed and
      immovable as we look at it. These and similar mental phenomena are
      ultimately to be traced to the fact that it is not our nature in itself,
      but only the outward presentation of it, that lies in time, and that the
      present is the point of contact between the world as subject and the world
      as object.<a href="#linknote-64" name="linknoteref-64" id="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a>

      necessary for the objectification of the will, for the will as presented
      in the passing phenomena of the world. Time is thus definable as the
      condition of change, and the present time as the only point of contact

    </p>
    <p>
      Again, why is it that in youth we can see no end to the years that seem to
      lie before us? Because we are obliged to find room for all the things we
      hope to attain in life. We cram the years so full of projects that if we
      were to try and carry them all out, death would come prematurely though we
      reached the age of Methuselah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason why life looks so long when we are young, is that we are
      apt to measure its length by the few years we have already lived. In those
      early years things are new to us, and so they appear important; we dwell
      upon them after they have happened and often call them to mind; and thus
      in youth life seems replete with incident, and therefore of long duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes we credit ourselves with a longing to be in some distant spot,
      whereas, in truth, we are only longing to have the time back again which
      we spent there&mdash;days when we were younger and fresher than we are
      now. In those moments Time mocks us by wearing the mask of space; and if
      we travel to the spot, we can see how much we have been deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two ways of reaching a great age, both of which presuppose a
      sound constitution as a conditio sine quâ non<i>. They may be illustrated
      by two lamps, one of which burns a long time with very little oil, because
      it has a very thin wick; and the other just as long, though it has a very
      thick one, because there is plenty of oil to feed it. Here, the oil is the
      vital energy, and the difference in the wick is the manifold way in which
      the vital energy is used. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to our thirty-sixth year, we may be compared, in respect of the way in
      which we use our vital energy, to people who live on the interest of their
      money: what they spend to-day, they have again to-morrow. But from the age
      of thirty-six onwards, our position is like that of the investor who
      begins to entrench upon his capital. At first he hardly notices any
      difference at all, as the greater part of his expenses is covered by the
      interest of his securities; and if the deficit is but slight, he pays no
      attention to it. But the deficit goes on increasing, until he awakes to
      the fact that it is becoming more serious every day: his position becomes
      less and less secure, and he feels himself growing poorer and poorer,
      while he has no expectation of this drain upon his resources coming to an
      end. His fall from wealth to poverty becomes faster every moment&mdash;like
      the fall of a solid body in space, until at last he has absolutely nothing
      left. A man is truly in a woeful plight if both the terms of this
      comparison&mdash;his vital energy and his wealth&mdash;really begin to
      melt away at one and the same time. It is the dread of this calamity that
      makes love of possession increase with age.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, at the beginning of life, in the years before we attain
      majority, and for some little time afterwards&mdash;the state of our vital
      energy puts us on a level with those who each year lay by a part of their
      interest and add it to their capital: in other words, not only does their
      interest come in regularly, but the capital is constantly receiving
      additions. This happy condition of affairs is sometimes brought about&mdash;with
      health as with money&mdash;under the watchful care of some honest
      guardian. O happy youth, and sad old age!

      Nevertheless, a man should economize his strength even when he is young.
      Aristotle<a href="#linknote-65" name="linknoteref-65" id="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a>
      observes that amongst those who were victors at Olympia only two or three
      gained a prize at two different periods, once in boyhood and then again
      when they came to be men; and the reason of this was that the premature
      efforts which the training involved, so completely exhausted their powers
      that they failed to last on into manhood. As this is true of muscular, so
      it is still more true of nervous energy, of which all intellectual
      achievements are the manifestation. Hence, those infant prodigies&mdash;ingenia
      praecoda<i>&mdash;the fruit of a hot-house education, who surprise us by
      their cleverness as children, afterwards turn out very ordinary folk. Nay,
      the manner in which boys are forced into an early acquaintance with the
      ancient tongues may, perhaps, be to blame for the dullness and lack of
      judgment which distinguish so many learned persons. </i>

    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that almost every man's character seems to be specially suited
      to some one period of life, so that on reaching it the man is at his best.
      Some people are charming so long as they are young, and afterwards there
      is nothing attractive about them; others are vigorous and active in
      manhood, and then lose all the value they possess as they advance in
      years; many appear to best advantage in old age, when their character
      assumes a gentler tone, as becomes men who have seen the world and take
      life easily. This is often the case with the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      This peculiarity must be due to the fact that the man's character has
      something in it akin to the qualities of youth or manhood or old age&mdash;something
      which accords with one or another of these periods of life, or perhaps
      acts as a corrective to its special failings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mariner observes the progress he makes only by the way in which
      objects on the coast fade away into the distance and apparently decrease
      in size. In the same way a man becomes conscious that he is advancing in
      years when he finds that people older than himself begin to seem young to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has already been remarked that the older a man becomes, the fewer are
      the traces left in his mind by all that he sees, does or experiences, and
      the cause of this has been explained. There is thus a sense in which it
      may be said that it is only in youth that a man lives with a full degree
      of consciousness, and that he is only half alive when he is old. As the
      years advance, his consciousness of what goes on about him dwindles, and
      the things of life hurry by without making any impression upon him, just
      as none is made by a work of art seen for the thousandth time. A man does
      what his hand finds to do, and afterwards he does not know whether he has
      done it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      As life becomes more and more unconscious, the nearer it approaches the
      point at which all consciousness ceases, the course of time itself seems
      to increase in rapidity. In childhood all the things and circumstances of
      life are novel; and that is sufficient to awake us to the full
      consciousness of existence: hence, at that age, the day seems of such
      immense length. The same thing happens when we are traveling: one month
      seems longer then than four spent at home. Still, though time seems to
      last longer when we are young or on a journey, the sense of novelty does
      not prevent it from now and then in reality hanging heavily upon our hands
      under both these circumstances, at any rate more than is the case when we
      are old or staying at home. But the intellect gradually becomes so rubbed
      down and blunted by long habituation to such impressions that things have
      a constant tendency to produce less and less impression upon us as they
      pass by; and this makes time seem increasingly less important, and
      therefore shorter in duration: the hours of the boy are longer than the
      days of the old man. Accordingly, time goes faster and faster the longer
      we live, like a ball rolling down a hill. Or, to take another example: as
      in a revolving disc, the further a point lies from the centre, the more
      rapid is its rate of progression, so it is in the wheel of life; the
      further you stand from the beginning, the faster time moves for you. Hence
      it may be said that as far as concerns the immediate sensation that time
      makes upon our minds, the length of any given year is in direct proportion
      to the number of times it will divide our whole life: for instance, at the
      age of fifty the year appears to us only one-tenth as long as it did at
      the age of five.
    </p>
    <p>
      This variation in the rate at which time appears to move, exercises a most
      decided influence upon the whole nature of our existence at every period
      of it. First of all, it causes childhood&mdash;even though it embrace only
      a span of fifteen years&mdash;to seem the longest period of life, and
      therefore the richest in reminiscences. Next, it brings it about that a
      man is apt to be bored just in proportion as he is young. Consider, for
      instance, that constant need of occupation&mdash;whether it is work or
      play&mdash;that is shown by children: if they come to an end of both work
      and play, a terrible feeling of boredom ensues. Even in youth people are
      by no means free from this tendency, and dread the hours when they have
      nothing to do. As manhood approaches, boredom disappears; and old men find
      the time too short when their days fly past them like arrows from a bow.
      Of course, I must be understood to speak of men<i>, not of decrepit </i>brutes<i>.
      With this increased rapidity of time, boredom mostly passes away as we
      advance in life; and as the passions with all their attendant pain are
      then laid asleep, the burden of life is, on the whole, appreciably lighter
      in later years than in youth, provided, of course, that health remains. So
      it is that the period immediately preceding the weakness and troubles of
      old age, receives the name of a man's </i>best years<i>. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      That may be a true appellation, in view of the comfortable feeling which
      those years bring; but for all that the years of youth, when our
      consciousness is lively and open to every sort of impression, have this
      privilege&mdash;that then the seeds are sown and the buds come forth; it
      is the springtime of the mind. Deep truths may be perceived, but can never
      be excogitated&mdash;that is to say, the first knowledge of them is
      immediate, called forth by some momentary impression. This knowledge is of
      such a kind as to be attainable only when the impressions are strong,
      lively and deep; and if we are to be acquainted with deep truths,
      everything depends upon a proper use of our early years. In later life, we
      may be better able to work upon other people,&mdash;upon the world,
      because our natures are then finished and rounded off, and no more a prey
      to fresh views; but then the world is less able to work upon us. These are
      the years of action and achievement; while youth is the time for forming
      fundamental conceptions, and laying down the ground-work of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In youth it is the outward aspect of things that most engages us; while in
      age, thought or reflection is the predominating quality of the mind.
      Hence, youth is the time for poetry, and age is more inclined to
      philosophy. In practical affairs it is the same: a man shapes his
      resolutions in youth more by the impression that the outward world makes
      upon him; whereas, when he is old, it is thought that determines his
      actions. This is partly to be explained by the fact that it is only when a
      man is old that the results of outward observation are present in
      sufficient numbers to allow of their being classified according to the
      ideas they represent,&mdash;a process which in its turn causes those ideas
      to be more fully understood in all their bearings, and the exact value and
      amount of trust to be placed in them, fixed and determined; while at the
      same time he has grown accustomed to the impressions produced by the
      various phenomena of life, and their effects on him are no longer what
      they were. Contrarily, in youth, the impressions that things make, that is
      to say, the outward aspects of life, are so overpoweringly strong,
      especially in the case of people of lively and imaginative disposition,
      that they view the world like a picture; and their chief concern is the
      figure they cut in it, the appearance they present; nay, they are unaware
      of the extent to which this is the case. It is a quality of mind that
      shows itself&mdash;if in no other way&mdash;in that personal vanity, and
      that love of fine clothes, which distinguish young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt that the intellectual powers are most capable of
      enduring great and sustained efforts in youth, up to the age of
      thirty-five at latest; from which period their strength begins to decline,
      though very gradually. Still, the later years of life, and even old age
      itself, are not without their intellectual compensation. It is only then
      that a man can be said to be really rich in experience or in learning; he
      has then had time and opportunity enough to enable him to see and think
      over life from all its sides; he has been able to compare one thing with
      another, and to discover points of contact and connecting links, so that
      only then are the true relations of things rightly understood. Further, in
      old age there comes an increased depth in the knowledge that was acquired
      in youth; a man has now many more illustrations of any ideas he may have
      attained; things which he thought he knew when he was young, he now knows
      in reality. And besides, his range of knowledge is wider; and in whatever
      direction it extends, it is thorough, and therefore formed into a
      consistent and connected whole; whereas in youth knowledge is always
      defective and fragmentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete and adequate notion of life can never be attained by any one
      who does not reach old age; for it is only the old man who sees life whole
      and knows its natural course; it is only he who is acquainted&mdash;and
      this is most important&mdash;not only with its entrance, like the rest of
      mankind, but with its exit too; so that he alone has a full sense of its
      utter vanity; whilst the others never cease to labor under the false
      notion that everything will come right in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, there is more conceptive power in youth, and at that
      time of life a man can make more out of the little that he knows. In age,
      judgment, penetration and thoroughness predominate. Youth is the time for
      amassing the material for a knowledge of the world that shall be
      distinctive and peculiar,&mdash;for an original view of life, in other
      words, the legacy that a man of genius leaves to his fellow-men; it is,
      however, only in later years that he becomes master of his material.
      Accordingly it will be found that, as a rule, a great writer gives his
      best work to the world when he is about fifty years of age. But though the
      tree of knowledge must reach its full height before it can bear fruit, the
      roots of it lie in youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every generation, no matter how paltry its character, thinks itself much
      wiser than the one immediately preceding it, let alone those that are more
      remote. It is just the same with the different periods in a man's life;
      and yet often, in the one case no less than in the other, it is a mistaken
      opinion. In the years of physical growth, when our powers of mind and our
      stores of knowledge are receiving daily additions, it becomes a habit for
      to-day to look down with contempt upon yesterday. The habit strikes root,
      and remains even after the intellectual powers have begun to decline,&mdash;when
      to-day should rather look up with respect to yesterday. So it is that we
      often unduly depreciate the achievements as well as the judgments of our
      youth. This seems the place for making the general observation, that,
      although in its main qualities a man's intellect<i> or </i>head<i>, as
      well as his </i>character<i> or </i>heart<i>, is innate, yet the former is
      by no means so unalterable in its nature as the latter. The fact is that
      the intellect is subject to very many transformations, which, as a rule,
      do not fail to make their actual appearance; and this is so, partly
      because the intellect has a deep foundation in the physique, and partly
      because the material with which it deals is given in experience. And so,
      from a physical point of view, we find that if a man has any peculiar
      power, it first gradually increases in strength until it reaches its acme,
      after which it enters upon a path of slow decadence, until it ends in
      imbecility. But, on the other hand, we must not lose sight of the fact
      that the material which gives employment to a man's powers and keeps them
      in activity,&mdash;the subject-matter of thought and knowledge,
      experience, intellectual attainments, the practice of seeing to the bottom
      of things, and so a perfect mental vision, form in themselves a mass which
      continues to increase in size, until the time comes when weakness shows
      itself, and the man's powers suddenly fail. The way in which these two
      distinguishable elements combine in the same nature,&mdash;the one
      absolutely unalterable, and the other subject to change in two directions
      opposed to each other&mdash;explains the variety of mental attitude and
      the dissimilarity of value which attach to a man at different periods of
      life. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The same truth may be more broadly expressed by saying that the first
      forty years of life furnish the text, while the remaining thirty supply
      the commentary; and that without the commentary we are unable to
      understand aright the true sense and coherence of the text, together with
      the moral it contains and all the subtle application of which it admits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the close of life, much the same thing happens as at the end of a
      bal masqué<i>&mdash;the masks are taken off. Then you can see who the
      people really are, with whom you have come into contact in your passage
      through the world. For by the end of life characters have come out in
      their true light, actions have borne fruit, achievements have been rightly
      appreciated, and all shams have fallen to pieces. For this, Time was in
      every case requisite. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most curious fact is that it is also only towards the close of
      life than a man really recognizes and understands his own true self,&mdash;the
      aims and objects he has followed in life, more especially the kind of
      relation in which he has stood to other people and to the world. It will
      often happen that as a result of this knowledge, a man will have to assign
      himself a lower place than he formerly thought was his due. But there are
      exceptions to this rule; and it will occasionally be the case that he will
      take a higher position than he had before. This will be owing to the fact
      that he had no adequate notion of the baseness<i> of the world, and that
      he set up a higher aim for himself than was followed by the rest of
      mankind. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of life shows a man the stuff of which he is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is customary to call youth the happy, and age the sad part of life.
      This would be true if it were the passions that made a man happy. Youth is
      swayed to and fro by them; and they give a great deal of pain and little
      pleasure. In age the passions cool and leave a man at rest, and then
      forthwith his mind takes a contemplative tone; the intellect is set free
      and attains the upper hand. And since, in itself, intellect is beyond the
      range of pain, and man feels happy just in so far as his intellect is the
      predominating part of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need only be remembered that all pleasure is negative, and that pain is
      positive in its nature, in order to see that the passions can never be a
      source of happiness, and that age is not the less to be envied on the
      ground that many pleasures are denied it. For every sort of pleasure is
      never anything more than the quietive of some need or longing; and that
      pleasure should come to an end as soon as the need ceases, is no more a
      subject of complaint than that a man cannot go on eating after he has had
      his dinner, or fall asleep again after a good night's rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far from youth being the happiest period of life, there is much more
      truth in the remark made by Plato, at the beginning of the Republic<i>,
      that the prize should rather be given to old age, because then at last a
      man is freed from the animal passion which has hitherto never ceased to
      disquiet him. Nay, it may even be said that the countless and manifold
      humors which have their source in this passion, and the emotions that
      spring from it, produce a mild state of madness; and this lasts as long as
      the man is subject to the spell of the impulse&mdash;this evil spirit, as
      it were, of which there is no riddance&mdash;so that he never really
      becomes a reasonable being until the passion is extinguished. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that, in general, and apart from individual
      circumstances and particular dispositions, youth is marked by a certain
      melancholy and sadness, while genial sentiments attach to old age; and the
      reason for this is nothing but the fact that the young man is still under
      the service, nay, the forced labor, imposed by that evil spirit, which
      scarcely ever leaves him a moment to himself. To this source may be
      traced, directly or indirectly, almost all and every ill that befalls or
      menaces mankind. The old man is genial and cheerful because, after long
      lying in the bonds of passion, he can now move about in freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, it should not be forgotten that, when this passion is extinguished,
      the true kernel of life is gone, and nothing remains but the hollow shell;
      or, from another point of view, life then becomes like a comedy, which,
      begun by real actors, is continued and brought to an end by automata
      dressed in their clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      However that may be, youth is the period of unrest, and age of repose; and
      from that very circumstance, the relative degree of pleasure belonging to
      each may be inferred. The child stretches out its little hands in the
      eager desire to seize all the pretty things that meet its sight, charmed
      by the world because all its senses are still so young and fresh. Much the
      same thing happens with the youth, and he displays greater energy in his
      quest. He, too, is charmed by all the pretty things and the many pleasing
      shapes that surround him; and forthwith his imagination conjures up
      pleasures which the world can never realize. So he is filled with an
      ardent desire for he knows not what delights&mdash;robbing him of all rest
      and making happiness impossible. But when old age is reached, all this is
      over and done with, partly because the blood runs cooler and the senses
      are no longer so easily allured; partly because experience has shown the
      true value of things and the futility of pleasure, whereby illusion has
      been gradually dispelled, and the strange fancies and prejudices which
      previously concealed or distorted a free and true view of the world, have
      been dissipated and put to flight; with the result that a man can now get
      a juster and clearer view, and see things as they are, and also in a
      measure attain more or less insight into the nullity of all things on this
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this that gives almost every old man, no matter how ordinary his
      faculties may be, a certain tincture of wisdom, which distinguishes him
      from the young. But the chief result of all this change is the peace of
      mind that ensues&mdash;a great element in happiness, and, in fact, the
      condition and essence of it. While the young man fancies that there is a
      vast amount of good things in the world, if he could only come at them,
      the old man is steeped in the truth of the Preacher's words, that all
      things are vanity<i>&mdash;knowing that, however gilded the shell, the nut
      is hollow. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In these later years, and not before, a man comes to a true appreciation
      of Horace's maxim: Nil admirari.<i> He is directly and sincerely convinced
      of the vanity of everything and that all the glories of the world are as
      nothing: his illusions are gone. He is no more beset with the idea that
      there is any particular amount of happiness anywhere, in the palace or in
      the cottage, any more than he himself enjoys when he is free from bodily
      or mental pain. The worldly distinctions of great and small, high and low,
      exist for him no longer; and in this blissful state of mind the old man
      may look down with a smile upon all false notions. He is completely
      undeceived, and knows that whatever may be done to adorn human life and
      deck it out in finery, its paltry character will soon show through the
      glitter of its surroundings; and that, paint and be jewel it as one may,
      it remains everywhere much the same,&mdash;an existence which has no true
      value except in freedom from pain, and is never to be estimated by the
      presence of pleasure, let alone, then, of display.<a href="#linknote-66"

    </p>
    <p>
      Disillusion is the chief characteristic of old age; for by that time the
      fictions are gone which gave life its charm and spurred on the mind to
      activity; the splendors of the world have been proved null and vain; its
      pomp, grandeur and magnificence are faded. A man has then found out that
      behind most of the things he wants, and most of the pleasures he longs
      for, there is very little after all; and so he comes by degrees to see
      that our existence is all empty and void. It is only when he is seventy
      years old that he quite understands the first words of the Preacher; and
      this again explains why it is that old men are sometimes fretful and
      morose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often said that the common lot of old age is disease and weariness
      of life. Disease is by no means essential to old age; especially where a
      really long span of years is to be attained; for as life goes on, the
      conditions of health and disorder tend to increase&mdash;crescente vita,
      crescit sanitas et morbus<i>. And as far as weariness or boredom is
      concerned, I have stated above why old age is even less exposed to that
      form of evil than youth. Nor is boredom by any means to be taken as a
      necessary accompaniment of that solitude, which, for reasons that do not
      require to be explained, old age certainly cannot escape; it is rather the
      fate that awaits those who have never known any other pleasures but the
      gratification of the senses and the delights of society&mdash;who have
      left their minds unenlightened and their faculties unused. It is quite
      true that the intellectual faculties decline with the approach of old age;
      but where they were originally strong, there will always be enough left to
      combat the onslaught of boredom. And then again, as I have said,
      experience, knowledge, reflection, and skill in dealing with men, combine
      to give an old man an increasingly accurate insight into the ways of the
      world; his judgment becomes keen and he attains a coherent view of life:
      his mental vision embraces a wider range. Constantly finding new uses for
      his stores of knowledge and adding to them at every opportunity, he
      maintains uninterrupted that inward process of self-education, which gives
      employment and satisfaction to the mind, and thus forms the due reward of
      all its efforts. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      All this serves in some measure as a compensation for decreased
      intellectual power. And besides, Time, as I have remarked, seems to go
      much more quickly when we are advanced in years; and this is in itself a
      preventive of boredom. There is no great harm in the fact that a man's
      bodily strength decreases in old age, unless, indeed, he requires it to
      make a living. To be poor when one is old, is a great misfortune. If a man
      is secure from that, and retains his health, old age may be a very
      passable time of life. Its chief necessity is to be comfortable and well
      off; and, in consequence, money is then prized more than ever, because it
      is a substitute for failing strength. Deserted by Venus, the old man likes
      to turn to Bacchus to make him merry. In the place of wanting to see
      things, to travel and learn, comes the desire to speak and teach. It is a
      piece of good fortune if the old man retains some of his love of study or
      of music or of the theatre,&mdash;if, in general, he is still somewhat
      susceptible to the things about him; as is, indeed, the case with some
      people to a very late age. At that time of life, what a man has in himself<i>
      is of greater advantage to him that ever it was before. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt that most people who have never been anything but
      dull and stupid, become more and more of automata as they grow old. They
      have always thought, said and done the same things as their neighbors; and
      nothing that happens now can change their disposition, or make them act
      otherwise. To talk to old people of this kind is like writing on the sand;
      if you produce any impression at all, it is gone almost immediately; old
      age is here nothing but the caput mortuum<i> of life&mdash;all that is
      essential to manhood is gone. There are cases in which nature supplies a
      third set of teeth in old age, thereby apparently demonstrating the fact
      that that period of life is a second childhood. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certainly a very melancholy thing that all a man's faculties tend to
      waste away as he grows old, and at a rate that increases in rapidity: but
      still, this is a necessary, nay, a beneficial arrangement, as otherwise
      death, for which it is a preparation, would be too hard to bear. So the
      greatest boon that follows the attainment of extreme old age is euthanasia<i>,&mdash;an
      easy death, not ushered in by disease, and free from all pain and
      struggle.<a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="noteref-1___"><small>1</small></a>
      For let a man live as long as he may, he is never conscious of any moment
      but the present, one and indivisible; and in those late years the mind
      loses more every day by sheer forgetfulness than ever it gains anew. </i>

    <p>
      The main difference between youth and age will always be that youth looks
      forward to life, and old age to death; and that while the one has a short
      past and a long future before it, the case is just the opposite with the
      other. It is quite true that when a man is old, to die is the only thing
      that awaits him; while if he is young, he may expect to live; and the
      question arises which of the two fates is the more hazardous, and if life
      is not a matter which, on the whole, it is better to have behind one than
      before? Does not the Preacher say: the day of death [is better] than the
      day of one's birth<i>.<a href="#linknote-67" name="linknoteref-67"

      the ultimate standard by which duration of time in regard to all other
      things is measured. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the Vedic Upanishads (Oupnekhat<i>, II.) </i>the natural length<i>
      of human life is put down at one hundred years. And I believe this to be
      right. I have observed, as a matter of fact, that it is only people who
      exceed the age of ninety who attain </i>euthanasia<i>,&mdash;who die, that
      is to say, of no disease, apoplexy or convulsion, and pass away without
      agony of any sort; nay, who sometimes even show no pallor, but expire
      generally in a sitting attitude, and often after a meal,&mdash;or, I may
      say, simply cease to live rather than die. To come to one's end before the
      age of ninety, means to die of disease, in other words, prematurely. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Old Testament (Psalms xc. 10) puts the limit of human life at
      seventy, and if it is very long, at eighty years; and what is more
      noticeable still, Herodotus (i. 32 and iii. 22) says the same thing. But
      this is wrong; and the error is due simply to a rough and superficial
      estimate of the results of daily experience. For if the natural length of
      life were from seventy to eighty years, people would die, about that time,
      of mere old age. Now this is certainly not the case. If they die then,
      they die, like younger people, of disease<i>; and disease is something
      abnormal. Therefore it is not natural to die at that age. It is only when
      they are between ninety and a hundred that people die of old age; die, I
      mean, without suffering from any disease, or showing any special signs of
      their condition, such as a struggle, death-rattle, convulsion, pallor,&mdash;the
      absence of all which constitutes </i>euthanasia<i>. The natural length of
      human life is a hundred years; and in assigning that limit the Upanishads
      are right once more.] </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A man's individual career is not, as Astrology wishes to make out, to be
      predicted from observation of the planets; but the course of human life in
      general, as far as the various periods of it are concerned, may be likened
      to the succession of the planets: so that we may be said to pass under the
      influence of each one of them in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten, Mercury<i> is in the ascendant; and at that age, a youth, like
      this planet, is characterized by extreme mobility within a narrow sphere,
      where trifles have a great effect upon him; but under the guidance of so
      crafty and eloquent a god, he easily makes great progress. </i>Venus<i>
      begins her sway during his twentieth year, and then a man is wholly given
      up to the love of women. At thirty, </i>Mars<i> comes to the front, and he
      is now all energy and strength,&mdash;daring, pugnacious and arrogant.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man reaches the age of forty, he is under the rule of the four
      Asteroids<i>; that is to say, his life has gained something in extension.
      He is frugal; in other words, by the help of </i>Ceres<i>, he favors what
      is useful; he has his own hearth, by the influence of </i>Vesta<i>; </i>Pallas<i>
      has taught him that which is necessary for him to know; and his wife&mdash;his
      </i>Juno<i>&mdash;rules as the mistress of his house. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the age of fifty, Jupiter<i> is the dominant influence. At that
      period a man has outlived most of his contemporaries, and he can feel
      himself superior to the generation about him. He is still in the full
      enjoyment of his strength, and rich in experience and knowledge; and if he
      has any power and position of his own, he is endowed with authority over
      all who stand in his immediate surroundings. He is no more inclined to
      receive orders from others; he wants to take command himself. The work
      most suitable to him now is to guide and rule within his own sphere. This
      is the point where Jupiter culminates, and where the man of fifty years is
      at his best. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes Saturn<i>, at about the age of sixty, a weight as of </i>lead<i>,
      dull and slow:&mdash; </i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead<i>.
Last of all, </i>Uranus<i>; or, as the saying is, a man goes to heaven.
</i></pre>
    <p>
      I cannot find a place for Neptune<i>, as this planet has been very
      thoughtlessly named; because I may not call it as it should be called&mdash;</i>Eros<i>.
      Otherwise I should point out how Beginning and End meet together, and how
      closely and intimately Eros is connected with Death: how Orcus, or
      Amenthes, as the Egyptians called him, is not only the receiver but the
      giver of all things&mdash;[Greek: lambanon kai didous]. Death is the great
      reservoir of Life. Everything comes from Orcus; everything that is alive
      now was once there. Could we but understand the great trick by which that
      is done, all would be clear! </i>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
