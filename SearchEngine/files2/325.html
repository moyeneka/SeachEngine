<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>There is no truth in the rumour that the Imperial Government is
trying to secure from KING ALFONSO an agreement that German
prisoners shall not escape on Sundays or in batches of more than
fifty at a time.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Far better another year of war," said the Bishop of LONDON in a
recent sermon, "than to leave it to the baby in the cradle to do it
over again." Too much importance should not be attached to these
ill-judged reflections on the younger members of the Staff.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In Berlin a crowd of people attempted to do some injury to an
officer on the paltry excuse that he ordered the execution of
thirty people for alleged espionage. The German people have always
been a little jealous of the privileges of the military.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Captain N. BERNIERS, who has just returned to Quebec, reports
that the Eskimos had not heard of the War. We should be the last to
worry Lord NORTHCLIFFE at present, but it certainly looks as if the
Circulation Manager of <i>The Daily Mail</i> has been slacking.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We really think more care should be taken by the authorities to
see that, while waging war on the Continent, they do not forget the
defence of those at home. The fact that Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL and
Mr. HORATIO BOTTOMLEY were away in France at the same time looks
like gross carelessness.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Next to the field of Mars we must pay homage to the forge of
Vulcan," said the KAISER in a recent speech. A stout fellow, this
Vulcan, but as a forger not really in the ALL-HIGHEST'S class.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Taxicabs are to be entitled to charge a shilling for the first
mile. The bus fare for the remainder of the distance will be the
same as heretofore.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is stated that fifty per cent. of the sugar forms have been
filled in wrong. On the other hand a number of our youthful
hedonists are complaining that as far as sugar is concerned their
forms have never been anywhere near filled in.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Wood Green gentleman has written to an evening paper to say
that he has grown a vegetable marrow which weighs forty-three
pounds. There is some talk of his being elected an Honorary
Angler.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Grimsby lady who has just celebrated her hundredth birthday
states that she has never visited a cinema theatre. We felt sure
there must be an explanation somewhere.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It seems a pity that the Willesden Health Committee should have
troubled to pass a resolution about the decreasing birth-rate. When
we remember air-raids and the shortage of sugar it is only natural
that people should show a disinclination to be born just now.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"I don't care how soon a General Election comes," says Mr. JOHN
DILLON, M.P. It is this dare-devil spirit which has made so many
Irishmen what they are. The recruiting officer has no terrors for
them.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>HENRY ELIONSKY, of New York, has succeeded in swimming seven
miles with his legs tied to a chair and with heavy boots and
clothing. It is not known why he did it, but we gather that CHARLIE
CHAPLIN is now wondering whether he was wise, after all, in
becoming a naturalised American.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The wave of crime still sweeps the country. On top of the
&pound;30,000 jewel robbery comes the news that a man has been
charged with breaking into a London tobacconist's shop and stealing
a box of matches value &frac12;<i>d.</i> (price
1&frac12;<i>d.</i>).</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A letter has just reached a City office addressed to the tenants
who occupied the premises twenty years ago. Fortunately such cases
of loitering on the part of our postmen are extremely rare.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An infuriated bull has been killed in High Street, Tonbridge,
after wrecking several shop windows. It is thought that the animal
had misread the directions on its sugar card.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A number of people have complained that they could hear nothing
of the recent air-raids over London, owing to the noise of the
firing being drowned by the admonitory activities of the
police.</p>

<h2>SOCIETY NOTES.</h2>
<h4><i>By The Hanger-on.</i></h4>
<h3>AIR-RAIDS AND OTHER DIVERSIONS.</h3>
<p>A promising young poet of my acquaintance, who in the midst of
war's obsessions still finds time and taste for the exercise of his
art (he is in a Government office), has allowed me to see the
opening couplet of what I understand to be a very ambitious poem.
It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Though overhead the Gothas buzz,</p>
<p>Stands London where it did? It does."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Many good judges of poetry to whom I have quoted these lines
think them very clever.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A witty friend of mine tells me that he is thinking of bringing
out a handy and up-to-date edition of the <i>Almanach de Gotha</i>,
special attention being paid to the changes of the Moon.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Society is always on the look-out for some new distraction from
the tedium of War. The latest vogue with smart people is to get up
little air-raid parties for the Tube, to be followed by auction or
a small boy-and-girl dance. Sections of tunnel or platform can be
engaged beforehand by arrangement with the Constabulary.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>I hear that my friend, ARTHUR BOURCHIER, continues to draw
crowds to the Oxford. I was dining the other day with a young and
brilliant officer, who has seen two months' active service in the
A.S.C. and won golden opinions at the Base, and he assured me that
there is no "Better 'Ole" than the Oxford during an air-raid.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Now that London is part of the Front, with a barrage of its own,
one has to be careful to censor one's correspondence. It is
advisable not to mention your actual address, but just to write
"Somewhere in the West-End. B.S.F." (British Sedentary Force).</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Winter season has begun exceptionally early. Last Sunday at
Church Parade I saw Lady "Nibs" Tattenham, looking the very image
of her latest photograph in <i>The Prattler</i>, where she appears
with her pet Pekie over the legend, "Deeply interested in
War-work."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A gallant Contemptible has been complaining to me that the Press
shows no sense of proportion in the space that it allots to
air-raids. Our casualties from that source, he said, are never one
tenth as heavy as those in France on days when G.H.Q. reports
"Everything quiet on the Western Front." I naturally disagreed with
his attitude. Nothing, I told him, is more likely to discourage the
Hun than to see column after column in our papers proving that
these visitations leave us totally unmoved. Besides it must be very
comforting to our troops in the trenches to learn in detail how
their dear ones at home are sharing the perils of the other fronts.
In any case nobody who knows our Press would doubt the purity of
their motive in reporting as many air-raid horrors as the Censor
permits.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>&Agrave; propos</i> of the Patriotic Press, no praise can be
too high for some of our society weeklies. They have set their
faces like flint against any serious reference to the War. When I
see them going imperturbably along the old pre-war lines, snapping
smart people at the races or in the Row, or reproducing the
devastating beauty of a revue chorus, I know that they have their
withers unwrung and their heart in the right place. I always have
one of these papers on my table to be taken as a corrective after
the daily casualty lists.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A striking feature of the Photographic Press is to be seen in
the revival of the <i>vie intime</i> of popular idols of the stage.
The human life of our great actors and actresses as revealed in
some simple rustic <i>villeggiatura</i> has always had a
fascination for a public that does not enjoy the privilege of their
private friendship. And in these strenuous War-days it is well to
bring home to the theatre-goer how necessary is domestic repose for
those who are doing their courageous bit to keep the nation from
dwelling on the inconveniences of Armageddon.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>One of the most profound after-the-war questions that is
agitating the mind of the Government is what eventually to do with
the miles of wooden and concrete villages that have sprung up all
over London like Jonah's mushroom. I hear a rumour that the House
of Commons tea-terrace will shortly be commandeered for the
erection of yet another block of buildings to accommodate yet
another Ministry&mdash;the Ministry of Demobilization of Temporary
Departmental Hutments.</p>
<p>O.S.</p>

<h2>THE TUBE HOTELS, LTD.</h2>
<p>[Mr. Punch has been fortunate enough to secure in advance a
prospectus of the enterprising managements.]</p>
<h3>THE CENTRAL LONDON RAILWAY</h3>
<p>offers splendid night accommodation in its magnificently
appointed stations. Every modern convenience. Luxurious lifts
conducted by the Company's own liveried attendants convey guests to
the dormitories. Constant supply of fresh ozone. Reduced terms to
season ticket holders.</p>
<h3>H&Ocirc;TEL EMBANKMENT.</h3>
<p>All lines converge to this Hotel, which is therefore the most
central in London. Frequent trains convey visitors direct to their
beds. For the convenience of patrons arriving above ground or by
District, the Directors have installed a superb moving staircase,
thereby obviating the inconvenience of crowded lifts.</p>
<p>The platforms and passages are tastefully decorated with
coloured pictures by the leading firms.</p>
<p>Visitors are respectfully requested not to sleep on the moving
staircase.</p>
<h3>H&Ocirc;TEL PICCADILLY CIRCUS.</h3>
<h4>In the Heart of Fashionable London.</h4>
<p>This Hotel, which is one of the deepest in London, is composed
of four magnificent platforms and nearly a mile of finely
tessellated corridors. Electric light. Constant temperature of
sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit. Excellent catering under the control
of the Automatic Machine Company. Reduced terms during moonless
nights.</p>
<h3>H&Ocirc;TEL HAMPSTEAD TUBE.</h3>
<p>Situated in a commanding position, underlooking the Heath, this
hotel is positively the deepest in London. The Management has
decided to extend the accommodation during one week in each month
by offering beds on the steps of the staircase. No one has ever
been known to walk either up or down this staircase, and patrons
are therefore assured of an uninterrupted night's repose. Extremely
moderate terms are quoted for the higher flights.</p>
<h3>THE GILLESPIE ARMS.</h3>
<p>Ensure an undisturbed night's sleep by putting up at the
Gillespie Road Station Family and Commercial Hotel. Large numbers
of trains pass this station without stopping, and residents are
comparatively free from the annoyance caused by the arrival and
departure of passengers.</p>
<p>Special terms for Aliens, who are requested to bring their own
mattresses.</p>

<h2>CODES.</h2>
<p>It began like the noise of rushing water, and for a moment the
Brigade Major hoped that somebody had taken it upon himself to wash
the orderly. The noise, however, was followed by a succession of
thumps which put an end to this pretty flight of fancy. Aghast he
surveyed the scene before him. Close to the Brigade Headquarters'
dug-out was an old French dump of every conceivable kind of
explosive made up into every known form of projectile. No longer
was it a picture of Still Life. The Sleeping Beauty was awake
indeed. The Prince had come in the form of a common whizz-bang.</p>
<p>As he looked (and ducked) a flock of aerial torpedoes, propelled
by the explosion of one of their number, rose and scattered as if
at the approach of a hostile sportsman. Another explosion blew what
seemed to be a million rockets sizzling into the air.</p>
<p>The store was on fire!</p>
<p>The Brigade Major retired.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Everybody was in the Signal dug-out (Signals build deep and
strong). Secretly the clerks were praying for the disintegration of
the typewriter and the total destruction of the overwhelming mass
of paper (paper warfare had been terrible of late). The Staff
Captain and the O.C. Gum Boots, who had been approaching the
Headquarters, were already half a mile down the road and still
going strong.</p>
<p>The Division rang up. One need hardly have mentioned that. In
times of stress the higher formations rarely fail.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" they asked.</p>
<p>The Brigade Major was just going to say, when suddenly he
remembered. That very morning he had been severely strafed for
speaking of important things over the telephone when so near the
enemy. "Had he not read the Divisional G 245/348/24 of the 29th
inst.? What was the good of issuing orders to defeat the efficiency
of the Bosch listening apparatus if they were not obeyed?" etc.,
etc.</p>
<p>True, it was conceivable that even without the aid of a delicate
listening apparatus the Bosch was cognisant of an explosion that
made his whole front line quiver; still orders is orders. So the
Brigade-Major swallowed hard.</p>
<p>"C-can't tell you over the wires. Your G 245/348/24..."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, we know all about that. Don't say it
<i>definitely</i>, but give us an <i>idea</i>. <i>Where</i> is all
this noise?"</p>
<p>"Here!&mdash;Oh!" piped the B.M. as a crump shook the receiver
out of his hand.</p>
<p>"Send it in code at once. The G.O.C. is strafing horribly to
know."</p>
<p>To encode a message which may be your last words on earth is not
the easiest of tasks. It has no romance about it. Who would relish
an obituary such as: "He died like a hero, his last words being
'XB35/067K'"?</p>
<p>To the ramping of the continuous crump the B.M. scraped away the
dirt and stuff that had fallen from the throbbing walls of his
dug-out and fished out the Code-Book. Hurriedly he turned over the
pages to "Ammunition" and read down the set phrases and their code
equivalents. Four times he relit the candle. There seemed nothing
under this heading applicable to the situation. "Send up" was one,
but that had already been done. "Am/is/are/running short of" was
another, but it was doubtful if the Division would see the real
meaning of it.</p>
<p>"Ah, here we are," he muttered, relighting the candle for the
fifth time. "Dumps." Alas, there was nothing to convey the
situation very clearly even under this heading. Finally he picked
out the nearest he could find and sent it over the wires.</p>
<p>This is what they decoded to the expectant G.O.C. of the
Division: "<i>Advanced ammunition dep&ocirc;t has moved</i>."</p>
<p>The G.O.C. said something which impelled the entire Divisional
Staff to the telephone, where they all grabbed for the
receiver.</p>
<p>"What the devil is this code message? We can't understand it.
You've sent in something about the dump at your Brigade
Headquarters."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the B.M. meaningly, "there is <i>not</i> a dump at
Brigade Headquarters now."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't care. We want to know what all this noise is
about."</p>
<p>"It's the dump. It's m-moved."</p>
<p>"Moved? Moved where? Give the map reference."</p>
<p>"Map reference?" murmured the B.M. "Oh, my sacred aunt, what
fools ... I'm sorry" (he smiled at them through his teeth) "I can't
give you the <i>m-map</i> reference, but I can give you the
<i>area</i> roughly."</p>
<p>"Barmy!" was the word he heard spoken to a bystander at the
other end.</p>
<p>"Look here, old man," they said kindly, "we know you're all very
tired and worried, but just try to <i>think</i> a moment. Never
mind dumps now. You can't be making all that noise moving a
dump&mdash;what?" (Specimen of Divisional joke&mdash;very rare.)
"Tell us, is the Bosch shelling?"</p>
<p>"No. They've stopped."</p>
<p>"Good. Then it's all over?"</p>
<p>"No. It's still going on."</p>
<p>"But you just said that it had stopped."</p>
<p>"Yes, it has. But the dump hasn't. It keeps m-moving."</p>
<p>"Poor old bird," they said, "his nerve's gone at last. All
right," they shouted, "don't you worry. The storeman will look
after the dump. You go to bed and have a good sleep."</p>
<p>"Have a g-good sleep!" muttered the B.M., "that's just like the
Divis&mdash;Oh!" and he sat down as a torpedo flopped into his
bedroom a few doors away and made a hole of it.</p>
<p>Then he sat up. The storeman of the Brigade dump was not two
hundred yards away from the active one. The poor fellow was to have
gone on leave that night. Presently it occurred to him that,
instead of trying to decide who should have the reversion of the
storeman's leave, it would be better to go and see if there really
was a vacancy. Fifteen boxes of melinite delayed him but a moment.
With melinite you know the worst at once; it doesn't hang round
like boxes of ammunition, for instance. He called a clerk and
together they raced over to the storeman's dug-out.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg
235]</span>
<p>"Jock!" cried the clerk. "Are ye there, Jock?"</p>
<p>"Is he quite dead?" said the B.M., making up his mind to use his
leave warrant for himself.</p>
<p>"No, Sir, he's very deaf, that's why he's a storeman.
Jo-ock!!"</p>
<p>"Hello!" came from the ground.</p>
<p>"Are ye all right, Jock?"</p>
<p>"Na. There's an awfu' to-do here."</p>
<p>"What's wrong then?"</p>
<p>"Ma candle keeps going oot."</p>
<p>"Are ye all right, though, Jock?"</p>
<p>"Na."</p>
<p>"Well, what's up with ye?"</p>
<p>"I told ye. Ma candle keeps going oot. What's up yon?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>When the B.M. got back he found a one-sided war in progress on
the telephone. The G.O.C. had heated up the wires to red-heat.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Nessel? Where the devil have you been? This noise
is still going on. Tell me what it is. No-dam-nonsense-now. Let's
have it."</p>
<p>"If you want to know and you don't mind the Bosch hearing what I
say, Sir, the dump, the French dump, has b-blown itself to
b-blazes."</p>
<p>"Why the <i>devil</i> couldn't you say so before?"</p>
<p>Every dog has his day. With a full and fatuous smile the
Brigade-Major picked up a paper and began: "Reference your G.
245/348/24 of the 29th inst. It says that&mdash;"</p>
<p>Somebody must have taken a bone away from a dog at the other
end. He growled horribly.</p>

<p>Mr. Punch desires to record thanks to the innumerable

escaped and were afterwards recaptured was "Von Thelan, a

<h2>AN INVOLUNTARY RAID.</h2>
<p>Life in a convalescent hospital for officers is not one
continuous round of gaiety, but it has its incidents for all
that.</p>
<p>The other day Sister took Haynes, Ansell and myself to have tea
with some people in the neighbouring village of Little Budford. We
were waiting in the hall for the car when Seymour came along.
Seymour is an adjutant when he is not at home, and he likes to see
things done with proper military precision.</p>
<p>"Here," he said, "you can't go off casually like that. Fall in,
tea-party."</p>
<p>We fell in, and he went to the smoking-room and woke Major
Stanley.</p>
<p>"Party for tea ready for inspection, Sir," he reported.</p>
<p>"Who? What? Where?" asked the Major confusedly. "Good Lord, you
young idiot, what a scare you gave me! Thought I was back in France
for a moment. Where's this party paraded?"</p>
<p>"Hout in the 'all, Sir." Seymour led him to where we were
standing at ease.</p>
<p>"Party!" he roared. "Shunsuwere!" We gave two convulsive jerks.
"Smarten up there, smarten HUP! Get a move on! This ain't a
waxwork. Shunsuwere!... Shun!! Party present, Sir."</p>
<p>The Major inspected us.</p>
<p>"I don't like this smear, Sergeant," he said, pointing to
Ansell's upper lip.</p>
<p>Seymour examined the feature in question.</p>
<p>"It don't appear to be dirt, Sir. Some sort o' growth, I think.
You try sand-papering it, me lad, an' you'll find it come orf all
right."</p>
<p>"Very good, Sergeant," answered Ansell solemnly.</p>
<p>The Major proceeded to Haynes, and eyed him with disfavour.</p>
<p>"We can't do nothing with this man, Sir," said Seymour
deprecatingly. "'Is legs is that bandy."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Private Haynes, by appearing on ceremonial
parade with a pair of bandy legs?"</p>
<p>"It wasn't my fault, Sir. 'Strewth, it wasn't. They got wet,
Sir, an' I went an' dried 'em at the cook'ouse fire, Sir, an' they
got warped, Sir."</p>
<p>"Well," said the Major, "don't bring 'em on parade again. Tell
your Q.M.S. I say you're to have a new pair."</p>
<p>"Very good, Sir."</p>
<p>The Major passed on to me, and surveyed my left arm more in
anger than in sorrow.</p>
<p>"Why has this man got his blue band fastened on with pins?" he
demanded. "Why isn't it sewn on? Why hasn't he fastened it on with
elastic? D'you hear me? Are you deaf? Why isn't it sewn on? Why
don't you speak?"</p>
<p>"Please, Sir...."</p>
<p>"Don't answer me back! Sergeant, take this man's name. He is
insolent. Take his name for insolence. You are insolent, Sir.
You're a disgrace to the Army. You're a ..."</p>
<p>"If you've quite finished with my squad, Major," put in Sister
in a quiet voice from the door, "the car is here, and we're late
already. I shall have to push a bit."</p>
<p>I promptly made for the seat beside the driver, explaining that
I wanted to see the speedometer burst. Sister does a good many
things, and does most of them well; but her particular
accomplishment is her motor-driving. After my experiences in
different cars at the Front&mdash;especially those driven by
Frenchmen&mdash;I thought at first that motoring had no new thrills
to offer me; but when Sister takes corners I still clutch at
anything handy.</p>
<p>Surrey began to stream past us. The landscape was extremely
beautiful, but only the more distant parts of it were visible
except as a mere blur. After five or six miles we turned into a
long straight stretch of road.</p>
<p>"The Hepworths live somewhere along this," said Sister. "There's
a lovely sunken garden just in front of the house which I want you
to notice. Hallo! here we are; I thought it was further on."</p>
<p>The car whizzed round and through a drive gateway half hidden in
trees. When I opened my eyes again I looked for the sunken garden;
but except for a few very prim-looking flower-beds the grounds in
front of the house consisted entirely of a lawn, round which the
drive took a broad circular sweep.</p>
<p>"It must be the wrong house," said Sister, and without pausing
an instant in our centrifugal career we rushed round the complete
circle and disappeared through the gate as suddenly as we had come.
As we passed the house I had a fleeting glimpse of an old,
hard-featured and furious female face glaring at us from one of the
windows.</p>
<p>On the road we stopped the car so as to regain some measure of
gravity before presenting ourselves at our real
destination&mdash;next house&mdash;but were still rather hysterical
when we arrived.</p>
<p>"You'll hear more of this," said our hostess, when we had
reported our raid. "Old Miss Mendip lives there&mdash;a regular
tartar; all kinds of views; writes to the papers."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In a subsequent issue of the local weekly we found the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><i>To the Editor of "The Inshot Times, Great and Little
Budford Chronicle and Home Counties Advertiser</i>."</blockquote>
<p>SIR,&mdash;Even in <i>war-time</i>, when one cannot call our
souls our own, we may surely expect the privacy of individuals and
the rights of property to receive <i>some</i> respect. An
Englishman's home is still his castle, though the debased morals
and decayed manners of modern <i>Society</i> (?) seem to blind its
members to the fact.</p>
<p>I wish to give publicity in your pages to a disgraceful
<i>outrage</i> of which I have been made the victim. On Tuesday
last I was rudely awakened from my afternoon rest by the sound of a
large motor-car. As I did not expect visitors I proceeded to the
window in order to discover to what the <i>intrusion</i> might be
due. What was my <i>astonishment</i> to discover that the vehicle
contained a party of four <i>perfect strangers</i>. Three of them,
I regret to state, were wounded officers; they were being driven by
one of the modern games-playing cigarette-smoking <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span> young
women to whom the old-fashioned word "<i>lady</i>" seems so
<i>singularly</i> inapplicable. Their sole object in entering
appeared to be the perpetration of a senseless practical
<i>joke</i>, for after <i>careering</i> round my garden at a pace
which I can only describe as <i>unwomanly</i>, they went off by the
way they had come.</p>
<p>My gardener, who witnessed the incident, tells me that on
reaching the road they stopped the vehicle and celebrated the
success of their inane efforts by <i>shrieking</i> with that
unrestrained mirth which jars so painfully on refined ears.</p>
<p>Can <i>nothing</i> be done?</p>
<p>I am, Sir, Yours faithfully,</p>

<h2>THE P.-P.-D.</h2>
<p>Henry is in the War Office, where he takes a hand in the
Direction of Military Aeronautics. To meet him you might almost
think that Military Aeronautics was a one-man show. He has, at any
rate in the eyes of the layman, an encyclop&aelig;dic knowledge of
aircraft and all appertaining thereto. When he is out for a walk on
Sunday with his wife and daughter, and a British aeroplane passes
over them with the usual fascinating roar, Henry is very superior.
Mummy (who is of coarse clay) and Betty (aged 1&frac12;, and
coarser still) are frankly excited every time.</p>
<p>"Look at the pretty airship!" says Mummy.</p>
<p>"Oo-ah!" says Betty.</p>
<p>"B.E.4X.," snaps Henry, without looking at it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Or rather this is what Henry used to do; but now things are
different. It was Betty who, so to speak, brought him down to earth
again. He had great ambitions for Betty, whom he fondly believed to
be possessed of intelligence above the lot of woman, and he always
laboured prodigiously to advance her education. Betty took to it
philosophically, however, and refused to be hurried; and Henry
almost despaired of getting her beyond two syllables. The "Common
Objects of the Farmyard" were rapidly assimilated, and all the
world of mechanical traction was comprehended in the generic
"puff-puff." But Henry wouldn't be satisfied with this very
creditable repertoire. "Out of respect for her father, if for no
other reason," he would insist, "she <i>must</i> learn to say
'aeroplane.'"</p>
<p>"How ridiculous!" said Mummy, who always called them "airships,"
to annoy Henry; "and anyhow it's no use going on at her; she never
will say things to order. If you'll only leave her alone for a bit
she'll probably say it, and then your sordid ambition will be
gratified."</p>
<p>But Henry cared for none of these things, and when Sunday came,
and with it Sunday's promenade and Sunday's aeroplane, he went at
it as hard as ever.</p>
<p>"Say 'air-ye-play,'" he commanded, as the pram was brought to a
standstill and the droning monster passed overhead.</p>
<p>Betty gazed raptly at the entrancing thing. Then suddenly she
raised a fat hand and pointed. "Oo-ah!" she said,
"puff-puff-dicky!"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>And nowadays Henry's omniscience is decently obscured under a
capacious <span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id=
"page238"></a>[pg 238]</span> bushel. If you meet an aeroplane when
you are walking with him and ask humbly for his verdict thereon, in
the expectation of an explosion of clipped technical jargon, he
will stop and study its outline with great attention, and will
eventually inform you, to your respectful mystification, that it is
a "P.-P.-D." Thereafter he will chuckle most unofficially.</p>

<h2>RAID JOTTINGS.</h2>
<p>A good deal of dissatisfaction is expressed with the state of
the cellars to which people have been invited during the raids.
"Surely," writes one of our correspondents, "it is a scandal that,
at this time in the world's history, some cellars should be totally
destitute of wine. That there should be no coal in the coal-cellars
is understandable enough; but to ask the timid public into empty
wine cellars is a travesty of hospitality."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Every effort will be made when the House reassembles to provide
separate cellars for the SPEAKER and Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. JIMMY WILDE, the Welsh boxer, it has been widely announced,
had a marvellous escape from an air-bomb. The little champion (for
once not in a position to hit back) was standing in the door of his
hotel when the projectile dropped, and blew him along the passage,
but inflicted no injuries. The world will therefore hear from Mr.
WILDE again, whose future antagonists should view with a shudder
this inability of the Gothas to knock him out.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. WILDE is, however, not alone in his good fortune. From all
the bombarded parts, and from some others, come news of remarkable
pieces of good luck, due almost or wholly to the fact that the
bombs fell on spots where our correspondents were not standing,
although they might easily have been there had they not been
elsewhere. The similarity of their experience is indeed most
striking.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE, for example, who disapproves of soldiers
laughing, happened to be in the country on the night of the 24th.
Had he been in town he might, in a melancholy reverie caused by the
incorrigible light-heartedness of his fellow-countrymen, have
wandered bang into the danger zone. No one can be too thankful that
he did not.</p>

<p>Sir HENRY WOOD'S project to play TCHAIKOVSKY'S "1812" in such
perfect time that the audience will have the pleasure of hearing
our anti-aircraft men supply the big-gun effects, although
laudable, is, it is feared, doomed to failure.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There was no air raid over London on Wednesday the 26th. The
sudden noise (which happily produced no panic) in His Majesty's
Theatre was merely Miss LILY BRAYTON dropping the clothes she was
not wearing.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A CONSTANT RAIDER writes:&mdash;"It is understood that the
German airmen's motto&mdash;borrowed, without acknowledgment, from
the dental profession&mdash;is 'We spare no panes.'"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In view of recent events Miss TENNYSON JESSE is considering
whether her new novel, <i>Secret Bread</i>, should be renamed
<i>Air-raided Bread</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. CHARLES COCHRAN is very anxious that it should be known that
not a single bomb hit him. Had any of them done so, the
consequences might have been very serious. This happy immunity
being his, he wishes it also to be known that his various and
meritorious theatres are doing even more astonishing business than
before.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. COCHRAN, however, together with other theatrical managers,
has a dangerous rival. The raids are threatening to ruin the
matin&eacute;es now so prevalent by setting up counter attractions.
The thousands of people (not only errand-boys) who now stand all
day to watch the workmen mend a hole in the roadway caused by a
bomb would otherwise, but for this engrossing and never tedious
spectacle, be in this theatre or that.</p>

having fallen there he remains intact.</p>

<h2>LETTERS OF A GENERAL TO HIS SON</h2>
<h4>(<i>On obtaining a Junior Staff appointment</i>).</h4>
<p>MY DEAR BOY,&mdash;We both congratulate you heartily on your
appointment. Acting on your suggestion, I have hinted to your
mother that her anxieties for your safety may be considerably
lessened in consequence. You will, of course, continue to address
letters likely to cause her any apprehension to my club. On
entering this new phase of your career you will not take it amiss
if I offer you a few words of practical advice:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Do not neglect your advantages. Always visit the line with a
double mission, one for the right of the line and one for the
left&mdash;and see which they are shelling.</p>
<p>2. If they are strafing all along the line, inspect
Transport.</p>
<p>3. Cultivate the detached manner when dealing with all but the
very senior. This will give you what is called distinction. Charm
will come later.</p>
<p>4. What you don't know, guess. If wrong, guess again.</p>
<p>5. Always put off on to others what you cannot do yourself.</p>
<p>6. What little you do, do well&mdash;and see that it gets talked
about. Medals are going round, and you may as well have them as
anybody else.</p>
<p>7. Belong to a good Mess and invite people who are inclined to
criticise.</p>
<p>8. When rung up on a subject of which you know nothing, learn to
conduct the conversation so that you abstract the necessary
enlightenment from the questioner himself (while appearing to be
perfectly conversant with what he is talking about), and, if
possible, get him to suggest the answer to his own conundrum. In
other words, bluff as in poker (which I trust you don't play).</p>
<p>These are just a few little hints that have occurred to me. Your
own good sense will guide you as to the rest. Everybody at home is
taking a tremendous interest in the War, I'm glad to say. Hardly a
day passes but I am asked at least a dozen times when it is going
to be over.</p>
<p>Your affectionate Father, etc., etc.</p>

<h2>FOR SERVICES RENDERED.</h2>
<p>If ever, in a railing mood, I have unjustly aspersed the Army;
if, by reason of deferred pay, over-diluted stew, or leave
adjourned, I have accused the Powers That Be of a step-motherly
indifference to my welfare, I hereby withdraw unreservedly all such
aspersions and accusations. For since my discharge tokens of kindly
interest and affection have reached me in such rapid succession
that I am kept wondering what the next will be. With a quarter of a
million men in his care (as I suppose, since my number was 256801),
my fatherly Record Officer has yet time for frequent correspondence
with "crocks" like me. He registers all his letters; he makes his
instructions so plain that a very suckling might understand them;
he takes every precaution lest, in the press of business, I should
be overlooked.</p>
<p>I had been at home about a week when his first communication
arrived&mdash;an unexpected windfall purporting to represent the
balance of my pay and allowances. The method of computation would
probably have transcended my intelligence if it had been indicated;
but there was no attempt at explanation, nor did I desire it. I
stamped and signed the receipt form according to unmistakable
directions, and returned it to Headquarters. A few days later
certain arrears of Separation Allowance came to hand&mdash;arrears
whose existence our own unaided sagacity would never have revealed.
Guided by an illustrative diagram we signed the receipt in due form
and returned it. Before we had ceased congratulating ourselves on
these accessions, yet another instalment of pay was delivered, with
form of receipt as in the previous case. We were almost convinced
that the country cottage and the leisured ease of our dreams were
within our grasp, but the well ran dry at that point. Some of my
balance may yet lurk in the coffers of the Paymaster, but I dare
not throw off the yoke of my bondage on the strength of a bare
possibility.</p>
<p>After a brief interval, Records returned to the charge with a
bulky envelope containing matter of great interest. One of the
enclosures certified that, for the term of three months, I was
transferred to Class W.P., Army Reserve. I made various conjectures
as to the meaning of "W," and so did Cinderella. On the whole we
favoured "Warrior," but perhaps we were wrong. At all events, the
interpretation of "P" was clearly set forth by another document,
which explained that I was entitled to a pension of eight shillings
and threepence per week so long as I remained among the happy
W.P.'s. There was also an identity certificate, whereon some
clergyman, magistrate or policeman must attest that I was alive
when I brought it to him, and a form of receipt for all the papers
in the batch. I signed it according to instructions and returned it
to Headquarters.</p>
<p>The identity certificate went back to a specified address, where
it set in motion machinery by which my pension paper was presently
delivered to me&mdash;accompanied by a form of receipt. This paper
was covered with mystic circles, whose meaning I discovered when I
presented myself at the post-office. They were apparently intended
to appease the presiding divinity by gratifying her passion for
stamping things. She hit my paper accurately in four of its rings,
and then, with a pleased smile, handed me thirty-three
shillings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Records had stirred up a benevolent neighbour to call
upon me. He belonged to an organisation for assisting discharged
soldiers; he was Opportunity in person for anyone who might need
him; but, as Cinderella explained, I was at that moment engaged
upon work of national importance and could not claim his help.
Nevertheless she thanked the gentleman and placed the incident to
the credit of the Powers That Be.</p>
<p>No acknowledgment was required for this visit; but a week later
my war services' badge was delivered per registered post, and I
confessed the fact both on the usual green slip and on the form of
receipt which was enclosed. Henceforth I was able to appear in
public with an outward and visible sign of the ferocity which
underlies my demeanour, and my most lurid tales had a substantial
witness.</p>
<p>Two months went by, during which the O. i/c Records made no
further additions to our postbag. There are mornings when your
friends appear to have forgotten you, when a Levitical postman
bangs your neighbour's gate mockingly and forthwith crosses the
street. On such mornings our thoughts may have turned to Records
with a certain yearning; but mainly we felt his care like the air
about us, and had no need that it should materialise in idle
correspondence.</p>
<p>At last my term of probation came to an end. In response to a
note from Records (with form for receipt) I returned my Transfer
Certificate and received in its place my final Discharge
Papers&mdash;with a form for receipt. At the same time I heard that
the Commissioners were in earnest consultation as to the
continuance of my pension.</p>
<p>Thus goodness and loving-kindness have followed me ever since I
handed in the uniform. To this day I am the subject of anxious
consideration. Not a week ago the early post brought me my
character. Imagine the incessant parental watchfulness of an
authority which can testify concerning one two hundred and fifty
thousandth of its charge that he is "a good soldier, willing and
industrious, honest, sober, trustworthy and well-conducted." Think
of the kindly interest which prompted the O. i/c Records to insert
a form of receipt&mdash;"to guard against impersonation." My
character might have got into base hands; some unworthy person
might have gone about professing to possess that willingness, that
industry, that sobriety, that trustworthiness and that elegance of
conduct which are mine alone; but the form of receipt would baffle
him. I cannot explain how, but Records knows.</p>
<p>What is yet in store for me the future bides; but this I know:
while England endures and Records continues to record, I shall not
walk alone.</p>

<h2>GOING BACK.</h2>
<p>"In these days," I began, but Francesca interrupted me.</p>
<p>"When anyone starts like that," she said, "I know he's going to
make the War an excuse for doing something rather more paltry than
usual."</p>
<p>"'Paltry' is not," I said, "a very nice word."</p>
<p>"I'll take the phrase back and substitute 'rather less noble and
generous.'"</p>
<p>"Yes, I like that better. I'll pass it in that form as your
comment on what you haven't yet allowed me to say."</p>
<p>"Quick," she said; "what was it? Don't leave me in
suspense."</p>
<p>"In these days," I said, "one mustn't spend too much on railway
companies."</p>
<p>"True," she said. "I'm with you there in these or any other
days."</p>
<p>"And therefore," I continued, "it will be quite enough if one of
us accompanies Frederick, our lively ten-year-old, to begin his
second term at school. There is no necessity whatever for both of
us to go with him."</p>
<p>"Hear, hear!" said Francesca; "your idea is better than I
thought. I will go with Frederick and you can stay at home and look
after the girls."</p>
<p>"No," I said firmly, "I will take Frederick, and you must remain
behind and keep an eye on Muriel, Nina and Alice."</p>
<p>"No," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said; "my eye's not good enough for the job; it hasn't
been trained for it. I should be sure to mislay one of the girls,
and then you'd never forgive yourself for having put upon me a
burden greater than I could bear. Besides," I added, "goings back
to school are in the man's department, with football, cricket,
boxing and things of that kind."</p>
<p>"And what," she said scornfully, "are you graciously pleased to
leave in my department?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I thought you knew. I leave to you table-manners, tidiness
(that's a tough one), hand-washing (that's a tougher), reading
aloud from Kipling and tucking him up in bed."</p>
<p>"Quite a good list, if by no means a complete one; but in these
days one mustn't be too critical. Anyhow it proves that I must take
the boy back to school."</p>
<p>"It proves just the contrary."</p>
<p>"No," she said, "it proves what ought to be there by leaving it
out."</p>
<p>"That," I said, "is a record even for you, Francesca."</p>
<p>"Well, it's logical anyway. How, for instance, could you talk to
the Matron? You'd be utterly lost before you'd been at it for half
a minute."</p>
<p>"Don't you worry about that," I said. "I have accomplishments of
which you don't seem to be aware, and one of them is talking to
Matrons at preparatory schools."</p>
<p>"Anyhow, you're not going to have a chance of showing it off
this time, <i>because I am going to take the boy back to
school</i>. That's final."</p>
<p>It was, and in due time Francesca took the boy back. Her account
of the farewell moments was not without a certain amount of pathos,
several other mothers and their boys being involved in the
valedictory scene. Four or five days afterwards, however, we
received the following letter, which put to flight any idea that
Frederick might be pining:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am very happy this term, and I am getting on fairly well in
my work. I like football much better than cricket. I have three or
four times just not got a goal, once it was when I kicked into goal
the goalkeeper (3 st. 4 lb.!) rushed out and kicked it away, and
once when we were playing Blues and Reds, and I was on the Blue
side, and I managed by good luck to get through a crowd of shouting
Reds and followed it up amidst shouts from the Blues and shot it to
the Red goal; but the goalkeeper (a different one) came out and hit
it away, at which I twisted my knee and collapsed (not with pain,
because it wasn't anything, but with anger and <i>desparation!</i>)
Am I to learn boxing this term? I am sorry to hear the hens are not
behaving well."</p>
<p>I should like to have seen the bold goalkeeper of 3 st. 4 lb. It
is a proud weight.</p>

<h2>YESTERDAY IN OXFORD STREET.</h2>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yesterday in Oxford Street, oh, what d'you think, my dears?</p>
<p>I had the most exciting time I've had for years and years;</p>
<p>The buildings looked so straight and tall, the sky was blue
between,</p>
<p>And, riding on a motor-bus, I saw the fairy queen!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Sitting there upon the rail and bobbing up and down,</p>
<p>The sun was shining on her wings and on her golden crown;</p>
<p>And looking at the shops she was, the pretty silks and
lace&mdash;</p>
<p>She seemed to think that Oxford Street was quite a lovely
place.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And once she turned and looked at me and waved her little
hand,</p>
<p>But I could only glare and stare, oh, would she understand?</p>
<p>I simply couldn't speak at all, I simply couldn't stir,</p>
<p>And all the rest of Oxford Street was just a shining blur.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then suddenly she shook her wings&mdash;a bird had fluttered
by&mdash;</p>
<p>And down into the street she looked and up into the sky,</p>
<p>And perching on the railing on a tiny fairy toe</p>
<p>She flashed away so quickly that I hardly saw her go.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I never saw her any more, although I looked all day;</p>
<p>Perhaps she only came to peep and never meant to stay;</p>
<p>But oh, my dears, just think of it, just think what luck for
me</p>
<p>That she should come to Oxford Street and I be there to see!</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>
<p>I think I prefer Mr. WELLS'S recent essay in the Newest Theology
to this too concrete illustration of <i>The Soul of a Bishop</i>
(CASSELL). It's not that I object to the irreverence of stripping a
poor tired bishop of cassock and gaiters, pursuing him to a
sleepless bed and cinematographing all his physical twistings and
turnings, his moral misgivings, his torturing doubts. I owe too
much to Mr. WELLS' irreverences to mind that sort of thing; and I
must say that, for a man who can't have had very much to do with
the episcopacy in his busy life, he does manage to give a
confoundedly plausible atmosphere to the whole setting. There are
two letters from an older bishop to <i>Dr. Scrope</i>, the one,
yieldingly tolerant, to dissuade him from resignation, the other,
written after the accomplished fact, with touches of exquisitely
restrained yet palpable malice, which strike me as masterly
projections. Mr. WELLS also contrives a wonderful impressiveness in
certain passages of the bishop's three visions. But I can't, even
after careful re-reading, see the point of making the bishop's
enlightenment depend upon a mysterious drug. This has an effect of
impishness. There is nothing in <i>Dr. Scrope's</i> development
that might not have taken place without this fantastic assistance
... I suppose the general suggestion of this rather wayward and
hasty but conspicuously sincere book is, that if only an occasional
bishop would secede it would make it easier for the plain man to
listen to the rest. And there may be something in this.</p>
<p>To those who are in love with Mr. W.J. LOCKE'S incurable
romanticism or who have a taste for heroines that "stiffen in a
sudden stroke of passion looking for the instant electrically
beautiful," let me commend <i>The Red Planet</i> (LANE). As a
matter of fact <i>Betty</i>, the heroine, is quite a dear, and the
narrator, <i>Major Meredyth</i>, a maimed hero of the Boer War, who
looks at this one from the tragic angle of an invalid chair, is,
apart from a habit of petulant and not very profound grousing at
Governments in <i>The Daily Rail</i> manner, a sport who thoroughly
deserves the reward of poor widowed <i>Betty's</i> hand on the last
page but one. Perhaps he does not show a very ready understanding
of the phenomenon of physical cowardice in the case of a
brother-officer, though later he makes amends. But I take it that
it was Mr. LOCKE'S idea to present a very ordinary decent sort with
the common man's prejudices and frank distrust of subtleties. A
sinister mystery of love, death and blackmail runs, a turbid
undercurrent, through the story. The publisher's pathetic apology
for the drab grey paper on which, in the interests of War Economy,
the book is printed, makes one wonder how the other publishers who
still issue books in black and white manage to live.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Of the literary reputations that the War has, so to speak, dug
in, I suppose none to be more firmly consolidated than that of Mr.
PATRICK MACGILL. The newest of his several battle-books is <i>The
Brown Brethren</i> (JENKINS), a title derived from the campaigning
colour that has amended a popular quotation till it should now read
"the thin brown line of heroes." I can hardly tell you anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg
246]</span> about Mr. MACGILL'S new book that you have not probably
read or said for yourself of the previous volumes. For my own part,
if the War is to be written about at all (a question concerning
which I preserve an open mind), I say let it be, as here, the real
thing, and the hotter and stronger the better. There is rough
humour in these sketches of soldier types, and just enough story to
thread them together; but it is the fighting that counts. Certain
chapters, for example that about <i>Benner's</i> struggle with the
Hun sniper, seem to leave one bruised and breathless as from
personal conflict. Mr. MACGILL writes about war as he knows it,
horribly, in a way that carries conviction like a charge of
bayonets, and with an entire disregard of the sensibilities of the
stay-at-home reader. For all which reasons <i>The Brown
Brethren</i> and their French friends are assured of the success
that they certainly deserve. Here's wishing them the best of
it!</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In <i>The Sentence of the Court</i> (WARD, LOCK) Mr. FRED M.
WHITE contrives effectively to entangle our interest in one of
those webs of facile intrigue from which the reader escapes only at
the last line of the last page, muttering at he lays the volume
down and observes with concern that it is 2.30 A.M., "What rot!"
The title of the story is misleading. There is no Court, and nobody
is sentenced, though the eminent specialist of Harley Street who
essays the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of villain richly deserves to be.
However, as he is left a bankrupt, discredited in his practice and
detached from the heroine whom he had sworn to appropriate, it
would perhaps be straining a point to cavil at his remaining at
large. The idea upon which the story is based, and which enables
the author to clothe his characters and their actions with
bewildering mystery, is essentially good and, I believe, new,
though far be it from me to do either Mr. WHITE or the reader the
disservice of saying what it is. Suffice that we are introduced to
some quite charming people, as well as two extremely unpleasant
ones, and if the web of mystery is held together in places by a
somewhat generous share of obtuseness on the part of the persons
concerned it is not for us to complain, since we become aware of
the defect only after the affair is over.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Apart from the greater complaint that I do not like her subject,
which probably is entirely my own fault, I have nothing but praise
for Mrs. STANLEY WRENCH'S latest volume, <i>Beat</i> (DUCKWORTH),
except as regards her amazing fondness for drooping the corners of
her characters' mouths, generally either "wistfully" or "sullenly."
It only made one annoyed when <i>Beatrix's</i> unpleasant sisters
developed the trick, but when poor little <i>Beat</i> herself was
affected that way, in spite of the magnificent courage with which
she faced the burden of deputy-motherhood, it made one miserable as
well. The task she had undertaken was a prodigious one, for the
sisters she had to rear were, you must understand, vexed with sex
instincts of the type of the modern novel, and so in a large
measure she failed, even though she sacrificed strength, happiness
and even her own love-story in the effort to keep them straight.
The tale is set out with every circumstance of sordid misery, in
which the spiritual beauty of the heroine is meant to shine, and
undeniably does shine with real strength and purity. The successive
deaths of the mother and step-mother, the shabby London lodgings,
the fall of <i>Veronica</i>, the selfishness of <i>Beat's</i>
boy-friend, and the loathsome trade of her lover&mdash;these, and
more horrors and lapses beside, are all taxed for the general
effect in so able and vivid a fashion that the authoress succeeds
to admiration in making her readers nearly as uncomfortable as her
characters, long before the climax is reached. The end comes rather
less wretchedly than could have been expected, but even so surely
this is genius partly run to seed. The greatest tragedies are not
written in these minor keys. <i>Beat</i>, woman and heroine, is so
admirable that one fain would know her apart from all this
unredeemed welter of sex and selfishness.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>I confess I should have thought that the fictional possibilities
of being as like as two peas to Royalty were fairly exhausted. But
apparently Mr. EDGAR JEPSON does not share this view; and it is
only fair to admit that in <i>The Professional Prince</i>
(HUTCHINSON) he has contrived to give a novel twist to the already
well laboured theme. <i>Prince Richard</i> (precise nationality
unstated) was so bored with the common round of his exalted duties
that, hearing of a convenient double, he engages him, at four
hundred a year and pickings, to represent him at dull functions,
and incidentally to pay the requisite attentions to the young
woman, reported by photograph as depressingly plain, whom political
considerations have marked as the <i>Prince's fianc&eacute;e</i>.
When later one of the characters points out to His Highness that
this conduct showed some lapse from the finer ideals of taste, I am
bound to say that I could find no words of contradiction. However
the originality arrives when <i>John Stuart</i>, the deputy,
instead of falling in love with the bride-elect in Ruritanian
fashion, develops a marked liking for the prosaic side of his job,
and insists upon lecturing his supposed relations upon the
political crisis of the moment. Capital fun this. When the
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> in her turn proved wholly different from the
photograph I permitted myself to hope that we were in for a double
masquerade&mdash;but this was to expect too much. Still, Mr. JEPSON
has handled his wildly-preposterous plot with great verve; and even
if the central situation is one that has been often encountered
before, this only proves again that HOPE springs eternal.... But I
wish he had avoided the War.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
