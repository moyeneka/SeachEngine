<h2><a name="chap01"></a>CASE I: A PSYCHICAL INVASION</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;And what is it makes you think I could be of use in this particular
case?&rdquo; asked Dr. John Silence, looking across somewhat sceptically at the
Swedish lady in the chair facing him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your sympathetic heart and your knowledge of occultism&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, please&mdash;that dreadful word!&rdquo; he interrupted, holding up a
finger with a gesture of impatience.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;your wonderful clairvoyant gift
and your trained psychic knowledge of the processes by which a personality may
be disintegrated and destroyed&mdash;these strange studies you&rsquo;ve been
experimenting with all these years&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only a case of multiple personality I must really cry
off,&rdquo; interrupted the doctor again hastily, a bored expression in his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that; now, please, be serious, for I want your
help,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and if I choose my words poorly you must be
patient with my ignorance. The case I know will interest you, and no one else
could deal with it so well. In fact, no ordinary professional man could deal
with it at all, for I know of no treatment nor medicine that can restore a lost
sense of humour!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You begin to interest me with your &lsquo;case,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
replied, and made himself comfortable to listen.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sivendson drew a sigh of contentment as she watched him go to the tube and
heard him tell the servant he was not to be disturbed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe you have read my thoughts already,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;your intuitive knowledge of what goes on in other people&rsquo;s minds
is positively uncanny.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her friend shook his head and smiled as he drew his chair up to a convenient
position and prepared to listen attentively to what she had to say. He closed
his eyes, as he always did when he wished to absorb the real meaning of a
recital that might be inadequately expressed, for by this method he found it
easier to set himself in tune with the living thoughts that lay behind the
broken words.
</p>

<p>
By his friends John Silence was regarded as an eccentric, because he was rich
by accident, and by choice&mdash;a doctor. That a man of independent means
should devote his time to doctoring, chiefly doctoring folk who could not pay,
passed their comprehension entirely. The native nobility of a soul whose first
desire was to help those who could not help themselves, puzzled them. After
that, it irritated them, and, greatly to his own satisfaction, they left him to
his own devices.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence was a free-lance, though, among doctors, having neither
consulting-room, bookkeeper, nor professional manner. He took no fees, being at
heart a genuine philanthropist, yet at the same time did no harm to his
fellow-practitioners, because he only accepted unremunerative cases, and cases
that interested him for some very special reason. He argued that the rich could
pay, and the very poor could avail themselves of organised charity, but that a
very large class of ill-paid, self-respecting workers, often followers of the
arts, could not afford the price of a week&rsquo;s comforts merely to be told
to travel. And it was these he desired to help: cases often requiring special
and patient study&mdash;things no doctor can give for a guinea, and that no one
would dream of expecting him to give.
</p>

<p>
But there was another side to his personality and practice, and one with which
we are now more directly concerned; for the cases that especially appealed to
him were of no ordinary kind, but rather of that intangible, elusive, and
difficult nature best described as psychical afflictions; and, though he would
have been the last person himself to approve of the title, it was beyond
question that he was known more or less generally as the &ldquo;Psychic
Doctor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In order to grapple with cases of this peculiar kind, he had submitted himself
to a long and severe training, at once physical, mental, and spiritual. What
precisely this training had been, or where undergone, no one seemed to
know,&mdash;for he never spoke of it, as, indeed, he betrayed no single other
characteristic of the charlatan,&mdash;but the fact that it had involved a
total disappearance from the world for five years, and that after he returned
and began his singular practice no one ever dreamed of applying to him the so
easily acquired epithet of quack, spoke much for the seriousness of his strange
quest and also for the genuineness of his attainments.
</p>

<p>
For the modern psychical researcher he felt the calm tolerance of the
&ldquo;man who knows.&rdquo; There was a trace of pity in his
voice&mdash;contempt he never showed&mdash;when he spoke of their methods.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This classification of results is uninspired work at best,&rdquo; he
said once to me, when I had been his confidential assistant for some years.
&ldquo;It leads nowhere, and after a hundred years will lead nowhere. It is
playing with the wrong end of a rather dangerous toy. Far better, it would be,
to examine the causes, and then the results would so easily slip into place and
explain themselves. For the sources are accessible, and open to all who have
the courage to lead the life that alone makes practical investigation safe and
possible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And towards the question of clairvoyance, too, his attitude was significantly
sane, for he knew how extremely rare the genuine power was, and that what is
commonly called clairvoyance is nothing more than a keen power of visualising.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It connotes a slightly increased sensibility, nothing more,&rdquo; he
would say. &ldquo;The true clairvoyant deplores his power, recognising that it
adds a new horror to life, and is in the nature of an affliction. And you will
find this always to be the real test.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that John Silence, this singularly developed doctor, was able to
select his cases with a clear knowledge of the difference between mere
hysterical delusion and the kind of psychical affliction that claimed his
special powers. It was never necessary for him to resort to the cheap mysteries
of divination; for, as I have heard him observe, after the solution of some
peculiarly intricate problem&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Systems of divination, from geomancy down to reading by tea-leaves, are
merely so many methods of obscuring the outer vision, in order that the inner
vision may become open. Once the method is mastered, no system is necessary at
all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the words were significant of the methods of this remarkable man, the
keynote of whose power lay, perhaps, more than anything else, in the knowledge,
first, that thought can act at a distance, and, secondly, that thought is
dynamic and can accomplish material results.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Learn how to <i>think</i>,&rdquo; he would have expressed it, &ldquo;and
you have learned to tap power at its source.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To look at&mdash;he was now past forty&mdash;he was sparely built, with
speaking brown eyes in which shone the light of knowledge and self-confidence,
while at the same time they made one think of that wondrous gentleness seen
most often in the eyes of animals. A close beard concealed the mouth without
disguising the grim determination of lips and jaw, and the face somehow
conveyed an impression of transparency, almost of light, so delicately were the
features refined away. On the fine forehead was that indefinable touch of peace
that comes from identifying the mind with what is permanent in the soul, and
letting the impermanent slip by without power to wound or distress; while, from
his manner,&mdash;so gentle, quiet, sympathetic,&mdash;few could have guessed
the strength of purpose that burned within like a great flame.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I should describe it as a psychical case,&rdquo; continued the
Swedish lady, obviously trying to explain herself very intelligently,
&ldquo;and just the kind you like. I mean a case where the cause is hidden deep
down in some spiritual distress, and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the symptoms first, please, my dear Svenska,&rdquo; he interrupted,
with a strangely compelling seriousness of manner, &ldquo;and your deductions
afterwards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned round sharply on the edge of her chair and looked him in the face,
lowering her voice to prevent her emotion betraying itself too obviously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In my opinion there&rsquo;s only one symptom,&rdquo; she half whispered,
as though telling something disagreeable&mdash;&ldquo;fear&mdash;simply
fear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Physical fear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think not; though how can I say? I think it&rsquo;s a horror in the
psychical region. It&rsquo;s no ordinary delusion; the man is quite sane; but
he lives in mortal terror of something&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by his &lsquo;psychical
region,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the doctor, with a smile; &ldquo;though I suppose
you wish me to understand that his spiritual, and not his mental, processes are
affected. Anyhow, try and tell me briefly and pointedly what you know about the
man, his symptoms, his need for help, my peculiar help, that is, and all that
seems vital in the case. I promise to listen devotedly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am trying,&rdquo; she continued earnestly, &ldquo;but must do so in my
own words and trust to your intelligence to disentangle as I go along. He is a
young author, and lives in a tiny house off Putney Heath somewhere. He writes
humorous stories&mdash;quite a genre of his own: Pender&mdash;you must have
heard the name&mdash;Felix Pender? Oh, the man had a great gift, and married on
the strength of it; his future seemed assured. I say &lsquo;had,&rsquo; for
quite suddenly his talent utterly failed him. Worse, it became transformed into
its opposite. He can no longer write a line in the old way that was bringing
him success&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence opened his eyes for a second and looked at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He still writes, then? The force has not gone?&rdquo; he asked briefly,
and then closed his eyes again to listen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He works like a fury,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but produces
nothing&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated a moment&mdash;&ldquo;nothing that he can
use or sell. His earnings have practically ceased, and he makes a precarious
living by book-reviewing and odd jobs&mdash;very odd, some of them. Yet, I am
certain his talent has not really deserted him finally, but is
merely&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Mrs. Sivendson hesitated for the appropriate word.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In abeyance,&rdquo; he suggested, without opening his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Obliterated,&rdquo; she went on, after a moment to weigh the word,
&ldquo;merely obliterated by something else&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By some one else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I knew. All I can say is that he is haunted, and temporarily his
sense of humour is shrouded&mdash;gone&mdash;replaced by something dreadful
that writes other things. Unless something competent is done, he will simply
starve to death. Yet he is afraid to go to a doctor for fear of being
pronounced insane; and, anyhow, a man can hardly ask a doctor to take a guinea
to restore a vanished sense of humour, can he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he tried any one at all&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not doctors yet. He tried some clergymen and religious people; but they
know so little and have so little intelligent sympathy. And most of them are so
busy balancing on their own little pedestals&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John Silence stopped her tirade with a gesture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how is it that you know so much about him?&rdquo; he asked gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know Mrs. Pender well&mdash;I knew her before she married
him&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And is she a cause, perhaps?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least. She is devoted; a woman very well educated, though
without being really intelligent, and with so little sense of humour herself
that she always laughs at the wrong places. But she has nothing to do with the
cause of his distress; and, indeed, has chiefly guessed it from observing him,
rather than from what little he has told her. And he, you know, is a really
lovable fellow, hard-working, patient&mdash;altogether worth saving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence opened his eyes and went over to ring for tea. He did not know very
much more about the case of the humorist than when he first sat down to listen;
but he realised that no amount of words from his Swedish friend would help to
reveal the real facts. A personal interview with the author himself could alone
do that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All humorists are worth saving,&rdquo; he said with a smile, as she
poured out tea. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to lose a single one in these
strenuous days. I will go and see your friend at the first opportunity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She thanked him elaborately, effusively, with many words, and he, with much
difficulty, kept the conversation thenceforward strictly to the teapot.
</p>

<p>
And, as a result of this conversation, and a little more he had gathered by
means best known to himself and his secretary, he was whizzing in his motor-car
one afternoon a few days later up the Putney Hill to have his first interview
with Felix Pender, the humorous writer who was the victim of some mysterious
malady in his &ldquo;psychical region&rdquo; that had obliterated his sense of
the comic and threatened to wreck his life and destroy his talent. And his
desire to help was probably of equal strength with his desire to know and to
investigate.
</p>

<p>
The motor stopped with a deep purring sound, as though a great black panther
lay concealed within its hood, and the doctor&mdash;the &ldquo;psychic
doctor,&rdquo; as he was sometimes called&mdash;stepped out through the
gathering fog, and walked across the tiny garden that held a blackened fir tree
and a stunted laurel shrubbery. The house was very small, and it was some time
before any one answered the bell. Then, suddenly, a light appeared in the hall,
and he saw a pretty little woman standing on the top step begging him to come
in. She was dressed in grey, and the gaslight fell on a mass of deliberately
brushed light hair. Stuffed, dusty birds, and a shabby array of African spears,
hung on the wall behind her. A hat-rack, with a bronze plate full of very large
cards, led his eye swiftly to a dark staircase beyond. Mrs. Pender had round
eyes like a child&rsquo;s, and she greeted him with an effusiveness that barely
concealed her emotion, yet strove to appear naturally cordial. Evidently she
had been looking out for his arrival, and had outrun the servant girl. She was
a little breathless.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve not been kept waiting&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s
<i>most</i> good of you to come&mdash;&rdquo; she began, and then stopped sharp
when she saw his face in the gaslight. There was something in Dr.
Silence&rsquo;s look that did not encourage mere talk. He was in earnest now,
if ever man was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good evening, Mrs. Pender,&rdquo; he said, with a quiet smile that won
confidence, yet deprecated unnecessary words, &ldquo;the fog delayed me a
little. I am glad to see you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They went into a dingy sitting-room at the back of the house, neatly furnished
but depressing. Books stood in a row upon the mantelpiece. The fire had
evidently just been lit. It smoked in great puffs into the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Sivendson said she thought you might be able to come,&rdquo;
ventured the little woman again, looking up engagingly into his face and
betraying anxiety and eagerness in every gesture. &ldquo;But I hardly dared to
believe it. I think it is really too good of you. My husband&rsquo;s case is so
peculiar that&mdash;well, you know, I am quite sure any <i>ordinary</i> doctor
would say at once the asylum&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he in, then?&rdquo; asked Dr. Silence gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the asylum?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Oh dear, no&mdash;not
yet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the house, I meant,&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
She gave a great sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be back any minute now,&rdquo; she replied, obviously
relieved to see him laugh; &ldquo;but the fact is, we didn&rsquo;t expect you
so early&mdash;I mean, my husband hardly thought you would come at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am always delighted to come&mdash;when I am really wanted, and can be
of help,&rdquo; he said quickly; &ldquo;and, perhaps, it&rsquo;s all for the
best that your husband is out, for now that we are alone you can tell me
something about his difficulties. So far, you know, I have heard very
little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her voice trembled as she thanked him, and when he came and took a chair close
beside her she actually had difficulty in finding words with which to begin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; she began timidly, and then continuing with a
nervous incoherent rush of words, &ldquo;he will be simply delighted that
you&rsquo;ve really come, because he said you were the only person he would
consent to see at all&mdash;the only doctor, I mean. But, of course, he
doesn&rsquo;t know how frightened I am, or how much I have noticed. He pretends
with me that it&rsquo;s just a nervous breakdown, and I&rsquo;m sure he
doesn&rsquo;t realise all the odd things I&rsquo;ve noticed him doing. But the
main thing, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, the main thing, Mrs. Pender,&rdquo; he said, encouragingly,
noticing her hesitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;is that he thinks we are not alone in the house. That&rsquo;s the
chief thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me more facts&mdash;just facts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It began last summer when I came back from Ireland; he had been here
alone for six weeks, and I thought him looking tired and queer&mdash;ragged and
scattered about the face, if you know what I mean, and his manner worn out. He
said he had been writing hard, but his inspiration had somehow failed him, and
he was dissatisfied with his work. His sense of humour was leaving him, or
changing into something else, he said. There was something in the house, he
declared, that&rdquo;&mdash;she emphasised the words&mdash;&ldquo;prevented his
feeling funny.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something in the house that prevented his feeling funny,&rdquo; repeated
the doctor. &ldquo;Ah, now we&rsquo;re getting to the heart of it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she resumed vaguely, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what he kept
saying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what was it he <i>did</i> that you thought strange?&rdquo; he asked
sympathetically. &ldquo;Be brief, or he may be here before you finish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very small things, but significant it seemed to me. He changed his
workroom from the library, as we call it, to the sitting-room. He said all his
characters became wrong and terrible in the library; they altered, so that he
felt like writing tragedies&mdash;vile, debased tragedies, the tragedies of
broken souls. But now he says the same of the sitting-room, and he&rsquo;s gone
back to the library.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, there&rsquo;s so little I can tell you,&rdquo; she went on,
with increasing speed and countless gestures. &ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s only
very small things he does and says that are queer. What frightens me is that he
assumes there is some one else in the house all the time&mdash;some one I never
see. He does not actually say so, but on the stairs I&rsquo;ve seen him
standing aside to let some one pass; I&rsquo;ve seen him open a door to let
some one in or out; and often in our bedrooms he puts chairs about as though
for some one else to sit in. Oh&mdash;oh yes, and once or twice,&rdquo; she
cried&mdash;&ldquo;once or twice&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused, and looked about her with a startled air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Once or twice,&rdquo; she resumed hurriedly, as though she heard a sound
that alarmed her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard him running&mdash;coming in and out
of the rooms breathless as if something were after him&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The door opened while she was still speaking, cutting her words off in the
middle, and a man came into the room. He was dark and clean-shaven, sallow
rather, with the eyes of imagination, and dark hair growing scantily about the
temples. He was dressed in a shabby tweed suit, and wore an untidy flannel
collar at the neck. The dominant expression of his face was
startled&mdash;hunted; an expression that might any moment leap into the
dreadful stare of terror and announce a total loss of self-control.
</p>

<p>
The moment he saw his visitor a smile spread over his worn features, and he
advanced to shake hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hoped you would come; Mrs. Sivendson said you might be able to find
time,&rdquo; he said simply. His voice was thin and needy. &ldquo;I am very
glad to see you, Dr. Silence. It is &lsquo;Doctor,&rsquo; is it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I am entitled to the description,&rdquo; laughed the other,
&ldquo;but I rarely get it. You know, I do not practise as a regular thing;
that is, I only take cases that specially interest me, or&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not finish the sentence, for the men exchanged a glance of sympathy that
rendered it unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have heard of your great kindness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my hobby,&rdquo; said the other quickly, &ldquo;and my
privilege.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I trust you will still think so when you have heard what I have to tell
you,&rdquo; continued the author, a little wearily. He led the way across the
hall into the little smoking-room where they could talk freely and undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
In the smoking-room, the door shut and privacy about them, Fender&rsquo;s
attitude changed somewhat, and his manner became very grave. The doctor sat
opposite, where he could watch his face. Already, he saw, it looked more
haggard. Evidently it cost him much to refer to his trouble at all.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I have is, in my belief, a profound spiritual affliction,&rdquo; he
began quite bluntly, looking straight into the other&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw that at once,&rdquo; Dr. Silence said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you saw that, of course; my atmosphere must convey that much to any
one with psychic perceptions. Besides which, I feel sure from all I&rsquo;ve
heard, that you are really a soul-doctor, are you not, more than a healer
merely of the body?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think of me too highly,&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;though I
prefer cases, as you know, in which the spirit is disturbed first, the body
afterwards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand, yes. Well, I have experienced a curious disturbance
in&mdash;not in my physical region primarily. I mean my nerves are all right,
and my body is all right. I have no delusions exactly, but my spirit is
tortured by a calamitous fear which first came upon me in a strange
manner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John Silence leaned forward a moment and took the speaker&rsquo;s hand and held
it in his own for a few brief seconds, closing his eyes as he did so. He was
not feeling his pulse, or doing any of the things that doctors ordinarily do;
he was merely absorbing into himself the main note of the man&rsquo;s mental
condition, so as to get completely his own point of view, and thus be able to
treat his case with true sympathy. A very close observer might perhaps have
noticed that a slight tremor ran through his frame after he had held the hand
for a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me quite frankly, Mr. Pender,&rdquo; he said soothingly, releasing
the hand, and with deep attention in his manner, &ldquo;tell me all the steps
that led to the beginning of this invasion. I mean tell me what the particular
drug was, and why you took it, and how it affected you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you know it began with a drug!&rdquo; cried the author, with
undisguised astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I only know from what I observe in you, and in its effect upon myself.
You are in a surprising psychical condition. Certain portions of your
atmosphere are vibrating at a far greater rate than others. This is the effect
of a drug, but of no ordinary drug. Allow me to finish, please. If the higher
rate of vibration spreads all over, you will become, of course, permanently
cognisant of a much larger world than the one you know normally. If, on the
other hand, the rapid portion sinks back to the usual rate, you will lose these
occasional increased perceptions you now have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You amaze me!&rdquo; exclaimed the author; &ldquo;for your words exactly
describe what I have been feeling&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mention this only in passing, and to give you confidence before you
approach the account of your real affliction,&rdquo; continued the doctor.
&ldquo;All perception, as you know, is the result of vibrations; and
clairvoyance simply means becoming sensitive to an increased scale of
vibrations. The awakening of the inner senses we hear so much about means no
more than that. Your partial clairvoyance is easily explained. The only thing
that puzzles me is how you managed to procure the drug, for it is not easy to
get in pure form, and no adulterated tincture could have given you the terrific
impetus I see you have acquired. But, please proceed now and tell me your story
in your own way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This <i>Cannabis indica</i>,&rdquo; the author went on, &ldquo;came into
my possession last autumn while my wife was away. I need not explain how I got
it, for that has no importance; but it was the genuine fluid extract, and I
could not resist the temptation to make an experiment. One of its effects, as
you know, is to induce torrential laughter&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes: sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;I am a writer of humorous tales, and I wished to increase my own
sense of laughter&mdash;to see the ludicrous from an abnormal point of view. I
wished to study it a bit, if possible, and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I took an experimental dose. I starved for six hours to hasten the
effect, locked myself into this room, and gave orders not to be disturbed. Then
I swallowed the stuff and waited.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the effect?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I waited one hour, two, three, four, five hours. Nothing happened. No
laughter came, but only a great weariness instead. Nothing in the room or in my
thoughts came within a hundred miles of a humorous aspect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Always a most uncertain drug,&rdquo; interrupted the doctor. &ldquo;We
make very small use of it on that account.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning I felt so hungry and tired that I
decided to give up the experiment and wait no longer. I drank some milk and
went upstairs to bed. I felt flat and disappointed. I fell asleep at once and
must have slept for about an hour, when I awoke suddenly with a great noise in
my ears. It was the noise of my own laughter! I was simply shaking with
merriment. At first I was bewildered and thought I had been laughing in dreams,
but a moment later I remembered the drug, and was delighted to think that after
all I had got an effect. It had been working all along, only I had
miscalculated the time. The only unpleasant thing <i>then</i> was an odd
feeling that I had not waked naturally, but had been wakened by some one
else&mdash;deliberately. This came to me as a certainty in the middle of my
noisy laughter and distressed me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Any impression who it could have been?&rdquo; asked the doctor, now
listening with close attention to every word, very much on the alert.
</p>

<p>
Pender hesitated and tried to smile. He brushed his hair from his forehead with
a nervous gesture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must tell me all your impressions, even your fancies; they are quite
as important as your certainties.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had a vague idea that it was some one connected with my forgotten
dream, some one who had been at me in my sleep, some one of great strength and
great ability&mdash;of great force&mdash;quite an unusual
personality&mdash;and, I was certain, too&mdash;a woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A good woman?&rdquo; asked John Silence quietly.
</p>

<p>
Pender started a little at the question and his sallow face flushed; it seemed
to surprise him. But he shook his head quickly with an indefinable look of
horror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Evil,&rdquo; he answered briefly, &ldquo;appallingly evil, and yet
mingled with the sheer wickedness of it was also a certain
perverseness&mdash;the perversity of the unbalanced mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated a moment and looked up sharply at his interlocutor. A shade of
suspicion showed itself in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed the doctor, &ldquo;you need not fear that I&rsquo;m
merely humouring you, or think you mad. Far from it. Your story interests me
exceedingly and you furnish me unconsciously with a number of clues as you tell
it. You see, I possess some knowledge of my own as to these psychic
byways.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was shaking with such violent laughter,&rdquo; continued the narrator,
reassured in a moment, &ldquo;though with no clear idea what was amusing me,
that I had the greatest difficulty in getting up for the matches, and was
afraid I should frighten the servants overhead with my explosions. When the gas
was lit I found the room empty, of course, and the door locked as usual. Then I
half dressed and went out on to the landing, my hilarity better under control,
and proceeded to go downstairs. I wished to record my sensations. I stuffed a
handkerchief into my mouth so as not to scream aloud and communicate my
hysterics to the entire household.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the presence of this&mdash;this&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was hanging about me all the time,&rdquo; said Pender, &ldquo;but for
the moment it seemed to have withdrawn. Probably, too, my laughter killed all
other emotions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how long did you take getting downstairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was just coming to that. I see you know all my &lsquo;symptoms&rsquo;
in advance, as it were; for, of course, I thought I should never get to the
bottom. Each step seemed to take five minutes, and crossing the narrow hall at
the foot of the stairs&mdash;well, I could have sworn it was half an
hour&rsquo;s journey had not my watch certified that it was a few seconds. Yet
I walked fast and tried to push on. It was no good. I walked apparently without
advancing, and at that rate it would have taken me a week to get down Putney
Hill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An experimental dose radically alters the scale of time and space
sometimes&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, when at last I got into my study and lit the gas, the change came
horridly, and sudden as a flash of lightning. It was like a douche of icy
water, and in the middle of this storm of laughter&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; what?&rdquo; asked the doctor, leaning forward and peering into his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;I was overwhelmed with terror,&rdquo; said Pender, lowering his
reedy voice at the mere recollection of it.
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment and mopped his forehead. The scared, hunted look in his eyes
now dominated the whole face. Yet, all the time, the corners of his mouth
hinted of possible laughter as though the recollection of that merriment still
amused him. The combination of fear and laughter in his face was very curious,
and lent great conviction to his story; it also lent a bizarre expression of
horror to his gestures.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Terror, was it?&rdquo; repeated the doctor soothingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, terror; for, though the Thing that woke me seemed to have gone, the
memory of it still frightened me, and I collapsed into a chair. Then I locked
the door and tried to reason with myself, but the drug made my movements so
prolonged that it took me five minutes to reach the door, and another five to
get back to the chair again. The laughter, too, kept bubbling up inside
me&mdash;great wholesome laughter that shook me like gusts of wind&mdash;so
that even my terror almost made me laugh. Oh, but I may tell you, Dr. Silence,
it was altogether vile, that mixture of fear and laughter, altogether vile!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, all at once, the things in the room again presented their funny
side to me and set me off laughing more furiously than ever. The bookcase was
ludicrous, the arm-chair a perfect clown, the way the clock looked at me on the
mantelpiece too comic for words; the arrangement of papers and inkstand on the
desk tickled me till I roared and shook and held my sides and the tears
streamed down my cheeks. And that footstool! Oh, that absurd footstool!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He lay back in his chair, laughing to himself and holding up his hands at the
thought of it, and at the sight of him Dr. Silence laughed, too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on, please,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I quite understand. I know
something myself of the hashish laughter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The author pulled himself together and resumed, his face growing quickly grave
again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So, you see, side by side with this extravagant, apparently causeless
merriment, there was also an extravagant, apparently causeless terror. The drug
produced the laughter, I knew; but what brought in the terror I could not
imagine. Everywhere behind the fun lay the fear. It was terror masked by cap
and bells; and I became the playground for two opposing emotions, armed and
fighting to the death. Gradually, then, the impression grew in me that this
fear was caused by the invasion&mdash;so you called it just now&mdash;of the
&lsquo;person&rsquo; who had wakened me: she was utterly evil; inimical to my
soul, or at least to all in me that wished for good. There I stood, sweating
and trembling, laughing at everything in the room, yet all the while with this
white terror mastering my heart. And this creature was putting&mdash;putting
her&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated again, using his handkerchief freely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Putting what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;putting ideas into my mind,&rdquo; he went on glancing nervously
about the room. &ldquo;Actually tapping my thought-stream so as to switch off
the usual current and inject her own. How mad that sounds! I know it, but
it&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s the only way I can express it. Moreover, while the
operation terrified me, the skill with which it was accomplished filled me
afresh with laughter at the clumsiness of men by comparison. Our ignorant,
bungling methods of teaching the minds of others, of inculcating ideas, and so
on, overwhelmed me with laughter when I understood this superior and diabolical
method. Yet my laughter seemed hollow and ghastly, and ideas of evil and
tragedy trod close upon the heels of the comic. Oh, doctor, I tell you again,
it was unnerving!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John Silence sat with his head thrust forward to catch every word of the story
which the other continued to pour out in nervous, jerky sentences and lowered
voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You saw nothing&mdash;no one&mdash;all this time?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not with my eyes. There was no visual hallucination. But in my mind
there began to grow the vivid picture of a woman&mdash;large, dark-skinned,
with white teeth and masculine features, and one eye&mdash;the left&mdash;so
drooping as to appear almost closed. Oh, such a face&mdash;!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A face you would recognise again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pender laughed dreadfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could forget it,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I only wish I
could forget it!&rdquo; Then he sat forward in his chair suddenly, and grasped
the doctor&rsquo;s hand with an emotional gesture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>must</i> tell you how grateful I am for your patience and
sympathy,&rdquo; he cried, with a tremor in his voice, &ldquo;and&mdash;that
you do not think me mad. I have told no one else a quarter of all this, and the
mere freedom of speech&mdash;the relief of sharing my affliction with
another&mdash;has helped me already more than I can possibly say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence pressed his hand and looked steadily into the frightened eyes. His
voice was very gentle when he replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your case, you know, is very singular, but of absorbing interest to
me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for it threatens, not your physical existence but
the temple of your psychical existence&mdash;the inner life. Your mind would
not be permanently affected here and now, in this world; but in the existence
after the body is left behind, you might wake up with your spirit so twisted,
so distorted, so befouled, that you would be <i>spiritually insane</i>&mdash;a
far more radical condition than merely being insane here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There came a strange hush over the room, and between the two men sitting there
facing one another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you really mean&mdash;Good Lord!&rdquo; stammered the author as soon
as he could find his tongue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I mean in detail will keep till a little later, and I need only say
now that I should not have spoken in this way unless I were quite positive of
being able to help you. Oh, there&rsquo;s no doubt as to that, believe me. In
the first place, I am very familiar with the workings of this extraordinary
drug, this drug which has had the chance effect of opening you up to the forces
of another region; and, in the second, I have a firm belief in the reality of
supersensuous occurrences as well as considerable knowledge of psychic
processes acquired by long and painful experiment. The rest is, or should be,
merely sympathetic treatment and practical application. The hashish has
partially opened another world to you by increasing your rate of psychical
vibration, and thus rendering you abnormally sensitive. Ancient forces attached
to this house have attacked you. For the moment I am only puzzled as to their
precise nature; for were they of an ordinary character, I should myself be
psychic enough to feel them. Yet I am conscious of feeling nothing as yet. But
now, please continue, Mr. Pender, and tell me the rest of your wonderful story;
and when you have finished, I will talk about the means of cure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pender shifted his chair a little closer to the friendly doctor and then went
on in the same nervous voice with his narrative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After making some notes of my impressions I finally got upstairs again
to bed. It was four o&rsquo;clock in the morning. I laughed all the way
up&mdash;at the grotesque banisters, the droll physiognomy of the staircase
window, the burlesque grouping of the furniture, and the memory of that
outrageous footstool in the room below; but nothing more happened to alarm or
disturb me, and I woke late in the morning after a dreamless sleep, none the
worse for my experiment except for a slight headache and a coldness of the
extremities due to lowered circulation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fear gone, too?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I seemed to have forgotten it, or at least ascribed it to mere
nervousness. Its reality had gone, anyhow for the time, and all that day I
wrote and wrote and wrote. My sense of laughter seemed wonderfully quickened
and my characters acted without effort out of the heart of true humour. I was
exceedingly pleased with this result of my experiment. But when the
stenographer had taken her departure and I came to read over the pages she had
typed out, I recalled her sudden glances of surprise and the odd way she had
looked up at me while I was dictating. I was amazed at what I read and could
hardly believe I had uttered it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was so distorted. The words, indeed, were mine so far as I could
remember, but the meanings seemed strange. It frightened me. The sense was so
altered. At the very places where my characters were intended to tickle the
ribs, only curious emotions of sinister amusement resulted. Dreadful innuendoes
had managed to creep into the phrases. There was laughter of a kind, but it was
bizarre, horrible, distressing; and my attempt at analysis only increased my
dismay. The story, as it read then, made me shudder, for by virtue of these
slight changes it had come somehow to hold the soul of horror, of horror
disguised as merriment. The framework of humour was there, if you understand
me, but the characters had turned sinister, and their laughter was evil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you show me this writing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The author shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I destroyed it,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;But, in the end, though of
course much perturbed about it, I persuaded myself that it was due to some
after-effect of the drug, a sort of reaction that gave a twist to my mind and
made me read macabre interpretations into words and situations that did not
properly hold them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, meanwhile, did the presence of this person leave you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; that stayed more or less. When my mind was actively employed I
forgot it, but when idle, dreaming, or doing nothing in particular, there she
was beside me, influencing my mind horribly&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In what way, precisely?&rdquo; interrupted the doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Evil, scheming thoughts came to me, visions of crime, hateful pictures
of wickedness, and the kind of bad imagination that so far has been foreign,
indeed impossible, to my normal nature&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The pressure of the Dark Powers upon the personality,&rdquo; murmured
the doctor, making a quick note.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh? I didn&rsquo;t quite catch&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray, go on. I am merely making notes; you shall know their purport
fully later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even when my wife returned I was still aware of this Presence in the
house; it associated itself with my inner personality in most intimate fashion;
and outwardly I always felt oddly constrained to be polite and respectful
towards it&mdash;to open doors, provide chairs and hold myself carefully
deferential when it was about. It became very compelling at last, and, if I
failed in any little particular, I seemed to know that it pursued me about the
house, from one room to another, haunting my very soul in its inmost abode. It
certainly came before my wife so far as my attentions were concerned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, let me first finish the story of my experimental dose, for I took
it again the third night, and underwent a very similar experience, delayed like
the first in coming, and then carrying me off my feet when it did come with a
rush of this false demon-laughter. This time, however, there was a reversal of
the changed scale of space and time; it shortened instead of lengthened, so
that I dressed and got downstairs in about twenty seconds, and the couple of
hours I stayed and worked in the study passed literally like a period of ten
minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is often true of an overdose,&rdquo; interjected the doctor,
&ldquo;and you may go a mile in a few minutes, or a few yards in a quarter of
an hour. It is quite incomprehensible to those who have never experienced it,
and is a curious proof that time and space are merely forms of thought.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; Pender went on, talking more and more rapidly in his
excitement, &ldquo;another extraordinary effect came to me, and I experienced a
curious changing of the senses, so that I perceived external things through one
large main sense-channel instead of through the five divisions known as sight,
smell, touch, and so forth. You will, I know, understand me when I tell you
that I <i>heard</i> sights and <i>saw</i> sounds. No language can make this
comprehensible, of course, and I can only say, for instance, that the striking
of the clock I saw as a visible picture in the air before me. I saw the sounds
of the tinkling bell. And in precisely the same way I heard the colours in the
room, especially the colours of those books in the shelf behind you. Those red
bindings I heard in deep sounds, and the yellow covers of the French bindings
next to them made a shrill, piercing note not unlike the chattering of
starlings. That brown bookcase muttered, and those green curtains opposite kept
up a constant sort of rippling sound like the lower notes of a wood-horn. But I
only was conscious of these sounds when I looked steadily at the different
objects, and thought about them. The room, you understand, was not full of a
chorus of notes; but when I concentrated my mind upon a colour, I heard, as
well as saw, it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a known, though rarely obtained, effect of <i>Cannabis
indica</i>,&rdquo; observed the doctor. &ldquo;And it provoked laughter again,
did it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only the muttering of the cupboard-bookcase made me laugh. It was so
like a great animal trying to get itself noticed, and made me think of a
performing bear&mdash;which is full of a kind of pathetic humour, you know. But
this mingling of the senses produced no confusion in my brain. On the contrary,
I was unusually clear-headed and experienced an intensification of
consciousness, and felt marvellously alive and keen-minded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Moreover, when I took up a pencil in obedience to an impulse to
sketch&mdash;a talent not normally mine&mdash;I found that I could draw nothing
but heads, nothing, in fact, but one head&mdash;always the same&mdash;the head
of a dark-skinned woman, with huge and terrible features and a very drooping
left eye; and so well drawn, too, that I was amazed, as you may
imagine&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the expression of the face&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pender hesitated a moment for words, casting about with his hands in the air
and hunching his shoulders. A perceptible shudder ran over him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I can only describe as&mdash;<i>blackness</i>,&rdquo; he replied in
a low tone; &ldquo;the face of a dark and evil soul.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You destroyed that, too?&rdquo; queried the doctor sharply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; I have kept the drawings,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh, and rose to
get them from a drawer in the writing-desk behind him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here is all that remains of the pictures, you see,&rdquo; he added,
pushing a number of loose sheets under the doctor&rsquo;s eyes; &ldquo;nothing
but a few scrawly lines. That&rsquo;s all I found the next morning. I had
really drawn no heads at all&mdash;nothing but those lines and blots and
wriggles. The pictures were entirely subjective, and existed only in my mind
which constructed them out of a few wild strokes of the pen. Like the altered
scale of space and time it was a complete delusion. These all passed, of
course, with the passing of the drug&rsquo;s effects. But the other thing did
not pass. I mean, the presence of that Dark Soul remained with me. It is here
still. It is real. I don&rsquo;t know how I can escape from it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is attached to the house, not to you personally. You must leave the
house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Only I cannot afford to leave the house, for my work is my sole
means of support, and&mdash;well, you see, since this change I cannot even
write. They are horrible, these mirthless tales I now write, with their mockery
of laughter, their diabolical suggestion. Horrible? I shall go mad if this
continues.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He screwed his face up and looked about the room as though he expected to see
some haunting shape.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This influence in this house induced by my experiment, has killed in a
flash, in a sudden stroke, the sources of my humour, and though I still go on
writing funny tales&mdash;I have a certain name you know&mdash;my inspiration
has dried up, and much of what I write I have to burn&mdash;yes, doctor, to
burn, before any one sees it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As utterly alien to your own mind and personality?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Utterly! As though some one else had written it&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And shocking!&rdquo; He passed his hand over his eyes a moment and let
the breath escape softly through his teeth. &ldquo;Yet most damnably clever in
the consummate way the vile suggestions are insinuated under cover of a kind of
high drollery. My stenographer left me of course&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve been
afraid to take another&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John Silence got up and began to walk about the room leisurely without
speaking; he appeared to be examining the pictures on the wall and reading the
names of the books lying about. Presently he paused on the hearthrug, with his
back to the fire, and turned to look his patient quietly in the eyes.
Pender&rsquo;s face was grey and drawn; the hunted expression dominated it; the
long recital had told upon him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Pender,&rdquo; he said, a curious glow showing about his
fine, quiet face; &ldquo;thank you for the sincerity and frankness of your
account. But I think now there is nothing further I need ask you.&rdquo; He
indulged in a long scrutiny of the author&rsquo;s haggard features drawing
purposely the man&rsquo;s eyes to his own and then meeting them with a look of
power and confidence calculated to inspire even the feeblest soul with courage.
&ldquo;And, to begin with,&rdquo; he added, smiling pleasantly, &ldquo;let me
assure you without delay that you need have no alarm, for you are no more
insane or deluded than I myself am&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pender heaved a deep sigh and tried to return the smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;and this is simply a case, so far as I can judge at present, of a
very singular psychical invasion, and a very sinister one, too, if you perhaps
understand what I mean&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an odd expression; you used it before, you know,&rdquo; said
the author wearily, yet eagerly listening to every word of the diagnosis, and
deeply touched by the intelligent sympathy which did not at once indicate the
lunatic asylum.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;and an odd affliction, too,
you&rsquo;ll allow, yet one not unknown to the nations of antiquity, nor to
those moderns, perhaps, who recognise the freedom of action under certain
pathogenic conditions between this world and another.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you think,&rdquo; asked Pender hastily, &ldquo;that it is all
primarily due to the <i>Cannabis</i>? There is nothing radically amiss with
myself&mdash;nothing incurable, or&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Due entirely to the overdose,&rdquo; Dr. Silence replied emphatically,
&ldquo;to the drug&rsquo;s direct action upon your psychical being. It rendered
you ultra-sensitive and made you respond to an increased rate of vibration.
And, let me tell you, Mr. Pender, that your experiment might have had results
far more dire. It has brought you into touch with a somewhat singular class of
Invisible, but of one, I think, chiefly human in character. You might, however,
just as easily have been drawn out of human range altogether, and the results
of such a contingency would have been exceedingly terrible. Indeed, you would
not now be here to tell the tale. I need not alarm you on that score, but
mention it as a warning you will not misunderstand or underrate after what you
have been through.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look puzzled. You do not quite gather what I am driving at; and it
is not to be expected that you should, for you, I suppose, are the nominal
Christian with the nominal Christian&rsquo;s lofty standard of ethics, and his
utter ignorance of spiritual possibilities. Beyond a somewhat childish
understanding of &lsquo;spiritual wickedness in high places,&rsquo; you
probably have no conception of what is possible once you break-down the slender
gulf that is mercifully fixed between you and that Outer World. But my studies
and training have taken me far outside these orthodox trips, and I have made
experiments that I could scarcely speak to you about in language that would be
intelligible to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment to note the breathless interest of Pender&rsquo;s face and
manner. Every word he uttered was calculated; he knew exactly the value and
effect of the emotions he desired to waken in the heart of the afflicted being
before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And from certain knowledge I have gained through various
experiences,&rdquo; he continued calmly, &ldquo;I can diagnose your case as I
said before to be one of psychical invasion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the nature of this&mdash;er&mdash;invasion?&rdquo; stammered the
bewildered writer of humorous tales.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no reason why I should not say at once that I do not yet quite
know,&rdquo; replied Dr. Silence. &ldquo;I may first have to make one or two
experiments&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On me?&rdquo; gasped Pender, catching his breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; the doctor said, with a grave smile, &ldquo;but with
your assistance, perhaps. I shall want to test the conditions of the
house&mdash;to ascertain, impossible, the character of the forces, of this
strange personality that has been haunting you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At present you have no idea exactly
who&mdash;what&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo; asked the other in a wild flurry of
interest, dread and amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a very good idea, but no proof rather,&rdquo; returned the
doctor. &ldquo;The effects of the drug in altering the scale of time and space,
and merging the senses have nothing primarily to do with the invasion. They
come to any one who is fool enough to take an experimental dose. It is the
other features of your case that are unusual. You see, you are now in touch
with certain violent emotions, desires, purposes, still active in this house,
that were produced in the past by some powerful and evil personality that lived
here. How long ago, or why they still persist so forcibly, I cannot positively
say. But I should judge that they are merely forces acting automatically with
the momentum of their terrific original impetus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not directed by a living being, a conscious will, you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly not&mdash;but none the less dangerous on that account, and more
difficult to deal with. I cannot explain to you in a few minutes the nature of
such things, for you have not made the studies that would enable you to follow
me; but I have reason to believe that on the dissolution at death of a human
being, its forces may still persist and continue to act in a blind, unconscious
fashion. As a rule they speedily dissipate themselves, but in the case of a
very powerful personality they may last a long time. And, in some
cases&mdash;of which I incline to think this is one&mdash;these forces may
coalesce with certain non-human entities who thus continue their life
indefinitely and increase their strength to an unbelievable degree. If the
original personality was evil, the beings attracted to the left-over forces
will also be evil. In this case, I think there has been an unusual and dreadful
aggrandisement of the thoughts and purposes left behind long ago by a woman of
consummate wickedness and great personal power of character and intellect. Now,
do you begin to see what I am driving at a little?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pender stared fixedly at his companion, plain horror showing in his eyes. But
he found nothing to say, and the doctor continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In your case, predisposed by the action of the drug, you have
experienced the rush of these forces in undiluted strength. They wholly
obliterate in you the sense of humour, fancy, imagination,&mdash;all that makes
for cheerfulness and hope. They seek, though perhaps automatically only, to
oust your own thoughts and establish themselves in their place. You are the
victim of a psychical invasion. At the same time, you have become clairvoyant
in the true sense. You are also a clairvoyant victim.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pender mopped his face and sighed. He left his chair and went over to the
fireplace to warm himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must think me a quack to talk like this, or a madman,&rdquo; laughed
Dr. Silence. &ldquo;But never mind that. I have come to help you, and I can
help you if you will do what I tell you. It is very simple: you must leave this
house at once. Oh, never mind the difficulties; we will deal with those
together. I can place another house at your disposal, or I would take the lease
here off your hands, and later have it pulled down. Your case interests me
greatly, and I mean to see you through, so that you have no anxiety, and can
drop back into your old groove of work tomorrow! The drug has provided you, and
therefore me, with a shortcut to a very interesting experience. I am grateful
to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The author poked the fire vigorously, emotion rising in him like a tide. He
glanced towards the door nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no need to alarm your wife or to tell her the details of our
conversation,&rdquo; pursued the other quietly. &ldquo;Let her know that you
will soon be in possession again of your sense of humour and your health, and
explain that I am lending you another house for six months. Meanwhile I may
have the right to use this house for a night or two for my experiment. Is that
understood between us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can only thank you from the bottom of my heart,&rdquo; stammered
Pender, unable to find words to express his gratitude.
</p>

<p>
Then he hesitated for a moment, searching the doctor&rsquo;s face anxiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your experiment with the house?&rdquo; he said at length.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of the simplest character, my dear Mr. Pender. Although I am myself an
artificially trained psychic, and consequently aware of the presence of
discarnate entities as a rule, I have so far felt nothing here at all. This
makes me sure that the forces acting here are of an unusual description. What I
propose to do is to make an experiment with a view of drawing out this evil,
coaxing it from its lair, so to speak, in order that it may <i>exhaust itself
through me</i> and become dissipated for ever. I have already been
inoculated,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I consider myself to be immune.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heavens above!&rdquo; gasped the author, collapsing on to a chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hell beneath! might be a more appropriate exclamation,&rdquo; the doctor
laughed. &ldquo;But, seriously, Mr. Pender, this is what I propose to
do&mdash;with your permission.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;you have my
permission and my best wishes for success. I can see no possible objection,
but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I pray to Heaven you will not undertake this experiment alone, will
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear, no; not alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will take a companion with good nerves, and reliable in case of
disaster, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall bring two companions,&rdquo; the doctor said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s better. I feel easier. I am sure you must have among
your acquaintances men who&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall not think of bringing men, Mr. Pender.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The other looked up sharply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, or women either; or children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Who will you bring, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Animals,&rdquo; explained the doctor, unable to prevent a smile at his
companion&rsquo;s expression of surprise&mdash;&ldquo;two animals, a cat and a
dog.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pender stared as if his eyes would drop out upon the floor, and then led the
way without another word into the adjoining room where his wife was awaiting
them for tea.
</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>
A few days later the humorist and his wife, with minds greatly relieved, moved
into a small furnished house placed at their free disposal in another part of
London; and John Silence, intent upon his approaching experiment, made ready to
spend a night in the empty house on the top of Putney Hill. Only two rooms were
prepared for occupation: the study on the ground floor and the bedroom
immediately above it; all other doors were to be locked, and no servant was to
be left in the house. The motor had orders to call for him at nine
o&rsquo;clock the following morning.
</p>

<p>
And, meanwhile, his secretary had instructions to look up the past history and
associations of the place, and learn everything he could concerning the
character of former occupants, recent or remote.
</p>

<p>
The animals, by whose sensitiveness he intended to test any unusual conditions
in the atmosphere of the building, Dr. Silence selected with care and judgment.
He believed (and had already made curious experiments to prove it) that animals
were more often, and more truly, clairvoyant than human beings. Many of them,
he felt convinced, possessed powers of perception far superior to that mere
keenness of the senses common to all dwellers in the wilds where the senses
grow specially alert; they had what he termed &ldquo;animal
clairvoyance,&rdquo; and from his experiments with horses, dogs, cats, and even
birds, he had drawn certain deductions, which, however, need not be referred to
in detail here.
</p>

<p>
Cats, in particular, he believed, were almost continuously conscious of a
larger field of vision, too detailed even for a photographic camera, and quite
beyond the reach of normal human organs. He had, further, observed that while
dogs were usually terrified in the presence of such phenomena, cats on the
other hand were soothed and satisfied. They welcomed manifestations as
something belonging peculiarly to their own region.
</p>

<p>
He selected his animals, therefore, with wisdom so that they might afford a
differing test, each in its own way, and that one should not merely communicate
its own excitement to the other. He took a dog and a cat.
</p>

<p>
The cat he chose, now full grown, had lived with him since kittenhood, a
kittenhood of perplexing sweetness and audacious mischief. Wayward it was and
fanciful, ever playing its own mysterious games in the corners of the room,
jumping at invisible nothings, leaping sideways into the air and falling with
tiny moccasined feet on to another part of the carpet, yet with an air of
dignified earnestness which showed that the performance was necessary to its
own well-being, and not done merely to impress a stupid human audience. In the
middle of elaborate washing it would look up, startled, as though to stare at
the approach of some Invisible, cocking its little head sideways and putting
out a velvet pad to inspect cautiously. Then it would get absent-minded, and
stare with equal intentness in another direction (just to confuse the
onlookers), and suddenly go on furiously washing its body again, but in quite a
new place. Except for a white patch on its breast it was coal black. And its
name was&mdash;Smoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Smoke&rdquo; described its temperament as well as its appearance. Its
movements, its individuality, its posing as a little furry mass of concealed
mysteries, its elfin-like elusiveness, all combined to justify its name; and a
subtle painter might have pictured it as a wisp of floating smoke, the fire
below betraying itself at two points only&mdash;the glowing eyes.
</p>

<p>
All its forces ran to intelligence&mdash;secret intelligence, the wordless
incalculable intuition of the Cat. It was, indeed, <i>the</i> cat for the
business in hand.
</p>

<p>
The selection of the dog was not so simple, for the doctor owned many; but
after much deliberation he chose a collie, called Flame from his yellow coat.
True, it was a trifle old, and stiff in the joints, and even beginning to grow
deaf, but, on the other hand, it was a very particular friend of Smoke&rsquo;s,
and had fathered it from kittenhood upwards so that a subtle understanding
existed between them. It was this that turned the balance in its favour, this
and its courage. Moreover, though good-tempered, it was a terrible fighter, and
its anger when provoked by a righteous cause was a fury of fire, and
irresistible.
</p>

<p>
It had come to him quite young, straight from the shepherd, with the air of the
hills yet in its nostrils, and was then little more than skin and bones and
teeth. For a collie it was sturdily built, its nose blunter than most, its
yellow hair stiff rather than silky, and it had full eyes, unlike the slit eyes
of its breed. Only its master could touch it, for it ignored strangers, and
despised their pattings&mdash;when any dared to pat it. There was something
patriarchal about the old beast. He was in earnest, and went through life with
tremendous energy and big things in view, as though he had the reputation of
his whole race to uphold. And to watch him fighting against odds was to
understand why he was terrible.
</p>

<p>
In his relations with Smoke he was always absurdly gentle; also he was
fatherly; and at the same time betrayed a certain diffidence or shyness. He
recognised that Smoke called for strong yet respectful management. The
cat&rsquo;s circuitous methods puzzled him, and his elaborate pretences perhaps
shocked the dog&rsquo;s liking for direct, undisguised action. Yet, while he
failed to comprehend these tortuous feline mysteries, he was never contemptuous
or condescending; and he presided over the safety of his furry black friend
somewhat as a father, loving, but intuitive, might superintend the vagaries of
a wayward and talented child. And, in return, Smoke rewarded him with
exhibitions of fascinating and audacious mischief.
</p>

<p>
And these brief descriptions of their characters are necessary for the proper
understanding of what subsequently took place.
</p>

<p>
With Smoke sleeping in the folds of his fur coat, and the collie lying watchful
on the seat opposite, John Silence went down in his motor after dinner on the
night of November 15th.
</p>

<p>
And the fog was so dense that they were obliged to travel at quarter speed the
entire way.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
It was after ten o&rsquo;clock when he dismissed the motor and entered the
dingy little house with the latchkey provided by Pender. He found the hall gas
turned low, and a fire in the study. Books and food had also been placed ready
by the servant according to instructions. Coils of fog rushed in after him
through the open door and filled the hall and passage with its cold discomfort.
</p>

<p>
The first thing Dr. Silence did was to lock up Smoke in the study with a saucer
of milk before the fire, and then make a search of the house with Flame. The
dog ran cheerfully behind him all the way while he tried the doors of the other
rooms to make sure they were locked. He nosed about into corners and made
little excursions on his own account. His manner was expectant. He knew there
must be something unusual about the proceeding, because it was contrary to the
habits of his whole life not to be asleep at this hour on the mat in front of
the fire. He kept looking up into his master&rsquo;s face, as door after door
was tried, with an expression of intelligent sympathy, but at the same time a
certain air of disapproval. Yet everything his master did was good in his eyes,
and he betrayed as little impatience as possible with all this unnecessary
journeying to and fro. If the doctor was pleased to play this sort of game at
such an hour of the night, it was surely not for him to object. So he played
it, too; and was very busy and earnest about it into the bargain.
</p>

<p>
After an uneventful search they came down again to the study, and here Dr.
Silence discovered Smoke washing his face calmly in front of the fire. The
saucer of milk was licked dry and clean; the preliminary examination that cats
always make in new surroundings had evidently been satisfactorily concluded. He
drew an arm-chair up to the fire, stirred the coals into a blaze, arranged the
table and lamp to his satisfaction for reading, and then prepared
surreptitiously to watch the animals. He wished to observe them carefully
without their being aware of it.
</p>

<p>
Now, in spite of their respective ages, it was the regular custom of these two
to play together every night before sleep. Smoke always made the advances,
beginning with grave impudence to pat the dog&rsquo;s tail, and Flame played
cumbrously, with condescension. It was his duty, rather than pleasure; he was
glad when it was over, and sometimes he was very determined and refused to play
at all.
</p>

<p>
And this night was one of the occasions on which he was firm.
</p>

<p>
The doctor, looking cautiously over the top of his book, watched the cat begin
the performance. It started by gazing with an innocent expression at the dog
where he lay with nose on paws and eyes wide open in the middle of the floor.
Then it got up and made as though it meant to walk to the door, going
deliberately and very softly. Flame&rsquo;s eyes followed it until it was
beyond the range of sight, and then the cat turned sharply and began patting
his tail tentatively with one paw. The tail moved slightly in reply, and Smoke
changed paws and tapped it again. The dog, however, did not rise to play as was
his wont, and the cat fell to parting it briskly with both paws. Flame still
lay motionless.
</p>

<p>
This puzzled and bored the cat, and it went round and stared hard into its
friend&rsquo;s face to see what was the matter. Perhaps some inarticulate
message flashed from the dog&rsquo;s eyes into its own little brain, making it
understand that the programme for the night had better not begin with play.
Perhaps it only realised that its friend was immovable. But, whatever the
reason, its usual persistence thenceforward deserted it, and it made no further
attempts at persuasion. Smoke yielded at once to the dog&rsquo;s mood; it sat
down where it was and began to wash.
</p>

<p>
But the washing, the doctor noted, was by no means its real purpose; it only
used it to mask something else; it stopped at the most busy and furious moments
and began to stare about the room. Its thoughts wandered absurdly. It peered
intently at the curtains; at the shadowy corners; at empty space above; leaving
its body in curiously awkward positions for whole minutes together. Then it
turned sharply and stared with a sudden signal of intelligence at the dog, and
Flame at once rose somewhat stiffly to his feet and began to wander aimlessly
and restlessly to and fro about the floor. Smoke followed him, padding quietly
at his heels. Between them they made what seemed to be a deliberate search of
the room.
</p>

<p>
And, here, as he watched them, noting carefully every detail of the performance
over the top of his book, yet making no effort to interfere, it seemed to the
doctor that the first beginnings of a faint distress betrayed themselves in the
collie, and in the cat the stirrings of a vague excitement.
</p>

<p>
He observed them closely. The fog was thick in the air, and the tobacco smoke
from his pipe added to its density; the furniture at the far end stood mistily,
and where the shadows congregated in hanging clouds under the ceiling, it was
difficult to see clearly at all; the lamplight only reached to a level of five
feet from the floor, above which came layers of comparative darkness, so that
the room appeared twice as lofty as it actually was. By means of the lamp and
the fire, however, the carpet was everywhere clearly visible.
</p>

<p>
The animals made their silent tour of the floor, sometimes the dog leading,
sometimes the cat; occasionally they looked at one another as though exchanging
signals; and once or twice, in spite of the limited space, he lost sight of one
or other among the fog and the shadows. Their curiosity, it appeared to him,
was something more than the excitement lurking in the unknown territory of a
strange room; yet, so far, it was impossible to test this, and he purposely
kept his mind quietly receptive lest the smallest mental excitement on his part
should communicate itself to the animals and thus destroy the value of their
independent behaviour.
</p>

<p>
They made a very thorough journey, leaving no piece of furniture unexamined, or
unsmelt. Flame led the way, walking slowly with lowered head, and Smoke
followed demurely at his heels, making a transparent pretence of not being
interested, yet missing nothing. And, at length, they returned, the old collie
first, and came to rest on the mat before the fire. Flame rested his muzzle on
his master&rsquo;s knee, smiling beatifically while he patted the yellow head
and spoke his name; and Smoke, coming a little later, pretending he came by
chance, looked from the empty saucer to his face, lapped up the milk when it
was given him to the last drop, and then sprang upon his knees and curled round
for the sleep it had fully earned and intended to enjoy.
</p>

<p>
Silence descended upon the room. Only the breathing of the dog upon the mat
came through the deep stillness, like the pulse of time marking the minutes;
and the steady drip, drip of the fog outside upon the window-ledges dismally
testified to the inclemency of the night beyond. And the soft crashings of the
coals as the fire settled down into the grate became less and less audible as
the fire sank and the flames resigned their fierceness.
</p>

<p>
It was now well after eleven o&rsquo;clock, and Dr. Silence devoted himself
again to his book. He read the words on the printed page and took in their
meaning superficially, yet without starting into life the correlations of
thought and suggestions that should accompany interesting reading. Underneath,
all the while, his mental energies were absorbed in watching, listening,
waiting for what might come. He was not over-sanguine himself, yet he did not
wish to be taken by surprise. Moreover, the animals, his sensitive barometers,
had incontinently gone to sleep.
</p>

<p>
After reading a dozen pages, however, he realised that his mind was really
occupied in reviewing the features of Pender&rsquo;s extraordinary story, and
that it was no longer necessary to steady his imagination by studying the dull
paragraphs detailed in the pages before him. He laid down his book accordingly,
and allowed his thoughts to dwell upon the features of the Case. Speculations
as to the meaning, however, he rigorously suppressed, knowing that such
thoughts would act upon his imagination like wind upon the glowing embers of a
fire.
</p>

<p>
As the night wore on the silence grew deeper and deeper, and only at rare
intervals he heard the sound of wheels on the main road a hundred yards away,
where the horses went at a walking pace owing to the density of the fog. The
echo of pedestrian footsteps no longer reached him, the clamour of occasional
voices no longer came down the side street. The night, muffled by fog, shrouded
by veils of ultimate mystery, hung about the haunted villa like a doom. Nothing
in the house stirred. Stillness, in a thick blanket, lay over the upper
storeys. Only the mist in the room grew more dense, he thought, and the damp
cold more penetrating. Certainly, from time to time, he shivered.
</p>

<p>
The collie, now deep in slumber, moved occasionally,&mdash;grunted, sighed, or
twitched his legs in dreams. Smoke lay on his knees, a pool of warm, black fur,
only the closest observation detecting the movement of his sleek sides. It was
difficult to distinguish exactly where his head and body joined in that circle
of glistening hair; only a black satin nose and a tiny tip of pink tongue
betrayed the secret.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence watched him, and felt comfortable. The collie&rsquo;s breathing was
soothing. The fire was well built, and would burn for another two hours without
attention. He was not conscious of the least nervousness. He particularly
wished to remain in his ordinary and normal state of mind, and to force
nothing. If sleep came naturally, he would let it come&mdash;and even welcome
it. The coldness of the room, when the fire died down later, would be sure to
wake him again; and it would then be time enough to carry these sleeping
barometers up to bed. From various psychic premonitions he knew quite well that
the night would not pass without adventure; but he did not wish to force its
arrival; and he wished to remain normal, and let the animals remain normal, so
that, when it came, it would be unattended by excitement or by any straining of
the attention. Many experiments had made him wise. And, for the rest, he had no
fear.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, after a time, he did fall asleep as he had expected, and the last
thing he remembered, before oblivion slipped up over his eyes like soft wool,
was the picture of Flame stretching all four legs at once, and sighing noisily
as he sought a more comfortable position for his paws and muzzle upon the mat.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
It was a good deal later when he became aware that a weight lay upon his chest,
and that something was pencilling over his face and mouth. A soft touch on the
cheek woke him. Something was patting him.
</p>

<p>
He sat up with a jerk, and found himself staring straight into a pair of
brilliant eyes, half green, half black. Smoke&rsquo;s face lay level with his
own; and the cat had climbed up with its front paws upon his chest.
</p>

<p>
The lamp had burned low and the fire was nearly out, yet Dr. Silence saw in a
moment that the cat was in an excited state. It kneaded with its front paws
into his chest, shifting from one to the other. He felt them prodding against
him. It lifted a leg very carefully and patted his cheek gingerly. Its fur, he
saw, was standing ridgewise upon its back; the ears were flattened back
somewhat; the tail was switching sharply. The cat, of course, had wakened him
with a purpose, and the instant he realised this, he set it upon the arm of the
chair and sprang up with a quick turn to face the empty room behind him. By
some curious instinct, his arms of their own accord assumed an attitude of
defence in front of him, as though to ward off something that threatened his
safety. Yet nothing was visible. Only shapes of fog hung about rather heavily
in the air, moving slightly to and fro.
</p>

<p>
His mind was now fully alert, and the last vestiges of sleep gone. He turned
the lamp higher and peered about him. Two things he became aware of at once:
one, that Smoke, while excited, was <i>pleasurably</i> excited; the other, that
the collie was no longer visible upon the mat at his feet. He had crept away to
the corner of the wall farthest from the window, and lay watching the room with
wide-open eyes, in which lurked plainly something of alarm.
</p>

<p>
Something in the dog&rsquo;s behaviour instantly struck Dr. Silence as unusual,
and, calling him by name, he moved across to pat him. Flame got up, wagged his
tail, and came over slowly to the rug, uttering a low sound that was half
growl, half whine. He was evidently perturbed about something, and his master
was proceeding to administer comfort when his attention was suddenly drawn to
the antics of his other four-footed companion, the cat.
</p>

<p>
And what he saw filled him with something like amazement.
</p>

<p>
Smoke had jumped down from the back of the arm-chair and now occupied the
middle of the carpet, where, with tail erect and legs stiff as ramrods, it was
steadily pacing backwards and forwards in a narrow space, uttering, as it did
so, those curious little guttural sounds of pleasure that only an animal of the
feline species knows how to make expressive of supreme happiness. Its stiffened
legs and arched back made it appear larger than usual, and the black visage
wore a smile of beatific joy. Its eyes blazed magnificently; it was in an
ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
At the end of every few paces it turned sharply and stalked back again along
the same line, padding softly, and purring like a roll of little muffled drums.
It behaved precisely as though it were rubbing against the ankles of some one
who remained invisible. A thrill ran down the doctor&rsquo;s spine as he stood
and stared. His experiment was growing interesting at last.
</p>

<p>
He called the collie&rsquo;s attention to his friend&rsquo;s performance to see
whether he too was aware of anything standing there upon the carpet, and the
dog&rsquo;s behaviour was significant and corroborative. He came as far as his
master&rsquo;s knees and then stopped dead, refusing to investigate closely. In
vain Dr. Silence urged him; he wagged his tail, whined a little, and stood in a
half-crouching attitude, staring alternately at the cat and at his
master&rsquo;s face. He was, apparently, both puzzled and alarmed, and the
whine went deeper and deeper down into his throat till it changed into an ugly
snarl of awakening anger.
</p>

<p>
Then the doctor called to him in a tone of command he had never known to be
disregarded; but still the dog, though springing up in response, declined to
move nearer. He made tentative motions, pranced a little like a dog about to
take to water, pretended to bark, and ran to and fro on the carpet. So far
there was no actual fear in his manner, but he was uneasy and anxious, and
nothing would induce him to go within touching distance of the walking cat.
Once he made a complete circuit, but always carefully out of reach; and in the
end he returned to his master&rsquo;s legs and rubbed vigorously against him.
Flame did not like the performance at all: that much was quite clear.
</p>

<p>
For several minutes John Silence watched the performance of the cat with
profound attention and without interfering. Then he called to the animal by
name.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Smoke, you mysterious beastie, what in the world are you about?&rdquo;
he said, in a coaxing tone.
</p>

<p>
The cat looked up at him for a moment, smiling in its ecstasy, blinking its
eyes, but too happy to pause. He spoke to it again. He called to it several
times, and each time it turned upon him its blazing eyes, drunk with inner
delight, opening and shutting its lips, its body large and rigid with
excitement. Yet it never for one instant paused in its short journeys to and
fro.
</p>

<p>
He noted exactly what it did: it walked, he saw, the same number of paces each
time, some six or seven steps, and then it turned sharply and retraced them. By
the pattern of the great roses in the carpet he measured it. It kept to the
same direction and the same line. It behaved precisely as though it were
rubbing against something solid. Undoubtedly, there was something standing
there on that strip of carpet, something invisible to the doctor, something
that alarmed the dog, yet caused the cat unspeakable pleasure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Smokie!&rdquo; he called again, &ldquo;Smokie, you black mystery, what
is it excites you so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again the cat looked up at him for a brief second, and then continued its
sentry-walk, blissfully happy, intensely preoccupied. And, for an instant, as
he watched it, the doctor was aware that a faint uneasiness stirred in the
depths of his own being, focusing itself for the moment upon this curious
behaviour of the uncanny creature before him.
</p>

<p>
There rose in him quite a new realisation of the mystery connected with the
whole feline tribe, but especially with that common member of it, the domestic
cat&mdash;their hidden lives, their strange aloofness, their incalculable
subtlety. How utterly remote from anything that human beings understood lay the
sources of their elusive activities. As he watched the indescribable bearing of
the little creature mincing along the strip of carpet under his eyes,
coquetting with the powers of darkness, welcoming, maybe, some fearsome
visitor, there stirred in his heart a feeling strangely akin to awe. Its
indifference to human kind, its serene superiority to the obvious, struck him
forcibly with fresh meaning; so remote, so inaccessible seemed the secret
purposes of its real life, so alien to the blundering honesty of other animals.
Its absolute poise of bearing brought into his mind the opium-eater&rsquo;s
words that &ldquo;no dignity is perfect which does not at some point ally
itself with the mysterious&rdquo;; and he became suddenly aware that the
presence of the dog in this foggy, haunted room on the top of Putney Hill was
uncommonly welcome to him. He was glad to feel that Flame&rsquo;s dependable
personality was with him. The savage growling at his heels was a pleasant
sound. He was glad to hear it. That marching cat made him uneasy.
</p>

<p>
Finding that Smoke paid no further attention to his words, the doctor decided
upon action. Would it rub against his leg, too? He would take it by surprise
and see.
</p>

<p>
He stepped quickly forward and placed himself upon the exact strip of carpet
where it walked.
</p>

<p>
But no cat is ever taken by surprise! The moment he occupied the space of the
Intruder, setting his feet on the woven roses midway in the line of travel,
Smoke suddenly stopped purring and sat down. If lifted up its face with the
most innocent stare imaginable of its green eyes. He could have sworn it
laughed. It was a perfect child again. In a single second it had resumed its
simple, domestic manner; and it gazed at him in such a way that he almost felt
Smoke was the normal being, and <i>his</i> was the eccentric behaviour that was
being watched. It was consummate, the manner in which it brought about this
change so easily and so quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Superb little actor!&rdquo; he laughed in spite of himself, and stooped
to stroke the shining black back. But, in a flash, as he touched its fur, the
cat turned and spat at him viciously, striking at his hand with one paw. Then,
with a hurried scutter of feet, it shot like a shadow across the floor and a
moment later was calmly sitting over by the window-curtains washing its face as
though nothing interested it in the whole world but the cleanness of its cheeks
and whiskers.
</p>

<p>
John Silence straightened himself up and drew a long breath. He realised that
the performance was temporarily at an end. The collie, meanwhile, who had
watched the whole proceeding with marked disapproval, had now lain down again
upon the mat by the fire, no longer growling. It seemed to the doctor just as
though something that had entered the room while he slept, alarming the dog,
yet bringing happiness to the cat, had now gone out again, leaving all as it
was before. Whatever it was that excited its blissful attentions had retreated
for the moment.
</p>

<p>
He realised this intuitively. Smoke evidently realised it, too, for presently
he deigned to march back to the fireplace and jump upon his master&rsquo;s
knees. Dr. Silence, patient and determined, settled down once more to his book.
The animals soon slept; the fire blazed cheerfully; and the cold fog from
outside poured into the room through every available chink and crannie.
</p>

<p>
For a long time silence and peace reigned in the room and Dr. Silence availed
himself of the quietness to make careful notes of what had happened. He entered
for future use in other cases an exhaustive analysis of what he had observed,
especially with regard to the effect upon the two animals. It is impossible
here, nor would it be intelligible to the reader unversed in the knowledge of
the region known to a scientifically trained psychic like Dr. Silence, to
detail these observations. But to him it was clear, up to a certain
point&mdash;for the rest he must still wait and watch. So far, at least, he
realised that while he slept in the chair&mdash;that is, while his will was
dormant&mdash;the room had suffered intrusion from what he recognised as an
intensely active Force, and might later be forced to acknowledge as something
more than merely a blind force, namely, a distinct personality.
</p>

<p>
So far it had affected himself scarcely at all, but had acted directly upon the
simpler organisms of the animals. It stimulated keenly the centres of the
cat&rsquo;s psychic being, inducing a state of instant happiness (intensifying
its consciousness probably in the same way a drug or stimulant intensifies that
of a human being); whereas it alarmed the less sensitive dog, causing it to
feel a vague apprehension and distress.
</p>

<p>
His own sudden action and exhibition of energy had served to disperse it
temporarily, yet he felt convinced&mdash;the indications were not lacking even
while he sat there making notes&mdash;that it still remained near to him,
conditionally if not spatially, and was, as it were, gathering force for a
second attack.
</p>

<p>
And, further, he intuitively understood that the relations between the two
animals had undergone a subtle change: that the cat had become immeasurably
superior, confident, sure of itself in its own peculiar region, whereas Flame
had been weakened by an attack he could not comprehend and knew not how to
reply to. Though not yet afraid, he was defiant&mdash;ready to act against a
fear that he felt to be approaching. He was no longer fatherly and protective
towards the cat. Smoke held the key to the situation; and both he and the cat
knew it.
</p>

<p>
Thus, as the minutes passed, John Silence sat and waited, keenly on the alert,
wondering how soon the attack would be renewed, and at what point it would be
diverted from the animals and directed upon himself.
</p>

<p>
The book lay on the floor beside him, his notes were complete. With one hand on
the cat&rsquo;s fur, and the dog&rsquo;s front paws resting against his feet,
the three of them dozed comfortably before the hot fire while the night wore on
and the silence deepened towards midnight.
</p>

<p>
It was well after one o&rsquo;clock in the morning when Dr. Silence turned the
lamp out and lighted the candle preparatory to going up to bed. Then Smoke
suddenly woke with a loud sharp purr and sat up. It neither stretched, washed
nor turned: it listened. And the doctor, watching it, realised that a certain
indefinable change had come about that very moment in the room. A swift
readjustment of the forces within the four walls had taken place&mdash;a new
disposition of their personal equations. The balance was destroyed, the former
harmony gone. Smoke, most sensitive of barometers, had been the first to feel
it, but the dog was not slow to follow suit, for on looking down he noted that
Flame was no longer asleep. He was lying with eyes wide open, and that same
instant he sat up on his great haunches and began to growl.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence was in the act of taking the matches to re-light the lamp when an
audible movement in the room behind him made him pause. Smoke leaped down from
his knee and moved forward a few paces across the carpet. Then it stopped and
stared fixedly; and the doctor stood up on the rug to watch.
</p>

<p>
As he rose the sound was repeated, and he discovered that it was not in the
room as he first thought, but outside, and that it came from more directions
than one. There was a rushing, sweeping noise against the window-panes, and
simultaneously a sound of something brushing against the door&mdash;out in the
hall. Smoke advanced sedately across the carpet, twitching his tail, and sat
down within a foot of the door. The influence that had destroyed the harmonious
conditions of the room had apparently moved in advance of its cause. Clearly,
something was about to happen.
</p>

<p>
For the first time that night John Silence hesitated; the thought of that dark
narrow hall-way, choked with fog, and destitute of human comfort, was
unpleasant. He became aware of a faint creeping of his flesh. He knew, of
course, that the actual opening of the door was not necessary to the invasion
of the room that was about to take place, since neither doors nor windows, nor
any other solid barriers could interpose an obstacle to what was seeking
entrance. Yet the opening of the door would be significant and symbolic, and he
distinctly shrank from it.
</p>

<p>
But for a moment only. Smoke, turning with a show of impatience, recalled him
to his purpose, and he moved past the sitting, watching creature, and
deliberately opened the door to its full width.
</p>

<p>
What subsequently happened, happened in the feeble and flickering light of the
solitary candle on the mantlepiece.
</p>

<p>
Through the opened door he saw the hall, dimly lit and thick with fog. Nothing,
of course, was visible&mdash;nothing but the hat-stand, the African spears in
dark lines upon the wall and the high-backed wooden chair standing grotesquely
underneath on the oilcloth floor. For one instant the fog seemed to move and
thicken oddly; but he set that down to the score of the imagination. The door
had opened upon nothing.
</p>

<p>
Yet Smoke apparently thought otherwise, and the deep growling of the collie
from the mat at the back of the room seemed to confirm his judgment.
</p>

<p>
For, proud and self-possessed, the cat had again risen to his feet, and having
advanced to the door, was now ushering some one slowly into the room. Nothing
could have been more evident. He paced from side to side, bowing his little
head with great <i>empressement</i> and holding his stiffened tail aloft like a
flag-staff. He turned this way and that, mincing to and fro, and showing signs
of supreme satisfaction. He was in his element. He welcomed the intrusion, and
apparently reckoned that his companions, the doctor and the dog, would welcome
it likewise.
</p>

<p>
The Intruder had returned for a second attack.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence moved slowly backwards and took up his position on the hearthrug,
keying himself up to a condition of concentrated attention.
</p>

<p>
He noted that Flame stood beside him, facing the room, with body motionless,
and head moving swiftly from side to side with a curious swaying movement. His
eyes were wide open, his back rigid, his neck and jaws thrust forward, his legs
tense and ready to leap. Savage, ready for attack or defence, yet dreadfully
puzzled and perhaps already a little cowed, he stood and stared, the hair on
his spine and sides positively bristling outwards as though a wind played
through it. In the dim firelight he looked like a great yellow-haired wolf,
silent, eyes shooting dark fire, exceedingly formidable. It was Flame, the
terrible.
</p>

<p>
Smoke, meanwhile, advanced from the door towards the middle of the room,
adopting the very slow pace of an invisible companion. A few feet away it
stopped and began to smile and blink its eyes. There was something deliberately
coaxing in its attitude as it stood there undecided on the carpet, clearly
wishing to effect some sort of introduction between the Intruder and its canine
friend and ally. It assumed its most winning manners, purring, smiling, looking
persuasively from one to the other, and making quick tentative steps first in
one direction and then in the other. There had always existed such perfect
understanding between them in everything. Surely Flame would appreciate
Smoke&rsquo;s intention now, and acquiesce.
</p>

<p>
But the old collie made no advances. He bared his teeth, lifting his lips till
the gums showed, and stood stockstill with fixed eyes and heaving sides. The
doctor moved a little farther back, watching intently the smallest movement,
and it was just then he divined suddenly from the cat&rsquo;s behaviour and
attitude that it was not only a single companion it had ushered into the room,
but <i>several</i>. It kept crossing over from one to the other, looking up at
each in turn. It sought to win over the dog to friendliness with them all. The
original Intruder had come back with reinforcements. And at the same time he
further realised that the Intruder was something more than a blindly acting
force, impersonal though destructive. It was a Personality, and moreover a
great personality. And it was accompanied for the purposes of assistance by a
host of other personalities, minor in degree, but similar in kind.
</p>

<p>
He braced himself in the corner against the mantelpiece and waited, his whole
being roused to defence, for he was now fully aware that the attack had spread
to include himself as well as the animals, and he must be on the alert. He
strained his eyes through the foggy atmosphere, trying in vain to see what the
cat and dog saw; but the candlelight threw an uncertain and flickering light
across the room and his eyes discerned nothing. On the floor Smoke moved softly
in front of him like a black shadow, his eyes gleaming as he turned his head,
still trying with many insinuating gestures and much purring to bring about the
introductions he desired.
</p>

<p>
But it was all in vain. Flame stood riveted to one spot, motionless as a figure
carved in stone.
</p>

<p>
Some minutes passed, during which only the cat moved, and then there came a
sharp change. Flame began to back towards the wall. He moved his head from side
to side as he went, sometimes turning to snap at something almost behind him.
They were advancing upon him, trying to surround him. His distress became very
marked from now onwards, and it seemed to the doctor that his anger merged into
genuine terror and became overwhelmed by it. The savage growl sounded
perilously like a whine, and more than once he tried to dive past his
master&rsquo;s legs, as though hunting for a way of escape. He was trying to
avoid something that everywhere blocked the way.
</p>

<p>
This terror of the indomitable fighter impressed the doctor enormously; yet
also painfully; stirring his impatience; for he had never before seen the dog
show signs of giving in, and it distressed him to witness it. He knew, however,
that he was not giving in easily, and understood that it was really impossible
for him to gauge the animal&rsquo;s sensations properly at all. What Flame
felt, and saw, must be terrible indeed to turn him all at once into a coward.
He faced something that made him afraid of more than his life merely. The
doctor spoke a few quick words of encouragement to him, and stroked the
bristling hair. But without much success. The collie seemed already beyond the
reach of comfort such as that, and the collapse of the old dog followed indeed
very speedily after this.
</p>

<p>
And Smoke, meanwhile, remained behind, watching the advance, but not joining in
it; sitting, pleased and expectant, considering that all was going well and as
it wished. It was kneading on the carpet with its front paws&mdash;slowly,
laboriously, as though its feet were dipped in treacle. The sound its claws
made as they caught in the threads was distinctly audible. It was still
smiling, blinking, purring.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the collie uttered a poignant short bark and leaped heavily to one
side. His bared teeth traced a line of whiteness through the gloom. The next
instant he dashed past his master&rsquo;s legs, almost upsetting his balance,
and shot out into the room, where he went blundering wildly against walls and
furniture. But that bark was significant; the doctor had heard it before and
knew what it meant: for it was the cry of the fighter against odds and it meant
that the old beast had found his courage again. Possibly it was only the
courage of despair, but at any rate the fighting would be terrific. And Dr.
Silence understood, too, that he dared not interfere. Flame must fight his own
enemies in his own way.
</p>

<p>
But the cat, too, had heard that dreadful bark; and it, too, had understood.
This was more than it had bargained for. Across the dim shadows of that haunted
room there must have passed some secret signal of distress between the animals.
Smoke stood up and looked swiftly about him. He uttered a piteous meow and
trotted smartly away into the greater darkness by the windows. What his object
was only those endowed with the spirit-like intelligence of cats might know.
But, at any rate, he had at last ranged himself on the side of his friend. And
the little beast meant business.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment the collie managed to gain the door. The doctor saw him rush
through into the hall like a flash of yellow light. He shot across the
oilcloth, and tore up the stairs, but in another second he appeared again,
flying down the steps and landing at the bottom in a tumbling heap, whining,
cringing, terrified. The doctor saw him slink back into the room again and
crawl round by the wall towards the cat. Was, then, even the staircase
occupied? Did <i>They</i> stand also in the hall? Was the whole house crowded
from floor to ceiling?
</p>

<p>
The thought came to add to the keen distress he felt at the sight of the
collie&rsquo;s discomfiture. And, indeed, his own personal distress had
increased in a marked degree during the past minutes, and continued to increase
steadily to the climax. He recognised that the drain on his own vitality grew
steadily, and that the attack was now directed against himself even more than
against the defeated dog, and the too much deceived cat.
</p>

<p>
It all seemed so rapid and uncalculated after that&mdash;the events that took
place in this little modern room at the top of Putney Hill between midnight and
sunrise&mdash;that Dr. Silence was hardly able to follow and remember it all.
It came about with such uncanny swiftness and terror; the light was so
uncertain; the movements of the black cat so difficult to follow on the dark
carpet, and the doctor himself so weary and taken by surprise&mdash;that he
found it almost impossible to observe accurately, or to recall afterwards
precisely what it was he had seen or in what order the incidents had taken
place. He never could understand what defect of vision on his part made it seem
as though the cat had duplicated itself at first, and then increased
indefinitely, so that there were at least a dozen of them darting silently
about the floor, leaping softly on to chairs and tables, passing like shadows
from the open door to the end of the room, all black as sin, with brilliant
green eyes flashing fire in all directions. It was like the reflections from a
score of mirrors placed round the walls at different angles. Nor could he make
out at the time why the size of the room seemed to have altered, grown much
larger, and why it extended away behind him where ordinarily the wall should
have been. The snarling of the enraged and terrified collie sounded sometimes
so far away; the ceiling seemed to have raised itself so much higher than
before, and much of the furniture had changed in appearance and shifted
marvellously.
</p>

<p>
It was all so confused and confusing, as though the little room he knew had
become merged and transformed into the dimensions of quite another chamber,
that came to him, with its host of cats and its strange distances, in a sort of
vision.
</p>

<p>
But these changes came about a little later, and at a time when his attention
was so concentrated upon the proceedings of Smoke and the collie, that he only
observed them, as it were, subconsciously. And the excitement, the flickering
candlelight, the distress he felt for the collie, and the distorting atmosphere
of fog were the poorest possible allies to careful observation.
</p>

<p>
At first he was only aware that the dog was repeating his short dangerous bark
from time to time, snapping viciously at the empty air, a foot or so from the
ground. Once, indeed, he sprang upwards and forwards, working furiously with
teeth and paws, and with a noise like wolves fighting, but only to dash back
the next minute against the wall behind him. Then, after lying still for a bit,
he rose to a crouching position as though to spring again, snarling horribly
and making short half-circles with lowered head. And Smoke all the while meowed
piteously by the window as though trying to draw the attack upon himself.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that the rush of the whole dreadful business seemed to turn aside
from the dog and direct itself upon his own person. The collie had made another
spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner, where he made noise enough
in his savage rage to waken the dead before he fell to whining and then finally
lay still. And directly afterwards the doctor&rsquo;s own distress became
intolerably acute. He had made a half movement forward to come to the rescue
when a veil that was denser than mere fog seemed to drop down over the scene,
draping room, walls, animals and fire in a mist of darkness and folding also
about his own mind. Other forms moved silently across the field of vision,
forms that he recognised from previous experiments, and welcomed not. Unholy
thoughts began to crowd into his brain, sinister suggestions of evil presented
themselves seductively. Ice seemed to settle about his heart, and his mind
trembled. He began to lose memory&mdash;memory of his identity, of where he
was, of what he ought to do. The very foundations of his strength were shaken.
His will seemed paralysed.
</p>

<p>
And it was then that the room filled with this horde of cats, all dark as the
night, all silent, all with lamping eyes of green fire. The dimensions of the
place altered and shifted. He was in a much larger space. The whining of the
dog sounded far away, and all about him the cats flew busily to and fro,
silently playing their tearing, rushing game of evil, weaving the pattern of
their dark purpose upon the floor. He strove hard to collect himself and
remember the words of power he had made use of before in similar dread
positions where his dangerous practice had sometimes led; but he could recall
nothing consecutively; a mist lay over his mind and memory; he felt dazed and
his forces scattered. The deeps within were too troubled for healing power to
come out of them.
</p>

<p>
It was glamour, of course, he realised afterwards, the strong glamour thrown
upon his imagination by some powerful personality behind the veil; but at the
time he was not sufficiently aware of this and, as with all true glamour, was
unable to grasp where the true ended and the false began. He was caught
momentarily in the same vortex that had sought to lure the cat to destruction
through its delight, and threatened utterly to overwhelm the dog through its
terror.
</p>

<p>
There came a sound in the chimney behind him like wind booming and tearing its
way down. The windows rattled. The candle flickered and went out. The glacial
atmosphere closed round him with the cold of death, and a great rushing sound
swept by overhead as though the ceiling had lifted to a great height. He heard
the door shut. Far away it sounded. He felt lost, shelterless in the depths of
his soul. Yet still he held out and resisted while the climax of the fight came
nearer and nearer.... He had stepped into the stream of forces awakened by
Pender and he knew that he must withstand them to the end or come to a
conclusion that it was not good for a man to come to. Something from the region
of utter cold was upon him.
</p>

<p>
And then quite suddenly, through the confused mists about him, there slowly
rose up the Personality that had been all the time directing the battle. Some
force entered his being that shook him as the tempest shakes a leaf, and close
against his eyes&mdash;clean level with his face&mdash;he found himself staring
into the wreck of a vast dark Countenance, a countenance that was terrible even
in its ruin.
</p>

<p>
For ruined it was, and terrible it was, and the mark of spiritual evil was
branded everywhere upon its broken features. Eyes, face and hair rose level
with his own, and for a space of time he never could properly measure, or
determine, these two, a man and a woman, looked straight into each
other&rsquo;s visages and down into each other&rsquo;s hearts.
</p>

<p>
And John Silence, the soul with the good, unselfish motive, held his own
against the dark discarnate woman whose motive was pure evil, and whose soul
was on the side of the Dark Powers.
</p>

<p>
It was the climax that touched the depth of power within him and began to
restore him slowly to his own. He was conscious, of course, of effort, and yet
it seemed no superhuman one, for he had recognised the character of his
opponent&rsquo;s power, and he called upon the good within him to meet and
overcome it. The inner forces stirred and trembled in response to his call.
They did not at first come readily as was their habit, for under the spell of
glamour they had already been diabolically lulled into inactivity, but come
they eventually did, rising out of the inner spiritual nature he had learned
with so much time and pain to awaken to life. And power and confidence came
with them. He began to breathe deeply and regularly, and at the same time to
absorb into himself the forces opposed to him, and to <i>turn them to his own
account</i>. By ceasing to resist, and allowing the deadly stream to pour into
him unopposed, he used the very power supplied by his adversary and thus
enormously increased his own.
</p>

<p>
For this spiritual alchemy he had learned. He understood that force ultimately
is everywhere one and the same; it is the motive behind that makes it good or
evil; and his motive was entirely unselfish. He knew&mdash;provided he was not
first robbed of self-control&mdash;how vicariously to absorb these evil
radiations into himself and change them magically into his own good purposes.
And, since his motive was pure and his soul fearless, they could not work him
harm.
</p>

<p>
Thus he stood in the main stream of evil unwittingly attracted by Pender,
deflecting its course upon himself; and after passing through the purifying
filter of his own unselfishness these energies could only add to his store of
experience, of knowledge, and therefore of power. And, as his self-control
returned to him, he gradually accomplished this purpose, even though trembling
while he did so.
</p>

<p>
Yet the struggle was severe, and in spite of the freezing chill of the air, the
perspiration poured down his face. Then, by slow degrees, the dark and dreadful
countenance faded, the glamour passed from his soul, the normal proportions
returned to walls and ceiling, the forms melted back into the fog, and the
whirl of rushing shadow-cats disappeared whence they came.
</p>

<p>
And with the return of the consciousness of his own identity John Silence was
restored to the full control of his own will-power. In a deep, modulated voice
he began to utter certain rhythmical sounds that slowly rolled through the air
like a rising sea, filling the room with powerful vibratory activities that
whelmed all irregularities of lesser vibrations in its own swelling tone. He
made certain sigils, gestures and movements at the same time. For several
minutes he continued to utter these words, until at length the growing volume
dominated the whole room and mastered the manifestation of all that opposed it.
For just as he understood the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil forces
by raising them into higher channels, so he knew from long study the occult use
of sound, and its direct effect upon the plastic region wherein the powers of
spiritual evil work their fell purposes. Harmony was restored first of all to
his own soul, and thence to the room and all its occupants.
</p>

<p>
And, after himself, the first to recognise it was the old dog lying in his
corner. Flame began suddenly uttering sounds of pleasure, that
&ldquo;something&rdquo; between a growl and a grunt that dogs make upon being
restored to their master&rsquo;s confidence. Dr. Silence heard the thumping of
the collie&rsquo;s tail against the floor. And the grunt and the thumping
touched the depth of affection in the man&rsquo;s heart, and gave him some
inkling of what agonies the dumb creature had suffered.
</p>

<p>
Next, from the shadows by the window, a somewhat shrill purring announced the
restoration of the cat to its normal state. Smoke was advancing across the
carpet. He seemed very pleased with himself, and smiled with an expression of
supreme innocence. He was no shadow-cat, but real and full of his usual and
perfect self-possession. He marched along, picking his way delicately, but with
a stately dignity that suggested his ancestry with the majesty of Egypt. His
eyes no longer glared; they shone steadily before him, they radiated, not
excitement, but knowledge. Clearly he was anxious to make amends for the
mischief to which he had unwittingly lent himself owing to his subtle and
electric constitution.
</p>

<p>
Still uttering his sharp high purrings he marched up to his master and rubbed
vigorously against his legs. Then he stood on his hind feet and pawed his knees
and stared beseechingly up into his face. He turned his head towards the corner
where the collie still lay, thumping his tail feebly and pathetically.
</p>

<p>
John Silence understood. He bent down and stroked the creature&rsquo;s living
fur, noting the line of bright blue sparks that followed the motion of his hand
down its back. And then they advanced together towards the corner where the dog
was.
</p>

<p>
Smoke went first and put his nose gently against his friend&rsquo;s muzzle,
purring while he rubbed, and uttering little soft sounds of affection in his
throat. The doctor lit the candle and brought it over. He saw the collie lying
on its side against the wall; it was utterly exhausted, and foam still hung
about its jaws. Its tail and eyes responded to the sound of its name, but it
was evidently very weak and overcome. Smoke continued to rub against its cheek
and nose and eyes, sometimes even standing on its body and kneading into the
thick yellow hair. Flame replied from time to time by little licks of the
tongue, most of them curiously misdirected.
</p>

<p>
But Dr. Silence felt intuitively that something disastrous had happened, and
his heart was wrung. He stroked the dear body, feeling it over for bruises or
broken bones, but finding none. He fed it with what remained of the sandwiches
and milk, but the creature clumsily upset the saucer and lost the sandwiches
between its paws, so that the doctor had to feed it with his own hand. And all
the while Smoke meowed piteously.
</p>

<p>
Then John Silence began to understand. He went across to the farther side of
the room and called aloud to it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Flame, old man! come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At any other time the dog would have been upon him in an instant, barking and
leaping to the shoulder. And even now he got up, though heavily and awkwardly,
to his feet. He started to run, wagging his tail more briskly. He collided
first with a chair, and then ran straight into a table. Smoke trotted close at
his side, trying his very best to guide him. But it was useless. Dr. Silence
had to lift him up into his own arms and carry him like a baby. For he was
blind.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
It was a week later when John Silence called to see the author in his new
house, and found him well on the way to recovery and already busy again with
his writing. The haunted look had left his eyes, and he seemed cheerful and
confident.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humour restored?&rdquo; laughed the doctor, as soon as they were
comfortably settled in the room overlooking the Park.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no trouble since I left that dreadful place,&rdquo;
returned Pender gratefully; &ldquo;and thanks to you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The doctor stopped him with a gesture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll discuss your new
plans afterwards, and my scheme for relieving you of the house and helping you
settle elsewhere. Of course it must be pulled down, for it&rsquo;s not fit for
any sensitive person to live in, and any other tenant might be afflicted in the
same way you were. Although, personally, I think the evil has exhausted itself
by now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He told the astonished author something of his experiences in it with the
animals.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand,&rdquo; Pender said, when the
account was finished, &ldquo;but I and my wife are intensely relieved to be
free of it all. Only I must say I should like to know something of the former
history of the house. When we took it six months ago I heard no word against
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence drew a typewritten paper from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can satisfy your curiosity to some extent,&rdquo; he said, running his
eye over the sheets, and then replacing them in his coat; &ldquo;for by my
secretary&rsquo;s investigations I have been able to check certain information
obtained in the hypnotic trance by a &lsquo;sensitive&rsquo; who helps me in
such cases. The former occupant who haunted you appears to have been a woman of
singularly atrocious life and character who finally suffered death by hanging,
after a series of crimes that appalled the whole of England and only came to
light by the merest chance. She came to her end in the year 1798, for it was
not this particular house she lived in, but a much larger one that then stood
upon the site it now occupies, and was then, of course, not in London, but in
the country. She was a person of intellect, possessed of a powerful, trained
will, and of consummate audacity, and I am convinced availed herself of the
resources of the lower magic to attain her ends. This goes far to explain the
virulence of the attack upon yourself, and why she is still able to carry on
after death the evil practices that formed her main purpose during life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think that after death a soul can still consciously
direct&mdash;&rdquo; gasped the author.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think, as I told you before, that the forces of a powerful personality
may still persist after death in the line of their original momentum,&rdquo;
replied the doctor; &ldquo;and that strong thoughts and purposes can still
react upon suitably prepared brains long after their originators have passed
away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you knew anything of magic,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;you would know
that thought is dynamic, and that it may call into existence forms and pictures
that may well exist for hundreds of years. For, not far removed from the region
of our human life is another region where float the waste and drift of all the
centuries, the limbo of the shells of the dead; a densely populated region
crammed with horror and abomination of all descriptions, and sometimes
galvanised into active life again by the will of a trained manipulator, a mind
versed in the practices of lower magic. That this woman understood its vile
commerce, I am persuaded, and the forces she set going during her life have
simply been accumulating ever since, and would have continued to do so had they
not been drawn down upon yourself, and afterwards discharged and satisfied
through me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything might have brought down the attack, for, besides drugs, there
are certain violent emotions, certain moods of the soul, certain spiritual
fevers, if I may so call them, which directly open the inner being to a
cognisance of this astral region I have mentioned. In your case it happened to
be a peculiarly potent drug that did it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But now, tell me,&rdquo; he added, after a pause, handing to the
perplexed author a pencil drawing he had made of the dark countenance that had
appeared to him during the night on Putney Hill&mdash;&ldquo;tell me if you
recognise this face?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pender looked at the drawing closely, greatly astonished. He shuddered a little
as he looked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is the face I kept trying to
draw&mdash;dark, with the great mouth and jaw, and the drooping eye. That is
the woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence then produced from his pocket-book an old-fashioned woodcut of the
same person which his secretary had unearthed from the records of the Newgate
Calendar. The woodcut and the pencil drawing were two different aspects of the
same dreadful visage. The men compared them for some moments in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It makes me thank God for the limitations of our senses,&rdquo; said
Pender quietly, with a sigh; &ldquo;continuous clairvoyance must be a sore
affliction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; returned John Silence significantly, &ldquo;and if
all the people nowadays who claim to be clairvoyant were really so, the
statistics of suicide and lunacy would be considerably higher than they are. It
is little wonder,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that your sense of humour was
clouded, with the mind-forces of that dead monster trying to use your brain for
their dissemination. You have had an interesting adventure, Mr. Felix Pender,
and, let me add, a fortunate escape.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The author was about to renew his thanks when there came a sound of scratching
at the door, and the doctor sprang up quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for me to go. I left my dog on the step, but I
suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before he had time to open the door, it had yielded to the pressure behind it
and flew wide open to admit a great yellow-haired collie. The dog, wagging his
tail and contorting his whole body with delight, tore across the floor and
tried to leap up upon his owner&rsquo;s breast. And there was laughter and
happiness in the old eyes; for they were clear again as the day.

<h2><a name="chap02"></a>CASE II: ANCIENT SORCERIES</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
There are, it would appear, certain wholly unremarkable persons, with none of
the characteristics that invite adventure, who yet once or twice in the course
of their smooth lives undergo an experience so strange that the world catches
its breath&mdash;and looks the other way! And it was cases of this kind,
perhaps, more than any other, that fell into the wide-spread net of John
Silence, the psychic doctor, and, appealing to his deep humanity, to his
patience, and to his great qualities of spiritual sympathy, led often to the
revelation of problems of the strangest complexity, and of the profoundest
possible human interest.
</p>

<p>
Matters that seemed almost too curious and fantastic for belief he loved to
trace to their hidden sources. To unravel a tangle in the very soul of
things&mdash;and to release a suffering human soul in the process&mdash;was
with him a veritable passion. And the knots he untied were, indeed, after
passing strange.
</p>

<p>
The world, of course, asks for some plausible basis to which it can attach
credence&mdash;something it can, at least, pretend to explain. The adventurous
type it can understand: such people carry about with them an adequate
explanation of their exciting lives, and their characters obviously drive them
into the circumstances which produce the adventures. It expects nothing else
from them, and is satisfied. But dull, ordinary folk have no right to
out-of-the-way experiences, and the world having been led to expect otherwise,
is disappointed with them, not to say shocked. Its complacent judgment has been
rudely disturbed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such a thing happened to <i>that</i> man!&rdquo; it cries&mdash;&ldquo;a
commonplace person like that! It is too absurd! There must be something
wrong!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yet there could be no question that something did actually happen to little
Arthur Vezin, something of the curious nature he described to Dr. Silence.
Outwardly or inwardly, it happened beyond a doubt, and in spite of the jeers of
his few friends who heard the tale, and observed wisely that &ldquo;such a
thing might perhaps have come to Iszard, that crack-brained Iszard, or to that
odd fish Minski, but it could never have happened to commonplace little Vezin,
who was fore-ordained to live and die according to scale.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But, whatever his method of death was, Vezin certainly did not &ldquo;live
according to scale&rdquo; so far as this particular event in his otherwise
uneventful life was concerned; and to hear him recount it, and watch his pale
delicate features change, and hear his voice grow softer and more hushed as he
proceeded, was to know the conviction that his halting words perhaps failed
sometimes to convey. He lived the thing over again each time he told it. His
whole personality became muffled in the recital. It subdued him more than ever,
so that the tale became a lengthy apology for an experience that he deprecated.
He appeared to excuse himself and ask your pardon for having dared to take part
in so fantastic an episode. For little Vezin was a timid, gentle, sensitive
soul, rarely able to assert himself, tender to man and beast, and almost
constitutionally unable to say No, or to claim many things that should rightly
have been his. His whole scheme of life seemed utterly remote from anything
more exciting than missing a train or losing an umbrella on an omnibus. And
when this curious event came upon him he was already more years beyond forty
than his friends suspected or he cared to admit.
</p>

<p>
John Silence, who heard him speak of his experience more than once, said that
he sometimes left out certain details and put in others; yet they were all
obviously true. The whole scene was unforgettably cinematographed on to his
mind. None of the details were imagined or invented. And when he told the story
with them all complete, the effect was undeniable. His appealing brown eyes
shone, and much of the charming personality, usually so carefully repressed,
came forward and revealed itself. His modesty was always there, of course, but
in the telling he forgot the present and allowed himself to appear almost
vividly as he lived again in the past of his adventure.
</p>

<p>
He was on the way home when it happened, crossing northern France from some
mountain trip or other where he buried himself solitary-wise every summer. He
had nothing but an unregistered bag in the rack, and the train was jammed to
suffocation, most of the passengers being unredeemed holiday English. He
disliked them, not because they were his fellow-countrymen, but because they
were noisy and obtrusive, obliterating with their big limbs and tweed clothing
all the quieter tints of the day that brought him satisfaction and enabled him
to melt into insignificance and forget that he was anybody. These English
clashed about him like a brass band, making him feel vaguely that he ought to
be more self-assertive and obstreperous, and that he did not claim insistently
enough all kinds of things that he didn&rsquo;t want and that were really
valueless, such as corner seats, windows up or down, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
So that he felt uncomfortable in the train, and wished the journey were over
and he was back again living with his unmarried sister in Surbiton.
</p>

<p>
And when the train stopped for ten panting minutes at the little station in
northern France, and he got out to stretch his legs on the platform, and saw to
his dismay a further batch of the British Isles debouching from another train,
it suddenly seemed impossible to him to continue the journey. Even <i>his</i>
flabby soul revolted, and the idea of staying a night in the little town and
going on next day by a slower, emptier train, flashed into his mind. The guard
was already shouting &ldquo;<i>en voiture</i>&rdquo; and the corridor of his
compartment was already packed when the thought came to him. And, for once, he
acted with decision and rushed to snatch his bag.
</p>

<p>
Finding the corridor and steps impassable, he tapped at the window (for he had
a corner seat) and begged the Frenchman who sat opposite to hand his luggage
out to him, explaining in his wretched French that he intended to break the
journey there. And this elderly Frenchman, he declared, gave him a look, half
of warning, half of reproach, that to his dying day he could never forget;
handed the bag through the window of the moving train; and at the same time
poured into his ears a long sentence, spoken rapidly and low, of which he was
able to comprehend only the last few words: &ldquo;<i>à cause du sommeil et à
cause des chats</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In reply to Dr. Silence, whose singular psychic acuteness at once seized upon
this Frenchman as a vital point in the adventure, Vezin admitted that the man
had impressed him favourably from the beginning, though without being able to
explain why. They had sat facing one another during the four hours of the
journey, and though no conversation had passed between them&mdash;Vezin was
timid about his stuttering French&mdash;he confessed that his eyes were being
continually drawn to his face, almost, he felt, to rudeness, and that each, by
a dozen nameless little politenesses and attentions, had evinced the desire to
be kind. The men liked each other and their personalities did not clash, or
would not have clashed had they chanced to come to terms of acquaintance. The
Frenchman, indeed, seemed to have exercised a silent protective influence over
the insignificant little Englishman, and without words or gestures betrayed
that he wished him well and would gladly have been of service to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this sentence that he hurled at you after the bag?&rdquo; asked John
Silence, smiling that peculiarly sympathetic smile that always melted the
prejudices of his patient, &ldquo;were you unable to follow it exactly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was so quick and low and vehement,&rdquo; explained Vezin, in his
small voice, &ldquo;that I missed practically the whole of it. I only caught
the few words at the very end, because he spoke them so clearly, and his face
was bent down out of the carriage window so near to mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>À cause du sommeil et à cause des chats&rsquo;?</i>&rdquo;
repeated Dr. Silence, as though half speaking to himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly,&rdquo; said Vezin; &ldquo;which, I take it,
means something like &lsquo;because of sleep and because of the cats,&rsquo;
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, that&rsquo;s how I should translate it,&rdquo; the doctor
observed shortly, evidently not wishing to interrupt more than necessary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the rest of the sentence&mdash;all the first part I couldn&rsquo;t
understand, I mean&mdash;was a warning not to do something&mdash;not to stop in
the town, or at some particular place in the town, perhaps. That was the
impression it made on me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then, of course, the train rushed off, and left Vezin standing on the platform
alone and rather forlorn.
</p>

<p>
The little town climbed in straggling fashion up a sharp hill rising out of the
plain at the back of the station, and was crowned by the twin towers of the
ruined cathedral peeping over the summit. From the station itself it looked
uninteresting and modern, but the fact was that the mediaeval position lay out
of sight just beyond the crest. And once he reached the top and entered the old
streets, he stepped clean out of modern life into a bygone century. The noise
and bustle of the crowded train seemed days away. The spirit of this silent
hill-town, remote from tourists and motor-cars, dreaming its own quiet life
under the autumn sun, rose up and cast its spell upon him. Long before he
recognised this spell he acted under it. He walked softly, almost on tiptoe,
down the winding narrow streets where the gables all but met over his head, and
he entered the doorway of the solitary inn with a deprecating and modest
demeanour that was in itself an apology for intruding upon the place and
disturbing its dream.
</p>

<p>
At first, however, Vezin said, he noticed very little of all this. The attempt
at analysis came much later. What struck him then was only the delightful
contrast of the silence and peace after the dust and noisy rattle of the train.
He felt soothed and stroked like a cat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like a cat, you said?&rdquo; interrupted John Silence, quickly catching
him up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. At the very start I felt that.&rdquo; He laughed apologetically.
&ldquo;I felt as though the warmth and the stillness and the comfort made me
purr. It seemed to be the general mood of the whole place&mdash;then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The inn, a rambling ancient house, the atmosphere of the old coaching days
still about it, apparently did not welcome him too warmly. He felt he was only
tolerated, he said. But it was cheap and comfortable, and the delicious cup of
afternoon tea he ordered at once made him feel really very pleased with himself
for leaving the train in this bold, original way. For to him it had seemed bold
and original. He felt something of a dog. His room, too, soothed him with its
dark panelling and low irregular ceiling, and the long sloping passage that led
to it seemed the natural pathway to a real Chamber of Sleep&mdash;a little dim
cubby hole out of the world where noise could not enter. It looked upon the
courtyard at the back. It was all very charming, and made him think of himself
as dressed in very soft velvet somehow, and the floors seemed padded, the walls
provided with cushions. The sounds of the streets could not penetrate there. It
was an atmosphere of absolute rest that surrounded him.
</p>

<p>
On engaging the two-franc room he had interviewed the only person who seemed to
be about that sleepy afternoon, an elderly waiter with Dundreary whiskers and a
drowsy courtesy, who had ambled lazily towards him across the stone yard; but
on coming downstairs again for a little promenade in the town before dinner he
encountered the proprietress herself. She was a large woman whose hands, feet,
and features seemed to swim towards him out of a sea of person. They emerged,
so to speak. But she had great dark, vivacious eyes that counteracted the bulk
of her body, and betrayed the fact that in reality she was both vigorous and
alert. When he first caught sight of her she was knitting in a low chair
against the sunlight of the wall, and something at once made him see her as a
great tabby cat, dozing, yet awake, heavily sleepy, and yet at the same time
prepared for instantaneous action. A great mouser on the watch occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
She took him in with a single comprehensive glance that was polite without
being cordial. Her neck, he noticed, was extraordinarily supple in spite of its
proportions, for it turned so easily to follow him, and the head it carried
bowed so very flexibly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But when she looked at me, you know,&rdquo; said Vezin, with that little
apologetic smile in his brown eyes, and that faintly deprecating gesture of the
shoulders that was characteristic of him, &ldquo;the odd notion came to me that
really she had intended to make quite a different movement, and that with a
single bound she could have leaped at me across the width of that stone yard
and pounced upon me like some huge cat upon a mouse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He laughed a little soft laugh, and Dr. Silence made a note in his book without
interrupting, while Vezin proceeded in a tone as though he feared he had
already told too much and more than we could believe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very soft, yet very active she was, for all her size and mass, and I
felt she knew what I was doing even after I had passed and was behind her back.
She spoke to me, and her voice was smooth and running. She asked if I had my
luggage, and was comfortable in my room, and then added that dinner was at
seven o&rsquo;clock, and that they were very early people in this little
country town. Clearly, she intended to convey that late hours were not
encouraged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Evidently, she contrived by voice and manner to give him the impression that
here he would be &ldquo;managed,&rdquo; that everything would be arranged and
planned for him, and that he had nothing to do but fall into the groove and
obey. No decided action or sharp personal effort would be looked for from him.
It was the very reverse of the train. He walked quietly out into the street
feeling soothed and peaceful. He realised that he was in a <i>milieu</i> that
suited him and stroked him the right way. It was so much easier to be obedient.
He began to purr again, and to feel that all the town purred with him.
</p>

<p>
About the streets of that little town he meandered gently, falling deeper and
deeper into the spirit of repose that characterised it. With no special aim he
wandered up and down, and to and fro. The September sunshine fell slantingly
over the roofs. Down winding alleyways, fringed with tumbling gables and open
casements, he caught fairylike glimpses of the great plain below, and of the
meadows and yellow copses lying like a dream-map in the haze. The spell of the
past held very potently here, he felt.
</p>

<p>
The streets were full of picturesquely garbed men and women, all busy enough,
going their respective ways; but no one took any notice of him or turned to
stare at his obviously English appearance. He was even able to forget that with
his tourist appearance he was a false note in a charming picture, and he melted
more and more into the scene, feeling delightfully insignificant and
unimportant and unselfconscious. It was like becoming part of a softly coloured
dream which he did not even realise to be a dream.
</p>

<p>
On the eastern side the hill fell away more sharply, and the plain below ran
off rather suddenly into a sea of gathering shadows in which the little patches
of woodland looked like islands and the stubble fields like deep water. Here he
strolled along the old ramparts of ancient fortifications that once had been
formidable, but now were only vision-like with their charming mingling of
broken grey walls and wayward vine and ivy. From the broad coping on which he
sat for a moment, level with the rounded tops of clipped plane trees, he saw
the esplanade far below lying in shadow. Here and there a yellow sunbeam crept
in and lay upon the fallen yellow leaves, and from the height he looked down
and saw that the townsfolk were walking to and fro in the cool of the evening.
He could just hear the sound of their slow footfalls, and the murmur of their
voices floated up to him through the gaps between the trees. The figures looked
like shadows as he caught glimpses of their quiet movements far below.
</p>

<p>
He sat there for some time pondering, bathed in the waves of murmurs and
half-lost echoes that rose to his ears, muffled by the leaves of the plane
trees. The whole town, and the little hill out of which it grew as naturally as
an ancient wood, seemed to him like a being lying there half asleep on the
plain and crooning to itself as it dozed.
</p>

<p>
And, presently, as he sat lazily melting into its dream, a sound of horns and
strings and wood instruments rose to his ears, and the town band began to play
at the far end of the crowded terrace below to the accompaniment of a very
soft, deep-throated drum. Vezin was very sensitive to music, knew about it
intelligently, and had even ventured, unknown to his friends, upon the
composition of quiet melodies with low-running chords which he played to
himself with the soft pedal when no one was about. And this music floating up
through the trees from an invisible and doubtless very picturesque band of the
townspeople wholly charmed him. He recognised nothing that they played, and it
sounded as though they were simply improvising without a conductor. No
definitely marked time ran through the pieces, which ended and began oddly
after the fashion of wind through an Aeolian harp. It was part of the place and
scene, just as the dying sunlight and faintly breathing wind were part of the
scene and hour, and the mellow notes of old-fashioned plaintive horns, pierced
here and there by the sharper strings, all half smothered by the continuous
booming of the deep drum, touched his soul with a curiously potent spell that
was almost too engrossing to be quite pleasant.
</p>

<p>
There was a certain queer sense of bewitchment in it all. The music seemed to
him oddly unartificial. It made him think of trees swept by the wind, of night
breezes singing among wires and chimney-stacks, or in the rigging of invisible
ships; or&mdash;and the simile leaped up in his thoughts with a sudden
sharpness of suggestion&mdash;a chorus of animals, of wild creatures, somewhere
in desolate places of the world, crying and singing as animals will, to the
moon. He could fancy he heard the wailing, half-human cries of cats upon the
tiles at night, rising and falling with weird intervals of sound, and this
music, muffled by distance and the trees, made him think of a queer company of
these creatures on some roof far away in the sky, uttering their solemn music
to one another and the moon in chorus.
</p>

<p>
It was, he felt at the time, a singular image to occur to him, yet it expressed
his sensation pictorially better than anything else. The instruments played
such impossibly odd intervals, and the crescendos and diminuendos were so very
suggestive of cat-land on the tiles at night, rising swiftly, dropping without
warning to deep notes again, and all in such strange confusion of discords and
accords. But, at the same time a plaintive sweetness resulted on the whole, and
the discords of these half-broken instruments were so singular that they did
not distress his musical soul like fiddles out of tune.
</p>

<p>
He listened a long time, wholly surrendering himself as his character was, and
then strolled homewards in the dusk as the air grew chilly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There was nothing to alarm?&rdquo; put in Dr. Silence briefly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Absolutely nothing,&rdquo; said Vezin; &ldquo;but you know it was all so
fantastical and charming that my imagination was profoundly impressed. Perhaps,
too,&rdquo; he continued, gently explanatory, &ldquo;it was this stirring of my
imagination that caused other impressions; for, as I walked back, the spell of
the place began to steal over me in a dozen ways, though all intelligible ways.
But there were other things I could not account for in the least, even
then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Incidents, you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hardly incidents, I think. A lot of vivid sensations crowded themselves
upon my mind and I could trace them to no causes. It was just after sunset and
the tumbled old buildings traced magical outlines against an opalescent sky of
gold and red. The dusk was running down the twisted streets. All round the hill
the plain pressed in like a dim sea, its level rising with the darkness. The
spell of this kind of scene, you know, can be very moving, and it was so that
night. Yet I felt that what came to me had nothing directly to do with the
mystery and wonder of the scene.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not merely the subtle transformations of the spirit that come with
beauty,&rdquo; put in the doctor, noticing his hesitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Vezin went on, duly encouraged and no longer so fearful
of our smiles at his expense. &ldquo;The impressions came from somewhere else.
For instance, down the busy main street where men and women were bustling home
from work, shopping at stalls and barrows, idly gossiping in groups, and all
the rest of it, I saw that I aroused no interest and that no one turned to
stare at me as a foreigner and stranger. I was utterly ignored, and my presence
among them excited no special interest or attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then, quite suddenly, it dawned upon me with conviction that all the
time this indifference and inattention were merely feigned. Everybody as a
matter of fact was watching me closely. Every movement I made was known and
observed. Ignoring me was all a pretence&mdash;an elaborate pretence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment and looked at us to see if we were smiling, and then
continued, reassured&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is useless to ask me how I noticed this, because I simply cannot
explain it. But the discovery gave me something of a shock. Before I got back
to the inn, however, another curious thing rose up strongly in my mind and
forced my recognition of it as true. And this, too, I may as well say at once,
was equally inexplicable to me. I mean I can only give you the fact, as fact it
was to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little man left his chair and stood on the mat before the fire. His
diffidence lessened from now onwards, as he lost himself again in the magic of
the old adventure. His eyes shone a little already as he talked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on, his soft voice rising somewhat with his
excitement, &ldquo;I was in a shop when it came to me first&mdash;though the
idea must have been at work for a long time subconsciously to appear in so
complete a form all at once. I was buying socks, I think,&rdquo; he laughed,
&ldquo;and struggling with my dreadful French, when it struck me that the woman
in the shop did not care two pins whether I bought anything or not. She was
indifferent whether she made a sale or did not make a sale. She was only
pretending to sell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This sounds a very small and fanciful incident to build upon what
follows. But really it was not small. I mean it was the spark that lit the line
of powder and ran along to the big blaze in my mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the whole town, I suddenly realised, was something other than I so
far saw it. The real activities and interests of the people were elsewhere and
otherwise than appeared. Their true lives lay somewhere out of sight behind the
scenes. Their busy-ness was but the outward semblance that masked their actual
purposes. They bought and sold, and ate and drank, and walked about the
streets, yet all the while the main stream of their existence lay somewhere
beyond my ken, underground, in secret places. In the shops and at the stalls
they did not care whether I purchased their articles or not; at the inn, they
were indifferent to my staying or going; their life lay remote from my own,
springing from hidden, mysterious sources, coursing out of sight, unknown. It
was all a great elaborate pretence, assumed possibly for my benefit, or
possibly for purposes of their own. But the main current of their energies ran
elsewhere. I almost felt as an unwelcome foreign substance might be expected to
feel when it has found its way into the human system and the whole body
organises itself to eject it or to absorb it. The town was doing this very
thing to me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This bizarre notion presented itself forcibly to my mind as I walked
home to the inn, and I began busily to wonder wherein the true life of this
town could lie and what were the actual interests and activities of its hidden
life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, now that my eyes were partly opened, I noticed other things too
that puzzled me, first of which, I think, was the extraordinary silence of the
whole place. Positively, the town was muffled. Although the streets were paved
with cobbles the people moved about silently, softly, with padded feet, like
cats. Nothing made noise. All was hushed, subdued, muted. The very voices were
quiet, low-pitched like purring. Nothing clamorous, vehement or emphatic seemed
able to live in the drowsy atmosphere of soft dreaming that soothed this little
hill-town into its sleep. It was like the woman at the inn&mdash;an outward
repose screening intense inner activity and purpose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yet there was no sign of lethargy or sluggishness anywhere about it. The
people were active and alert. Only a magical and uncanny softness lay over them
all like a spell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Vezin passed his hand across his eyes for a moment as though the memory had
become very vivid. His voice had run off into a whisper so that we heard the
last part with difficulty. He was telling a true thing obviously, yet something
that he both liked and hated telling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I went back to the inn,&rdquo; he continued presently in a louder voice,
&ldquo;and dined. I felt a new strange world about me. My old world of reality
receded. Here, whether I liked it or no, was something new and
incomprehensible. I regretted having left the train so impulsively. An
adventure was upon me, and I loathed adventures as foreign to my nature.
Moreover, this was the beginning apparently of an adventure somewhere deep
within me, in a region I could not check or measure, and a feeling of alarm
mingled itself with my wonder&mdash;alarm for the stability of what I had for
forty years recognised as my &lsquo;personality.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I went upstairs to bed, my mind teeming with thoughts that were unusual
to me, and of rather a haunting description. By way of relief I kept thinking
of that nice, prosaic noisy train and all those wholesome, blustering
passengers. I almost wished I were with them again. But my dreams took me
elsewhere. I dreamed of cats, and soft-moving creatures, and the silence of
life in a dim muffled world beyond the senses.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Vezin stayed on from day to day, indefinitely, much longer than he had
intended. He felt in a kind of dazed, somnolent condition. He did nothing in
particular, but the place fascinated him and he could not decide to leave.
Decisions were always very difficult for him and he sometimes wondered how he
had ever brought himself to the point of leaving the train. It seemed as though
some one else must have arranged it for him, and once or twice his thoughts ran
to the swarthy Frenchman who had sat opposite. If only he could have understood
that long sentence ending so strangely with &ldquo;<i>à cause du sommeil et à
cause des chats</i>.&rdquo; He wondered what it all meant.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the hushed softness of the town held him prisoner and he sought in
his muddling, gentle way to find out where the mystery lay, and what it was all
about. But his limited French and his constitutional hatred of active
investigation made it hard for him to buttonhole anybody and ask questions. He
was content to observe, and watch, and remain negative.
</p>

<p>
The weather held on calm and hazy, and this just suited him. He wandered about
the town till he knew every street and alley. The people suffered him to come
and go without let or hindrance, though it became clearer to him every day that
he was never free himself from observation. The town watched him as a cat
watches a mouse. And he got no nearer to finding out what they were all so busy
with or where the main stream of their activities lay. This remained hidden.
The people were as soft and mysterious as cats.
</p>

<p>
But that he was continually under observation became more evident from day to
day.
</p>

<p>
For instance, when he strolled to the end of the town and entered a little
green public garden beneath the ramparts and seated himself upon one of the
empty benches in the sun, he was quite alone&mdash;at first. Not another seat
was occupied; the little park was empty, the paths deserted. Yet, within ten
minutes of his coming, there must have been fully twenty persons scattered
about him, some strolling aimlessly along the gravel walks, staring at the
flowers, and others seated on the wooden benches enjoying the sun like himself.
None of them appeared to take any notice of him; yet he understood quite well
they had all come there to watch. They kept him under close observation. In the
street they had seemed busy enough, hurrying upon various errands; yet these
were suddenly all forgotten and they had nothing to do but loll and laze in the
sun, their duties unremembered. Five minutes after he left, the garden was
again deserted, the seats vacant. But in the crowded street it was the same
thing again; he was never alone. He was ever in their thoughts.
</p>

<p>
By degrees, too, he began to see how it was he was so cleverly watched, yet
without the appearance of it. The people did nothing <i>directly</i>. They
behaved <i>obliquely</i>. He laughed in his mind as the thought thus clothed
itself in words, but the phrase exactly described it. They looked at him from
angles which naturally should have led their sight in another direction
altogether. Their movements were oblique, too, so far as these concerned
himself. The straight, direct thing was not their way evidently. They did
nothing obviously. If he entered a shop to buy, the woman walked instantly away
and busied herself with something at the farther end of the counter, though
answering at once when he spoke, showing that she knew he was there and that
this was only her way of attending to him. It was the fashion of the cat she
followed. Even in the dining-room of the inn, the be-whiskered and courteous
waiter, lithe and silent in all his movements, never seemed able to come
straight to his table for an order or a dish. He came by zigzags, indirectly,
vaguely, so that he appeared to be going to another table altogether, and only
turned suddenly at the last moment, and was there beside him.
</p>

<p>
Vezin smiled curiously to himself as he described how he began to realize these
things. Other tourists there were none in the hostel, but he recalled the
figures of one or two old men, inhabitants, who took their <i>déjeuner</i> and
dinner there, and remembered how fantastically they entered the room in similar
fashion. First, they paused in the doorway, peering about the room, and then,
after a temporary inspection, they came in, as it were, sideways, keeping close
to the walls so that he wondered which table they were making for, and at the
last minute making almost a little quick run to their particular seats. And
again he thought of the ways and methods of cats.
</p>

<p>
Other small incidents, too, impressed him as all part of this queer, soft town
with its muffled, indirect life, for the way some of the people appeared and
disappeared with extraordinary swiftness puzzled him exceedingly. It may have
been all perfectly natural, he knew, yet he could not make it out how the
alleys swallowed them up and shot them forth in a second of time when there
were no visible doorways or openings near enough to explain the phenomenon.
Once he followed two elderly women who, he felt, had been particularly
examining him from across the street&mdash;quite near the inn this
was&mdash;and saw them turn the corner a few feet only in front of him. Yet
when he sharply followed on their heels he saw nothing but an utterly deserted
alley stretching in front of him with no sign of a living thing. And the only
opening through which they could have escaped was a porch some fifty yards
away, which not the swiftest human runner could have reached in time.
</p>

<p>
And in just such sudden fashion people appeared, when he never expected them.
Once when he heard a great noise of fighting going on behind a low wall, and
hurried up to see what was going on, what should he see but a group of girls
and women engaged in vociferous conversation which instantly hushed itself to
the normal whispering note of the town when his head appeared over the wall.
And even then none of them turned to look at him directly, but slunk off with
the most unaccountable rapidity into doors and sheds across the yard. And their
voices, he thought, had sounded so like, so strangely like, the angry snarling
of fighting animals, almost of cats.
</p>

<p>
The whole spirit of the town, however, continued to evade him as something
elusive, protean, screened from the outer world, and at the same time
intensely, genuinely vital; and, since he now formed part of its life, this
concealment puzzled and irritated him; more&mdash;it began rather to frighten
him.
</p>

<p>
Out of the mists that slowly gathered about his ordinary surface thoughts,
there rose again the idea that the inhabitants were waiting for him to declare
himself, to take an attitude, to do this, or to do that; and that when he had
done so they in their turn would at length make some direct response, accepting
or rejecting him. Yet the vital matter concerning which his decision was
awaited came no nearer to him.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice he purposely followed little processions or groups of the
citizens in order to find out, if possible, on what purpose they were bent; but
they always discovered him in time and dwindled away, each individual going his
or her own way. It was always the same: he never could learn what their main
interest was. The cathedral was ever empty, the old church of St. Martin, at
the other end of the town, deserted. They shopped because they had to, and not
because they wished to. The booths stood neglected, the stalls unvisited, the
little <i>cafés</i> desolate. Yet the streets were always full, the townsfolk
ever on the bustle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can it be,&rdquo; he thought to himself, yet with a deprecating laugh
that he should have dared to think anything so odd, &ldquo;can it be that these
people are people of the twilight, that they live only at night their real
life, and come out honestly only with the dusk? That during the day they make a
sham though brave pretence, and after the sun is down their true life begins?
Have they the souls of night-things, and is the whole blessed town in the hands
of the cats?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fancy somehow electrified him with little shocks of shrinking and dismay.
Yet, though he affected to laugh, he knew that he was beginning to feel more
than uneasy, and that strange forces were tugging with a thousand invisible
cords at the very centre of his being. Something utterly remote from his
ordinary life, something that had not waked for years, began faintly to stir in
his soul, sending feelers abroad into his brain and heart, shaping queer
thoughts and penetrating even into certain of his minor actions. Something
exceedingly vital to himself, to his soul, hung in the balance.
</p>

<p>
And, always when he returned to the inn about the hour of sunset, he saw the
figures of the townsfolk stealing through the dusk from their shop doors,
moving sentry-wise to and fro at the corners of the streets, yet always
vanishing silently like shadows at his near approach. And as the inn invariably
closed its doors at ten o&rsquo;clock he had never yet found the opportunity he
rather half-heartedly sought to see for himself what account the town could
give of itself at night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;<i>à cause du sommeil et à cause des chats</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the
words now rang in his ears more and more often, though still as yet without any
definite meaning.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, something made him sleep like the dead.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
It was, I think, on the fifth day&mdash;though in this detail his story
sometimes varied&mdash;that he made a definite discovery which increased his
alarm and brought him up to a rather sharp climax. Before that he had already
noticed that a change was going forward and certain subtle transformations
being brought about in his character which modified several of his minor
habits. And he had affected to ignore them. Here, however, was something he
could no longer ignore; and it startled him.
</p>

<p>
At the best of times he was never very positive, always negative rather,
compliant and acquiescent; yet, when necessity arose he was capable of
reasonably vigorous action and could take a strongish decision. The discovery
he now made that brought him up with such a sharp turn was that this power had
positively dwindled to nothing. He found it impossible to make up his mind.
For, on this fifth day, he realised that he had stayed long enough in the town
and that for reasons he could only vaguely define to himself it was wiser
<i>and safer</i> that he should leave.
</p>

<p>
And he found that he could not leave!
</p>

<p>
This is difficult to describe in words, and it was more by gesture and the
expression of his face that he conveyed to Dr. Silence the state of impotence
he had reached. All this spying and watching, he said, had as it were spun a
net about his feet so that he was trapped and powerless to escape; he felt like
a fly that had blundered into the intricacies of a great web; he was caught,
imprisoned, and could not get away. It was a distressing sensation. A numbness
had crept over his will till it had become almost incapable of decision. The
mere thought of vigorous action&mdash;action towards escape&mdash;began to
terrify him. All the currents of his life had turned inwards upon himself,
striving to bring to the surface something that lay buried almost beyond reach,
determined to force his recognition of something he had long
forgotten&mdash;forgotten years upon years, centuries almost ago. It seemed as
though a window deep within his being would presently open and reveal an
entirely new world, yet somehow a world that was not unfamiliar. Beyond that,
again, he fancied a great curtain hung; and when that too rolled up he would
see still farther into this region and at last understand something of the
secret life of these extraordinary people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this why they wait and watch?&rdquo; he asked himself with rather a
shaking heart, &ldquo;for the time when I shall join them&mdash;or refuse to
join them? Does the decision rest with me after all, and not with them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And it was at this point that the sinister character of the adventure first
really declared itself, and he became genuinely alarmed. The stability of his
rather fluid little personality was at stake, he felt, and something in his
heart turned coward.
</p>

<p>
Why otherwise should he have suddenly taken to walking stealthily, silently,
making as little sound as possible, for ever looking behind him? Why else
should he have moved almost on tiptoe about the passages of the practically
deserted inn, and when he was abroad have found himself deliberately taking
advantage of what cover presented itself? And why, if he was not afraid, should
the wisdom of staying indoors after sundown have suddenly occurred to him as
eminently desirable? Why, indeed?
</p>

<p>
And, when John Silence gently pressed him for an explanation of these things,
he admitted apologetically that he had none to give.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was simply that I feared something might happen to me unless I kept a
sharp look-out. I felt afraid. It was instinctive,&rdquo; was all he could say.
&ldquo;I got the impression that the whole town was after me&mdash;wanted me
for something; and that if it got me I should lose myself, or at least the Self
I knew, in some unfamiliar state of consciousness. But I am not a psychologist,
you know,&rdquo; he added meekly, &ldquo;and I cannot define it better than
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was while lounging in the courtyard half an hour before the evening meal
that Vezin made this discovery, and he at once went upstairs to his quiet room
at the end of the winding passage to think it over alone. In the yard it was
empty enough, true, but there was always the possibility that the big woman
whom he dreaded would come out of some door, with her pretence of knitting, to
sit and watch him. This had happened several times, and he could not endure the
sight of her. He still remembered his original fancy, bizarre though it was,
that she would spring upon him the moment his back was turned and land with one
single crushing leap upon his neck. Of course it was nonsense, but then it
haunted him, and once an idea begins to do that it ceases to be nonsense. It
has clothed itself in reality.
</p>

<p>
He went upstairs accordingly. It was dusk, and the oil lamps had not yet been
lit in the passages. He stumbled over the uneven surface of the ancient
flooring, passing the dim outlines of doors along the corridor&mdash;doors that
he had never once seen opened&mdash;rooms that seemed never occupied. He moved,
as his habit now was, stealthily and on tiptoe.
</p>

<p>
Half-way down the last passage to his own chamber there was a sharp turn, and
it was just here, while groping round the walls with outstretched hands, that
his fingers touched something that was not wall&mdash;something that moved. It
was soft and warm in texture, indescribably fragrant, and about the height of
his shoulder; and he immediately thought of a furry, sweet-smelling kitten. The
next minute he knew it was something quite different.
</p>

<p>
Instead of investigating, however,&mdash;his nerves must have been too
overwrought for that, he said,&mdash;he shrank back as closely as possible
against the wall on the other side. The thing, whatever it was, slipped past
him with a sound of rustling and, retreating with light footsteps down the
passage behind him, was gone. A breath of warm, scented air was wafted to his
nostrils.
</p>

<p>
Vezin caught his breath for an instant and paused, stockstill, half leaning
against the wall&mdash;and then almost ran down the remaining distance and
entered his room with a rush, locking the door hurriedly behind him. Yet it was
not fear that made him run: it was excitement, pleasurable excitement. His
nerves were tingling, and a delicious glow made itself felt all over his body.
In a flash it came to him that this was just what he had felt twenty-five years
ago as a boy when he was in love for the first time. Warm currents of life ran
all over him and mounted to his brain in a whirl of soft delight. His mood was
suddenly become tender, melting, loving.
</p>

<p>
The room was quite dark, and he collapsed upon the sofa by the window,
wondering what had happened to him and what it all meant. But the only thing he
understood clearly in that instant was that something in him had swiftly,
magically changed: he no longer wished to leave, or to argue with himself about
leaving. The encounter in the passage-way had changed all that. The strange
perfume of it still hung about him, bemusing his heart and mind. For he knew
that it was a girl who had passed him, a girl&rsquo;s face that his fingers had
brushed in the darkness, and he felt in some extraordinary way as though he had
been actually kissed by her, kissed full upon the lips.
</p>

<p>
Trembling, he sat upon the sofa by the window and struggled to collect his
thoughts. He was utterly unable to understand how the mere passing of a girl in
the darkness of a narrow passage-way could communicate so electric a thrill to
his whole being that he still shook with the sweetness of it. Yet, there it
was! And he found it as useless to deny as to attempt analysis. Some ancient
fire had entered his veins, and now ran coursing through his blood; and that he
was forty-five instead of twenty did not matter one little jot. Out of all the
inner turmoil and confusion emerged the one salient fact that the mere
atmosphere, the merest casual touch, of this girl, unseen, unknown in the
darkness, had been sufficient to stir dormant fires in the centre of his heart,
and rouse his whole being from a state of feeble sluggishness to one of tearing
and tumultuous excitement.
</p>

<p>
After a time, however, the number of Vezin&rsquo;s years began to assert their
cumulative power; he grew calmer, and when a knock came at length upon his door
and he heard the waiter&rsquo;s voice suggesting that dinner was nearly over,
he pulled himself together and slowly made his way downstairs into the
dining-room.
</p>

<p>
Every one looked up as he entered, for he was very late, but he took his
customary seat in the far corner and began to eat. The trepidation was still in
his nerves, but the fact that he had passed through the courtyard and hall
without catching sight of a petticoat served to calm him a little. He ate so
fast that he had almost caught up with the current stage of the table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te, when a slight commotion in the room drew his attention.
</p>

<p>
His chair was so placed that the door and the greater portion of the long
<i>salle à manger</i> were behind him, yet it was not necessary to turn round
to know that the same person he had passed in the dark passage had now come
into the room. He felt the presence long before he heard or saw any one. Then
he became aware that the old men, the only other guests, were rising one by one
in their places, and exchanging greetings with some one who passed among them
from table to table. And when at length he turned with his heart beating
furiously to ascertain for himself, he saw the form of a young girl, lithe and
slim, moving down the centre of the room and making straight for his own table
in the corner. She moved wonderfully, with sinuous grace, like a young panther,
and her approach filled him with such delicious bewilderment that he was
utterly unable to tell at first what her face was like, or discover what it was
about the whole presentment of the creature that filled him anew with
trepidation and delight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Ma&rsquo;mselle est de retour!&rdquo; he heard the old waiter murmur
at his side, and he was just able to take in that she was the daughter of the
proprietress, when she was upon him, and he heard her voice. She was addressing
him. Something of red lips he saw and laughing white teeth, and stray wisps of
fine dark hair about the temples; but all the rest was a dream in which his own
emotion rose like a thick cloud before his eyes and prevented his seeing
accurately, or knowing exactly what he did. He was aware that she greeted him
with a charming little bow; that her beautiful large eyes looked searchingly
into his own; that the perfume he had noticed in the dark passage again
assailed his nostrils, and that she was bending a little towards him and
leaning with one hand on the table at this side. She was quite close to
him&mdash;that was the chief thing he knew&mdash;explaining that she had been
asking after the comfort of her mother&rsquo;s guests, and now was introducing
herself to the latest arrival&mdash;himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieur has already been here a few days,&rdquo; he heard the
waiter say; and then her own voice, sweet as singing, replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, but M&rsquo;sieur is not going to leave us just yet, I hope. My
mother is too old to look after the comfort of our guests properly, but now I
am here I will remedy all that.&rdquo; She laughed deliciously.
&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieur shall be well looked after.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Vezin, struggling with his emotion and desire to be polite, half rose to
acknowledge the pretty speech, and to stammer some sort of reply, but as he did
so his hand by chance touched her own that was resting upon the table, and a
shock that was for all the world like a shock of electricity, passed from her
skin into his body. His soul wavered and shook deep within him. He caught her
eyes fixed upon his own with a look of most curious intentness, and the next
moment he knew that he had sat down wordless again on his chair, that the girl
was already half-way across the room, and that he was trying to eat his salad
with a dessert-spoon and a knife.
</p>

<p>
Longing for her return, and yet dreading it, he gulped down the remainder of
his dinner, and then went at once to his bedroom to be alone with his thoughts.
This time the passages were lighted, and he suffered no exciting contretemps;
yet the winding corridor was dim with shadows, and the last portion, from the
bend of the walls onwards, seemed longer than he had ever known it. It ran
downhill like the pathway on a mountain side, and as he tiptoed softly down it
he felt that by rights it ought to have led him clean out of the house into the
heart of a great forest. The world was singing with him. Strange fancies filled
his brain, and once in the room, with the door securely locked, he did not
light the candles, but sat by the open window thinking long, long thoughts that
came unbidden in troops to his mind.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
This part of the story he told to Dr. Silence, without special coaxing, it is
true, yet with much stammering embarrassment. He could not in the least
understand, he said, how the girl had managed to affect him so profoundly, and
even before he had set eyes upon her. For her mere proximity in the darkness
had been sufficient to set him on fire. He knew nothing of enchantments, and
for years had been a stranger to anything approaching tender relations with any
member of the opposite sex, for he was encased in shyness, and realised his
overwhelming defects only too well. Yet this bewitching young creature came to
him deliberately. Her manner was unmistakable, and she sought him out on every
possible occasion. Chaste and sweet she was undoubtedly, yet frankly inviting;
and she won him utterly with the first glance of her shining eyes, even if she
had not already done so in the dark merely by the magic of her invisible
presence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You felt she was altogether wholesome and good!&rdquo; queried the
doctor. &ldquo;You had no reaction of any sort&mdash;for instance, of
alarm?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Vezin looked up sharply with one of his inimitable little apologetic smiles. It
was some time before he replied. The mere memory of the adventure had suffused
his shy face with blushes, and his brown eyes sought the floor again before he
answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can quite say that,&rdquo; he explained presently.
&ldquo;I acknowledged certain qualms, sitting up in my room afterwards. A
conviction grew upon me that there was something about her&mdash;how shall I
express it?&mdash;well, something unholy. It is not impurity in any sense,
physical or mental, that I mean, but something quite indefinable that gave me a
vague sensation of the creeps. She drew me, and at the same time repelled me,
more than&mdash;than&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated, blushing furiously, and unable to finish the sentence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing like it has ever come to me before or since,&rdquo; he
concluded, with lame confusion. &ldquo;I suppose it was, as you suggested just
now, something of an enchantment. At any rate, it was strong enough to make me
feel that I would stay in that awful little haunted town for years if only I
could see her every day, hear her voice, watch her wonderful movements, and
sometimes, perhaps, touch her hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you explain to me what you felt was the source of her power?&rdquo;
John Silence asked, looking purposely anywhere but at the narrator.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am surprised that you should ask me such a question,&rdquo; answered
Vezin, with the nearest approach to dignity he could manage. &ldquo;I think no
man can describe to another convincingly wherein lies the magic of the woman
who ensnares him. I certainly cannot. I can only say this slip of a girl
bewitched me, and the mere knowledge that she was living and sleeping in the
same house filled me with an extraordinary sense of delight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing I can tell you,&rdquo; he went on earnestly,
his eyes aglow, &ldquo;namely, that she seemed to sum up and synthesise in
herself all the strange hidden forces that operated so mysteriously in the town
and its inhabitants. She had the silken movements of the panther, going
smoothly, silently to and fro, and the same indirect, oblique methods as the
townsfolk, screening, like them, secret purposes of her own&mdash;purposes that
I was sure had <i>me</i> for their objective. She kept me, to my terror and
delight, ceaselessly under observation, yet so carelessly, so consummately,
that another man less sensitive, if I may say so&rdquo;&mdash;he made a
deprecating gesture&mdash;&ldquo;or less prepared by what had gone before,
would never have noticed it at all. She was always still, always reposeful, yet
she seemed to be everywhere at once, so that I never could escape from her. I
was continually meeting the stare and laughter of her great eyes, in the
corners of the rooms, in the passages, calmly looking at me through the
windows, or in the busiest parts of the public streets.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Their intimacy, it seems, grew very rapidly after this first encounter which
had so violently disturbed the little man&rsquo;s equilibrium. He was naturally
very prim, and prim folk live mostly in so small a world that anything
violently unusual may shake them clean out of it, and they therefore
instinctively distrust originality. But Vezin began to forget his primness
after awhile. The girl was always modestly behaved, and as her mother&rsquo;s
representative she naturally had to do with the guests in the hotel. It was not
out of the way that a spirit of camaraderie should spring up. Besides, she was
young, she was charmingly pretty, she was French, and&mdash;she obviously liked
him.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, there was something indescribable&mdash;a certain indefinable
atmosphere of other places, other times&mdash;that made him try hard to remain
on his guard, and sometimes made him catch his breath with a sudden start. It
was all rather like a delirious dream, half delight, half dread, he confided in
a whisper to Dr. Silence; and more than once he hardly knew quite what he was
doing or saying, as though he were driven forward by impulses he scarcely
recognised as his own.
</p>

<p>
And though the thought of leaving presented itself again and again to his mind,
it was each time with less insistence, so that he stayed on from day to day,
becoming more and more a part of the sleepy life of this dreamy mediaeval town,
losing more and more of his recognisable personality. Soon, he felt, the
Curtain within would roll up with an awful rush, and he would find himself
suddenly admitted into the secret purposes of the hidden life that lay behind
it all. Only, by that time, he would have become transformed into an entirely
different being.
</p>

<p>
And, meanwhile, he noticed various little signs of the intention to make his
stay attractive to him: flowers in his bedroom, a more comfortable arm-chair in
the corner, and even special little extra dishes on his private table in the
dining-room. Conversations, too, with &ldquo;Mademoiselle Ilsé&rdquo; became
more and more frequent and pleasant, and although they seldom travelled beyond
the weather, or the details of the town, the girl, he noticed, was never in a
hurry to bring them to an end, and often contrived to interject little odd
sentences that he never properly understood, yet felt to be significant.
</p>

<p>
And it was these stray remarks, full of a meaning that evaded him, that pointed
to some hidden purpose of her own and made him feel uneasy. They all had to do,
he felt sure, with reasons for his staying on in the town indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And has M&rsquo;sieur not even yet come to a decision?&rdquo; she said
softly in his ear, sitting beside him in the sunny yard before <i>déjeuner</i>,
the acquaintance having progressed with significant rapidity. &ldquo;Because,
if it&rsquo;s so difficult, we must all try together to help him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The question startled him, following upon his own thoughts. It was spoken with
a pretty laugh, and a stray bit of hair across one eye, as she turned and
peered at him half roguishly. Possibly he did not quite understand the French
of it, for her near presence always confused his small knowledge of the
language distressingly. Yet the words, and her manner, and something else that
lay behind it all in her mind, frightened him. It gave such point to his
feeling that the town was waiting for him to make his mind up on some important
matter.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, her voice, and the fact that she was there so close beside
him in her soft dark dress, thrilled him inexpressibly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is true I find it difficult to leave,&rdquo; he stammered, losing his
way deliciously in the depths of her eyes, &ldquo;and especially now that
Mademoiselle Ilsé has come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was surprised at the success of his sentence, and quite delighted with the
little gallantry of it. But at the same time he could have bitten his tongue
off for having said it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then after all you like our little town, or you would not be pleased to
stay on,&rdquo; she said, ignoring the compliment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am enchanted with it, and enchanted with you,&rdquo; he cried, feeling
that his tongue was somehow slipping beyond the control of his brain. And he
was on the verge of saying all manner of other things of the wildest
description, when the girl sprang lightly up from her chair beside him, and
made to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is <i>soupe à l&rsquo;onion</i> to-day!&rdquo; she cried, laughing
back at him through the sunlight, &ldquo;and I must go and see about it.
Otherwise, you know, M&rsquo;sieur will not enjoy his dinner, and then,
perhaps, he will leave us!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He watched her cross the courtyard, moving with all the grace and lightness of
the feline race, and her simple black dress clothed her, he thought, exactly
like the fur of the same supple species. She turned once to laugh at him from
the porch with the glass door, and then stopped a moment to speak to her
mother, who sat knitting as usual in her corner seat just inside the hall-way.
</p>

<p>
But how was it, then, that the moment his eye fell upon this ungainly woman,
the pair of them appeared suddenly as other than they were? Whence came that
transforming dignity and sense of power that enveloped them both as by magic?
What was it about that massive woman that made her appear instantly regal, and
set her on a throne in some dark and dreadful scenery, wielding a sceptre over
the red glare of some tempestuous orgy? And why did this slender stripling of a
girl, graceful as a willow, lithe as a young leopard, assume suddenly an air of
sinister majesty, and move with flame and smoke about her head, and the
darkness of night beneath her feet?
</p>

<p>
Vezin caught his breath and sat there transfixed. Then, almost simultaneously
with its appearance, the queer notion vanished again, and the sunlight of day
caught them both, and he heard her laughing to her mother about the <i>soupe à
l&rsquo;onion</i>, and saw her glancing back at him over her dear little
shoulder with a smile that made him think of a dew-kissed rose bending lightly
before summer airs.
</p>

<p>
And, indeed, the onion soup was particularly excellent that day, because he saw
another cover laid at his small table, and, with fluttering heart, heard the
waiter murmur by way of explanation that &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;mselle Ilsé would
honour M&rsquo;sieur to-day at <i>déjeuner</i>, as her custom sometimes is with
her mother&rsquo;s guests.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So actually she sat by him all through that delirious meal, talking quietly to
him in easy French, seeing that he was well looked after, mixing the
salad-dressing, and even helping him with her own hand. And, later in the
afternoon, while he was smoking in the courtyard, longing for a sight of her as
soon as her duties were done, she came again to his side, and when he rose to
meet her, she stood facing him a moment, full of a perplexing sweet shyness
before she spoke&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My mother thinks you ought to know more of the beauties of our little
town, and <i>I</i> think so too! Would M&rsquo;sieur like me to be his guide,
perhaps? I can show him everything, for our family has lived here for many
generations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had him by the hand, indeed, before he could find a single word to express
his pleasure, and led him, all unresisting, out into the street, yet in such a
way that it seemed perfectly natural she should do so, and without the faintest
suggestion of boldness or immodesty. Her face glowed with the pleasure and
interest of it, and with her short dress and tumbled hair she looked every bit
the charming child of seventeen that she was, innocent and playful, proud of
her native town, and alive beyond her years to the sense of its ancient beauty.
</p>

<p>
So they went over the town together, and she showed him what she considered its
chief interest: the tumble-down old house where her forebears had lived; the
sombre, aristocratic-looking mansion where her mother&rsquo;s family dwelt for
centuries, and the ancient market-place where several hundred years before the
witches had been burnt by the score. She kept up a lively running stream of
talk about it all, of which he understood not a fiftieth part as he trudged
along by her side, cursing his forty-five years and feeling all the yearnings
of his early manhood revive and jeer at him. And, as she talked, England and
Surbiton seemed very far away indeed, almost in another age of the
world&rsquo;s history. Her voice touched something immeasurably old in him,
something that slept deep. It lulled the surface parts of his consciousness to
sleep, allowing what was far more ancient to awaken. Like the town, with its
elaborate pretence of modern active life, the upper layers of his being became
dulled, soothed, muffled, and what lay underneath began to stir in its sleep.
That big Curtain swayed a little to and fro. Presently it might lift
altogether....
</p>

<p>
He began to understand a little better at last. The mood of the town was
reproducing itself in him. In proportion as his ordinary external self became
muffled, that inner secret life, that was far more real and vital, asserted
itself. And this girl was surely the high-priestess of it all, the chief
instrument of its accomplishment. New thoughts, with new interpretations,
flooded his mind as she walked beside him through the winding streets, while
the picturesque old gabled town, softly coloured in the sunset, had never
appeared to him so wholly wonderful and seductive.
</p>

<p>
And only one curious incident came to disturb and puzzle him, slight in itself,
but utterly inexplicable, bringing white terror into the child&rsquo;s face and
a scream to her laughing lips. He had merely pointed to a column of blue smoke
that rose from the burning autumn leaves and made a picture against the red
roofs, and had then run to the wall and called her to his side to watch the
flames shooting here and there through the heap of rubbish. Yet, at the sight
of it, as though taken by surprise, her face had altered dreadfully, and she
had turned and run like the wind, calling out wild sentences to him as she ran,
of which he had not understood a single word, except that the fire apparently
frightened her, and she wanted to get quickly away from it, and to get him away
too.
</p>

<p>
Yet five minutes later she was as calm and happy again as though nothing had
happened to alarm or waken troubled thoughts in her, and they had both
forgotten the incident.
</p>

<p>
They were leaning over the ruined ramparts together listening to the weird
music of the band as he had heard it the first day of his arrival. It moved him
again profoundly as it had done before, and somehow he managed to find his
tongue and his best French. The girl leaned across the stones close beside him.
No one was about. Driven by some remorseless engine within he began to stammer
something&mdash;he hardly knew what&mdash;of his strange admiration for her.
Almost at the first word she sprang lightly off the wall and came up smiling in
front of him, just touching his knees as he sat there. She was hatless as
usual, and the sun caught her hair and one side of her cheek and throat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; she cried, clapping her little hands
softly in his face, &ldquo;so very glad, because that means that if you like me
you must also like what I do, and what I belong to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Already he regretted bitterly having lost control of himself. Something in the
phrasing of her sentence chilled him. He knew the fear of embarking upon an
unknown and dangerous sea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will take part in our real life, I mean,&rdquo; she added softly,
with an indescribable coaxing of manner, as though she noticed his shrinking.
&ldquo;You will come back to us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Already this slip of a child seemed to dominate him; he felt her power coming
over him more and more; something emanated from her that stole over his senses
and made him aware that her personality, for all its simple grace, held forces
that were stately, imposing, august. He saw her again moving through smoke and
flame amid broken and tempestuous scenery, alarmingly strong, her terrible
mother by her side. Dimly this shone through her smile and appearance of
charming innocence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will, I know,&rdquo; she repeated, holding him with her eyes.
</p>

<p>
They were quite alone up there on the ramparts, and the sensation that she was
overmastering him stirred a wild sensuousness in his blood. The mingled abandon
and reserve in her attracted him furiously, and all of him that was man rose up
and resisted the creeping influence, at the same time acclaiming it with the
full delight of his forgotten youth. An irresistible desire came to him to
question her, to summon what still remained to him of his own little
personality in an effort to retain the right to his normal self.
</p>

<p>
The girl had grown quiet again, and was now leaning on the broad wall close
beside him, gazing out across the darkening plain, her elbows on the coping,
motionless as a figure carved in stone. He took his courage in both hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me, Ilsé,&rdquo; he said, unconsciously imitating her own purring
softness of voice, yet aware that he was utterly in earnest, &ldquo;what is the
meaning of this town, and what is this real life you speak of? And why is it
that the people watch me from morning to night? Tell me what it all means? And,
tell me,&rdquo; he added more quickly with passion in his voice, &ldquo;what
you really are&mdash;yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned her head and looked at him through half-closed eyelids, her growing
inner excitement betraying itself by the faint colour that ran like a shadow
across her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo;&mdash;he faltered oddly under her
gaze&mdash;&ldquo;that I have some right to know&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she opened her eyes to the full. &ldquo;You love me, then?&rdquo; she
asked softly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I swear,&rdquo; he cried impetuously, moved as by the force of a rising
tide, &ldquo;I never felt before&mdash;I have never known any other girl
who&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you <i>have</i> the right to know,&rdquo; she calmly interrupted
his confused confession, &ldquo;for love shares all secrets.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused, and a thrill like fire ran swiftly through him. Her words lifted
him off the earth, and he felt a radiant happiness, followed almost the same
instant in horrible contrast by the thought of death. He became aware that she
had turned her eyes upon his own and was speaking again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The real life I speak of,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is the old, old
life within, the life of long ago, the life to which you, too, once belonged,
and to which you still belong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A faint wave of memory troubled the deeps of his soul as her low voice sank
into him. What she was saying he knew instinctively to be true, even though he
could not as yet understand its full purport. His present life seemed slipping
from him as he listened, merging his personality in one that was far older and
greater. It was this loss of his present self that brought to him the thought
of death.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You came here,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;with the purpose of seeking
it, and the people felt your presence and are waiting to know what you decide,
whether you will leave them without having found it, or whether&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her eyes remained fixed upon his own, but her face began to change, growing
larger and darker with an expression of age.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is their thoughts constantly playing about your soul that makes you
feel they watch you. They do not watch you with their eyes. The purposes of
their inner life are calling to you, seeking to claim you. You were all part of
the same life long, long ago, and now they want you back again among
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Vezin&rsquo;s timid heart sank with dread as he listened; but the girl&rsquo;s
eyes held him with a net of joy so that he had no wish to escape. She
fascinated him, as it were, clean out of his normal self.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alone, however, the people could never have caught and held you,&rdquo;
she resumed. &ldquo;The motive force was not strong enough; it has faded
through all these years. But I&rdquo;&mdash;she paused a moment and looked at
him with complete confidence in her splendid eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I possess the
spell to conquer you and hold you: the spell of old love. I can win you back
again and make you live the old life with me, for the force of the ancient tie
between us, if I choose to use it, is irresistible. And I do choose to use it.
I still want you. And you, dear soul of my dim past&rdquo;&mdash;she pressed
closer to him so that her breath passed across his eyes, and her voice
positively sang&mdash;&ldquo;I mean to have you, for you love me and are
utterly at my mercy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Vezin heard, and yet did not hear; understood, yet did not understand. He had
passed into a condition of exaltation. The world was beneath his feet, made of
music and flowers, and he was flying somewhere far above it through the
sunshine of pure delight. He was breathless and giddy with the wonder of her
words. They intoxicated him. And, still, the terror of it all, the dreadful
thought of death, pressed ever behind her sentences. For flames shot through
her voice out of black smoke and licked at his soul.
</p>

<p>
And they communicated with one another, it seemed to him, by a process of swift
telepathy, for his French could never have compassed all he said to her. Yet
she understood perfectly, and what she said to him was like the recital of
verses long since known. And the mingled pain and sweetness of it as he
listened were almost more than his little soul could hold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yet I came here wholly by chance&mdash;&rdquo; he heard himself saying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried with passion, &ldquo;you came here because I called
to you. I have called to you for years, and you came with the whole force of
the past behind you. You had to come, for I own you, and I claim you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She rose again and moved closer, looking at him with a certain insolence in the
face&mdash;the insolence of power.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set behind the towers of the old cathedral and the darkness rose up
from the plain and enveloped them. The music of the band had ceased. The leaves
of the plane trees hung motionless, but the chill of the autumn evening rose
about them and made Vezin shiver. There was no sound but the sound of their
voices and the occasional soft rustle of the girl&rsquo;s dress. He could hear
the blood rushing in his ears. He scarcely realised where he was or what he was
doing. Some terrible magic of the imagination drew him deeply down into the
tombs of his own being, telling him in no unfaltering voice that her words
shadowed forth the truth. And this simple little French maid, speaking beside
him with so strange authority, he saw curiously alter into quite another being.
As he stared into her eyes, the picture in his mind grew and lived, dressing
itself vividly to his inner vision with a degree of reality he was compelled to
acknowledge. As once before, he saw her tall and stately, moving through wild
and broken scenery of forests and mountain caverns, the glare of flames behind
her head and clouds of shifting smoke about her feet. Dark leaves encircled her
hair, flying loosely in the wind, and her limbs shone through the merest rags
of clothing. Others were about her, too, and ardent eyes on all sides cast
delirious glances upon her, but her own eyes were always for One only, one whom
she held by the hand. For she was leading the dance in some tempestuous orgy to
the music of chanting voices, and the dance she led circled about a great and
awful Figure on a throne, brooding over the scene through lurid vapours, while
innumerable other wild faces and forms crowded furiously about her in the
dance. But the one she held by the hand he knew to be himself, and the
monstrous shape upon the throne he knew to be her mother.
</p>

<p>
The vision rose within him, rushing to him down the long years of buried time,
crying aloud to him with the voice of memory reawakened.... And then the scene
faded away and he saw the clear circle of the girl&rsquo;s eyes gazing
steadfastly into his own, and she became once more the pretty little daughter
of the innkeeper, and he found his voice again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he whispered tremblingly&mdash;&ldquo;you child of
visions and enchantment, how is it that you so bewitch me that I loved you even
before I saw?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She drew herself up beside him with an air of rare dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The call of the Past,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and besides,&rdquo; she
added proudly, &ldquo;in the real life I am a princess&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A princess!&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;and my mother is a queen!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this, little Vezin utterly lost his head. Delight tore at his heart and
swept him into sheer ecstasy. To hear that sweet singing voice, and to see
those adorable little lips utter such things, upset his balance beyond all hope
of control. He took her in his arms and covered her unresisting face with
kisses.
</p>

<p>
But even while he did so, and while the hot passion swept him, he felt that she
was soft and loathsome, and that her answering kisses stained his very soul....
And when, presently, she had freed herself and vanished into the darkness, he
stood there, leaning against the wall in a state of collapse, creeping with
horror from the touch of her yielding body, and inwardly raging at the weakness
that he already dimly realised must prove his undoing.
</p>

<p>
And from the shadows of the old buildings into which she disappeared there rose
in the stillness of the night a singular, long-drawn cry, which at first he
took for laughter, but which later he was sure he recognised as the almost
human wailing of a cat.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
For a long time Vezin leant there against the wall, alone with his surging
thoughts and emotions. He understood at length that he had done the one thing
necessary to call down upon him the whole force of this ancient Past. For in
those passionate kisses he had acknowledged the tie of olden days, and had
revived it. And the memory of that soft impalpable caress in the darkness of
the inn corridor came back to him with a shudder. The girl had first mastered
him, and then led him to the one act that was necessary for her purpose. He had
been waylaid, after the lapse of centuries&mdash;caught, and conquered.
</p>

<p>
Dimly he realised this, and sought to make plans for his escape. But, for the
moment at any rate, he was powerless to manage his thoughts or will, for the
sweet, fantastic madness of the whole adventure mounted to his brain like a
spell, and he gloried in the feeling that he was utterly enchanted and moving
in a world so much larger and wilder than the one he had ever been accustomed
to.
</p>

<p>
The moon, pale and enormous, was just rising over the sea-like plain, when at
last he rose to go. Her slanting rays drew all the houses into new perspective,
so that their roofs, already glistening with dew, seemed to stretch much higher
into the sky than usual, and their gables and quaint old towers lay far away in
its purple reaches.
</p>

<p>
The cathedral appeared unreal in a silver mist. He moved softly, keeping to the
shadows; but the streets were all deserted and very silent; the doors were
closed, the shutters fastened. Not a soul was astir. The hush of night lay over
everything; it was like a town of the dead, a churchyard with gigantic and
grotesque tombstones.
</p>

<p>
Wondering where all the busy life of the day had so utterly disappeared to, he
made his way to a back door that entered the inn by means of the stables,
thinking thus to reach his room unobserved. He reached the courtyard safely and
crossed it by keeping close to the shadow of the wall. He sidled down it,
mincing along on tiptoe, just as the old men did when they entered the <i>salle
à manger</i>. He was horrified to find himself doing this instinctively. A
strange impulse came to him, catching him somehow in the centre of his
body&mdash;an impulse to drop upon all fours and run swiftly and silently. He
glanced upwards and the idea came to him to leap up upon his window-sill
overhead instead of going round by the stairs. This occurred to him as the
easiest, and most natural way. It was like the beginning of some horrible
transformation of himself into something else. He was fearfully strung up.
</p>

<p>
The moon was higher now, and the shadows very dark along the side of the street
where he moved. He kept among the deepest of them, and reached the porch with
the glass doors.
</p>

<p>
But here there was light; the inmates, unfortunately, were still about. Hoping
to slip across the hall unobserved and reach the stairs, he opened the door
carefully and stole in. Then he saw that the hall was not empty. A large dark
thing lay against the wall on his left. At first he thought it must be
household articles. Then it moved, and he thought it was an immense cat,
distorted in some way by the play of light and shadow. Then it rose straight up
before him and he saw that it was the proprietress.
</p>

<p>
What she had been doing in this position he could only venture a dreadful
guess, but the moment she stood up and faced him he was aware of some terrible
dignity clothing her about that instantly recalled the girl&rsquo;s strange
saying that she was a queen. Huge and sinister she stood there under the little
oil lamp; alone with him in the empty hall. Awe stirred in his heart, and the
roots of some ancient fear. He felt that he must bow to her and make some kind
of obeisance. The impulse was fierce and irresistible, as of long habit. He
glanced quickly about him. There was no one there. Then he deliberately
inclined his head toward her. He bowed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enfin! M&rsquo;sieur s&rsquo;est donc décidé. C&rsquo;est bien alors.
J&rsquo;en suis contente.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her words came to him sonorously as through a great open space.
</p>

<p>
Then the great figure came suddenly across the flagged hall at him and seized
his trembling hands. Some overpowering force moved with her and caught him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On pourrait faire un p&rsquo;tit tour ensemble, n&rsquo;est-ce pas? Nous
y allons cette nuit et il faut s&rsquo;exercer un peu d&rsquo;avance pour cela.
Ilsé, Ilsé, viens donc ici. Viens vite!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And she whirled him round in the opening steps of some dance that seemed oddly
and horribly familiar. They made no sound on the stones, this strangely
assorted couple. It was all soft and stealthy. And presently, when the air
seemed to thicken like smoke, and a red glare as of flame shot through it, he
was aware that some one else had joined them and that his hand the mother had
released was now tightly held by the daughter. Ilsé had come in answer to the
call, and he saw her with leaves of vervain twined in her dark hair, clothed in
tattered vestiges of some curious garment, beautiful as the night, and
horribly, odiously, loathsomely seductive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To the Sabbath! to the Sabbath!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;On to the
Witches&rsquo; Sabbath!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Up and down that narrow hall they danced, the women on each side of him, to the
wildest measure he had ever imagined, yet which he dimly, dreadfully
remembered, till the lamp on the wall flickered and went out, and they were
left in total darkness. And the devil woke in his heart with a thousand vile
suggestions and made him afraid.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly they released his hands and he heard the voice of the mother cry that
it was time, and they must go. Which way they went he did not pause to see. He
only realised that he was free, and he blundered through the darkness till he
found the stairs and then tore up them to his room as though all hell was at
his heels.
</p>

<p>
He flung himself on the sofa, with his face in his hands, and groaned. Swiftly
reviewing a dozen ways of immediate escape, all equally impossible, he finally
decided that the only thing to do for the moment was to sit quiet and wait. He
must see what was going to happen. At least in the privacy of his own bedroom
he would be fairly safe. The door was locked. He crossed over and softly opened
the window which gave upon the courtyard and also permitted a partial view of
the hall through the glass doors.
</p>

<p>
As he did so the hum and murmur of a great activity reached his ears from the
streets beyond&mdash;the sound of footsteps and voices muffled by distance. He
leaned out cautiously and listened. The moonlight was clear and strong now, but
his own window was in shadow, the silver disc being still behind the house. It
came to him irresistibly that the inhabitants of the town, who a little while
before had all been invisible behind closed doors, were now issuing forth, busy
upon some secret and unholy errand. He listened intently.
</p>

<p>
At first everything about him was silent, but soon he became aware of movements
going on in the house itself. Rustlings and cheepings came to him across that
still, moonlit yard. A concourse of living beings sent the hum of their
activity into the night. Things were on the move everywhere. A biting, pungent
odour rose through the air, coming he knew not whence. Presently his eyes
became glued to the windows of the opposite wall where the moonshine fell in a
soft blaze. The roof overhead, and behind him, was reflected clearly in the
panes of glass, and he saw the outlines of dark bodies moving with long
footsteps over the tiles and along the coping. They passed swiftly and
silently, shaped like immense cats, in an endless procession across the
pictured glass, and then appeared to leap down to a lower level where he lost
sight of them. He just caught the soft thudding of their leaps. Sometimes their
shadows fell upon the white wall opposite, and then he could not make out
whether they were the shadows of human beings or of cats. They seemed to change
swiftly from one to the other. The transformation looked horribly real, for
they leaped like human beings, yet changed swiftly in the air immediately
afterwards, and dropped like animals.
</p>

<p>
The yard, too, beneath him, was now alive with the creeping movements of dark
forms all stealthily drawing towards the porch with the glass doors. They kept
so closely to the wall that he could not determine their actual shape, but when
he saw that they passed on to the great congregation that was gathering in the
hall, he understood that these were the creatures whose leaping shadows he had
first seen reflected in the windowpanes opposite. They were coming from all
parts of the town, reaching the appointed meeting-place across the roofs and
tiles, and springing from level to level till they came to the yard.
</p>

<p>
Then a new sound caught his ear, and he saw that the windows all about him were
being softly opened, and that to each window came a face. A moment later
figures began dropping hurriedly down into the yard. And these figures, as they
lowered themselves down from the windows, were human, he saw; but once safely
in the yard they fell upon all fours and changed in the swiftest possible
second into&mdash;cats&mdash;huge, silent cats. They ran in streams to join the
main body in the hall beyond.
</p>

<p>
So, after all, the rooms in the house had not been empty and unoccupied.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, what he saw no longer filled him with amazement. For he remembered it
all. It was familiar. It had all happened before just so, hundreds of times,
and he himself had taken part in it and known the wild madness of it all. The
outline of the old building changed, the yard grew larger, and he seemed to be
staring down upon it from a much greater height through smoky vapours. And, as
he looked, half remembering, the old pains of long ago, fierce and sweet,
furiously assailed him, and the blood stirred horribly as he heard the Call of
the Dance again in his heart and tasted the ancient magic of Ilsé whirling by
his side.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he started back. A great lithe cat had leaped softly up from the
shadows below on to the sill close to his face, and was staring fixedly at him
with the eyes of a human. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; it seemed to say, &ldquo;come
with us to the Dance! Change as of old! Transform yourself swiftly and
come!&rdquo; Only too well he understood the creature&rsquo;s soundless call.
</p>

<p>
It was gone again in a flash with scarcely a sound of its padded feet on the
stones, and then others dropped by the score down the side of the house, past
his very eyes, all changing as they fell and darting away rapidly, softly,
towards the gathering point. And again he felt the dreadful desire to do
likewise; to murmur the old incantation, and then drop upon hands and knees and
run swiftly for the great flying leap into the air. Oh, how the passion of it
rose within him like a flood, twisting his very entrails, sending his
heart&rsquo;s desire flaming forth into the night for the old, old Dance of the
Sorcerers at the Witches&rsquo; Sabbath! The whirl of the stars was about him;
once more he met the magic of the moon. The power of the wind, rushing from
precipice and forest, leaping from cliff to cliff across the valleys, tore him
away.... He heard the cries of the dancers and their wild laughter, and with
this savage girl in his embrace he danced furiously about the dim Throne where
sat the Figure with the sceptre of majesty....
</p>

<p>
Then, suddenly, all became hushed and still, and the fever died down a little
in his heart. The calm moonlight flooded a courtyard empty and deserted. They
had started. The procession was off into the sky. And he was left
behind&mdash;alone.
</p>

<p>
Vezin tiptoed softly across the room and unlocked the door. The murmur from the
streets, growing momentarily as he advanced, met his ears. He made his way with
the utmost caution down the corridor. At the head of the stairs he paused and
listened. Below him, the hall where they had gathered was dark and still, but
through opened doors and windows on the far side of the building came the sound
of a great throng moving farther and farther into the distance.
</p>

<p>
He made his way down the creaking wooden stairs, dreading yet longing to meet
some straggler who should point the way, but finding no one; across the dark
hall, so lately thronged with living, moving things, and out through the opened
front doors into the street. He could not believe that he was really left
behind, really forgotten, that he had been purposely permitted to escape. It
perplexed him.
</p>

<p>
Nervously he peered about him, and up and down the street; then, seeing
nothing, advanced slowly down the pavement.
</p>

<p>
The whole town, as he went, showed itself empty and deserted, as though a great
wind had blown everything alive out of it. The doors and windows of the houses
stood open to the night; nothing stirred; moonlight and silence lay over all.
The night lay about him like a cloak. The air, soft and cool, caressed his
cheek like the touch of a great furry paw. He gained confidence and began to
walk quickly, though still keeping to the shadowed side. Nowhere could he
discover the faintest sign of the great unholy exodus he knew had just taken
place. The moon sailed high over all in a sky cloudless and serene.
</p>

<p>
Hardly realising where he was going, he crossed the open market-place and so
came to the ramparts, whence he knew a pathway descended to the high road and
along which he could make good his escape to one of the other little towns that
lay to the northward, and so to the railway.
</p>

<p>
But first he paused and gazed out over the scene at his feet where the great
plain lay like a silver map of some dream country. The still beauty of it
entered his heart, increasing his sense of bewilderment and unreality. No air
stirred, the leaves of the plane trees stood motionless, the near details were
defined with the sharpness of day against dark shadows, and in the distance the
fields and woods melted away into haze and shimmering mistiness.
</p>

<p>
But the breath caught in his throat and he stood stockstill as though
transfixed when his gaze passed from the horizon and fell upon the near
prospect in the depth of the valley at his feet. The whole lower slopes of the
hill, that lay hid from the brightness of the moon, were aglow, and through the
glare he saw countless moving forms, shifting thick and fast between the
openings of the trees; while overhead, like leaves driven by the wind, he
discerned flying shapes that hovered darkly one moment against the sky and then
settled down with cries and weird singing through the branches into the region
that was aflame.
</p>

<p>
Spellbound, he stood and stared for a time that he could not measure. And then,
moved by one of the terrible impulses that seemed to control the whole
adventure, he climbed swiftly upon the top of the broad coping, and balanced a
moment where the valley gaped at his feet. But in that very instant, as he
stood hovering, a sudden movement among the shadows of the houses caught his
eye, and he turned to see the outline of a large animal dart swiftly across the
open space behind him, and land with a flying leap upon the top of the wall a
little lower down. It ran like the wind to his feet and then rose up beside him
upon the ramparts. A shiver seemed to run through the moonlight, and his sight
trembled for a second. His heart pulsed fearfully. Ilsé stood beside him,
peering into his face.
</p>

<p>
Some dark substance, he saw, stained the girl&rsquo;s face and skin, shining in
the moonlight as she stretched her hands towards him; she was dressed in
wretched tattered garments that yet became her mightily; rue and vervain twined
about her temples; her eyes glittered with unholy light. He only just
controlled the wild impulse to take her in his arms and leap with her from
their giddy perch into the valley below.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she cried, pointing with an arm on which the rags fluttered
in the rising wind towards the forest aglow in the distance. &ldquo;See where
they await us! The woods are alive! Already the Great Ones are there, and the
dance will soon begin! The salve is here! Anoint yourself and come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Though a moment before the sky was clear and cloudless, yet even while she
spoke the face of the moon grew dark and the wind began to toss in the crests
of the plane trees at his feet. Stray gusts brought the sounds of hoarse
singing and crying from the lower slopes of the hill, and the pungent odour he
had already noticed about the courtyard of the inn rose about him in the air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Transform, transform!&rdquo; she cried again, her voice rising like a
song. &ldquo;Rub well your skin before you fly. Come! Come with me to the
Sabbath, to the madness of its furious delight, to the sweet abandonment of its
evil worship! See! the Great Ones are there, and the terrible Sacraments
prepared. The Throne is occupied. Anoint and come! Anoint and come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She grew to the height of a tree beside him, leaping upon the wall with flaming
eyes and hair strewn upon the night. He too began to change swiftly. Her hands
touched the skin of his face and neck, streaking him with the burning salve
that sent the old magic into his blood with the power before which fades all
that is good.
</p>

<p>
A wild roar came up to his ears from the heart of the wood, and the girl, when
she heard it, leaped upon the wall in the frenzy of her wicked joy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Satan is there!&rdquo; she screamed, rushing upon him and striving to
draw him with her to the edge of the wall. &ldquo;Satan has come. The
Sacraments call us! Come, with your dear apostate soul, and we will worship and
dance till the moon dies and the world is forgotten!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just saving himself from the dreadful plunge, Vezin struggled to release
himself from her grasp, while the passion tore at his reins and all but
mastered him. He shrieked aloud, not knowing what he said, and then he shrieked
again. It was the old impulses, the old awful habits instinctively finding
voice; for though it seemed to him that he merely shrieked nonsense, the words
he uttered really had meaning in them, and were intelligible. It was the
ancient call. And it was heard below. It was answered.
</p>

<p>
The wind whistled at the skirts of his coat as the air round him darkened with
many flying forms crowding upwards out of the valley. The crying of hoarse
voices smote upon his ears, coming closer. Strokes of wind buffeted him,
tearing him this way and that along the crumbling top of the stone wall; and
Ilsé clung to him with her long shining arms, smooth and bare, holding him fast
about the neck. But not Ilsé alone, for a dozen of them surrounded him,
dropping out of the air. The pungent odour of the anointed bodies stifled him,
exciting him to the old madness of the Sabbath, the dance of the witches and
sorcerers doing honour to the personified Evil of the world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anoint and away! Anoint and away!&rdquo; they cried in wild chorus about
him. &ldquo;To the Dance that never dies! To the sweet and fearful fantasy of
evil!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another moment and he would have yielded and gone, for his will turned soft and
the flood of passionate memory all but overwhelmed him, when&mdash;so can a
small thing alter the whole course of an adventure&mdash;he caught his foot
upon a loose stone in the edge of the wall, and then fell with a sudden crash
on to the ground below. But he fell towards the houses, in the open space of
dust and cobblestones, and fortunately not into the gaping depth of the valley
on the farther side.
</p>

<p>
And they, too, came in a tumbling heap about him, like flies upon a piece of
food, but as they fell he was released for a moment from the power of their
touch, and in that brief instant of freedom there flashed into his mind the
sudden intuition that saved him. Before he could regain his feet he saw them
scrabbling awkwardly back upon the wall, as though bat-like they could only fly
by dropping from a height, and had no hold upon him in the open. Then, seeing
them perched there in a row like cats upon a roof, all dark and singularly
shapeless, their eyes like lamps, the sudden memory came back to him of
Ilsé&rsquo;s terror at the sight of fire.
</p>

<p>
Quick as a flash he found his matches and lit the dead leaves that lay under
the wall.
</p>

<p>
Dry and withered, they caught fire at once, and the wind carried the flame in a
long line down the length of the wall, licking upwards as it ran; and with
shrieks and wailings, the crowded row of forms upon the top melted away into
the air on the other side, and were gone with a great rush and whirring of
their bodies down into the heart of the haunted valley, leaving Vezin
breathless and shaken in the middle of the deserted ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ilsé!&rdquo; he called feebly; &ldquo;Ilsé!&rdquo; for his heart ached
to think that she was really gone to the great Dance without him, and that he
had lost the opportunity of its fearful joy. Yet at the same time his relief
was so great, and he was so dazed and troubled in mind with the whole thing,
that he hardly knew what he was saying, and only cried aloud in the fierce
storm of his emotion....
</p>

<p>
The fire under the wall ran its course, and the moonlight came out again, soft
and clear, from its temporary eclipse. With one last shuddering look at the
ruined ramparts, and a feeling of horrid wonder for the haunted valley beyond,
where the shapes still crowded and flew, he turned his face towards the town
and slowly made his way in the direction of the hotel.
</p>

<p>
And as he went, a great wailing of cries, and a sound of howling, followed him
from the gleaming forest below, growing fainter and fainter with the bursts of
wind as he disappeared between the houses.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;It may seem rather abrupt to you, this sudden tame ending,&rdquo; said
Arthur Vezin, glancing with flushed face and timid eyes at Dr. Silence sitting
there with his notebook, &ldquo;but the fact is&mdash;er&mdash;from that moment
my memory seems to have failed rather. I have no distinct recollection of how I
got home or what precisely I did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It appears I never went back to the inn at all. I only dimly recollect
racing down a long white road in the moonlight, past woods and villages, still
and deserted, and then the dawn came up, and I saw the towers of a biggish town
and so came to a station.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, long before that, I remember pausing somewhere on the road and
looking back to where the hill-town of my adventure stood up in the moonlight,
and thinking how exactly like a great monstrous cat it lay there upon the
plain, its huge front paws lying down the two main streets, and the twin and
broken towers of the cathedral marking its torn ears against the sky. That
picture stays in my mind with the utmost vividness to this day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Another thing remains in my mind from that escape&mdash;namely, the
sudden sharp reminder that I had not paid my bill, and the decision I made,
standing there on the dusty highroad, that the small baggage I had left behind
would more than settle for my indebtedness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the rest, I can only tell you that I got coffee and bread at a café
on the outskirts of this town I had come to, and soon after found my way to the
station and caught a train later in the day. That same evening I reached
London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how long altogether,&rdquo; asked John Silence quietly, &ldquo;do
you think you stayed in the town of the adventure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Vezin looked up sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was coming to that,&rdquo; he resumed, with apologetic wrigglings of
his body. &ldquo;In London I found that I was a whole week out in my reckoning
of time. I had stayed over a week in the town, and it ought to have been
September 15th,&mdash;instead of which it was only September 10th!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So that, in reality, you had only stayed a night or two in the
inn?&rdquo; queried the doctor.
</p>

<p>
Vezin hesitated before replying. He shuffled upon the mat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must have gained time somewhere,&rdquo; he said at
length&mdash;&ldquo;somewhere or somehow. I certainly had a week to my credit.
I can&rsquo;t explain it. I can only give you the fact.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this happened to you last year, since when you have never been back
to the place?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Last autumn, yes,&rdquo; murmured Vezin; &ldquo;and I have never dared
to go back. I think I never want to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, tell me,&rdquo; asked Dr. Silence at length, when he saw that the
little man had evidently come to the end of his words and had nothing more to
say, &ldquo;had you ever read up the subject of the old witchcraft practices
during the Middle Ages, or been at all interested in the subject?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; declared Vezin emphatically. &ldquo;I had never given a
thought to such matters so far as I know&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or to the question of reincarnation, perhaps?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never&mdash;before my adventure; but I have since,&rdquo; he replied
significantly.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, something still on the man&rsquo;s mind that he wished to
relieve himself of by confession, yet could only with difficulty bring himself
to mention; and it was only after the sympathetic tactfulness of the doctor had
provided numerous openings that he at length availed himself of one of them,
and stammered that he would like to show him the marks he still had on his neck
where, he said, the girl had touched him with her anointed hands.
</p>

<p>
He took off his collar after infinite fumbling hesitation, and lowered his
shirt a little for the doctor to see. And there, on the surface of the skin,
lay a faint reddish line across the shoulder and extending a little way down
the back towards the spine. It certainly indicated exactly the position an arm
might have taken in the act of embracing. And on the other side of the neck,
slightly higher up, was a similar mark, though not quite so clearly defined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was where she held me that night on the ramparts,&rdquo; he
whispered, a strange light coming and going in his eyes.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
It was some weeks later when I again found occasion to consult John Silence
concerning another extraordinary case that had come under my notice, and we
fell to discussing Vezin&rsquo;s story. Since hearing it, the doctor had made
investigations on his own account, and one of his secretaries had discovered
that Vezin&rsquo;s ancestors had actually lived for generations in the very
town where the adventure came to him. Two of them, both women, had been tried
and convicted as witches, and had been burned alive at the stake. Moreover, it
had not been difficult to prove that the very inn where Vezin stayed was built
about 1700 upon the spot where the funeral pyres stood and the executions took
place. The town was a sort of headquarters for all the sorcerers and witches of
the entire region, and after conviction they were burnt there literally by
scores.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems strange,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;that Vezin should
have remained ignorant of all this; but, on the other hand, it was not the kind
of history that successive generations would have been anxious to keep alive,
or to repeat to their children. Therefore I am inclined to think he still knows
nothing about it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The whole adventure seems to have been a very vivid revival of the
memories of an earlier life, caused by coming directly into contact with the
living forces still intense enough to hang about the place, and, by a most
singular chance, too, with the very souls who had taken part with him in the
events of that particular life. For the mother and daughter who impressed him
so strangely must have been leading actors, with himself, in the scenes and
practices of witchcraft which at that period dominated the imaginations of the
whole country.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One has only to read the histories of the times to know that these
witches claimed the power of transforming themselves into various animals, both
for the purposes of disguise and also to convey themselves swiftly to the
scenes of their imaginary orgies. Lycanthropy, or the power to change
themselves into wolves, was everywhere believed in, and the ability to
transform themselves into cats by rubbing their bodies with a special salve or
ointment provided by Satan himself, found equal credence. The witchcraft trials
abound in evidences of such universal beliefs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence quoted chapter and verse from many writers on the subject, and
showed how every detail of Vezin&rsquo;s adventure had a basis in the practices
of those dark days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that the entire affair took place subjectively in the man&rsquo;s
own consciousness, I have no doubt,&rdquo; he went on, in reply to my
questions; &ldquo;for my secretary who has been to the town to investigate,
discovered his signature in the visitors&rsquo; book, and proved by it that he
had arrived on September 8th, and left suddenly without paying his bill. He
left two days later, and they still were in possession of his dirty brown bag
and some tourist clothes. I paid a few francs in settlement of his debt, and
have sent his luggage on to him. The daughter was absent from home, but the
proprietress, a large woman very much as he described her, told my secretary
that he had seemed a very strange, absent-minded kind of gentleman, and after
his disappearance she had feared for a long time that he had met with a violent
end in the neighbouring forest where he used to roam about alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like to have obtained a personal interview with the daughter so
as to ascertain how much was subjective and how much actually took place with
her as Vezin told it. For her dread of fire and the sight of burning must, of
course, have been the intuitive memory of her former painful death at the
stake, and have thus explained why he fancied more than once that he saw her
through smoke and flame.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And that mark on his skin, for instance?&rdquo; I inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Merely the marks produced by hysterical brooding,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;like the stigmata of the <i>religieuses</i>, and the bruises which
appear on the bodies of hypnotised subjects who have been told to expect them.
This is very common and easily explained. Only it seems curious that these
marks should have remained so long in Vezin&rsquo;s case. Usually they
disappear quickly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Obviously he is still thinking about it all, brooding, and living it all
over again,&rdquo; I ventured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Probably. And this makes me fear that the end of his trouble is not yet.
We shall hear of him again. It is a case, alas! I can do little to
alleviate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence spoke gravely and with sadness in his voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what do you make of the Frenchman in the train?&rdquo; I asked
further&mdash;&ldquo;the man who warned him against the place, <i>à cause du
sommeil et à cause des chats?</i> Surely a very singular incident?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A very singular incident indeed,&rdquo; he made answer slowly,
&ldquo;and one I can only explain on the basis of a highly improbable
coincidence&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Namely?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That the man was one who had himself stayed in the town and undergone
there a similar experience. I should like to find this man and ask him. But the
crystal is useless here, for I have no slightest clue to go upon, and I can
only conclude that some singular psychic affinity, some force still active in
his being out of the same past life, drew him thus to the personality of Vezin,
and enabled him to fear what might happen to him, and thus to warn him as he
did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he presently continued, half talking to himself, &ldquo;I
suspect in this case that Vezin was swept into the vortex of forces arising out
of the intense activities of a past life, and that he lived over again a scene
in which he had often played a leading part centuries before. For strong
actions set up forces that are so slow to exhaust themselves, they may be said
in a sense never to die. In this case they were not vital enough to render the
illusion complete, so that the little man found himself caught in a very
distressing confusion of the present and the past; yet he was sufficiently
sensitive to recognise that it was true, and to fight against the degradation
of returning, even in memory, to a former and lower state of development.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah yes!&rdquo; he continued, crossing the floor to gaze at the darkening
sky, and seemingly quite oblivious of my presence, &ldquo;subliminal up-rushes
of memory like this can be exceedingly painful, and sometimes exceedingly
dangerous. I only trust that this gentle soul may soon escape from this
obsession of a passionate and tempestuous past. But I doubt it, I doubt
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His voice was hushed with sadness as he spoke, and when he turned back into the
room again there was an expression of profound yearning upon his face, the
yearning of a soul whose desire to help is sometimes greater than his power.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap03"></a>CASE III: THE NEMESIS OF FIRE</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
By some means which I never could fathom, John Silence always contrived to keep
the compartment to himself, and as the train had a clear run of two hours
before the first stop, there was ample time to go over the preliminary facts of
the case. He had telephoned to me that very morning, and even through the
disguise of the miles of wire the thrill of incalculable adventure had sounded
in his voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As if it were an ordinary country visit,&rdquo; he called, in reply to
my question; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t forget to bring your gun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With blank cartridges, I suppose?&rdquo; for I knew his rigid principles
with regard to the taking of life, and guessed that the guns were merely for
some obvious purpose of disguise.
</p>

<p>
Then he thanked me for coming, mentioned the train, snapped down the receiver,
and left me, vibrating with the excitement of anticipation, to do my packing.
For the honour of accompanying Dr. John Silence on one of his big cases was
what many would have considered an empty honour&mdash;and risky. Certainly the
adventure held all manner of possibilities, and I arrived at Waterloo with the
feelings of a man who is about to embark on some dangerous and peculiar mission
in which the dangers he expects to run will not be the ordinary dangers to life
and limb, but of some secret character difficult to name and still more
difficult to cope with.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Manor House has a high sound,&rdquo; he told me, as we sat with our
feet up and talked, &ldquo;but I believe it is little more than an overgrown
farmhouse in the desolate heather country beyond D&mdash;&mdash;, and its
owner, Colonel Wragge, a retired soldier with a taste for books, lives there
practically alone, I understand, with an elderly invalid sister. So you need
not look forward to a lively visit, unless the case provides some excitement of
its own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which is likely?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
By way of reply he handed me a letter marked &ldquo;Private.&rdquo; It was
dated a week ago, and signed &ldquo;Yours faithfully, Horace Wragge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He heard of me, you see, through Captain Anderson,&rdquo; the doctor
explained modestly, as though his fame were not almost world-wide; &ldquo;you
remember that Indian obsession case&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I read the letter. Why it should have been marked private was difficult to
understand. It was very brief, direct, and to the point. It referred by way of
introduction to Captain Anderson, and then stated quite simply that the writer
needed help of a peculiar kind and asked for a personal interview&mdash;a
morning interview, since it was impossible for him to be absent from the house
at night. The letter was dignified even to the point of abruptness, and it is
difficult to explain how it managed to convey to me the impression of a strong
man, shaken and perplexed. Perhaps the restraint of the wording, and the
mystery of the affair had something to do with it; and the reference to the
Anderson case, the horror of which lay still vivid in my memory, may have
touched the sense of something rather ominous and alarming. But, whatever the
cause, there was no doubt that an impression of serious peril rose somehow out
of that white paper with the few lines of firm writing, and the spirit of a
deep uneasiness ran between the words and reached the mind without any visible
form of expression.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And when you saw him&mdash;?&rdquo; I asked, returning the letter as the
train rushed clattering noisily through Clapham Junction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have not seen him,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s mind
was charged to the brim when he wrote that; full of vivid mental pictures.
Notice the restraint of it. For the main character of his case psychometry
could be depended upon, and the scrap of paper his hand has touched is
sufficient to give to another mind&mdash;a sensitive and sympathetic
mind&mdash;clear mental pictures of what is going on. I think I have a very
sound general idea of his problem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So there may be excitement, after all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John Silence waited a moment before he replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something very serious is amiss there,&rdquo; he said gravely, at
length. &ldquo;Some one&mdash;not himself, I gather,&mdash;has been meddling
with a rather dangerous kind of gunpowder. So&mdash;yes, there may be
excitement, as you put it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And my duties?&rdquo; I asked, with a decidedly growing interest.
&ldquo;Remember, I am your &lsquo;assistant.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Behave like an intelligent confidential secretary. Observe everything,
without seeming to. Say nothing&mdash;nothing that means anything. Be present
at all interviews. I may ask a good deal of you, for if my impressions are
correct this is&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He broke off suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t tell you my impressions yet,&rdquo; he resumed after a
moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Just watch and listen as the case proceeds. Form
your own impressions and cultivate your intuitions. We come as ordinary
visitors, of course,&rdquo; he added, a twinkle showing for an instant in his
eye; &ldquo;hence, the guns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Though disappointed not to hear more, I recognised the wisdom of his words and
knew how valueless my impressions would be once the powerful suggestion of
having heard his own lay behind them. I likewise reflected that intuition
joined to a sense of humour was of more use to a man than double the quantity
of mere &ldquo;brains,&rdquo; as such.
</p>

<p>
Before putting the letter away, however, he handed it back, telling me to place
it against my forehead for a few moments and then describe any pictures that
came spontaneously into my mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deliberately look for anything. Just imagine you see the
inside of the eyelid, and wait for pictures that rise against its dark
screen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I followed his instructions, making my mind as nearly blank as possible. But no
visions came. I saw nothing but the lines of light that pass to and fro like
the changes of a kaleidoscope across the blackness. A momentary sensation of
warmth came and went curiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see&mdash;what?&rdquo; he asked presently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I was obliged to admit disappointedly; &ldquo;nothing
but the usual flashes of light one always sees. Only, perhaps, they are more
vivid than usual.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said nothing by way of comment or reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And they group themselves now and then,&rdquo; I continued, with painful
candour, for I longed to see the pictures he had spoken of, &ldquo;group
themselves into globes and round balls of fire, and the lines that flash about
sometimes look like triangles and crosses&mdash;almost like geometrical
figures. Nothing more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I opened my eyes again, and gave him back the letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It makes my head hot,&rdquo; I said, feeling somehow unworthy for not
seeing anything of interest. But the look in his eyes arrested my attention at
once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That sensation of heat is important,&rdquo; he said significantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was certainly real, and rather uncomfortable,&rdquo; I replied,
hoping he would expand and explain. &ldquo;There was a distinct feeling of
warmth&mdash;internal warmth somewhere&mdash;oppressive in a sense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is interesting,&rdquo; he remarked, putting the letter back in his
pocket, and settling himself in the corner with newspapers and books. He
vouchsafed nothing more, and I knew the uselessness of trying to make him talk.
Following his example I settled likewise with magazines into my corner. But
when I closed my eyes again to look for the flashing lights and the sensation
of heat, I found nothing but the usual phantasmagoria of the day&rsquo;s
events&mdash;faces, scenes, memories,&mdash;and in due course I fell asleep and
then saw nothing at all of any kind.
</p>

<p>
When we left the train, after six hours&rsquo; travelling, at a little wayside
station standing without trees in a world of sand and heather, the late October
shadows had already dropped their sombre veil upon the landscape, and the sun
dipped almost out of sight behind the moorland hills. In a high dogcart, behind
a fast horse, we were soon rattling across the undulating stretches of an open
and bleak country, the keen air stinging our cheeks and the scents of pine and
bracken strong about us. Bare hills were faintly visible against the horizon,
and the coachman pointed to a bank of distant shadows on our left where he told
us the sea lay. Occasional stone farmhouses, standing back from the road among
straggling fir trees, and large black barns that seemed to shift past us with a
movement of their own in the gloom, were the only signs of humanity and
civilisation that we saw, until at the end of a bracing five miles the lights
of the lodge gates flared before us and we plunged into a thick grove of pine
trees that concealed the Manor House up to the moment of actual arrival.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge himself met us in the hall. He was the typical army officer who
had seen service, real service, and found himself in the process. He was tall
and well built, broad in the shoulders, but lean as a greyhound, with grave
eyes, rather stern, and a moustache turning grey. I judged him to be about
sixty years of age, but his movements showed a suppleness of strength and
agility that contradicted the years. The face was full of character and
resolution, the face of a man to be depended upon, and the straight grey eyes,
it seemed to me, wore a veil of perplexed anxiety that he made no attempt to
disguise. The whole appearance of the man at once clothed the adventure with
gravity and importance. A matter that gave such a man cause for serious alarm,
I felt, must be something real and of genuine moment.
</p>

<p>
His speech and manner, as he welcomed us, were like his letter, simple and
sincere. He had a nature as direct and undeviating as a bullet. Thus, he showed
plainly his surprise that Dr. Silence had not come alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My confidential secretary, Mr. Hubbard,&rdquo; the doctor said,
introducing me, and the steady gaze and powerful shake of the hand I then
received were well calculated, I remember thinking, to drive home the
impression that here was a man who was not to be trifled with, and whose
perplexity must spring from some very real and tangible cause. And, quite
obviously, he was relieved that we had come. His welcome was unmistakably
genuine.
</p>

<p>
He led us at once into a room, half library, half smoking-room, that opened out
of the low-ceilinged hall. The Manor House gave the impression of a rambling
and glorified farmhouse, solid, ancient, comfortable, and wholly unpretentious.
And so it was. Only the heat of the place struck me as unnatural. This room
with the blazing fire may have seemed uncomfortably warm after the long drive
through the night air; yet it seemed to me that the hall itself, and the whole
atmosphere of the house, breathed a warmth that hardly belonged to well-filled
grates or the pipes of hot air and water. It was not the heat of the
greenhouse; it was an oppressive heat that somehow got into the head and mind.
It stirred a curious sense of uneasiness in me, and I caught myself thinking of
the sensation of warmth that had emanated from the letter in the train.
</p>

<p>
I heard him thanking Dr. Silence for having come; there was no preamble, and
the exchange of civilities was of the briefest description. Evidently here was
a man who, like my companion, loved action rather than talk. His manner was
straightforward and direct. I saw him in a flash: puzzled, worried, harassed
into a state of alarm by something he could not comprehend; forced to deal with
things he would have preferred to despise, yet facing it all with dogged
seriousness and making no attempt to conceal that he felt secretly ashamed of
his incompetence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I cannot offer you much entertainment beyond that of my own company,
and the queer business that has been going on here, and is still going
on,&rdquo; he said, with a slight inclination of the head towards me by way of
including me in his confidence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think, Colonel Wragge,&rdquo; replied John Silence impressively,
&ldquo;that we shall none of us find the time hangs heavy. I gather we shall
have our hands full.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at one another for the space of some seconds, and there was
an indefinable quality in their silence which for the first time made me admit
a swift question into my mind; and I wondered a little at my rashness in coming
with so little reflection into a big case of this incalculable doctor. But no
answer suggested itself, and to withdraw was, of course, inconceivable. The
gates had closed behind me now, and the spirit of the adventure was already
besieging my mind with its advance guard of a thousand little hopes and fears.
</p>

<p>
Explaining that he would wait till after dinner to discuss anything serious, as
no reference was ever made before his sister, he led the way upstairs and
showed us personally to our rooms; and it was just as I was finishing dressing
that a knock came at my door and Dr. Silence entered.
</p>

<p>
He was always what is called a serious man, so that even in moments of comedy
you felt he never lost sight of the profound gravity of life, but as he came
across the room to me I caught the expression of his face and understood in a
flash that he was now in his most grave and earnest mood. He looked almost
troubled. I stopped fumbling with my black tie and stared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is serious,&rdquo; he said, speaking in a low voice, &ldquo;more so
even than I imagined. Colonel Wragge&rsquo;s control over his thoughts
concealed a great deal in my psychometrising of the letter. I looked in to warn
you to keep yourself well in hand&mdash;generally speaking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haunted house?&rdquo; I asked, conscious of a distinct shiver down my
back.
</p>

<p>
But he smiled gravely at the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haunted House of Life more likely,&rdquo; he replied, and a look came
into his eyes which I had only seen there when a human soul was in the toils
and he was thick in the fight of rescue. He was stirred in the deeps.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Colonel Wragge&mdash;or the sister?&rdquo; I asked hurriedly, for the
gong was sounding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Neither directly,&rdquo; he said from the door. &ldquo;Something far
older, something very, very remote indeed. This thing has to do with the ages,
unless I am mistaken greatly, the ages on which the mists of memory have long
lain undisturbed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He came across the floor very quickly with a finger on his lips, looking at me
with a peculiar searchingness of gaze.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you aware yet of anything&mdash;odd here?&rdquo; he asked in a
whisper. &ldquo;Anything you cannot quite define, for instance. Tell me,
Hubbard, for I want to know all your impressions. They may help me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I shook my head, avoiding his gaze, for there was something in the eyes that
scared me a little. But he was so in earnest that I set my mind keenly
searching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing yet,&rdquo; I replied truthfully, wishing I could confess to a
real emotion; &ldquo;nothing but the strange heat of the place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave a little jump forward in my direction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The heat again, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as though glad of
my corroboration. &ldquo;And how would you describe it, perhaps?&rdquo; he
asked quickly, with a hand on the door knob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like ordinary physical heat,&rdquo; I said,
casting about in my thoughts for a definition.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More a mental heat,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;a glowing of thought
and desire, a sort of feverish warmth of the spirit. Isn&rsquo;t that
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I admitted that he had exactly described my sensations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said, as he opened the door, and with an indescribable
gesture that combined a warning to be ready with a sign of praise for my
correct intuition, he was gone.
</p>

<p>
I hurried after him, and found the two men waiting for me in front of the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ought to warn you,&rdquo; our host was saying as I came in,
&ldquo;that my sister, whom you will meet at dinner, is not aware of the real
object of your visit. She is under the impression that we are interested in the
same line of study&mdash;folklore&mdash;and that your researches have led to my
seeking acquaintance. She comes to dinner in her chair, you know. It will be a
great pleasure to her to meet you both. We have few visitors.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So that on entering the dining-room we were prepared to find Miss Wragge
already at her place, seated in a sort of bath-chair. She was a vivacious and
charming old lady, with smiling expression and bright eyes, and she chatted all
through dinner with unfailing spontaneity. She had that face, unlined and
fresh, that some people carry through life from the cradle to the grave; her
smooth plump cheeks were all pink and white, and her hair, still dark, was
divided into two glossy and sleek halves on either side of a careful parting.
She wore gold-rimmed glasses, and at her throat was a large scarab of green
jasper that made a very handsome brooch.
</p>

<p>
Her brother and Dr. Silence talked little, so that most of the conversation was
carried on between herself and me, and she told me a great deal about the
history of the old house, most of which I fear I listened to with but half an
ear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And when Cromwell stayed here,&rdquo; she babbled on, &ldquo;he occupied
the very rooms upstairs that used to be mine. But my brother thinks it safer
for me to sleep on the ground floor now in case of fire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And this sentence has stayed in my memory only because of the sudden way her
brother interrupted her and instantly led the conversation on to another topic.
The passing reference to fire seemed to have disturbed him, and thenceforward
he directed the talk himself.
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to believe that this lively and animated old lady, sitting
beside me and taking so eager an interest in the affairs of life, was
practically, we understood, without the use of her lower limbs, and that her
whole existence for years had been passed between the sofa, the bed, and the
bath-chair in which she chatted so naturally at the dinner table. She made no
allusion to her affliction until the dessert was reached, and then, touching a
bell, she made us a witty little speech about leaving us &ldquo;like time, on
noiseless feet,&rdquo; and was wheeled out of the room by the butler and
carried off to her apartments at the other end of the house.
</p>

<p>
And the rest of us were not long in following suit, for Dr. Silence and myself
were quite as eager to learn the nature of our errand as our host was to impart
it to us. He led us down a long flagged passage to a room at the very end of
the house, a room provided with double doors, and windows, I saw, heavily
shuttered. Books lined the walls on every side, and a large desk in the bow
window was piled up with volumes, some open, some shut, some showing scraps of
paper stuck between the leaves, and all smothered in a general cataract of
untidy foolscap and loose-half sheets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My study and workroom,&rdquo; explained Colonel Wragge, with a
delightful touch of innocent pride, as though he were a very serious scholar.
He placed arm-chairs for us round the fire. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he added
significantly, &ldquo;we shall be safe from interruption and can talk
securely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
During dinner the manner of the doctor had been all that was natural and
spontaneous, though it was impossible for me, knowing him as I did, not to be
aware that he was subconsciously very keenly alert and already receiving upon
the ultra-sensitive surface of his mind various and vivid impressions; and
there was now something in the gravity of his face, as well as in the
significant tone of Colonel Wragge&rsquo;s speech, and something, too, in the
fact that we three were shut away in this private chamber about to listen to
things probably strange, and certainly mysterious&mdash;something in all this
that touched my imagination sharply and sent an undeniable thrill along my
nerves. Taking the chair indicated by my host, I lit my cigar and waited for
the opening of the attack, fully conscious that we were now too far gone in the
adventure to admit of withdrawal, and wondering a little anxiously where it was
going to lead.
</p>

<p>
What I expected precisely, it is hard to say. Nothing definite, perhaps. Only
the sudden change was dramatic. A few hours before the prosaic atmosphere of
Piccadilly was about me, and now I was sitting in a secret chamber of this
remote old building waiting to hear an account of things that held possibly the
genuine heart of terror. I thought of the dreary moors and hills outside, and
the dark pine copses soughing in the wind of night; I remembered my
companion&rsquo;s singular words up in my bedroom before dinner; and then I
turned and noted carefully the stern countenance of the Colonel as he faced us
and lit his big black cigar before speaking.
</p>

<p>
The threshold of an adventure, I reflected as I waited for the first words, is
always the most thrilling moment&mdash;until the climax comes.
</p>

<p>
But Colonel Wragge hesitated&mdash;mentally&mdash;a long time before he began.
He talked briefly of our journey, the weather, the country, and other
comparatively trivial topics, while he sought about in his mind for an
appropriate entry into the subject that was uppermost in the thoughts of all of
us. The fact was he found it a difficult matter to speak of at all, and it was
Dr. Silence who finally showed him the way over the hedge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hubbard will take a few notes when you are ready&mdash;you
won&rsquo;t object,&rdquo; he suggested; &ldquo;I can give my undivided
attention in this way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; turning to reach some of the loose sheets on the
writing table, and glancing at me. He still hesitated a little, I thought.
&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he said apologetically, &ldquo;I wondered if it was
quite fair to trouble you so soon. The daylight might suit you better to hear
what I have to tell. Your sleep, I mean, might be less disturbed,
perhaps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I appreciate your thoughtfulness,&rdquo; John Silence replied with his
gentle smile, taking command as it were from that moment, &ldquo;but really we
are both quite immune. There is nothing, I think, that could prevent either of
us sleeping, except&mdash;an outbreak of fire, or some such very physical
disturbance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge raised his eyes and looked fixedly at him. This reference to an
outbreak of fire I felt sure was made with a purpose. It certainly had the
desired effect of removing from our host&rsquo;s manner the last signs of
hesitancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course, I know nothing of your
methods in matters of this kind&mdash;so, perhaps, you would like me to begin
at once and give you an outline of the situation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence bowed his agreement. &ldquo;I can then take my precautions
accordingly,&rdquo; he added calmly.
</p>

<p>
The soldier looked up for a moment as though he did not quite gather the
meaning of these words; but he made no further comment and turned at once to
tackle a subject on which he evidently talked with diffidence and
unwillingness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so utterly out of my line of things,&rdquo; he began,
puffing out clouds of cigar smoke between his words, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s
so little to tell with any real evidence behind it, that it&rsquo;s almost
impossible to make a consecutive story for you. It&rsquo;s the total cumulative
effect that is so&mdash;so disquieting.&rdquo; He chose his words with care, as
though determined not to travel one hair&rsquo;s breadth beyond the truth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I came into this place twenty years ago when my elder brother
died,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but could not afford to live here then. My
sister, whom you met at dinner, kept house for him till the end, and during all
these years, while I was seeing service abroad, she had an eye to the
place&mdash;for we never got a satisfactory tenant&mdash;and saw that it was
not allowed to go to ruin. I myself took possession, however, only a year ago.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; he went on, after a perceptible pause, &ldquo;spent
much of his time away, too. He was a great traveller, and filled the house with
stuff he brought home from all over the world. The laundry&mdash;a small
detached building beyond the servants&rsquo; quarters&mdash;he turned into a
regular little museum. The curios and things I have cleared away&mdash;they
collected dust and were always getting broken&mdash;but the laundry-house you
shall see tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge spoke with such deliberation and with so many pauses that this
beginning took him a long time. But at this point he came to a full stop
altogether. Evidently there was something he wished to say that cost him
considerable effort. At length he looked up steadily into my companion&rsquo;s
face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I ask you&mdash;that is, if you won&rsquo;t think it strange,&rdquo;
he said, and a sort of hush came over his voice and manner, &ldquo;whether you
have noticed anything at all unusual&mdash;anything queer, since you came into
the house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence answered without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is a curious sensation of heat in
the place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, with a slight start. &ldquo;You
<i>have</i> noticed it. This unaccountable heat&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But its cause, I gather, is not in the house itself&mdash;but
outside,&rdquo; I was astonished to hear the doctor add.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge rose from his chair and turned to unhook a framed map that hung
upon the wall. I got the impression that the movement was made with the
deliberate purpose of concealing his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your diagnosis, I believe, is amazingly accurate,&rdquo; he said after a
moment, turning round with the map in his hands. &ldquo;Though, of course, I
can have no idea how you should guess&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John Silence shrugged his shoulders expressively. &ldquo;Merely my
impression,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you pay attention to impressions, and do
not allow them to be confused by deductions of the intellect, you will often
find them surprisingly, uncannily, accurate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge resumed his seat and laid the map upon his knees. His face was
very thoughtful as he plunged abruptly again into his story.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On coming into possession,&rdquo; he said, looking us alternately in the
face, &ldquo;I found a crop of stories of the most extraordinary and impossible
kind I had ever heard&mdash;stories which at first I treated with amused
indifference, but later was forced to regard seriously, if only to keep my
servants. These stories I thought I traced to the fact of my brother&rsquo;s
death&mdash;and, in a way, I think so still.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leant forward and handed the map to Dr. Silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old plan of the estate,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but
accurate enough for our purpose, and I wish you would note the position of the
plantations marked upon it, especially those near the house. That one,&rdquo;
indicating the spot with his finger, &ldquo;is called the Twelve Acre
Plantation. It was just there, on the side nearest the house, that my brother
and the head keeper met their deaths.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke as a man forced to recognise facts that he deplored, and would have
preferred to leave untouched&mdash;things he personally would rather have
treated with ridicule if possible. It made his words peculiarly dignified and
impressive, and I listened with an increasing uneasiness as to the sort of help
the doctor would look to me for later. It seemed as though I were a spectator
of some drama of mystery in which any moment I might be summoned to play a
part.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was twenty years ago,&rdquo; continued the Colonel, &ldquo;but there
was much talk about it at the time, unfortunately, and you may, perhaps, have
heard of the affair. Stride, the keeper, was a passionate, hot-tempered man but
I regret to say, so was my brother, and quarrels between them seem to have been
frequent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not recall the affair,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;May I ask
what was the cause of death?&rdquo; Something in his voice made me prick up my
ears for the reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The keeper, it was said, from suffocation. And at the inquest the
doctors averred that both men had been dead the same length of time when
found.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your brother?&rdquo; asked John Silence, noticing the omission, and
listening intently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Equally mysterious,&rdquo; said our host, speaking in a low voice with
effort. &ldquo;But there was one distressing feature I think I ought to
mention. For those who saw the face&mdash;I did not see it myself&mdash;and
though Stride carried a gun its chambers were undischarged&mdash;&rdquo; He
stammered and hesitated with confusion. Again that sense of terror moved
between his words. He stuck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the chief listener sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s face, they said, looked as though it had been
scorched. It had been swept, as it were, by something that
burned&mdash;blasted. It was, I am told, quite dreadful. The bodies were found
lying side by side, faces downwards, both pointing away from the wood, as
though they had been in the act of running, and not more than a dozen yards
from its edge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence made no comment. He appeared to be studying the map attentively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not see the face myself,&rdquo; repeated the other, his manner
somehow expressing the sense of awe he contrived to keep out of his voice,
&ldquo;but my sister unfortunately did, and her present state I believe to be
entirely due to the shock it gave to her nerves. She never can be brought to
refer to it, naturally, and I am even inclined to think that the memory has
mercifully been permitted to vanish from her mind. But she spoke of it at the
time as a face swept by flame&mdash;blasted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John Silence looked up from his contemplation of the map, but with the air of
one who wished to listen, not to speak, and presently Colonel Wragge went on
with his account. He stood on the mat, his broad shoulders hiding most of the
mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They all centred about this particular plantation, these stories. That
was to be expected, for the people here are as superstitious as Irish
peasantry, and though I made one or two examples among them to stop the foolish
talk, it had no effect, and new versions came to my ears every week. You may
imagine how little good dismissals did, when I tell you that the servants
dismissed themselves. It was not the house servants, but the men who worked on
the estate outside. The keepers gave notice one after another, none of them
with any reason I could accept; the foresters refused to enter the wood, and
the beaters to beat in it. Word flew all over the countryside that Twelve Acre
Plantation was a place to be avoided, day or night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There came a point,&rdquo; the Colonel went on, now well in his swing,
&ldquo;when I felt compelled to make investigations on my own account. I could
not kill the thing by ignoring it; so I collected and analysed the stories at
first hand. For this Twelve Acre Wood, you will see by the map, comes rather
near home. Its lower end, if you will look, almost touches the end of the back
lawn, as I will show you tomorrow, and its dense growth of pines forms the
chief protection the house enjoys from the east winds that blow up from the
sea. And in olden days, before my brother interfered with it and frightened all
the game away, it was one of the best pheasant coverts on the whole
estate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what form, if I may ask, did this interference take?&rdquo; asked
Dr. Silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In detail, I cannot tell you, for I do not know&mdash;except that I
understand it was the subject of his frequent differences with the head keeper;
but during the last two years of his life, when he gave up travelling and
settled down here, he took a special interest in this wood, and for some
unaccountable reason began to build a low stone wall around it. This wall was
never finished, but you shall see the ruins tomorrow in the daylight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the result of your investigations&mdash;these stories, I
mean?&rdquo; the doctor broke in, anxious to keep him to the main issues.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m coming to that,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;but the
wood first, for this wood out of which they grew like mushrooms has nothing in
any way peculiar about it. It is very thickly grown, and rises to a clearer
part in the centre, a sort of mound where there is a circle of large
boulders&mdash;old Druid stones, I&rsquo;m told. At another place there&rsquo;s
a small pond. There&rsquo;s nothing distinctive about it that I could
mention&mdash;just an ordinary pine-wood, a very ordinary pine-wood&mdash;only
the trees are a bit twisted in the trunks, some of &rsquo;em, and very dense.
Nothing more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the stories? Well, none of them had anything to do with my poor
brother, or the keeper, as you might have expected; and they were all
odd&mdash;such odd things, I mean, to invent or imagine. I never could make out
how these people got such notions into their heads.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment to relight his cigar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no regular path through it,&rdquo; he resumed, puffing
vigorously, &ldquo;but the fields round it are constantly used, and one of the
gardeners whose cottage lies over that way declared he often saw moving lights
in it at night, and luminous shapes like globes of fire over the tops of the
trees, skimming and floating, and making a soft hissing sound&mdash;most of
&rsquo;em said that, in fact&mdash;and another man saw shapes flitting in and
out among the trees, things that were neither men nor animals, and all faintly
luminous. No one ever pretended to see human forms&mdash;always queer, huge
things they could not properly describe. Sometimes the whole wood was lit up,
and one fellow&mdash;he&rsquo;s still here and you shall see him&mdash;has a
most circumstantial yarn about having seen great stars lying on the ground
round the edge of the wood at regular intervals&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What kind of stars?&rdquo; put in John Silence sharply, in a sudden way
that made me start.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know quite; ordinary stars, I think he said, only very
large, and apparently blazing as though the ground was alight. He was too
terrified to go close and examine, and he has never seen them since.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stooped and stirred the fire into a welcome blaze&mdash;welcome for its
blaze of light rather than for its heat. In the room there was already a
strange pervading sensation of warmth that was oppressive in its effect and far
from comforting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, straightening up again on the mat,
&ldquo;this was all commonplace enough&mdash;this seeing lights and figures at
night. Most of these fellows drink, and imagination and terror between them may
account for almost anything. But others saw things in broad daylight. One of
the woodmen, a sober, respectable man, took the shortcut home to his midday
meal, and swore he was followed the whole length of the wood by something that
never showed itself, but dodged from tree to tree, always keeping out of sight,
yet solid enough to make the branches sway and the twigs snap on the ground.
And it made a noise, he declared&mdash;but really&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker
stopped and gave a short laugh&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s too absurd&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Please!</i>&rdquo; insisted the doctor; &ldquo;for it is these small
details that give me the best clues always.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;it made a crackling noise, he said, like a bonfire. Those were
his very words: like the crackling of a bonfire,&rdquo; finished the soldier,
with a repetition of his short laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Most interesting,&rdquo; Dr. Silence observed gravely. &ldquo;Please
omit nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and it was soon after that the fires
began&mdash;the fires in the wood. They started mysteriously burning in the
patches of coarse white grass that cover the more open parts of the plantation.
No one ever actually saw them start, but many, myself among the number, have
seen them burning and smouldering. They are always small and circular in shape,
and for all the world like a picnic fire. The head keeper has a dozen
explanations, from sparks flying out of the house chimneys to the sunlight
focusing through a dewdrop, but none of them, I must admit, convince me as
being in the least likely or probable. They are most singular, I consider, most
singular, these mysterious fires, and I am glad to say that they come only at
rather long intervals and never seem to spread.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the keeper had other queer stories as well, and about things that
are verifiable. He declared that no life ever willingly entered the plantation;
more, that no life existed in it at all. No birds nested in the trees, or flew
into their shade. He set countless traps, but never caught so much as a rabbit
or a weasel. Animals avoided it, and more than once he had picked up dead
creatures round the edges that bore no obvious signs of how they had met their
death.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Moreover, he told me one extraordinary tale about his retriever chasing
some invisible creature across the field one day when he was out with his gun.
The dog suddenly pointed at something in the field at his feet, and then gave
chase, yelping like a mad thing. It followed its imaginary quarry to the
borders of the wood, and then went in&mdash;a thing he had never known it to do
before. The moment it crossed the edge&mdash;it is darkish in there even in
daylight&mdash;it began fighting in the most frenzied and terrific fashion. It
made him afraid to interfere, he said. And at last, when the dog came out,
hanging its tail down and panting, he found something like white hair stuck to
its jaws, and brought it to show me. I tell you these details
because&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are important, believe me,&rdquo; the doctor stopped him.
&ldquo;And you have it still, this hair?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It disappeared in the oddest way,&rdquo; the Colonel explained.
&ldquo;It was curious looking stuff, something like asbestos, and I sent it to
be analysed by the local chemist. But either the man got wind of its origin, or
else he didn&rsquo;t like the look of it for some reason, because he returned
it to me and said it was neither animal, vegetable, nor mineral, so far as he
could make out, and he didn&rsquo;t wish to have anything to do with it. I put
it away in paper, but a week later, on opening the package&mdash;it was gone!
Oh, the stories are simply endless. I could tell you hundreds all on the same
lines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And personal experiences of your own, Colonel Wragge?&rdquo; asked John
Silence earnestly, his manner showing the greatest possible interest and
sympathy.
</p>

<p>
The soldier gave an almost imperceptible start. He looked distinctly
uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, I think,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;nothing&mdash;er&mdash;I
should like to rely on. I mean nothing I have the right to speak of,
perhaps&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His mouth closed with a snap. Dr. Silence, after waiting a little to see if he
would add to his reply, did not seek to press him on the point.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed presently, and as though he would speak
contemptuously, yet dared not, &ldquo;this sort of thing has gone on at
intervals ever since. It spreads like wildfire, of course, mysterious chatter
of this kind, and people began trespassing all over the estate, coming to see
the wood, and making themselves a general nuisance. Notices of man-traps and
spring-guns only seemed to increase their persistence; and&mdash;think of
it,&rdquo; he snorted, &ldquo;some local Research Society actually wrote and
asked permission for one of their members to spend a night in the wood! Bolder
fools, who didn&rsquo;t write for leave, came and took away bits of bark from
the trees and gave them to clairvoyants, who invented in their turn a further
batch of tales. There was simply no end to it all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Most distressing and annoying, I can well believe,&rdquo; interposed the
doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then suddenly, the phenomena ceased as mysteriously as they had begun,
and the interest flagged. The tales stopped. People got interested in something
else. It all seemed to die out. This was last July. I can tell you exactly, for
I&rsquo;ve kept a diary more or less of what happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But now, quite recently, within the past three weeks, it has all revived
again with a rush&mdash;with a kind of furious attack, so to speak. It has
really become unbearable. You may imagine what it means, and the general state
of affairs, when I say that the possibility of leaving has occurred to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Incendiarism?&rdquo; suggested Dr. Silence, half under his breath, but
not so low that Colonel Wragge did not hear him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, sir, you take the very words out of my mouth!&rdquo; exclaimed
the astonished man, glancing from the doctor to me and from me to the doctor,
and rattling the money in his pocket as though some explanation of my
friend&rsquo;s divining powers were to be found that way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that you are thinking very vividly,&rdquo; the doctor
said quietly, &ldquo;and your thoughts form pictures in my mind before you
utter them. It&rsquo;s merely a little elementary thought-reading.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His intention, I saw, was not to perplex the good man, but to impress him with
his powers so as to ensure obedience later.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good Lord! I had no idea&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish the sentence,
and dived again abruptly into his narrative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not see anything myself, I must admit, but the stories of
independent eye-witnesses were to the effect that lines of light, like streams
of thin fire, moved through the wood and sometimes were seen to shoot out
precisely as flames might shoot out&mdash;in the direction of this house.
There,&rdquo; he explained, in a louder voice that made me jump, pointing with
a thick finger to the map, &ldquo;where the westerly fringe of the plantation
comes up to the end of the lower lawn at the back of the house&mdash;where it
links on to those dark patches, which are laurel shrubberies, running right up
to the back premises&mdash;that&rsquo;s where these lights were seen. They
passed from the wood to the shrubberies, and in this way reached the house
itself. Like silent rockets, one man described them, rapid as lightning and
exceedingly bright.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this evidence you spoke of?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They actually reached the sides of the house. They&rsquo;ve left a mark
of scorching on the walls&mdash;the walls of the laundry building at the other
end. You shall see &rsquo;em tomorrow.&rdquo; He pointed to the map to indicate
the spot, and then straightened himself and glared about the room as though he
had said something no one could believe and expected contradiction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Scorched&mdash;just as the faces were,&rdquo; the doctor murmured,
looking significantly at me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Scorched&mdash;yes,&rdquo; repeated the Colonel, failing to catch the
rest of the sentence in his excitement.
</p>

<p>
There was a prolonged silence in the room, in which I heard the gurgling of the
oil in the lamp and the click of the coals and the heavy breathing of our host.
The most unwelcome sensations were creeping about my spine, and I wondered
whether my companion would scorn me utterly if I asked to sleep on the sofa in
his room. It was eleven o&rsquo;clock, I saw by the clock on the mantelpiece.
We had crossed the dividing line and were now well in the movement of the
adventure. The fight between my interest and my dread became acute. But, even
if turning back had been possible, I think the interest would have easily
gained the day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have enemies, of course,&rdquo; I heard the Colonel&rsquo;s rough
voice break into the pause presently, &ldquo;and have discharged a number of
servants&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; put in John Silence briefly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think not? In a sense I am glad, and yet&mdash;there are some things
that can be met and dealt with&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He left the sentence unfinished, and looked down at the floor with an
expression of grim severity that betrayed a momentary glimpse of character.
This fighting man loathed and abhorred the thought of an enemy he could not see
and come to grips with. Presently he moved over and sat down in the chair
between us. Something like a sigh escaped him. Dr. Silence said nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My sister, of course, is kept in ignorance, as far as possible, of all
this,&rdquo; he said disconnectedly, and as if talking to himself. &ldquo;But
even if she knew she would find matter-of-fact explanations. I only wish I
could. I&rsquo;m sure they exist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There came then an interval in the conversation that was very significant. It
did not seem a real pause, or the silence real silence, for both men continued
to think so rapidly and strongly that one almost imagined their thoughts
clothed themselves in words in the air of the room. I was more than a little
keyed up with the strange excitement of all I had heard, but what stimulated my
nerves more than anything else was the obvious fact that the doctor was clearly
upon the trail of discovery. In his mind at that moment, I believe, he had
already solved the nature of this perplexing psychical problem. His face was
like a mask, and he employed the absolute minimum of gesture and words. All his
energies were directed inwards, and by those incalculable methods and processes
he had mastered with such infinite patience and study, I felt sure he was
already in touch with the forces behind these singular phenomena and laying his
deep plans for bringing them into the open, and then effectively dealing with
them.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge meanwhile grew more and more fidgety. From time to time he
turned towards my companion, as though about to speak, yet always changing his
mind at the last moment. Once he went over and opened the door suddenly,
apparently to see if any one were listening at the keyhole, for he disappeared
a moment between the two doors, and I then heard him open the outer one. He
stood there for some seconds and made a noise as though he were sniffing the
air like a dog. Then he closed both doors cautiously and came back to the
fireplace. A strange excitement seemed growing upon him. Evidently he was
trying to make up his mind to say something that he found it difficult to say.
And John Silence, as I rightly judged, was waiting patiently for him to choose
his own opportunity and his own way of saying it. At last he turned and faced
us, squaring his great shoulders, and stiffening perceptibly.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence looked up sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your own experiences help me most,&rdquo; he observed quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; the Colonel said, speaking very low, &ldquo;this
past week there have been outbreaks of fire in the house itself. Three separate
outbreaks&mdash;and all&mdash;in my sister&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the doctor said, as if this was just what he had expected to
hear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Utterly unaccountable&mdash;all of them,&rdquo; added the other, and
then sat down. I began to understand something of the reason of his excitement.
He was realising at last that the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; explanation he had held
to all along was becoming impossible, and he hated it. It made him angry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;she was out each time and does
not know. But I have made her sleep now in a room on the ground floor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A wise precaution,&rdquo; the doctor said simply. He asked one or two
questions. The fires had started in the curtains&mdash;once by the window and
once by the bed. The third time smoke had been discovered by the maid coming
from the cupboard, and it was found that Miss Wragge&rsquo;s clothes hanging on
the hooks were smouldering. The doctor listened attentively, but made no
comment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now can you tell me,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;what your own
feeling about it is&mdash;your general impression?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It sounds foolish to say so,&rdquo; replied the soldier, after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;but I feel exactly as I have often felt on
active service in my Indian campaigns: just as if the house and all in it were
in a state of siege; as though a concealed enemy were encamped about
us&mdash;in ambush somewhere.&rdquo; He uttered a soft nervous laugh. &ldquo;As
if the next sign of smoke would precipitate a panic&mdash;a dreadful
panic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The picture came before me of the night shadowing the house, and the twisted
pine trees he had described crowding about it, concealing some powerful enemy;
and, glancing at the resolute face and figure of the old soldier, forced at
length to his confession, I understood something of all he had been through
before he sought the assistance of John Silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And tomorrow, unless I am mistaken, is full moon,&rdquo; said the doctor
suddenly, watching the other&rsquo;s face for the effect of his apparently
careless words.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge gave an uncontrollable start, and his face for the first time
showed unmistakable pallor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What in the world&mdash;?&rdquo; he began, his lip quivering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only that I am beginning to see light in this extraordinary
affair,&rdquo; returned the other calmly, &ldquo;and, if my theory is correct,
each month when the moon is at the full should witness an increase in the
activity of the phenomena.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the connection,&rdquo; Colonel Wragge answered almost
savagely, &ldquo;but I am bound to say my diary bears you out.&rdquo; He wore
the most puzzled expression I have ever seen upon an honest face, but he
abhorred this additional corroboration of an explanation that perplexed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I cannot see the
connection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo; said the doctor, with his first laugh that
evening. He got up and hung the map upon the wall again. &ldquo;But I
do&mdash;because these things are my special study&mdash;and let me add that I
have yet to come across a problem that is not natural, and has not a natural
explanation. It&rsquo;s merely a question of how much one knows&mdash;and
admits.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge eyed him with a new and curious respect in his face. But his
feelings were soothed. Moreover, the doctor&rsquo;s laugh and change of manner
came as a relief to all, and broke the spell of grave suspense that had held us
so long. We all rose and stretched our limbs, and took little walks about the
room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad, Dr. Silence, if you will allow me to say so, that you are
here,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;very glad indeed. And now I fear I have
kept you both up very late,&rdquo; with a glance to include me, &ldquo;for you
must be tired, and ready for your beds. I have told you all there is to
tell,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and tomorrow you must feel perfectly free to take
any steps you think necessary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The end was abrupt, yet natural, for there was nothing more to say, and neither
of these men talked for mere talking&rsquo;s sake.
</p>

<p>
Out in the cold and chilly hall he lit our candles and took us upstairs. The
house was at rest and still, every one asleep. We moved softly. Through the
windows on the stairs we saw the moonlight falling across the lawn, throwing
deep shadows. The nearer pine trees were just visible in the distance, a wall
of impenetrable blackness.
</p>

<p>
Our host came for a moment to our rooms to see that we had everything. He
pointed to a coil of strong rope lying beside the window, fastened to the wall
by means of an iron ring. Evidently it had been recently put in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we shall need it,&rdquo; Dr. Silence said, with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I trust not,&rdquo; replied our host gravely. &ldquo;I sleep quite close
to you across the landing,&rdquo; he whispered, pointing to his door,
&ldquo;and if you&mdash;if you want anything in the night you will know where
to find me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wished us pleasant dreams and disappeared down the passage into his room,
shading the candle with his big muscular hand from the draughts.
</p>

<p>
John Silence stopped me a moment before I went.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know what it is?&rdquo; I asked, with an excitement that even
overcame my weariness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sure. And you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not the smallest notion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked disappointed, but not half as disappointed as I felt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Egypt,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;Egypt!&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Nothing happened to disturb me in the night&mdash;nothing, that is, except a
nightmare in which Colonel Wragge chased me amid thin streaks of fire, and his
sister always prevented my escape by suddenly rising up out of the ground in
her chair&mdash;dead. The deep baying of dogs woke me once, just before the
dawn, it must have been, for I saw the window frame against the sky; there was
a flash of lightning, too, I thought, as I turned over in bed. And it was warm,
for October oppressively warm.
</p>

<p>
It was after eleven o&rsquo;clock when our host suggested going out with the
guns, these, we understood, being a somewhat thin disguise for our true
purpose. Personally, I was glad to be in the open air, for the atmosphere of
the house was heavy with presentiment. The sense of impending disaster hung
over all. Fear stalked the passages, and lurked in the corners of every room.
It was a house haunted, but really haunted; not by some vague shadow of the
dead, but by a definite though incalculable influence that was actively alive,
and dangerous. At the least smell of smoke the entire household quivered. An
odour of burning, I was convinced, would paralyse all the inmates. For the
servants, though professedly ignorant by the master&rsquo;s unspoken orders,
yet shared the common dread; and the hideous uncertainty, joined with this
display of so spiteful and calculated a spirit of malignity, provided a kind of
black doom that draped not only the walls, but also the minds of the people
living within them.
</p>

<p>
Only the bright and cheerful vision of old Miss Wragge being pushed about the
house in her noiseless chair, chatting and nodding briskly to every one she
met, prevented us from giving way entirely to the depression which governed the
majority. The sight of her was like a gleam of sunshine through the depths of
some ill-omened wood, and just as we went out I saw her being wheeled along by
her attendant into the sunshine of the back lawn, and caught her cheery smile
as she turned her head and wished us good sport.
</p>

<p>
The morning was October at its best. Sunshine glistened on the dew-drenched
grass and on leaves turned golden-red. The dainty messengers of coming
hoar-frost were already in the air, a search for permanent winter quarters.
From the wide moors that everywhere swept up against the sky, like a purple sea
splashed by the occasional grey of rocky clefts, there stole down the cool and
perfumed wind of the west. And the keen taste of the sea ran through all like a
master-flavour, borne over the spaces perhaps by the seagulls that cried and
circled high in the air.
</p>

<p>
But our host took little interest in this sparkling beauty, and had no thought
of showing off the scenery of his property. His mind was otherwise intent, and,
for that matter, so were our own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those bleak moors and hills stretch unbroken for hours,&rdquo; he said,
with a sweep of the hand; &ldquo;and over there, some four miles,&rdquo;
pointing in another direction, &ldquo;lies S&mdash;&mdash; Bay, a long, swampy
inlet of the sea, haunted by myriads of seabirds. On the other side of the
house are the plantations and pine-woods. I thought we would get the dogs and
go first to the Twelve Acre Wood I told you about last night. It&rsquo;s quite
near.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We found the dogs in the stable, and I recalled the deep baying of the night
when a fine bloodhound and two great Danes leaped out to greet us. Singular
companions for guns, I thought to myself, as we struck out across the fields
and the great creatures bounded and ran beside us, nose to ground.
</p>

<p>
The conversation was scanty. John Silence&rsquo;s grave face did not encourage
talk. He wore the expression I knew well&mdash;that look of earnest solicitude
which meant that his whole being was deeply absorbed and preoccupied.
Frightened, I had never seen him, but anxious often&mdash;it always moved me to
witness it&mdash;and he was anxious now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the way back you shall see the laundry building,&rdquo; Colonel
Wragge observed shortly, for he, too, found little to say. &ldquo;We shall
attract less attention then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yet not all the crisp beauty of the morning seemed able to dispel the feelings
of uneasy dread that gathered increasingly about our minds as we went.
</p>

<p>
In a very few minutes a clump of pine trees concealed the house from view, and
we found ourselves on the outskirts of a densely grown plantation of conifers.
Colonel Wragge stopped abruptly, and, producing a map from his pocket,
explained once more very briefly its position with regard to the house. He
showed how it ran up almost to the walls of the laundry building&mdash;though
at the moment beyond our actual view&mdash;and pointed to the windows of his
sister&rsquo;s bedroom where the fires had been. The room, now empty, looked
straight on to the wood. Then, glancing nervously about him, and calling the
dogs to heel, he proposed that we should enter the plantation and make as
thorough examination of it as we thought worth while. The dogs, he added, might
perhaps be persuaded to accompany us a little way&mdash;and he pointed to where
they cowered at his feet&mdash;but he doubted it. &ldquo;Neither voice nor whip
will get them very far, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know by
experience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you have no objection,&rdquo; replied Dr. Silence, with decision, and
speaking almost for the first time, &ldquo;we will make our examination
alone&mdash;Mr. Hubbard and myself. It will be best so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His tone was absolutely final, and the Colonel acquiesced so politely that even
a less intuitive man than myself must have seen that he was genuinely relieved.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You doubtless have good reasons,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Merely that I wish to obtain my impressions uncoloured. This delicate
clue I am working on might be so easily blurred by the thought-currents of
another mind with strongly preconceived ideas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly. I understand,&rdquo; rejoined the soldier, though with an
expression of countenance that plainly contradicted his words. &ldquo;Then I
will wait here with the dogs; and we&rsquo;ll have a look at the laundry on our
way home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I turned once to look back as we clambered over the low stone wall built by the
late owner, and saw his straight, soldierly figure standing in the sunlit field
watching us with a curiously intent look on his face. There was something to me
incongruous, yet distinctly pathetic, in the man&rsquo;s efforts to meet all
far-fetched explanations of the mystery with contempt, and at the same time in
his stolid, unswerving investigation of it all. He nodded at me and made a
gesture of farewell with his hand. That picture of him, standing in the
sunshine with his big dogs, steadily watching us, remains with me to this day.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence led the way in among the twisted trunks, planted closely together
in serried ranks, and I followed sharp at his heels. The moment we were out of
sight he turned and put down his gun against the roots of a big tree, and I did
likewise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall hardly want these cumbersome weapons of murder,&rdquo; he
observed, with a passing smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are sure of your clue, then?&rdquo; I asked at once, bursting with
curiosity, yet fearing to betray it lest he should think me unworthy. His own
methods were so absolutely simple and untheatrical.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure of my clue,&rdquo; he answered gravely. &ldquo;And I think we
have come just in time. You shall know in due course. For the present&mdash;be
content to follow and observe. And think, steadily. The support of your mind
will help me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His voice had that quiet mastery in it which leads men to face death with a
sort of happiness and pride. I would have followed him anywhere at that moment.
At the same time his words conveyed a sense of dread seriousness. I caught the
thrill of his confidence; but also, in this broad light of day, I felt the
measure of alarm that lay behind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You still have no strong impressions?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Nothing
happened in the night, for instance? No vivid dreamings?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked closely for my answer, I was aware.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I slept almost an unbroken sleep. I was tremendously tired, you know,
and, but for the oppressive heat&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good! You still notice the heat, then,&rdquo; he said to himself, rather
than expecting an answer. &ldquo;And the lightning?&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;that lightning out of a clear sky&mdash;that flashing&mdash;did you
notice <i>that</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I answered truly that I thought I had seen a flash during a moment of
wakefulness, and he then drew my attention to certain facts before moving on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You remember the sensation of warmth when you put the letter to your
forehead in the train; the heat generally in the house last evening, and, as
you now mention, in the night. You heard, too, the Colonel&rsquo;s stories
about the appearances of fire in this wood and in the house itself, and the way
his brother and the gamekeeper came to their deaths twenty years ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I nodded, wondering what in the world it all meant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you get no clue from these facts?&rdquo; he asked, a trifle
surprised.
</p>

<p>
I searched every corner of my mind and imagination for some inkling of his
meaning, but was obliged to admit that I understood nothing so far.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, you will later. And now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we will go
over the wood and see what we can find.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His words explained to me something of his method. We were to keep our minds
alert and report to each other the least fancy that crossed the picture-gallery
of our thoughts. Then, just as we started, he turned again to me with a final
warning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, for your safety,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;imagine
<i>now</i>&mdash;and for that matter, imagine always until we leave this
place&mdash;imagine with the utmost keenness, that you are surrounded by a
shell that protects you. Picture yourself inside a protective envelope, and
build it up with the most intense imagination you can evoke. Pour the whole
force of your thought and will into it. Believe vividly all through this
adventure that such a shell, constructed of your thought, will and imagination,
surrounds you completely, and that nothing can pierce it to attack.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke with dramatic conviction, gazing hard at me as though to enforce his
meaning, and then moved forward and began to pick his way over the rough,
tussocky ground into the wood. And meanwhile, knowing the efficacy of his
prescription, I adopted it to the best of my ability.
</p>

<p>
The trees at once closed about us like the night. Their branches met overhead
in a continuous tangle, their stems crept closer and closer, the brambly
undergrowth thickened and multiplied. We tore our trousers, scratched our
hands, and our eyes filled with fine dust that made it most difficult to avoid
the clinging, prickly network of branches and creepers. Coarse white grass that
caught our feet like string grew here and there in patches. It crowned the
lumps of peaty growth that stuck up like human heads, fantastically dressed,
thrusting up at us out of the ground with crests of dead hair. We stumbled and
floundered among them. It was hard going, and I could well conceive it
impossible to find a way at all in the night-time. We jumped, when possible,
from tussock to tussock, and it seemed as though we were springing among heads
on a battlefield, and that this dead white grass concealed eyes that turned to
stare as we passed.
</p>

<p>
Here and there the sunlight shot in with vivid spots of white light, dazzling
the sight, but only making the surrounding gloom deeper by contrast. And on two
occasions we passed dark circular places in the grass where fires had eaten
their mark and left a ring of ashes. Dr. Silence pointed to them, but without
comment and without pausing, and the sight of them woke in me a singular
realisation of the dread that lay so far only just out of sight in this
adventure.
</p>

<p>
It was exhausting work, and heavy going. We kept close together. The warmth,
too, was extraordinary. Yet it did not seem the warmth of the body due to
violent exertion, but rather an inner heat of the mind that laid glowing hands
of fire upon the heart and set the brain in a kind of steady blaze. When my
companion found himself too far in advance, he waited for me to come up. The
place had evidently been untouched by hand of man, keeper, forester or
sportsman, for many a year; and my thoughts, as we advanced painfully, were not
unlike the state of the wood itself&mdash;dark, confused, full of a haunting
wonder and the shadow of fear.
</p>

<p>
By this time all signs of the open field behind us were hid. No single gleam
penetrated. We might have been groping in the heart of some primeval forest.
Then, suddenly, the brambles and tussocks and stringlike grass came to an end;
the trees opened out; and the ground began to slope upwards towards a large
central mound. We had reached the middle of the plantation, and before us stood
the broken Druid stones our host had mentioned. We walked easily up the little
hill, between the sparser stems, and, resting upon one of the ivy-covered
boulders, looked round upon a comparatively open space, as large, perhaps, as a
small London Square.
</p>

<p>
Thinking of the ceremonies and sacrifices this rough circle of prehistoric
monoliths might have witnessed, I looked up into my companion&rsquo;s face with
an unspoken question. But he read my thought and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our mystery has nothing to do with these dead symbols,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but with something perhaps even more ancient, and of another country
altogether.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Egypt?&rdquo; I said half under my breath, hopelessly puzzled, but
recalling his words in my bedroom.
</p>

<p>
He nodded. Mentally I still floundered, but he seemed intensely preoccupied and
it was no time for asking questions; so while his words circled unintelligibly
in my mind I looked round at the scene before me, glad of the opportunity to
recover breath and some measure of composure. But hardly had I time to notice
the twisted and contorted shapes of many of the pine trees close at hand when
Dr. Silence leaned over and touched me on the shoulder. He pointed down the
slope. And the look I saw in his eyes keyed up every nerve in my body to its
utmost pitch.
</p>

<p>
A thin, almost imperceptible column of blue smoke was rising among the trees
some twenty yards away at the foot of the mound. It curled up and up, and
disappeared from sight among the tangled branches overhead. It was scarcely
thicker than the smoke from a small brand of burning wood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Protect yourself! Imagine your shell strongly,&rdquo; whispered the
doctor sharply, &ldquo;and follow me closely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He rose at once and moved swiftly down the slope towards the smoke, and I
followed, afraid to remain alone. I heard the soft crunching of our steps on
the pine needles. Over his shoulder I watched the thin blue spiral, without
once taking my eyes off it. I hardly know how to describe the peculiar sense of
vague horror inspired in me by the sight of that streak of smoke pencilling its
way upwards among the dark trees. And the sensation of increasing heat as we
approached was phenomenal. It was like walking towards a glowing yet invisible
fire.
</p>

<p>
As we drew nearer his pace slackened. Then he stopped and pointed, and I saw a
small circle of burnt grass upon the ground. The tussocks were blackened and
smouldering, and from the centre rose this line of smoke, pale, blue, steady.
Then I noticed a movement of the atmosphere beside us, as if the warm air were
rising and the cooler air rushing in to take its place: a little centre of wind
in the stillness. Overhead the boughs stirred and trembled where the smoke
disappeared. Otherwise, not a tree sighed, not a sound made itself heard. The
wood was still as a graveyard. A horrible idea came to me that the course of
nature was about to change without warning, had changed a little already, that
the sky would drop, or the surface of the earth crash inwards like a broken
bubble. Something, certainly, reached up to the citadel of my reason, causing
its throne to shake.
</p>

<p>
John Silence moved forward again. I could not see his face, but his attitude
was plainly one of resolution, of muscles and mind ready for vigorous action.
We were within ten feet of the blackened circle when the smoke of a sudden
ceased to rise, and vanished. The tail of the column disappeared in the air
above, and at the same instant it seemed to me that the sensation of heat
passed from my face, and the motion of the wind was gone. The calm spirit of
the fresh October day resumed command.
</p>

<p>
Side by side we advanced and examined the place. The grass was smouldering, the
ground still hot. The circle of burned earth was a foot to a foot and a half in
diameter. It looked like an ordinary picnic fireplace. I bent down cautiously
to look, but in a second I sprang back with an involuntary cry of alarm, for,
as the doctor stamped on the ashes to prevent them spreading, a sound of
hissing rose from the spot as though he had kicked a living creature. This
hissing was faintly audible in the air. It moved past us, away towards the
thicker portion of the wood in the direction of our field, and in a second Dr.
Silence had left the fire and started in pursuit.
</p>

<p>
And then began the most extraordinary hunt of invisibility I can ever conceive.
</p>

<p>
He went fast even at the beginning, and, of course, it was perfectly obvious
that he was following something. To judge by the poise of his head he kept his
eyes steadily at a certain level&mdash;just above the height of a man&mdash;and
the consequence was he stumbled a good deal over the roughness of the ground.
The hissing sound had stopped. There was no sound of any kind, and what he saw
to follow was utterly beyond me. I only know, that in mortal dread of being
left behind, and with a biting curiosity to see whatever there was to be seen,
I followed as quickly as I could, and even then barely succeeded in keeping up
with him.
</p>

<p>
And, as we went, the whole mad jumble of the Colonel&rsquo;s stories ran
through my brain, touching a sense of frightened laughter that was only held in
check by the sight of this earnest, hurrying figure before me. For John Silence
at work inspired me with a kind of awe. He looked so diminutive among these
giant twisted trees, while yet I knew that his purpose and his knowledge were
so great, and even in hurry he was dignified. The fancy that we were playing
some queer, exaggerated game together met the fact that we were two men dancing
upon the brink of some possible tragedy, and the mingling of the two emotions
in my mind was both grotesque and terrifying.
</p>

<p>
He never turned in his mad chase, but pushed rapidly on, while I panted after
him like a figure in some unreasoning nightmare. And, as I ran, it came upon me
that he had been aware all the time, in his quiet, internal way, of many things
that he had kept for his own secret consideration; he had been watching,
waiting, planning from the very moment we entered the shade of the wood. By
some inner, concentrated process of mind, dynamic if not actually magical, he
had been in direct contact with the source of the whole adventure, the very
essence of the real mystery. And now the forces were moving to a climax.
Something was about to happen, something important, something possibly
dreadful. Every nerve, every sense, every significant gesture of the plunging
figure before me proclaimed the fact just as surely as the skies, the winds,
and the face of the earth tell the birds the time to migrate and warn the
animals that danger lurks and they must move.
</p>

<p>
In a few moments we reached the foot of the mound and entered the tangled
undergrowth that lay between us and the sunlight of the field. Here the
difficulties of fast travelling increased a hundredfold. There were brambles to
dodge, low boughs to dive under, and countless tree trunks closing up to make a
direct path impossible. Yet Dr. Silence never seemed to falter or hesitate. He
went, diving, jumping, dodging, ducking, but ever in the same main direction,
following a clean trail. Twice I tripped and fell, and both times, when I
picked myself up again, I saw him ahead of me, still forcing a way like a dog
after its quarry. And sometimes, like a dog, he stopped and pointed&mdash;human
pointing it was, psychic pointing, and each time he stopped to point I heard
that faint high hissing in the air beyond us. The instinct of an infallible
dowser possessed him, and he made no mistakes.
</p>

<p>
At length, abruptly, I caught up with him, and found that we stood at the edge
of the shallow pond Colonel Wragge had mentioned in his account the night
before. It was long and narrow, filled with dark brown water, in which the
trees were dimly reflected. Not a ripple stirred its surface.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; he cried out, as I came up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to
cross. It&rsquo;s bound to betray itself. The water is its natural enemy, and
we shall see the direction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And, even as he spoke, a thin line like the track of a water-spider, shot
swiftly across the shiny surface; there was a ghost of steam in the air above;
and immediately I became aware of an odour of burning.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence turned and shot a glance at me that made me think of lightning. I
began to shake all over.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he cried with excitement, &ldquo;to the trail again! We
must run around. It&rsquo;s going to the house!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The alarm in his voice quite terrified me. Without a false step I dashed round
the slippery banks and dived again at his heels into the sea of bushes and tree
trunks. We were now in the thick of the very dense belt that ran around the
outer edge of the plantation, and the field was near; yet so dark was the
tangle that it was some time before the first shafts of white sunlight became
visible. The doctor now ran in zigzags. He was following something that dodged
and doubled quite wonderfully, yet had begun, I fancied, to move more slowly
than before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;In the light we shall lose it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I still saw nothing, heard nothing, caught no suggestion of a trail; yet this
man, guided by some interior divining that seemed infallible, made no false
turns, though how he failed to crash headlong into the trees has remained a
mystery to me ever since. And then, with a sudden rush, we found ourselves on
the skirts of the wood with the open field lying in bright sunshine before our
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; I heard him cry, a note of anguish in his voice.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out&mdash;and, by God, it&rsquo;s making for the
house!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I saw the Colonel standing in the field with his dogs where we had left him. He
was bending double, peering into the wood where he heard us running, and he
straightened up like a bent whip released. John Silence dashed passed, calling
him to follow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall lose the trail in the light,&rdquo; I heard him cry as he ran.
&ldquo;But quick! We may yet get there in time!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That wild rush across the open field, with the dogs at our heels, leaping and
barking, and the elderly Colonel behind us running as though for his life,
shall I ever forget it? Though I had only vague ideas of the meaning of it all,
I put my best foot forward, and, being the youngest of the three, I reached the
house an easy first. I drew up, panting, and turned to wait for the others.
But, as I turned, something moving a little distance away caught my eye, and in
that moment I swear I experienced the most overwhelming and singular shock of
surprise and terror I have ever known, or can conceive as possible.
</p>

<p>
For the front door was open, and the waist of the house being narrow, I could
see through the hall into the dining-room beyond, and so out on to the back
lawn, and there I saw no less a sight than the figure of Miss
Wragge&mdash;running. Even at that distance it was plain that she had seen me,
and was coming fast towards me, running with the frantic gait of a
terror-stricken woman. She had recovered the use of her legs.
</p>

<p>
Her face was a livid grey, as of death itself, but the general expression was
one of laughter, for her mouth was gaping, and her eyes, always bright, shone
with the light of a wild merriment that seemed the merriment of a child, yet
was singularly ghastly. And that very second, as she fled past me into her
brother&rsquo;s arms behind, I smelt again most unmistakably the odour of
burning, and to this day the smell of smoke and fire can come very near to
turning me sick with the memory of what I had seen.
</p>

<p>
Fast on her heels, too, came the terrified attendant, more mistress of herself,
and able to speak&mdash;which the old lady could not do&mdash;but with a face
almost, if not quite, as fearful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We were down by the bushes in the sun,&rdquo;&mdash;she gasped and
screamed in reply to Colonel Wragge&rsquo;s distracted
questionings,&mdash;&ldquo;I was wheeling the chair as usual when she shrieked
and leaped&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know exactly&mdash;I was too frightened to
see&mdash;Oh, my God! she jumped clean out of the chair&mdash;<i>and ran</i>!
There was a blast of hot air from the wood, and she hid her face and jumped.
She didn&rsquo;t make a sound&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t cry out, or make a sound.
She just ran.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the nightmare horror of it all reached the breaking point a few minutes
later, and while I was still standing in the hall temporarily bereft of speech
and movement; for while the doctor, the Colonel and the attendant were half-way
up the staircase, helping the fainting woman to the privacy of her room, and
all in a confused group of dark figures, there sounded a voice behind me, and I
turned to see the butler, his face dripping with perspiration, his eyes
starting out of his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The laundry&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;the laundry
building&rsquo;s a-caught!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I remember his odd expression &ldquo;a-caught,&rdquo; and wanting to laugh, but
finding my face rigid and inflexible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s about again, s&rsquo;help me Gawd!&rdquo; he cried, in
a voice thin with terror, running about in circles.
</p>

<p>
And then the group on the stairs scattered as at the sound of a shot, and the
Colonel and Dr. Silence came down three steps at a time, leaving the afflicted
Miss Wragge to the care of her single attendant.
</p>

<p>
We were out across the front lawn in a moment and round the corner of the
house, the Colonel leading, Silence and I at his heels, and the portly butler
puffing some distance in the rear, getting more and more mixed in his addresses
to God and the devil; and the moment we passed the stables and came into view
of the laundry building, we saw a wicked-looking volume of smoke pouring out of
the narrow windows, and the frightened women-servants and grooms running hither
and thither, calling aloud as they ran.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of the master restored order instantly, and this retired soldier,
poor thinker perhaps, but capable man of action, had the matter in hand from
the start. He issued orders like a martinet, and, almost before I could realise
it, there were streaming buckets on the scene and a line of men and women
formed between the building and the stable pump.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Inside,&rdquo; I heard John Silence cry, and the Colonel followed him
through the door, while I was just quick enough at their heels to hear him add,
&ldquo;the smoke&rsquo;s the worst part of it. There&rsquo;s no fire yet, I
think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And, true enough, there was no fire. The interior was thick with smoke, but it
speedily cleared and not a single bucket was used upon the floor or walls. The
air was stifling, the heat fearful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s precious little to burn in here; it&rsquo;s all
stone,&rdquo; the Colonel exclaimed, coughing. But the doctor was pointing to
the wooden covers of the great cauldron in which the clothes were washed, and
we saw that these were smouldering and charred. And when we sprinkled half a
bucket of water on them the surrounding bricks hissed and fizzed and sent up
clouds of steam. Through the open door and windows this passed out with the
rest of the smoke, and we three stood there on the brick floor staring at the
spot and wondering, each in our own fashion, how in the name of natural law the
place could have caught fire or smoked at all. And each was silent&mdash;myself
from sheer incapacity and befuddlement, the Colonel from the quiet pluck that
faces all things yet speaks little, and John Silence from the intense mental
grappling with this latest manifestation of a profound problem that called for
concentration of thought rather than for any words.
</p>

<p>
There was really nothing to say. The facts were indisputable.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge was the first to utter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; he said briefly, and moved off. In the yard I heard
him sending the frightened servants about their business in an excellently
matter-of-fact voice, scolding some one roundly for making such a big fire and
letting the flues get over-heated, and paying no heed to the stammering reply
that no fire had been lit there for several days. Then he dispatched a groom on
horseback for the local doctor.
</p>

<p>
Then Dr. Silence turned and looked at me. The absolute control he possessed,
not only over the outward expression of emotion by gesture, change of colour,
light in the eyes, and so forth, but also, as I well knew, over its very birth
in his heart, the masklike face of the dead he could assume at will, made it
extremely difficult to know at any given moment what was at work in his inner
consciousness. But now, when he turned and looked at me, there was no
sphinx-expression there, but rather the keen triumphant face of a man who had
solved a dangerous and complicated problem, and saw his way to a clean victory.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Now</i> do you guess?&rdquo; he asked quietly, as though it were the
simplest matter in the world, and ignorance were impossible.
</p>

<p>
I could only stare stupidly and remain silent. He glanced down at the charred
cauldron-lids, and traced a figure in the air with his finger. But I was too
excited, or too mortified, or still too dazed, perhaps, to see what it was he
outlined, or what it was he meant to convey. I could only go on staring and
shaking my puzzled head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fire-elemental,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;a fire-elemental of the most
powerful and malignant kind&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; thundered the voice of Colonel Wragge behind us, having
returned suddenly and overheard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fire-elemental,&rdquo; repeated Dr. Silence more calmly,
but with a note of triumph in his voice he could not keep out, &ldquo;and a
fire-elemental enraged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The light began to dawn in my mind at last. But the Colonel&mdash;who had never
heard the term before, and was besides feeling considerably worked up for a
plain man with all this mystery he knew not how to grapple with&mdash;the
Colonel stood, with the most dumfoundered look ever seen on a human
countenance, and continued to roar, and stammer, and stare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why,&rdquo; he began, savage with the desire to find something
visible he could fight&mdash;&ldquo;why, in the name of all the
blazes&mdash;?&rdquo; and then stopped as John Silence moved up and took his
arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, my dear Colonel Wragge,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;you touch
the heart of the whole thing. You ask &lsquo;Why.&rsquo; That is precisely our
problem.&rdquo; He held the soldier&rsquo;s eyes firmly with his own.
&ldquo;And that, too, I think, we shall soon know. Come and let us talk over a
plan of action&mdash;that room with the double doors, perhaps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The word &ldquo;action&rdquo; calmed him a little, and he led the way, without
further speech, back into the house, and down the long stone passage to the
room where we had heard his stories on the night of our arrival. I understood
from the doctor&rsquo;s glance that my presence would not make the interview
easier for our host, and I went upstairs to my own room&mdash;shaking.
</p>

<p>
But in the solitude of my room the vivid memories of the last hour revived so
mercilessly that I began to feel I should never in my whole life lose the
dreadful picture of Miss Wragge running&mdash;that dreadful human climax after
all the non-human mystery in the wood&mdash;and I was not sorry when a servant
knocked at my door and said that Colonel Wragge would be glad if I would join
them in the little smoking-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it is better you should be present,&rdquo; was all Colonel
Wragge said as I entered the room. I took the chair with my back to the window.
There was still an hour before lunch, though I imagine that the usual divisions
of the day hardly found a place in the thoughts of any one of us.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere of the room was what I might call electric. The Colonel was
positively bristling; he stood with his back to the fire, fingering an unlit
black cigar, his face flushed, his being obviously roused and ready for action.
He hated this mystery. It was poisonous to his nature, and he longed to meet
something face to face&mdash;something he could gauge and fight. Dr. Silence, I
noticed at once, was sitting before the map of the estate which was spread upon
a table. I knew by his expression the state of his mind. He was in the thick of
it all, knew it, delighted in it, and was working at high pressure. He
recognised my presence with a lifted eyelid, and the flash of the eye,
contrasted with his stillness and composure, told me volumes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was about to explain to our host briefly what seems to me afoot in all
this business,&rdquo; he said without looking up, &ldquo;when he asked that you
should join us so that we can all work together.&rdquo; And, while signifying
my assent, I caught myself wondering what quality it was in the calm speech of
this undemonstrative man that was so full of power, so charged with the
strange, virile personality behind it and that seemed to inspire us with his
own confidence as by a process of radiation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hubbard,&rdquo; he went on gravely, turning to the soldier,
&ldquo;knows something of my methods, and in more than
one&mdash;er&mdash;interesting situation has proved of assistance. What we want
now&rdquo;&mdash;and here he suddenly got up and took his place on the mat
beside the Colonel, and looked hard at him&mdash;&ldquo;is men who have
self-control, who are sure of themselves, whose minds at the critical moment
will emit positive forces, instead of the wavering and uncertain currents due
to negative feelings&mdash;due, for instance, to fear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at us each in turn. Colonel Wragge moved his feet farther apart, and
squared his shoulders; and I felt guilty but said nothing, conscious that my
latent store of courage was being deliberately hauled to the front. He was
winding me up like a clock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So that, in what is yet to come,&rdquo; continued our leader,
&ldquo;each of us will contribute his share of power, and ensure success for my
plan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything I can <i>see</i>,&rdquo; said the
Colonel bluntly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; I heard myself say, as it were automatically,
&ldquo;for anything,&rdquo; and then added, feeling the declaration was lamely
insufficient, &ldquo;and everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence left the mat and began walking to and fro about the room, both
hands plunged deep into the pockets of his shooting-jacket. Tremendous vitality
streamed from him. I never took my eyes off the small, moving figure; small
yes,&mdash;and yet somehow making me think of a giant plotting the destruction
of worlds. And his manner was gentle, as always, soothing almost, and his words
uttered quietly without emphasis or emotion. Most of what he said was
addressed, though not too obviously, to the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The violence of this sudden attack,&rdquo; he said softly, pacing to and
fro beneath the bookcase at the end of the room, &ldquo;is due, of course,
partly to the fact that tonight the moon is at the full&rdquo;&mdash;here he
glanced at me for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;and partly to the fact that we have all
been so deliberately concentrating upon the matter. Our thinking, our
investigation, has stirred it into unusual activity. I mean that the
intelligent force behind these manifestations has realised that some one is
busied about its destruction. And it is now on the defensive: more, it is
aggressive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But &lsquo;it&rsquo;&mdash;what is &lsquo;it&rsquo;?&rdquo; began the
soldier, fuming. &ldquo;What, in the name of all that&rsquo;s dreadful,
<i>is</i> a fire-elemental?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot give you at this moment,&rdquo; replied Dr. Silence, turning to
him, but undisturbed by the interruption, &ldquo;a lecture on the nature and
history of magic, but can only say that an Elemental is the active force behind
the elements,&mdash;whether earth, air, water, <i>or fire</i>,&mdash;it is
impersonal in its essential nature, but can be focused, personified, ensouled,
so to say, by those who know how&mdash;by magicians, if you will&mdash;for
certain purposes of their own, much in the same way that steam and electricity
can be harnessed by the practical man of this century.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alone, these blind elemental energies can accomplish little, but
governed and directed by the trained will of a powerful manipulator they may
become potent activities for good or evil. They are the basis of all magic, and
it is the motive behind them that constitutes the magic &lsquo;black&rsquo; or
&lsquo;white&rsquo;; they can be the vehicles of curses or of blessings, for a
curse is nothing more than the thought of a violent will perpetuated. And in
such cases&mdash;cases like this&mdash;the conscious, directing will of the
mind that is using the elemental stands always behind the
phenomena&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think that my brother&mdash;!&rdquo; broke in the Colonel, aghast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has nothing whatever to do with it&mdash;directly. The fire-elemental
that has here been tormenting you and your household was sent upon its mission
long before you, or your family, or your ancestors, or even the nation you
belong to&mdash;unless I am much mistaken&mdash;was even in existence. We will
come to that a little later; after the experiment I propose to make we shall be
more positive. At present I can only say we have to deal now, not only with the
phenomenon of Attacking Fire merely, but with the vindictive and enraged
intelligence that is directing it from behind the scenes&mdash;vindictive and
enraged,&rdquo;&mdash;he repeated the words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That explains&mdash;&rdquo; began Colonel Wragge, seeking furiously for
words he could not find quickly enough.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much,&rdquo; said John Silence, with a gesture to restrain him.
</p>

<p>
He stopped a moment in the middle of his walk, and a deep silence came down
over the little room. Through the windows the sunlight seemed less bright, the
long line of dark hills less friendly, making me think of a vast wave towering
to heaven and about to break and overwhelm us. Something formidable had crept
into the world about us. For, undoubtedly, there was a disquieting thought,
holding terror as well as awe, in the picture his words conjured up: the
conception of a human will reaching its deathless hand, spiteful and
destructive, down through the ages, to strike the living and afflict the
innocent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what is its object?&rdquo; burst out the soldier, unable to restrain
himself longer in the silence. &ldquo;Why does it come from that plantation?
And why should it attack us, or any one in particular?&rdquo; Questions began
to pour from him in a stream.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; the doctor answered quietly, having let him run
on for several minutes. &ldquo;But I must first discover positively what, or
who, it is that directs this particular fire-elemental. And, to do that, we
must first&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke with slow deliberation&mdash;&ldquo;seek to
capture&mdash;to confine by visibility&mdash;to limit its sphere in a concrete
form.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens almighty!&rdquo; exclaimed the soldier, mixing his words in
his unfeigned surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; pursued the other calmly; &ldquo;for in so doing I
think we can release it from the purpose that binds it, restore it to its
normal condition of latent fire, and also&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice
perceptibly &mdash;&ldquo;also discover the face and form of the Being that
ensouls it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man behind the gun!&rdquo; cried the Colonel, beginning to
understand something, and leaning forward so as not to miss a single syllable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean that in the last resort, before it returns to the womb of
potential fire, it will probably assume the face and figure of its Director, of
the man of magical knowledge who originally bound it with his incantations and
sent it forth upon its mission of centuries.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The soldier sat down and gasped openly in his face, breathing hard; but it was
a very subdued voice that framed the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how do you propose to make it visible? How capture and confine it?
What d&rsquo;ye mean, Dr. John Silence?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By furnishing it with the materials for a form. By the process of
materialisation simply. Once limited by dimensions, it will become slow, heavy,
visible. We can then dissipate it. Invisible fire, you see, is dangerous and
incalculable; locked up in a form we can perhaps manage it. We must betray
it&mdash;to its death.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this material?&rdquo; we asked in the same breath, although I think
I had already guessed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not pleasant, but effective,&rdquo; came the quiet reply; &ldquo;the
exhalations of freshly spilled blood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not human blood!&rdquo; cried Colonel Wragge, starting up from his chair
with a voice like an explosion. I thought his eyes would start from their
sockets.
</p>

<p>
The face of Dr. Silence relaxed in spite of himself, and his spontaneous little
laugh brought a welcome though momentary relief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The days of human sacrifice, I hope, will never come again,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;Animal blood will answer the purpose, and we can make the
experiment as pleasant as possible. Only, the blood must be freshly spilled and
strong with the vital emanations that attract this peculiar class of elemental
creature. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps if some pig on the estate is ready for the
market&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned to hide a smile; but the passing touch of comedy found no echo in the
mind of our host, who did not understand how to change quickly from one emotion
to another. Clearly he was debating many things laboriously in his honest
brain. But, in the end, the earnestness and scientific disinterestedness of the
doctor, whose influence over him was already very great, won the day, and he
presently looked up more calmly, and observed shortly that he thought perhaps
the matter could be arranged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are other and pleasanter methods,&rdquo; Dr. Silence went on to
explain, &ldquo;but they require time and preparation, and things have gone
much too far, in my opinion, to admit of delay. And the process need cause you
no distress: we sit round the bowl and await results. Nothing more. The
emanations of blood&mdash;which, as Levi says, is the first incarnation of the
universal fluid&mdash;furnish the materials out of which the creatures of
discarnate life, spirits if you prefer, can fashion themselves a temporary
appearance. The process is old, and lies at the root of all blood sacrifice. It
was known to the priests of Baal, and it is known to the modern ecstasy dancers
who cut themselves to produce objective phantoms who dance with them. And the
least gifted clairvoyant could tell you that the forms to be seen in the
vicinity of slaughter-houses, or hovering above the deserted battlefields,
are&mdash;well, simply beyond all description. I do not mean,&rdquo; he added,
noticing the uneasy fidgeting of his host, &ldquo;that anything in our
laundry-experiment need appear to terrify us, for this case seems a
comparatively simple one, and it is only the vindictive character of the
intelligence directing this fire-elemental that causes anxiety and makes for
personal danger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is curious,&rdquo; said the Colonel, with a sudden rush of words,
drawing a deep breath, and as though speaking of things distasteful to him,
&ldquo;that during my years among the Hill Tribes of Northern India I came
across&mdash;personally came across&mdash;instances of the sacrifices of blood
to certain deities being stopped suddenly, and all manner of disasters
happening until they were resumed. Fires broke out in the huts, and even on the
clothes, of the natives&mdash;and&mdash;and I admit I have read, in the course
of my studies,&rdquo;&mdash;he made a gesture toward his books and heavily
laden table,&mdash;&ldquo;of the Yezidis of Syria evoking phantoms by means of
cutting their bodies with knives during their whirling dances&mdash;enormous
globes of fire which turned into monstrous and terrible forms&mdash;and I
remember an account somewhere, too, how the emaciated forms and pallid
countenances of the spectres, that appeared to the Emperor Julian, claimed to
be the true Immortals, and told him to renew the sacrifices of blood &lsquo;for
the fumes of which, since the establishment of Christianity, they had been
pining&rsquo;&mdash;that these were in reality the phantoms evoked by the rites
of blood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both Dr. Silence and myself listened in amazement, for this sudden speech was
so unexpected, and betrayed so much more knowledge than we had either of us
suspected in the old soldier.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then perhaps you have read, too,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;how the
Cosmic Deities of savage races, elemental in their nature, have been kept alive
through many ages by these blood rites?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;that is new to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; Dr. Silence added, &ldquo;I am glad you are not
wholly unfamiliar with the subject, for you will now bring more sympathy, and
therefore more help, to our experiment. For, of course, in this case, we only
want the blood to tempt the creature from its lair and enclose it in a
form&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I quite understand. And I only hesitated just now,&rdquo; he went on,
his words coming much more slowly, as though he felt he had already said too
much, &ldquo;because I wished to be quite sure it was no mere curiosity, but an
actual sense of necessity that dictated this horrible experiment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is your safety, and that of your household, and of your sister, that
is at stake,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;Once I have <i>seen</i>, I hope
to discover whence this elemental comes, and what its real purpose is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge signified his assent with a bow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the moon will help us,&rdquo; the other said, &ldquo;for it will be
full in the early hours of the morning, and this kind of elemental-being is
always most active at the period of full moon. Hence, you see, the clue
furnished by your diary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So it was finally settled. Colonel Wragge would provide the materials for the
experiment, and we were to meet at midnight. How he would contrive at that
hour&mdash;but that was his business. I only know we both realised that he
would keep his word, and whether a pig died at midnight, or at noon, was after
all perhaps only a question of the sleep and personal comfort of the
executioner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tonight, then, in the laundry,&rdquo; said Dr. Silence finally, to
clinch the plan; &ldquo;we three alone&mdash;and at midnight, when the
household is asleep and we shall be free from disturbance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He exchanged significant glances with our host, who, at that moment, was called
away by the announcement that the family doctor had arrived, and was ready to
see him in his sister&rsquo;s room.
</p>

<p>
For the remainder of the afternoon John Silence disappeared. I had my
suspicions that he made a secret visit to the plantation and also to the
laundry building; but, in any case, we saw nothing of him, and he kept strictly
to himself. He was preparing for the night, I felt sure, but the nature of his
preparations I could only guess. There was movement in his room, I heard, and
an odour like incense hung about the door, and knowing that he regarded rites
as the vehicles of energies, my guesses were probably not far wrong.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge, too, remained absent the greater part of the afternoon, and,
deeply afflicted, had scarcely left his sister&rsquo;s bedside, but in response
to my inquiry when we met for a moment at tea-time, he told me that although
she had moments of attempted speech, her talk was quite incoherent and
hysterical, and she was still quite unable to explain the nature of what she
had seen. The doctor, he said, feared she had recovered the use of her limbs,
only to lose that of her memory, and perhaps even of her mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then the recovery of her legs, I trust, may be permanent, at any
rate,&rdquo; I ventured, finding it difficult to know what sympathy to offer.
And he replied with a curious short laugh, &ldquo;Oh yes; about that there can
be no doubt whatever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And it was due merely to the chance of my overhearing a fragment of
conversation&mdash;unwillingly, of course&mdash;that a little further light was
thrown upon the state in which the old lady actually lay. For, as I came out of
my room, it happened that Colonel Wragge and the doctor were going downstairs
together, and their words floated up to my ears before I could make my presence
known by so much as a cough.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you must find a way,&rdquo; the doctor was saying with decision;
&ldquo;for I cannot insist too strongly upon that&mdash;and at all costs she
must be kept quiet. These attempts to go out must be prevented&mdash;if
necessary, by force. This desire to visit some wood or other she keeps talking
about is, of course, hysterical in nature. It cannot be permitted for a
moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It shall not be permitted,&rdquo; I heard the soldier reply, as they
reached the hall below.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It has impressed her mind for some reason&mdash;&rdquo; the doctor went
on, by way evidently of soothing explanation, and then the distance made it
impossible for me to hear more.
</p>

<p>
At dinner Dr. Silence was still absent, on the public plea of a headache, and
though food was sent to his room, I am inclined to believe he did not touch it,
but spent the entire time fasting.
</p>

<p>
We retired early, desiring that the household should do likewise, and I must
confess that at ten o&rsquo;clock when I bid my host a temporary good-night,
and sought my room to make what mental preparation I could, I realised in no
very pleasant fashion that it was a singular and formidable assignation, this
midnight meeting in the laundry building, and that there were moments in every
adventure of life when a wise man, and one who knew his own limitations, owed
it to his dignity to withdraw discreetly. And, but for the character of our
leader, I probably should have then and there offered the best excuse I could
think of, and have allowed myself quietly to fall asleep and wait for an
exciting story in the morning of what had happened. But with a man like John
Silence, such a lapse was out of the question, and I sat before my fire
counting the minutes and doing everything I could think of to fortify my
resolution and fasten my will at the point where I could be reasonably sure
that my self-control would hold against all attacks of men, devils, or
elementals.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
At a quarter before midnight, clad in a heavy ulster, and with slippered feet,
I crept cautiously from my room and stole down the passage to the top of the
stairs. Outside the doctor&rsquo;s door I waited a moment to listen. All was
still; the house in utter darkness; no gleam of light beneath any door; only,
down the length of the corridor, from the direction of the sick-room, came
faint sounds of laughter and incoherent talk that were not things to reassure a
mind already half a-tremble, and I made haste to reach the hall and let myself
out through the front door into the night.
</p>

<p>
The air was keen and frosty, perfumed with night smells, and exquisitely fresh;
all the million candles of the sky were alight, and a faint breeze rose and
fell with far-away sighings in the tops of the pine trees. My blood leaped for
a moment in the spaciousness of the night, for the splendid stars brought
courage; but the next instant, as I turned the corner of the house, moving
stealthily down the gravel drive, my spirits sank again ominously. For, yonder,
over the funereal plumes of the Twelve Acre Plantation, I saw the broken,
yellow disc of the half-moon just rising in the east, staring down like some
vast Being come to watch upon the progress of our doom. Seen through the
distorting vapours of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, her face looked weirdly
unfamiliar, her usual expression of benignant vacancy somehow a-twist. I
slipped along by the shadows of the wall, keeping my eyes upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
The laundry-house, as already described, stood detached from the other offices,
with laurel shrubberies crowding thickly behind it, and the kitchen-garden so
close on the other side that the strong smells of soil and growing things came
across almost heavily. The shadows of the haunted plantation, hugely lengthened
by the rising moon behind them, reached to the very walls and covered the stone
tiles of the roof with a dark pall. So keenly were my senses alert at this
moment that I believe I could fill a chapter with the endless small details of
the impression I received&mdash;shadows, odour, shapes, sounds&mdash;in the
space of the few seconds I stood and waited before the closed wooden door.
</p>

<p>
Then I became aware of some one moving towards me through the moonlight, and
the figure of John Silence, without overcoat and bareheaded, came quickly and
without noise to join me. His eyes, I saw at once, were wonderfully bright, and
so marked was the shining pallor of his face that I could hardly tell when he
passed from the moonlight into the shade.
</p>

<p>
He passed without a word, beckoning me to follow, and then pushed the door
open, and went in.
</p>

<p>
The chill air of the place met us like that of an underground vault; and the
brick floor and whitewashed walls, streaked with damp and smoke, threw back the
cold in our faces. Directly opposite gaped the black throat of the huge open
fireplace, the ashes of wood fires still piled and scattered about the hearth,
and on either side of the projecting chimney-column were the deep recesses
holding the big twin cauldrons for boiling clothes. Upon the lids of these
cauldrons stood the two little oil lamps, shaded red, which gave all the light
there was, and immediately in front of the fireplace there was a small circular
table with three chairs set about it. Overhead, the narrow slit windows, high
up the walls, pointed to a dim network of wooden rafters half lost among the
shadows, and then came the dark vault of the roof. Cheerless and unalluring,
for all the red light, it certainly was, reminding me of some unused
conventicle, bare of pews or pulpit, ugly and severe, and I was forcibly struck
by the contrast between the normal uses to which the place was ordinarily put,
and the strange and medieval purpose which had brought us under its roof
tonight.
</p>

<p>
Possibly an involuntary shudder ran over me, for my companion turned with a
confident look to reassure me, and he was so completely master of himself that
I at once absorbed from his abundance, and felt the chinks of my failing
courage beginning to close up. To meet his eye in the presence of danger was
like finding a mental railing that guided and supported thought along the giddy
edges of alarm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am quite ready,&rdquo; I whispered, turning to listen for approaching
footsteps.
</p>

<p>
He nodded, still keeping his eyes on mine. Our whispers sounded hollow as they
echoed overhead among the rafters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not all would have
the courage. Keep your thoughts controlled, and imagine the protective shell
round you&mdash;round your inner being.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; I repeated, cursing my chattering teeth.
</p>

<p>
He took my hand and shook it, and the contact seemed to shake into me something
of his supreme confidence. The eyes and hands of a strong man can touch the
soul. I think he guessed my thought, for a passing smile flashed about the
corners of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will feel more comfortable,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone,
&ldquo;when the chain is complete. The Colonel we can count on, of course.
Remember, though,&rdquo; he added warningly, &ldquo;he may perhaps become
controlled&mdash;possessed&mdash;when the thing comes, because he won&rsquo;t
know how to resist. And to explain the business to such a man&mdash;!&rdquo; He
shrugged his shoulders expressively. &ldquo;But it will only be temporary, and
I will see that no harm comes to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He glanced round at the arrangements with approval.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Red light,&rdquo; he said, indicating the shaded lamps, &ldquo;has the
lowest rate of vibration. Materialisations are dissipated by strong
light&mdash;won&rsquo;t form, or hold together&mdash;in rapid
vibrations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was not sure that I approved altogether of this dim light, for in complete
darkness there is something protective&mdash;the knowledge that one cannot be
seen, probably&mdash;which a half-light destroys, but I remembered the warning
to keep my thoughts steady, and forbore to give them expression.
</p>

<p>
There was a step outside, and the figure of Colonel Wragge stood in the
doorway. Though entering on tiptoe, he made considerable noise and clatter, for
his free movements were impeded by the burden he carried, and we saw a large
yellowish bowl held out at arms&rsquo; length from his body, the mouth covered
with a white cloth. His face, I noted, was rigidly composed. He, too, was
master of himself. And, as I thought of this old soldier moving through the
long series of alarms, worn with watching and wearied with assault,
unenlightened yet undismayed, even down to the dreadful shock of his
sister&rsquo;s terror, and still showing the dogged pluck that persists in the
face of defeat, I understood what Dr. Silence meant when he described him as a
man &ldquo;to be counted on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I think there was nothing beyond this rigidity of his stern features, and a
certain greyness of the complexion, to betray the turmoil of the emotions that
were doubtless going on within; and the quality of these two men, each in his
own way, so keyed me up that, by the time the door was shut and we had
exchanged silent greetings, all the latent courage I possessed was well to the
fore, and I felt as sure of myself as I knew I ever could feel.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge set the bowl carefully in the centre of the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Midnight,&rdquo; he said shortly, glancing at his watch, and we all
three moved to our chairs.
</p>

<p>
There, in the middle of that cold and silent place, we sat, with the vile bowl
before us, and a thin, hardly perceptible steam rising through the damp air
from the surface of the white cloth and disappearing upwards the moment it
passed beyond the zone of red light and entered the deep shadows thrown forward
by the projecting wall of chimney.
</p>

<p>
The doctor had indicated our respective places, and I found myself seated with
my back to the door and opposite the black hearth. The Colonel was on my left,
and Dr. Silence on my right, both half facing me, the latter more in shadow
than the former. We thus divided the little table into even sections, and
sitting back in our chairs we awaited events in silence.
</p>

<p>
For something like an hour I do not think there was even the faintest sound
within those four walls and under the canopy of that vaulted roof. Our slippers
made no scratching on the gritty floor, and our breathing was suppressed almost
to nothing; even the rustle of our clothes as we shifted from time to time upon
our seats was inaudible. Silence smothered us absolutely&mdash;the silence of
night, of listening, the silence of a haunted expectancy. The very gurgling of
the lamps was too soft to be heard, and if light itself had sound, I do not
think we should have noticed the silvery tread of the moonlight as it entered
the high narrow windows and threw upon the floor the slender traces of its
pallid footsteps.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge and the doctor, and myself too for that matter, sat thus like
figures of stone, without speech and without gesture. My eyes passed in
ceaseless journeys from the bowl to their faces, and from their faces to the
bowl. They might have been masks, however, for all the signs of life they gave;
and the light steaming from the horrid contents beneath the white cloth had
long ceased to be visible.
</p>

<p>
Then presently, as the moon rose higher, the wind rose with it. It sighed, like
the lightest of passing wings, over the roof; it crept most softly round the
walls; it made the brick floor like ice beneath our feet. With it I saw
mentally the desolate moorland flowing like a sea about the old house, the
treeless expanse of lonely hills, the nearer copses, sombre and mysterious in
the night. The plantation, too, in particular I saw, and imagined I heard the
mournful whisperings that must now be a-stirring among its tree-tops as the
breeze played down between the twisted stems. In the depth of the room behind
us the shafts of moonlight met and crossed in a growing network.
</p>

<p>
It was after an hour of this wearing and unbroken attention, and I should judge
about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when the baying of the dogs in the
stableyard first began, and I saw John Silence move suddenly in his chair and
sit up in an attitude of attention. Every force in my being instantly leaped
into the keenest vigilance. Colonel Wragge moved too, though slowly, and
without raising his eyes from the table before him.
</p>

<p>
The doctor stretched his arm out and took the white cloth from the bowl.
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps imagination that persuaded me the red glare of the lamps grew
fainter and the air over the table before us thickened. I had been expecting
something for so long that the movement of my companions, and the lifting of
the cloth, may easily have caused the momentary delusion that something hovered
in the air before my face, touching the skin of my cheeks with a silken run.
But it was certainly not a delusion that the Colonel looked up at the same
moment and glanced over his shoulder, as though his eyes followed the movements
of something to and fro about the room, and that he then buttoned his overcoat
more tightly about him and his eyes sought my own face first, and then the
doctor&rsquo;s. And it was no delusion that his face seemed somehow to have
turned dark, become spread as it were with a shadowy blackness. I saw his lips
tighten and his expression grow hard and stern, and it came to me then with a
rush that, of course, this man had told us but a part of the experiences he had
been through in the house, and that there was much more he had never been able
to bring himself to reveal at all. I felt sure of it. The way he turned and
stared about him betrayed a familiarity with other things than those he had
described to us. It was not merely a sight of fire he looked for; it was a
sight of something alive, intelligent, something able to evade his searching;
it was <i>a person</i>. It was the watch for the ancient Being who sought to
obsess him.
</p>

<p>
And the way in which Dr. Silence answered his look&mdash;though it was only by
a glance of subtlest sympathy&mdash;confirmed my impression.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We may be ready now,&rdquo; I heard him say in a whisper, and I
understood that his words were intended as a steadying warning, and braced
myself mentally to the utmost of my power.
</p>

<p>
Yet long before Colonel Wragge had turned to stare about the room, and long
before the doctor had confirmed my impression that things were at last
beginning to stir, I had become aware in most singular fashion that the place
held more than our three selves. With the rising of the wind this increase to
our numbers had first taken place. The baying of the hounds almost seemed to
have signalled it. I cannot say how it may be possible to realise that an empty
place has suddenly become&mdash;not empty, when the new arrival is nothing that
appeals to any one of the senses; for this recognition of an
&ldquo;invisible,&rdquo; as of the change in the balance of personal forces in
a human group, is indefinable and beyond proof. Yet it is unmistakable. And I
knew perfectly well at what given moment the atmosphere within these four walls
became charged with the presence of other living beings besides ourselves. And,
on reflection, I am convinced that both my companions knew it too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Watch the light,&rdquo; said the doctor under his breath, and then I
knew too that it was no fancy of my own that had turned the air darker, and the
way he turned to examine the face of our host sent an electric thrill of wonder
and expectancy shivering along every nerve in my body.
</p>

<p>
Yet it was no kind of terror that I experienced, but rather a sort of mental
dizziness, and a sensation as of being suspended in some remote and dreadful
altitude where things might happen, indeed were about to happen, that had never
before happened within the ken of man. Horror may have formed an ingredient,
but it was not chiefly horror, and in no sense ghostly horror.
</p>

<p>
Uncommon thoughts kept beating on my brain like tiny hammers, soft yet
persistent, seeking admission; their unbidden tide began to wash along the far
fringes of my mind, the currents of unwonted sensations to rise over the remote
frontiers of my consciousness. I was aware of thoughts, and the fantasies of
thoughts, that I never knew before existed. Portions of my being stirred that
had never stirred before, and things ancient and inexplicable rose to the
surface and beckoned me to follow. I felt as though I were about to fly off, at
some immense tangent, into an outer space hitherto unknown even in dreams. And
so singular was the result produced upon me that I was uncommonly glad to
anchor my mind, as well as my eyes, upon the masterful personality of the
doctor at my side, for there, I realised, I could draw always upon the forces
of sanity and safety.
</p>

<p>
With a vigorous effort of will I returned to the scene before me, and tried to
focus my attention, with steadier thoughts, upon the table, and upon the silent
figures seated round it. And then I saw that certain changes had come about in
the place where we sat.
</p>

<p>
The patches of moonlight on the floor, I noted, had become curiously shaded;
the faces of my companions opposite were not so clearly visible as before; and
the forehead and cheeks of Colonel Wragge were glistening with perspiration. I
realised further, that an extraordinary change had come about in the
temperature of the atmosphere. The increased warmth had a painful effect, not
alone on Colonel Wragge, but upon all of us. It was oppressive and unnatural.
We gasped figuratively as well as actually.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are the first to feel it,&rdquo; said Dr. Silence in low tones,
looking across at him. &ldquo;You are in more intimate touch, of
course&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Colonel was trembling, and appeared to be in considerable distress. His
knees shook, so that the shuffling of his slippered feet became audible. He
inclined his head to show that he had heard, but made no other reply. I think,
even then, he was sore put to it to keep himself in hand. I knew what he was
struggling against. As Dr. Silence had warned me, he was about to be obsessed,
and was savagely, though vainly, resisting.
</p>

<p>
But, meanwhile, a curious and whirling sense of exhilaration began to come over
me. The increasing heat was delightful, bringing a sensation of intense
activity, of thoughts pouring through the mind at high speed, of vivid pictures
in the brain, of fierce desires and lightning energies alive in every part of
the body. I was conscious of no physical distress, such as the Colonel felt,
but only of a vague feeling that it might all grow suddenly too
intense&mdash;that I might be consumed&mdash;that my personality as well as my
body, might become resolved into the flame of pure spirit. I began to live at a
speed too intense to last. It was as if a thousand ecstasies besieged me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; whispered the voice of John Silence in my ear, and I
looked up with a start to see that the Colonel had risen from his chair. The
doctor rose too. I followed suit, and for the first time saw down into the
bowl. To my amazement and horror I saw that the contents were troubled. The
blood was astir with movement.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the experiment was witnessed by us standing. It came, too, with a
curious suddenness. There was no more dreaming, for me at any rate.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget the figure of Colonel Wragge standing there beside me,
upright and unshaken, squarely planted on his feet, looking about him, puzzled
beyond belief, yet full of a fighting anger. Framed by the white walls, the red
glow of the lamps upon his streaming cheeks, his eyes glowing against the
deathly pallor of his skin, breathing hard and making convulsive efforts of
hands and body to keep himself under control, his whole being roused to the
point of savage fighting, yet with nothing visible to get at anywhere&mdash;he
stood there, immovable against odds. And the strange contrast of the pale skin
and the burning face I had never seen before, or wish to see again.
</p>

<p>
But what has left an even sharper impression on my memory was the blackness
that then began crawling over his face, obliterating the features, concealing
their human outline, and hiding him inch by inch from view. This was my first
realisation that the process of materialisation was at work. His visage became
shrouded. I moved from one side to the other to keep him in view, and it was
only then I understood that, properly speaking, the blackness was not upon the
countenance of Colonel Wragge, but that something had inserted itself between
me and him, thus screening his face with the effect of a dark veil. Something
that apparently rose through the floor was passing slowly into the air above
the table and above the bowl. The blood in the bowl, moreover, was considerably
less than before.
</p>

<p>
And, with this change in the air before us, there came at the same time a
further change, I thought, in the face of the soldier. One-half was turned
towards the red lamps, while the other caught the pale illumination of the
moonlight falling aslant from the high windows, so that it was difficult to
estimate this change with accuracy of detail. But it seemed to me that, while
the features&mdash;eyes, nose, mouth&mdash;remained the same, the life
informing them had undergone some profound transformation. The signature of a
new power had crept into the face and left its traces there&mdash;an expression
dark, and in some unexplained way, terrible.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly he opened his mouth and spoke, and the sound of this changed
voice, deep and musical though it was, made me cold and set my heart beating
with uncomfortable rapidity. The Being, as he had dreaded, was already in
control of his brain, using his mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see a blackness like the blackness of Egypt before my face,&rdquo;
said the tones of this unknown voice that seemed half his own and half
another&rsquo;s. &ldquo;And out of this darkness they come, they come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I gave a dreadful start. The doctor turned to look at me for an instant, and
then turned to centre his attention upon the figure of our host, and I
understood in some intuitive fashion that he was there to watch over the
strangest contest man ever saw&mdash;to watch over and, if necessary, to
protect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is being controlled&mdash;possessed,&rdquo; he whispered to me
through the shadows. His face wore a wonderful expression, half triumph, half
admiration.
</p>

<p>
Even as Colonel Wragge spoke, it seemed to me that this visible darkness began
to increase, pouring up thickly out of the ground by the hearth, rising up in
sheets and veils, shrouding our eyes and faces. It stole up from below&mdash;an
awful blackness that seemed to drink in all the radiations of light in the
building, leaving nothing but the ghost of a radiance in their place. Then, out
of this rising sea of shadows, issued a pale and spectral light that gradually
spread itself about us, and from the heart of this light I saw the shapes of
fire crowd and gather. And these were not human shapes, or the shapes of
anything I recognised as alive in the world, but outlines of fire that traced
globes, triangles, crosses, and the luminous bodies of various geometrical
figures. They grew bright, faded, and then grew bright again with an effect
almost of pulsation. They passed swiftly to and fro through the air, rising and
falling, and particularly in the immediate neighbourhood of the Colonel, often
gathering about his head and shoulders, and even appearing to settle upon him
like giant insects of flame. They were accompanied, moreover, by a faint sound
of hissing&mdash;the same sound we had heard that afternoon in the plantation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The fire-elementals that precede their master,&rdquo; the doctor said in
an undertone. &ldquo;Be ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And while this weird display of the shapes of fire alternately flashed and
faded, and the hissing echoed faintly among the dim rafters overhead, we heard
the awful voice issue at intervals from the lips of the afflicted soldier. It
was a voice of power, splendid in some way I cannot describe, and with a
certain sense of majesty in its cadences, and, as I listened to it with quickly
beating heart, I could fancy it was some ancient voice of Time itself, echoing
down immense corridors of stone, from the depths of vast temples, from the very
heart of mountain tombs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen my divine Father, Osiris,&rdquo; thundered the great tones.
&ldquo;I have scattered the gloom of the night. I have burst through the earth,
and am one with the starry Deities!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Something grand came into the soldier&rsquo;s face. He was staring fixedly
before him, as though seeing nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Watch,&rdquo; whispered Dr. Silence in my ear, and his whisper seemed to
come from very far away.
</p>

<p>
Again the mouth opened and the awesome voice issued forth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thoth,&rdquo; it boomed, &ldquo;has loosened the bandages of Set which
fettered my mouth. I have taken my place in the great winds of heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I heard the little wind of night, with its mournful voice of ages, sighing
round the walls and over the roof.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; came from the doctor at my side, and the thunder of the
voice continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have hidden myself with you, O ye stars that never diminish. I
remember my name&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;House&mdash;of&mdash;Fire!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The voice ceased and the sound died away. Something about the face and figure
of Colonel Wragge relaxed, I thought. The terrible look passed from his face.
The Being that obsessed him was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The great Ritual,&rdquo; said Dr. Silence aside to me, very low,
&ldquo;the Book of the Dead. Now it&rsquo;s leaving him. Soon the blood will
fashion it a body.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge, who had stood absolutely motionless all this time, suddenly
swayed, so that I thought he was going to fall,&mdash;and, but for the quick
support of the doctor&rsquo;s arm, he probably would have fallen, for he
staggered as in the beginning of collapse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am drunk with the wine of Osiris,&rdquo; he cried,&mdash;and it was
half with his own voice this time&mdash;&ldquo;but Horus, the Eternal Watcher,
is about my path&mdash;for&mdash;safety.&rdquo; The voice dwindled and failed,
dying away into something almost like a cry of distress.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, watch closely,&rdquo; said Dr. Silence, speaking loud, &ldquo;for
after the cry will come the Fire!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I began to tremble involuntarily; an awful change had come without warning into
the air; my legs grew weak as paper beneath my weight and I had to support
myself by leaning on the table. Colonel Wragge, I saw, was also leaning forward
with a kind of droop. The shapes of fire had vanished all, but his face was lit
by the red lamps and the pale, shifting moonlight rose behind him like mist.
</p>

<p>
We were both gazing at the bowl, now almost empty; the Colonel stooped so low I
feared every minute he would lose his balance and drop into it; and the shadow,
that had so long been in process of forming, now at length began to assume
material outline in the air before us.
</p>

<p>
Then John Silence moved forward quickly. He took his place between us and the
shadow. Erect, formidable, absolute master of the situation, I saw him stand
there, his face calm and almost smiling, and fire in his eyes. His protective
influence was astounding and incalculable. Even the abhorrent dread I felt at
the sight of the creature growing into life and substance before us, lessened
in some way so that I was able to keep my eyes fixed on the air above the bowl
without too vivid a terror.
</p>

<p>
But as it took shape, rising out of nothing as it were, and growing momentarily
more defined in outline, a period of utter and wonderful silence settled down
upon the building and all it contained. A hush of ages, like the sudden centre
of peace at the heart of the travelling cyclone, descended through the night,
and out of this hush, as out of the emanations of the steaming blood, issued
the form of the ancient being who had first sent the elemental of fire upon its
mission. It grew and darkened and solidified before our eyes. It rose from just
beyond the table so that the lower portions remained invisible, but I saw the
outline limn itself upon the air, as though slowly revealed by the rising of a
curtain. It apparently had not then quite concentrated to the normal
proportions, but was spread out on all sides into space, huge, though rapidly
condensing, for I saw the colossal shoulders, the neck, the lower portion of
the dark jaws, the terrible mouth, and then the teeth and lips&mdash;and, as
the veil seemed to lift further upon the tremendous face&mdash;I saw the nose
and cheek bones. In another moment I should have looked straight into the
eyes&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But what Dr. Silence did at that moment was so unexpected, and took me so by
surprise, that I have never yet properly understood its nature, and he has
never yet seen fit to explain in detail to me. He uttered some sound that had a
note of command in it&mdash;and, in so doing, stepped forward and intervened
between me and the face. The figure, just nearing completeness, he therefore
hid from my sight&mdash;and I have always thought purposely hid from my sight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The fire!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;The fire! Beware!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden roar as of flame from the very mouth of the pit, and for the
space of a single second all grew light as day. A blinding flash passed across
my face, and there was heat for an instant that seemed to shrivel skin, and
flesh, and bone. Then came steps, and I heard Colonel Wragge utter a great cry,
wilder than any human cry I have ever known. The heat sucked all the breath out
of my lungs with a rush, and the blaze of light, as it vanished, swept my
vision with it into enveloping darkness.
</p>

<p>
When I recovered the use of my senses a few moments later I saw that Colonel
Wragge with a face of death, its whiteness strangely stained, had moved closer
to me. Dr. Silence stood beside him, an expression of triumph and success in
his eyes. The next minute the soldier tried to clutch me with his hand. Then he
reeled, staggered, and, unable to save himself, fell with a great crash upon
the brick floor.
</p>

<p>
After the sheet of flame, a wind raged round the building as though it would
lift the roof off, but then passed as suddenly as it came. And in the intense
calm that followed I saw that the form had vanished, and the doctor was
stooping over Colonel Wragge upon the floor, trying to lift him to a sitting
position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;more light. Take the shades
off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge sat up and the glare of the unshaded lamps fell upon his face.
It was grey and drawn, still running heat, and there was a look in the eyes and
about the corners of the mouth that seemed in this short space of time to have
added years to its age. At the same time, the expression of effort and anxiety
had left it. It showed relief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he said, looking up at the doctor in a dazed fashion, and
struggling to his feet. &ldquo;Thank God! it&rsquo;s gone at last.&rdquo; He
stared round the laundry as though to find out where he was. &ldquo;Did it
control me&mdash;take possession of me? Did I talk nonsense?&rdquo; he asked
bluntly. &ldquo;After the heat came, I remember nothing&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel yourself again in a few minutes,&rdquo; the doctor
said. To my infinite horror I saw that he was surreptitiously wiping sundry
dark stains from the face. &ldquo;Our experiment has been a success
and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave me a swift glance to hide the bowl, standing between me and our host
while I hurriedly stuffed it down under the lid of the nearest cauldron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;and none of us the worse for it,&rdquo; he finished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And fires?&rdquo; he asked, still dazed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be no
more fires?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is dissipated&mdash;partly, at any rate,&rdquo; replied Dr. Silence
cautiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the man behind the gun,&rdquo; he went on, only half realising what
he was saying, I think; &ldquo;have you discovered <i>that?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A form materialised,&rdquo; said the doctor briefly. &ldquo;I know for
certain now what the directing intelligence was behind it all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge pulled himself together and got upon his feet. The words
conveyed no clear meaning to him yet. But his memory was returning gradually,
and he was trying to piece together the fragments into a connected whole. He
shivered a little, for the place had grown suddenly chilly. The air was empty
again, lifeless.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You feel all right again now,&rdquo; Dr. Silence said, in the tone of a
man stating a fact rather than asking a question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks to you&mdash;both, yes.&rdquo; He drew a deep breath, and mopped
his face, and even attempted a smile. He made me think of a man coming from the
battlefield with the stains of fighting still upon him, but scornful of his
wounds. Then he turned gravely towards the doctor with a question in his eyes.
Memory had returned and he was himself again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely what I expected,&rdquo; the doctor said calmly; &ldquo;a
fire-elemental sent upon its mission in the days of Thebes, centuries before
Christ, and tonight, for the first time all these thousands of years, released
from the spell that originally bound it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We stared at him in amazement, Colonel Wragge opening his lips for words that
refused to shape themselves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, if we dig,&rdquo; he continued significantly, pointing to the floor
where the blackness had poured up, &ldquo;we shall find some underground
connection&mdash;a tunnel most likely&mdash;leading to the Twelve Acre Wood. It
was made by&mdash;your predecessor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A tunnel made by my brother!&rdquo; gasped the soldier. &ldquo;Then my
sister should know&mdash;she lived here with him&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
John Silence inclined his head slowly. &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;Your brother, no doubt, was as much tormented as you have
been,&rdquo; he continued after a pause in which Colonel Wragge seemed deeply
preoccupied with his thoughts, &ldquo;and tried to find peace by burying it in
the wood, and surrounding the wood then, like a large magic circle, with the
enchantments of the old formulae. So the stars the man saw
blazing&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But burying what?&rdquo; asked the soldier faintly, stepping backwards
towards the support of the wall.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence regarded us both intently for a moment before he replied. I think
he weighed in his mind whether to tell us now, or when the investigation was
absolutely complete.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mummy,&rdquo; he said softly, after a moment; &ldquo;the mummy that
your brother took from its resting place of centuries, and brought
home&mdash;here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge dropped down upon the nearest chair, hanging breathlessly on
every word. He was far too amazed for speech.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mummy of some important person&mdash;a priest most
likely&mdash;protected from disturbance and desecration by the ceremonial magic
of the time. For they understood how to attach to the mummy, to lock up with it
in the tomb, an elemental force that would direct itself even after ages upon
any one who dared to molest it. In this case it was an elemental of
fire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence crossed the floor and turned out the lamps one by one. He had
nothing more to say for the moment. Following his example, I folded the table
together and took up the chairs, and our host, still dazed and silent,
mechanically obeyed him and moved to the door.
</p>

<p>
We removed all traces of the experiment, taking the empty bowl back to the
house concealed beneath an ulster.
</p>

<p>
The air was cool and fragrant as we walked to the house, the stars beginning to
fade overhead and a fresh wind of early morning blowing up out of the east
where the sky was already hinting of the coming day. It was after five
o&rsquo;clock.
</p>

<p>
Stealthily we entered the front hall and locked the door, and as we went on
tiptoe upstairs to our rooms, the Colonel, peering at us over his candle as he
nodded good-night, whispered that if we were ready the digging should be begun
that very day.
</p>

<p>
Then I saw him steal along to his sister&rsquo;s room and disappear.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
But not even the mysterious references to the mummy, or the prospect of a
revelation by digging, were able to hinder the reaction that followed the
intense excitement of the past twelve hours, and I slept the sleep of the dead,
dreamless and undisturbed. A touch on the shoulder woke me, and I saw Dr.
Silence standing beside the bed, dressed to go out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s tea-time. You&rsquo;ve slept the
best part of a dozen hours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I sprang up and made a hurried toilet, while my companion sat and talked. He
looked fresh and rested, and his manner was even quieter than usual.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Colonel Wragge has provided spades and pickaxes. We&rsquo;re going out
to unearth this mummy at once,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no
reason we should not get away by the morning train.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go tonight, if you are,&rdquo; I said honestly.
</p>

<p>
But Dr. Silence shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must see this through to the end,&rdquo; he said gravely, and in a
tone that made me think he still anticipated serious things, perhaps. He went
on talking while I dressed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This case is really typical of all stories of mummy-haunting, and none
of them are cases to trifle with,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;for the mummies
of important people&mdash;kings, priests, magicians&mdash;were laid away with
profoundly significant ceremonial, and were very effectively protected, as you
have seen, against desecration, and especially against destruction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The general belief,&rdquo; he went on, anticipating my questions,
&ldquo;held, of course, that the perpetuity of the mummy guaranteed that of its
Ka,&mdash;the owner&rsquo;s spirit,&mdash;but it is not improbable that the
magical embalming was also used to retard reincarnation, the preservation of
the body preventing the return of the spirit to the toil and discipline of
earth-life; and, in any case, they knew how to attach powerful guardian-forces
to keep off trespassers. And any one who dared to remove the mummy, or
especially to unwind it&mdash;well,&rdquo; he added, with meaning, &ldquo;you
have seen&mdash;and you will see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I caught his face in the mirror while I struggled with my collar. It was deeply
serious. There could be no question that he spoke of what he believed and knew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The traveller-brother who brought it here must have been haunted
too,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for he tried to banish it by burial in the
wood, making a magic circle to enclose it. Something of genuine ceremonial he
must have known, for the stars the man saw were of course the remains of the
still flaming pentagrams he traced at intervals in the circle. Only he did not
know enough, or possibly was ignorant that the mummy&rsquo;s guardian was a
fire-force. Fire cannot be enclosed by fire, though, as you saw, it can be
released by it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then that awful figure in the laundry?&rdquo; I asked, thrilled to find
him so communicative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Undoubtedly the actual Ka of the mummy operating always behind its
agent, the elemental, and most likely thousands of years old.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Miss Wragge&mdash;?&rdquo; I ventured once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Miss Wragge,&rdquo; he repeated with increased gravity, &ldquo;Miss
Wragge&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A knock at the door brought a servant with word that tea was ready, and the
Colonel had sent to ask if we were coming down. The thread was broken. Dr.
Silence moved to the door and signed to me to follow. But his manner told me
that in any case no real answer would have been forthcoming to my question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the place to dig in,&rdquo; I asked, unable to restrain my
curiosity, &ldquo;will you find it by some process of divination
or&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused at the door and looked back at me, and with that he left me to finish
my dressing.
</p>

<p>
It was growing dark when the three of us silently made our way to the Twelve
Acre Plantation; the sky was overcast, and a black wind came out of the east.
Gloom hung about the old house and the air seemed full of sighings. We found
the tools ready laid at the edge of the wood, and each shouldering his piece,
we followed our leader at once in among the trees. He went straight forward for
some twenty yards and then stopped. At his feet lay the blackened circle of one
of the burned places. It was just discernible against the surrounding white
grass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are three of these,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they all lie in a
line with one another. Any one of them will tap the tunnel that connects the
laundry&mdash;the former Museum&mdash;with the chamber where the mummy now lies
buried.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He at once cleared away the burnt grass and began to dig; we all began to dig.
While I used the pick, the others shovelled vigorously. No one spoke. Colonel
Wragge worked the hardest of the three. The soil was light and sandy, and there
were only a few snake-like roots and occasional loose stones to delay us. The
pick made short work of these. And meanwhile the darkness settled about us and
the biting wind swept roaring through the trees overhead.
</p>

<p>
Then, quite suddenly, without a cry, Colonel Wragge disappeared up to his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The tunnel!&rdquo; cried the doctor, helping to drag him out, red,
breathless, and covered with sand and perspiration. &ldquo;Now, let me lead the
way.&rdquo; And he slipped down nimbly into the hole, so that a moment later we
heard his voice, muffled by sand and distance, rising up to us.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hubbard, you come next, and then Colonel Wragge&mdash;if he
wishes,&rdquo; we heard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you, of course,&rdquo; he said, looking at me as I
scrambled in.
</p>

<p>
The hole was bigger now, and I got down on all-fours in a channel not much
bigger than a large sewer-pipe and found myself in total darkness. A minute
later a heavy thud, followed by a cataract of loose sand, announced the arrival
of the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Catch hold of my heel,&rdquo; called Dr. Silence, &ldquo;and Colonel
Wragge can take yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In this slow, laborious fashion we wormed our way along a tunnel that had been
roughly dug out of the shifting sand, and was shored up clumsily by means of
wooden pillars and posts. Any moment, it seemed to me, we might be buried
alive. We could not see an inch before our eyes, but had to grope our way
feeling the pillars and the walls. It was difficult to breathe, and the Colonel
behind me made but slow progress, for the cramped position of our bodies was
very severe.
</p>

<p>
We had travelled in this way for ten minutes, and gone perhaps as much as ten
yards, when I lost my grasp of the doctor&rsquo;s heel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I heard his voice, sounding above me somewhere. He was
standing up in a clear space, and the next moment I was standing beside him.
Colonel Wragge came heavily after, and he too rose up and stood. Then Dr.
Silence produced his candles and we heard preparations for striking matches.
</p>

<p>
Yet even before there was light, an indefinable sensation of awe came over us
all. In this hole in the sand, some three feet under ground, we stood side by
side, cramped and huddled, struck suddenly with an over whelming apprehension
of something ancient, something formidable, something incalculably wonderful,
that touched in each one of us a sense of the sublime and the terrible even
before we could see an inch before our faces. I know not how to express in
language this singular emotion that caught us here in utter darkness, touching
no sense directly, it seemed, yet with the recognition that before us in the
blackness of this underground night there lay something that was mighty with
the mightiness of long past ages.
</p>

<p>
I felt Colonel Wragge press in closely to my side, and I understood the
pressure and welcomed it. No human touch, to me at least, has ever been more
eloquent.
</p>

<p>
Then the match flared, a thousand shadows fled on black wings, and I saw John
Silence fumbling with the candle, his face lit up grotesquely by the flickering
light below it.
</p>

<p>
I had dreaded this light, yet when it came there was apparently nothing to
explain the profound sensations of dread that preceded it. We stood in a small
vaulted chamber in the sand, the sides and roof shored with bars of wood, and
the ground laid roughly with what seemed to be tiles. It was six feet high, so
that we could all stand comfortably, and may have been ten feet long by eight
feet wide. Upon the wooden pillars at the side I saw that Egyptian
hieroglyphics had been rudely traced by burning.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence lit three candles and handed one to each of us. He placed a fourth
in the sand against the wall on his right, and another to mark the entrance to
the tunnel. We stood and stared about us, instinctively holding our breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Empty, by God!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Wragge. His voice trembled with
excitement. And then, as his eyes rested on the ground, he added, &ldquo;And
footsteps&mdash;look&mdash;footsteps in the sand!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Silence said nothing. He stooped down and began to make a search of the
chamber, and as he moved, my eyes followed his crouching figure and noted the
queer distorted shadows that poured over the walls and ceiling after him. Here
and there thin trickles of loose sand ran fizzing down the sides. The
atmosphere, heavily charged with faint yet pungent odours, lay utterly still,
and the flames of the candles might have been painted on the air for all the
movement they betrayed.
</p>

<p>
And, as I watched, it was almost necessary to persuade myself forcibly that I
was only standing upright with difficulty in this little sand-hole of a modern
garden in the south of England, for it seemed to me that I stood, as in vision,
at the entrance of some vast rock-hewn Temple far, far down the river of Time.
The illusion was powerful, and persisted. Granite columns, that rose to heaven,
piled themselves about me, majestically uprearing, and a roof like the sky
itself spread above a line of colossal figures that moved in shadowy procession
along endless and stupendous aisles. This huge and splendid fantasy, borne I
knew not whence, possessed me so vividly that I was actually obliged to
concentrate my attention upon the small stooping figure of the doctor, as he
groped about the walls, in order to keep the eye of imagination on the scene
before me.
</p>

<p>
But the limited space rendered a long search out of the question, and his
footsteps, instead of shuffling through loose sand, presently struck something
of a different quality that gave forth a hollow and resounding echo. He stooped
to examine more closely.
</p>

<p>
He was standing exactly in the centre of the little chamber when this happened,
and he at once began scraping away the sand with his feet. In less than a
minute a smooth surface became visible&mdash;the surface of a wooden covering.
The next thing I saw was that he had raised it and was peering down into a
space below. Instantly, a strong odour of nitre and bitumen, mingled with the
strange perfume of unknown and powdered aromatics, rose up from the uncovered
space and filled the vault, stinging the throat and making the eyes water and
smart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mummy!&rdquo; whispered Dr. Silence, looking up into our faces over
his candle; and as he said the word I felt the soldier lurch against me, and
heard his breathing in my very ear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mummy!&rdquo; he repeated under his breath, as we pressed forward to
look.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to say exactly why the sight should have stirred in me so
prodigious an emotion of wonder and veneration, for I have had not a little to
do with mummies, have unwound scores of them, and even experimented magically
with not a few. But there was something in the sight of that grey and silent
figure, lying in its modern box of lead and wood at the bottom of this sandy
grave, swathed in the bandages of centuries and wrapped in the perfumed linen
that the priests of Egypt had prayed over with their mighty enchantments
thousands of years before&mdash;something in the sight of it lying there and
breathing its own spice-laden atmosphere even in the darkness of its exile in
this remote land, something that pierced to the very core of my being and
touched that root of awe which slumbers in every man near the birth of tears
and the passion of true worship.
</p>

<p>
I remember turning quickly from the Colonel, lest he should see my emotion, yet
fail to understand its cause, turn and clutch John Silence by the arm, and then
fall trembling to see that he, too, had lowered his head and was hiding his
face in his hands.
</p>

<p>
A kind of whirling storm came over me, rising out of I know not what utter
deeps of memory, and in a whiteness of vision I heard the magical old
chauntings from the Book of the Dead, and saw the Gods pass by in dim
procession, the mighty, immemorial Beings who were yet themselves only the
personified attributes of the true Gods, the God with the Eyes of Fire, the God
with the Face of Smoke. I saw again Anubis, the dog-faced deity, and the
children of Horus, eternal watcher of the ages, as they swathed Osiris, the
first mummy of the world, in the scented and mystic bands, and I tasted again
something of the ecstasy of the justified soul as it embarked in the golden
Boat of Ra, and journeyed onwards to rest in the fields of the blessed.
</p>

<p>
And then, as Dr. Silence, with infinite reverence, stooped and touched the
still face, so dreadfully staring with its painted eyes, there rose again to
our nostrils wave upon wave of this perfume of thousands of years, and time
fled backwards like a thing of naught, showing me in haunted panorama the most
wonderful dream of the whole world.
</p>

<p>
A gentle hissing became audible in the air, and the doctor moved quickly
backwards. It came close to our faces and then seemed to play about the walls
and ceiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The last of the Fire&mdash;still waiting for its full
accomplishment,&rdquo; he muttered; but I heard both words and hissing as
things far away, for I was still busy with the journey of the soul through the
Seven Halls of Death, listening for echoes of the grandest ritual ever known to
men.
</p>

<p>
The earthen plates covered with hieroglyphics still lay beside the mummy, and
round it, carefully arranged at the points of the compass, stood the four jars
with the heads of the hawk, the jackal, the cynocephalus, and man, the jars in
which were placed the hair, the nail parings, the heart, and other special
portions of the body. Even the amulets, the mirror, the blue clay statues of
the Ka, and the lamp with seven wicks were there. Only the sacred scarabaeus
was missing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not only has it been torn from its ancient resting-place,&rdquo; I heard
Dr. Silence saying in a solemn voice as he looked at Colonel Wragge with fixed
gaze, &ldquo;but it has been partially unwound,&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to the
wrappings of the breast,&mdash;&ldquo;and&mdash;the scarabaeus has been removed
from the throat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hissing, that was like the hissing of an invisible flame, had ceased; only
from time to time we heard it as though it passed backwards and forwards in the
tunnel; and we stood looking into each other&rsquo;s faces without speaking.
</p>

<p>
Presently Colonel Wragge made a great effort and braced himself. I heard the
sound catch in his throat before the words actually became audible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; he said, very low. And then there followed a long
pause, broken at length by John Silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be replaced,&rdquo; he said significantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew nothing,&rdquo; the soldier said, forcing himself to speak the
words he hated saying. &ldquo;Absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be returned,&rdquo; repeated the other, &ldquo;if it is not now
too late. For I fear&mdash;I fear&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge made a movement of assent with his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It shall be,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
The place was still as the grave.
</p>

<p>
I do not know what it was then that made us all three turn round with so sudden
a start, for there was no sound audible to my ears, at least.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was on the point of replacing the lid over the mummy, when he
straightened up as if he had been shot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something coming,&rdquo; said Colonel Wragge under his
breath, and the doctor&rsquo;s eyes, peering down the small opening of the
tunnel, showed me the true direction.
</p>

<p>
A distant shuffling noise became distinctly audible coming from a point about
half-way down the tunnel we had so laboriously penetrated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sand falling in,&rdquo; I said, though I knew it was
foolish.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Colonel calmly, in a voice that seemed to have the
ring of iron, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it for some time past. It is something
alive&mdash;and it is coming nearer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stared about him with a look of resolution that made his face almost noble.
The horror in his heart was overmastering, yet he stood there prepared for
anything that might come.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way out,&rdquo; John Silence said.
</p>

<p>
He leaned the lid against the sand, and waited. I knew by the masklike
expression of his face, the pallor, and the steadiness of the eyes, that he
anticipated something that might be very terrible&mdash;appalling.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel and myself stood on either side of the opening. I still held my
candle and was ashamed of the way it shook, dripping the grease all over me;
but the soldier had set his into the sand just behind his feet.
</p>

<p>
Thoughts of being buried alive, of being smothered like rats in a trap, of
being caught and done to death by some invisible and merciless force we could
not grapple with, rushed into my mind. Then I thought of fire&mdash;of
suffocation&mdash;of being roasted alive. The perspiration began to pour from
my face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; came the voice of Dr. Silence to me through the vault.
</p>

<p>
For five minutes, that seemed fifty, we stood waiting, looking from each
other&rsquo;s faces to the mummy, and from the mummy to the hole, and all the
time the shuffling sound, soft and stealthy, came gradually nearer. The
tension, for me at least, was very near the breaking point when at last the
cause of the disturbance reached the edge. It was hidden for a moment just
behind the broken rim of soil. A jet of sand, shaken by the close vibration,
trickled down on to the ground; I have never in my life seen anything fall with
such laborious leisure. The next second, uttering a cry of curious quality, it
came into view.
</p>

<p>
And it was far more distressingly horrible than anything I had anticipated.
</p>

<p>
For the sight of some Egyptian monster, some god of the tombs, or even of some
demon of fire, I think I was already half prepared; but when, instead, I saw
the white visage of Miss Wragge framed in that round opening of sand, followed
by her body crawling on all fours, her eyes bulging and reflecting the yellow
glare of the candles, my first instinct was to turn and run like a frantic
animal seeking a way of escape.
</p>

<p>
But Dr. Silence, who seemed no whit surprised, caught my arm and steadied me,
and we both saw the Colonel then drop upon his knees and come thus to a level
with his sister. For more than a whole minute, as though struck in stone, the
two faces gazed silently at each other: hers, for all the dreadful emotion in
it, more like a gargoyle than anything human; and his, white and blank with an
expression that was beyond either astonishment or alarm. She looked up; he
looked down. It was a picture in a nightmare, and the candle, stuck in the sand
close to the hole, threw upon it the glare of impromptu footlights.
</p>

<p>
Then John Silence moved forward and spoke in a voice that was very low, yet
perfectly calm and natural.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you have come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are the one person
whose presence at this moment is most required. And I hope that you may yet be
in time to appease the anger of the Fire, and to bring peace again to your
household, and,&rdquo; he added lower still so that no one heard it but myself,
&ldquo;<i>safety to yourself</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And while her brother stumbled backwards, crushing a candle into the sand in
his awkwardness, the old lady crawled farther into the vaulted chamber and
slowly rose upon her feet.
</p>

<p>
At the sight of the wrapped figure of the mummy I was fully prepared to see her
scream and faint, but on the contrary, to my complete amazement, she merely
bowed her head and dropped quietly upon her knees. Then, after a pause of more
than a minute, she raised her eyes to the roof and her lips began to mutter as
in prayer. Her right hand, meanwhile, which had been fumbling for some time at
her throat suddenly came away, and before the gaze of all of us she held it
out, palm upwards, over the grey and ancient figure outstretched below. And in
it we beheld glistening the green jasper of the stolen scarabaeus.
</p>

<p>
Her brother, leaning heavily against the wall behind, uttered a sound that was
half cry, half exclamation, but John Silence, standing directly in front of
her, merely fixed his eyes on her and pointed downwards to the staring face
below.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Replace it,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;where it belongs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Wragge was kneeling at the feet of the mummy when this happened. We three
men all had our eyes riveted on what followed. Only the reader who by some
remote chance may have witnessed a line of mummies, freshly laid from their
tombs upon the sand, slowly stir and bend as the heat of the Egyptian sun warms
their ancient bodies into the semblance of life, can form any conception of the
ultimate horror we experienced when the silent figure before us moved in its
grave of lead and sand. Slowly, before our eyes, it writhed, and, with a faint
rustling of the immemorial cerements, rose up, and, through sightless and
bandaged eyes, stared across the yellow candlelight at the woman who had
violated it.
</p>

<p>
I tried to move&mdash;her brother tried to move&mdash;but the sand seemed to
hold our feet. I tried to cry&mdash;her brother tried to cry&mdash;but the sand
seemed to fill our lungs and throat. We could only stare&mdash;and, even so,
the sand seemed to rise like a desert storm and cloud our vision ...
</p>

<p>
And when I managed at length to open my eyes again, the mummy was lying once
more upon its back, motionless, the shrunken and painted face upturned towards
the ceiling, and the old lady had tumbled forward and was lying in the
semblance of death with her head and arms upon its crumbling body.
</p>

<p>
But upon the wrappings of the throat I saw the green jasper of the sacred
scarabaeus shining again like a living eye.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wragge and the doctor recovered themselves long before I did, and I
found myself helping them clumsily and unintelligently to raise the frail body
of the old lady, while John Silence carefully replaced the covering over the
grave and scraped back the sand with his foot, while he issued brief
directions.
</p>

<p>
I heard his voice as in a dream; but the journey back along that cramped
tunnel, weighted by a dead woman, blinded with sand, suffocated with heat, was
in no sense a dream. It took us the best part of half an hour to reach the open
air. And, even then, we had to wait a considerable time for the appearance of
Dr. Silence. We carried her undiscovered into the house and up to her own room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mummy will cause no further disturbance,&rdquo; I heard Dr. Silence
say to our host later that evening as we prepared to drive for the night train,
&ldquo;provided always,&rdquo; he added significantly, &ldquo;that you, and
yours, cause it no disturbance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was in a dream, too, that we left.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You did not see her face, I know,&rdquo; he said to me as we wrapped our
rugs about us in the empty compartment. And when I shook my head, quite unable
to explain the instinct that had come to me not to look, he turned toward me,
his face pale, and genuinely sad.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Scorched and blasted,&rdquo; he whispered.
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
