<h3>TO THE READER</h3>


<blockquote><i>For whatsoever worth or wit appears<br>
In this mixed record of five hectic years,<br>
This tale of heroes, heroines--and others--<br>
Thank first &quot;O. S.&quot; and then his band of brothers<br>
Who took their cue, with pencil and with pen,<br>
From the gay courage of our fighting men.<br>
Theirs be the praise, not his, who here supplies<br>
Merely the editorial hooks and eyes<br>
And, rich by proxy, prodigally spends<br>
The largess of his colleagues and his friends.</i>

<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<br>

<p>Though a lover of peace, Mr. Punch from his earliest
days has not been unfamiliar with war. He was born
during the Afghan campaign; in his youth England
fought side by side with the French in the Crimea; he saw
the old Queen bestow the first Victoria Crosses in 1857; he
was moved and stirred by the horrors and heroisms of the
Indian Mutiny. A little later on, when our relations with
France were strained by the Imperialism of Louis Napoleon,
he had witnessed the rise of the volunteer movement and made
merry with the activities of the citizen soldier of Brook Green.
Later on again he had watched, not without grave misgiving,
the growth of the great Prussian war machine which crushed
Denmark, overthrew Austria, and having isolated France,
overwhelmed her heroic resistance by superior numbers and
science, and stripped her of Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>In May, 1864, Mr. Punch presented the King of Prussia
with the &quot;Order of St. Gibbet&quot; for his treatment of Denmark.</p>

<p>In August of the same year he portrayed the brigands
dividing the spoil and Prussia grabbing the lion's share, thus
foreshadowing the inevitable conflict with Austria.</p>

<p>In the war of 1870-1 he showed France on her knees but
defying the new Caesar, and arraigned Bismarck before the
altar of Justice for demanding exorbitant securities.</p>

<p>And in 1873, when the German occupation was ended by
the payment of the indemnity, in a flash of prophetic vision
Mr. Punch pictured France, vanquished but unsubdued, bidding
her conqueror &quot;Au revoir.&quot;</p>

<h4>GAUL TO THE NEW C&AElig;SAR</h4>

<h4>&quot;Defiance, Emperor, while I have strength to hurl it!&quot;

<i>(Dec. 17, 1870)</i></h4>
<br><br>
<p>More than forty years followed, years of peace and prosperity
for Great Britain, only broken by the South African
war, the wounds of which were healed by a generous settlement.
But all the time Germany was preparing for &quot;The Day,&quot;
steadily perfecting her war machine, enlarging her armies,
creating a great fleet, and piling up colossal supplies of guns
and munitions, while her professors and historians, harnessed
to the car of militarism, inflamed the people against England
as the jealous enemy of Germany's legitimate expansion.
Abroad, like a great octopus, she was fastening the tentacles
of permeation and penetration in every corner of the globe,
honeycombing Russia and Belgium, France, England and
America with secret agents, spying and intriguing and abusing
our hospitality. For twenty-five years the Kaiser was our
frequent and honoured, if somewhat embarrassing, guest,
professing friendship for England and admiration of her ways,
shooting at Sandringham, competing at Cowes, sending telegrams
of congratulation to the University boat-race winners,
ingratiating himself with all he met by his social gifts, his
vivacious conversation, his prodigious versatility and energy.</p>

<h4>THE REWARD OF (DE)MERIT<br>

King Punch presenteth Prussia with the Order of &quot;St. Gibbet.&quot;<br>

(<i>May 7</i>, 1864)</h4>
<br><br>

<p>Mr. Punch was no enemy of Germany. He remembered--none
better--the debt we owe to her learning and her art;
to Bach and Beethoven, to Handel, the &quot;dear Saxon&quot; who
adopted our citizenship; to Mendelssohn, who regarded
England as his second home; to her fairy tales and folk-lore;
to the Brothers Grimm and the <i>Struwwelpeter</i>; to the old kindly
Germany which has been driven mad by War Lords and Pan-Germans.
If Mr. Punch's awakening was gradual he at least
recognised the dangerous elements in the Kaiser's character
as far back as October, 1888, when he underlined Bismarck's
warning against Caesarism. In March, 1890, appeared
Tenniel's famous cartoon &quot;Dropping the Pilot&quot;; in May of
the same year the Kaiser appears as the <i>Enfant Terrible</i> of
Europe, rocking the boat and alarming his fellow-rulers. In
January, 1892, he is the Imperial Jack-in-the-Box with a finger
in every pie; in March, 1892, the modern Alexander, who</p>

<blockquote>Assumes the God,<br>
Affects to nod,<br>
And seems to shake the spheres;<br></blockquote>

<p>though unfortunately never nodding in the way that Homer
did. (This cartoon, by the way, caused <i>Punch</i> to be excluded
for a while from the Imperial Palace.)</p>

<p>In February, 1896, Mr. Punch drew the Kaiser as Fidgety
Will. In January, 1897, he was the Imperial actor-manager
casting himself for a leading part in <i>Un Voyage en Chine</i>; in
October of the same year he was &quot;Cook's Crusader,&quot; sympathising
with the Turk at the time of the Cretan ultimatum;
and in April, 1903, the famous visit to Tangier suggested the
Moor of Potsdam wooing Morocco to the strains of</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Unter den Linden&quot;--always at Home,<br>
&quot;Under the Limelight,&quot; wherever I roam.<br></blockquote>

<br>
GERMANY: &quot;Farewell, Madam, and if--&quot;<br>

FRANCE: &quot;Ha! We shall meet again!&quot;<br>

(<i>Sept. 27, 1873.</i>)</h4>
<br><br>
<p>In 1905 the Kaiser was &quot;The Sower of Tares,&quot; the enemy
of Europe.</p>

<p>In 1910 he was Teutonising and Prussifying Turkey; in
1911 discovering to his discomfort that the Triple Entente was
a solid fact.</p>

<p>And in September, 1913, he was shown as unable to dissemble
his disappointment at the defeat of the German-trained
Turkish army by the Balkan League.</p>

<br>

He <i>won't</i> sit still.&quot;<br>

Just like any bucking horse.<br>

<br><br>
<p>So, too, with Turkey. From 1876 to 1913 Mr. Punch's
cartoons on the Near East are one continuous and illuminating
commentary on Lord Salisbury's historic admission that we
had &quot;backed the wrong horse,&quot; culminating in the cartoon
&quot;Armageddon: a Diversion&quot; in December, 1912, when Turkey
says &quot;Good! If only all these other Christian nations get at
one another's throats I may have a dog's chance yet.&quot;
Throughout the entire series the Sick Man remains cynical
and impenitent, blowing endless bubble-promises of reform
from his hookah, bullying and massacring his subject races
whenever he had the chance, playing off the jealousies of the
Powers, one against the other, to further his own sinister ends.</p>

<h4>SOLID<br>
<br>
GERMANY: &quot;Donnerwetter! It's rock. I thought it was
going to be paper.&quot; (<i>Aug. 2, 1911</i>)</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Yet Mr. Punch does not wish to lay claim to any special
prescience or wisdom, for, in spite of lucid intervals of foresight,
we were all deceived by Germany. Nearly fifty years
of peace had blinded us to fifty years of relentless preparation
for war. But if we were deceived by the treachery of Germany's
false professions, we had no monopoly of illusion. Germany
made the huge mistake of believing that we would stand out--that
we dared not support France in face of our troubles
and divisions at home. She counted on the pacific influences
in a Liberal Cabinet, on the looseness of the ties which bound
us to our Dominions, on the &quot;contemptible&quot; numbers of our
Expeditionary Force, on the surrender of Belgium. She had
willed the War; the tragedy of Sarajevo gave her the excuse.
There is no longer any need to fix the responsibility. The
roots of the world conflict which seemed obscure to a neutral
statesman have long been laid bare by the avowals of the
chief criminal. The story is told in the Memoir of Prince
Lichnowsky, in the revelations of Dr. Muehlon of Krupp's,
in the official correspondence that has come to light since the
Revolution of Berlin. Germany stands before the bar of
civilisation as the <i>reus confitens</i> in the cause of light against
darkness, freedom against world enslavement.</p>

<p>So the War began, and if &quot;when war begins then hell
opens,&quot; the saying gained a tenfold truth in the greatest War
of all, when the aggressor at once began to wage it on non-combatants,
on the helpless and innocent, on women and
children, with a cold and deliberate ferocity unparalleled in
history. Let it now be frankly owned that in the shock of this
discovery Mr. Punch thought seriously of putting up his
shutters. How could he carry on in a shattered and mourning
world? The chronicle that follows shows how it became
possible, thanks to the temper of all our people in all parts of
the Empire, above all to the unwavering confidence of our
sailors and soldiers, to that &quot;wonderful spirit of light-heartedness,
that perpetual sense of the ridiculous&quot; which, in the words
of one of Mr. Punch's many contributors from the front,
&quot;even under the most appalling conditions never seemed to
desert them, and which indeed seemed to flourish more freely
m the mud and rain of the front line trenches than in the
comparative comfort of billets or 'cushy jobs.'&quot; Tommy gave
Mr. Punch his cue, and his high example was not thrown
away on those at home, where, when all allowance is made for
shirkers and slackers and scaremongers, callous pleasure-seekers,
faint-hearted pacificists, rebels and traitors, the great
majority so bore themselves as to convince Mr. Punch that it
was not only a privilege but a duty to minister to mirth even
at times when one hastened to laugh for fear of being obliged
to weep. In this resolve he was fortified and encouraged, week
after week, by the generous recognition of his efforts which
came from all parts of our far-flung line.</p>

<p>This is no formal History of the War in the strict or scientific
sense of the phrase; no detailed record of naval and military
operations. There have been many occasions on which silence
or reticence seemed the only way to maintain the national composure.
It is <i>Mr. Punch's</i> History of the Great War, a mirror
of varying moods, month by month, but reflecting in the main
how England remained steadfastly true to her best traditions;
how all sorts and conditions of men and women comported
themselves throughout the greatest ordeal that had ever
befallen their race.</p>




<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>
<h2>Mr. PUNCH'S HISTORY of the GREAT WAR</h2>
<br>

<h2><i><a name="August,_1914."></a>August, 1914.</i></h2>

<p>Four weeks ago we stood on the verge of the great upheaval
and knew it not. We were thinking of holidays;
of cricket and golf and bathing, and then were suddenly
plunged in the deep waters of the greatest of all Wars. It has
been a month of rude awakening, of revelation, of discovery--of
many moods varying from confidence to deep misgiving, yet
dominated by a sense of relief that England has chosen the right
course. <a name="Sir_Edward_Grey's_statement"></a>Sir Edward Grey's statement that we meant to stand by
France and fulfil our obligations to Belgium rallied all parties.
&quot;Thrice armed is he that hath his quarrel just.&quot; The Fleet
&quot;stands fast&quot; and the vigil of the North Sea has begun.<a name="War_Office"></a> Lord
Kitchener has gone to the War Office, and in twelve days
from the declaration of War <a name="our_Expeditionary_Force"></a>our Expeditionary Force, the
best trained and equipped army that England has ever put
into the field, landed in France. The Dominions and India
are staunch. Every able-bodied public school boy and under-graduate
of military age has joined the colours. The Admiralty
is crowded with living counterparts of Captain Kettle, offering
their services in any capacity, linking up the Merchant Marine
with the Royal Navy in one great solidarity of the sea.</p>

<p>The Empire is sound and united. So far the omens are
good. But as the days pass the colossal task of the Allies
becomes increasingly apparent. <a name="armies_of_spies"></a>Peace-loving nations are confronted
by a Power which has prepared for war for forty years,
equipped in every detail as no Power has ever been equipped
before, with a docile and well-disciplined people trained to arms,
fortified by a well-founded belief in their invincibility, reinforced
by armies of spies in every country, hostile or neutral. We
are up against the mightiest War-machine of all time, wonderful
in organisation, joining the savagery of the barbarian to the
deadliest resources of modern science. The revelation of the
black soul of Germany is the greatest and the most hideous
surprise of this month of months, crowning long years of
treachery and the abuse of hospitality with an orgy of butchery
and devastation--the torture and massacre of old men, women
and children, the shooting of hostages, the sack and burning
of towns and the destruction of ancient seats of learning. Yet
we feel that in trampling upon <a name="heroic_Belgium"></a>heroic Belgium, who dared to
bar the gate, Germany has outraged the conscience of the world
and sealed her ultimate doom.</p>

<p>The month closes in gloom, the <a name="fall_of_Li&eacute;ge"></a>fall of Li&eacute;ge, Namur and
<a name="Brussels"></a>Brussels, the sack of Louvain, and the repulse of the Russian
raid into East Prussia at Tannenberg following in rapid succession.
Against these disasters we have to set the brilliant
engagement in the <a name="Heligoland_Bight"></a>Heligoland Bight. But the onrush of the
Germans on the Western front is not stayed, though their time-table
has been thrown out by the self-sacrifice of the Belgians,
the steadfast courage of <a name="French's_&quot;contemptible_little_army&quot;"></a>French's &quot;contemptible little army&quot;
in the retreat from Mons, and the bold decision of Smith-Dorrien,
who saved the situation at Le Cateau. In these days
of apprehension and misgiving, clouded by alarming rumours
of a broken and annihilated army, it sometimes seems as though
we should never smile again. Where, in a world of blood and
tears, can <i>Punch</i> exercise his function without outraging the
fitness of things? These doubts have been with us from the
beginning, but they are already being resolved by the discovery--another
of the wonders of the time--that on the very fringes
of tragedy there is room for cheerfulness. When our fighting
men refuse to be downhearted in the direst peril, we at home
should follow their high example, note where we can the
humours of the fray, and &quot;bear in silence though our hearts
may bleed.&quot;</p>

<h4>MEDICAL OFFICER: &quot;Sorry I must reject you on account of your teeth.&quot;<br>

WOULD-BE-RECRUIT: &quot;Man, ye're making a gran' mistake. I'm no wanting
to bite the Germans, I'm wanting to shoot 'em.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Germany in one brief month has given us a wonderful
exhibition of conscienceless strength, of disciplined ferocity.
She has shown an equally amazing failure to read the character
of her foes aright. We now know what German Kultur
means: but of the soul and spirit of England she knows nothing.
Least of all does she understand that formidable and incorrigible
levity which refuses to take hard knocks seriously. It will
be our privilege to assist in educating our enemies on these
and other points, even though, as Lord Kitchener thinks,
it takes three years to do it. The Mad Dog of Europe is
loose, but we remember the fate of the dog who &quot;to serve
some private ends went mad and bit the man.&quot; &quot;The man
recovered from his bite, the dog it was that died.&quot; Meanwhile
the Official Press Bureau has begun its operations, the Prince
of Wales's <a name="Relief_Fun"></a>Relief Fund for the relief of those who may suffer
distress through the war is started, and in the City</p>

<blockquote>Because beneath grey Northern Skies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some grey hulls heave and fall,<br>
The merchants sell their merchandise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All just as usual.<br>
<br></blockquote>
<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>

<h2><i><a name="September,_1914."></a>September, 1914.</i></h2>

<p>Another month of revelations and reticences, of carnage
and destruction, loss and gain, with the miracle of the
Marne as the first great sign of the turning of the tide.
On September 3 the <a name="Paris_Government_moved_to_Bordeaux"></a>Paris Government moved to Bordeaux,
on the 5th the retreat from Mons ended, on the 13th <a name="Joffre"></a>Joffre,
always unboastful and laconic, announced the rolling back of
the invaders, on the 15th the <a name="battle_of_the_Aisne"></a>battle of the Aisne had begun.
What an Iliad of agony, endurance and heroism lies behind
these dates--the ordeal and deliverance of Paris, the steadfastness
of the &quot;Contemptibles,&quot; the martyrdom of Belgium!</p>

<p>Day by day Germany unmasks herself more clearly in her
true colours from highest to lowest. The Kaiser reveals himself
as a <a name="blasphemer_and_hypocrite"></a>blasphemer and hypocrite, the Imperial crocodile with
the bleeding heart, the Crown Prince as a<a name="common_brigand"></a> common brigand,
the High Command as chief instigators to ferocity<a name="Belgium_women"></a>, the rank
and file as docile instruments of butchery and torture, content
to use Belgium women as a screen when going into action.</p>

<blockquote><a name="THE_TWO_GERMANIES"></a>THE TWO GERMANIES<br>
<br>
Marvellous the utter transformation<br>
Of the spirit of the German nation!<br>
<br>
Once the land of poets, seers and sages,<br>

<a name="Footnote_A"></a><a href="#FNanchorA">[A]</a> Great play is made in Strauss's <i>Elektra</i> with the &quot;slippery blood&quot; motive.

<p>The <a name="campaign_of_lies"></a>campaign of lies goes on with immense energy in all
neutral countries, for the Kaiser is evidently of opinion that
the pen is perhaps mightier than the sword.</p>

<p>At home the great improvisation of the New Armies, undertaken
by Lord Kitchener in the teeth of much expert criticism,
goes steadily on. <a name="500,000_men"></a>Lord Kitchener asked for 500,000 men,
and he has got them. On September 10 the House voted
another half million. The open spaces in <a name="Hyde_Park"></a>Hyde Park are
given over to training;<a name="place_of_men"></a> women are beginning to take the
place of men. Already the spirit of the new soldiers is
growing akin to that of the regulars. One of Mr. Punch's
brigade, who has begun to send his impressions of the
<a name="mobilised_Territorials"></a>mobilised Territorials, sums it up very well when he says that, amateurs
or professionals, they are all very much alike. &quot;Feed them
like princes and pamper them like babies, and they'll complain
all the time. But stand them up to be shot at and they'll take
it as a joke, and rather a good joke, too.&quot; <a name="dignified_reticence"></a>Lord Roberts
maintains a dignified reticence, but that is &quot;Bobs' way&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>He knew, none better, how 'twould be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And spoke his warning far and wide:<br>
He worked to save us ceaselessly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting his well-earned ease aside.<br>
<br>
We smiled and shrugged and went our way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to the swift approaching blow:<br>
His every word proves true to-day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But no man hears, &quot;I told you so!&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile <a name="General_Botha"></a>General Botha, Boer and Briton too, is on the
war-path, and we can, without an undue stretch of imagination,
picture him composing a telegram to the Kaiser in these terms:
&quot;Just off to repel another raid. Your customary wire of congratulations
should be addressed, 'British Headquarters, German
South-West Africa.'&quot;</p>

<p><a name="The_rigours_of_the_Censorshi"></a>The rigours of the Censorship are pressing hard on war
correspondents. Official news of importance trickles in in
driblets: for the rest, newspaper men, miles from the front,
are driven to eke out their dispatches with negligible trivialities.
We know that <a name="Rheims_Cathedral"></a>Rheims Cathedral is suffering wanton bombardment.
And a great many of us believe that at least a quarter
of a million Russians have passed through England on their
way to France. The number of people who have seen them
is large: that of those who have seen people who have seen
them is enormous.</p>

sir, if this don't prove it, I don't know what do. A train went through here
full, and when it came back I knowed there'd been Rooshuns in it, 'cause the
cushions and floors was covered with snow.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>We gather that the Press Bureau has no notion whether
the rumour is true or not, and cannot think of any way of
finding out. But it consents to its publication in the hope
that it will frighten the Kaiser. Apropos of the Russians we
learn that they have won a pronounced victory (though not
by us) at Przemysl.</p>

the fall of Nancy, the drive for the Channel ports has
begun at Ypres,<a name="battleships"></a> and German submarines have retorted to Mr.
Churchill's threat to &quot;dig out&quot; the German Fleet &quot;like rats&quot;
by torpedoing three battleships. <a name="Trench_warfare"></a>Trench warfare is in full and
deadly swing, but &quot;Thomas of the light heart&quot; refuses to be
downhearted:</p>

<blockquote>He takes to fighting as a game,<br>
He does no talking through his hat<br>
Of holy missions: all the same<br>
He has his faith--be sure of that:<br>
He'll not disgrace his sporting breed<br>
Nor play what isn't cricket. There's his creed.<br></blockquote>

<p><a name="Terriers"></a>Last month Lord Kitchener paid a high tribute to the
growing efficiency of the &quot;Terriers&quot; and their readiness to go
anywhere. <i>Punch's</i> representative with the &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;
fully bears out this praise. They have been inoculated and
are ready to move on. Some suggest India, others Egypt.
&quot;But what tempted the majority was the thought of a season's
shooting without having to pay for so much as a gun licence,
and so we decided for the Continent.&quot;</p>

<p>News from the front continues scanty, and Joffre's laconic
<i>communiqu&eacute;s</i> might in sum be versified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>On our left wing the state of things remains<br>
Unaltered on a general review,<br>
Our losses in the centre match our gains,<br>
And on our right wing there is nothing new.<br></blockquote>

<p>Nor do we gain much enlightenment from the &quot;Eyewitness&quot;
with G.H.Q., though his literary skill in elegantly
describing the things that do not matter moves our admiration.</p>

<p>The Kaiser's sons continue to distinguish themselves as first-class
looters, and the ban laid on the English language, including
very properly the word &quot;gentleman,&quot; has been lifted
in favour of Wilhelm Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The prophets are no longer so optimistic in predicting
when the War will end. One of Mr. Punch's young men

arrived at Templemore, co. Tipperary. It's a long, long way,
but they've got there at last.</p>

<p>The miracle of the Marne has been followed by another
miracle--that of Ypres. Outgunned and outnumbered,
our thin line has <a name="stemmed_the_rush"></a>stemmed the rush to the sea.</p>

<p>The road to Calais has been blocked like that to Paris.
<a name="Tsing-tau"></a>Heartening news comes from afar of the fall of Tsing-tau before
our redoubtable Japanese allies, and with it the crumbling of
Germany's scheme of an Oriental Empire; of the British occupation
of Basra; and of the <a name="sinking_of_the_Emden"></a>sinking of the <i>Emden</i>, thanks to
the &quot;good hunting&quot; of the <i>Sydney</i>--the first fruits of Australian

has its consolations. It is something to be rid of an &quot;unspeakable&quot;

account at the expense of her subject nationalities: in all
respects a fitting partner for her ally and master.</p>

off Coronel is less than our pride in the spirit of the heroic

does the Army from the <a name="death_of_Lord_Roberts"></a>death of Lord Roberts, the &quot;happy

<p><a name="reluctant_tribute"></a>Even the Germans have paid reluctant tribute to one who,
as Bonar Law said in the House, &quot;was in real life all, and
more than all, that Colonel Newcome was in fiction.&quot; He was
the exemplar <i>in excelsis</i> of those &quot;bantams,&quot; &quot;little and good,&quot;
who, after being rejected for their diminutive stature, are now
joining up under the new regulations:</p>

<p>We have begun to think in millions. The war is costing
a million a day. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has launched
a <a name="war_loan_of_230"></a>war loan of 230 millions and doubled our income tax. The
Prime Minister asks for an addition of a million men to the
Regular Army. But the country has not yet fully awakened
to the realities of war. Football clubs are concerned with the
&quot;jostling of the ordinary patrons&quot; by men in uniform. &quot;Business
as usual&quot; is interpreted as &quot;pleasure as usual&quot; in some
quarters. Rumour is busy with stories of mysterious prisoners
in the Tower, with tales of huge guns which are to shell us
from Calais when the Germans get there; with reports (from
neutral sources) of the speedy advent of scores of Zeppelins
and hundreds of aeroplanes over London. But though</p>

<p>It is otherwise with Belgium, with its shattered homes and wrecked
towns. The great Russian legend is still going strong, in spite of the
statements of the Under-Secretary for War, and, after all, why should
the Germans do all the story telling? By the way, a &quot;<a name="German_Truth_Society"></a>German Truth Society&quot;
has been founded. It is pleasant to know that it is
realised over there at last that there is a difference between Truth and
German Truth. The British Navy, we learn from the <i>K&ouml;lnische
Zeitung</i>, &quot;is in hiding.&quot; But our fragrant contemporary need
not worry. In due course the Germans shall have the hiding.</p>

<p>In some ways the unchanged spirit of our people is rather
disconcerting. One of Mr. Punch's young men, happening
to meet a music-hall acquaintance, asked him how he thought
the war was going, and met with the answer: &quot;Oh, I think
the managers will have to give in.&quot; And the proposal to
change the name of Berlin Road at Lewisham has been rejected
by the residents.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Austria's &quot;punitive expedition&quot; has ended in disaster for
the Austrians. They entered Belgrade on the 2nd, and were
<a name="driven_out"></a>driven out twelve days later by the Serbs. King George has
paid his first <a name="visit_to_the_front"></a>visit to the front, and made General Foch a
<a name="G.C.B"></a>G.C.B. We know that the General is a great authority on
strategy, and that his name, correctly pronounced, rhymes
with Boche, as hero with Nero. He is evidently a man likely
to be heard of again. Another hitherto unfamiliar name that
has cropped up is that of Herr <a name="Lissauer"></a>Lissauer, who, for writing a
&quot;Hymn of Hate&quot; against England, has been decorated by the
Kaiser. This shows true magnanimity on the part of the
Kaiser, in his capacity of King of Prussia, since the &quot;Hymn
of Hate&quot; turns out to be a close adaptation of a poem composed
by a Saxon patriot, in which Prussia, not England, was held
up to execration.</p>

<p>Kitchener's great improvisation is already bearing fruit, and
the New Armies are flocking to the support of the old. <a name="Indian_troops"></a>Indian troops
are fighting gallantly in three continents. King Albert
&quot;the unconquerable,&quot; in the narrow strip of his country that
still belongs to him, waits in unshaken faith for the coming
of the dawn. And as Christmas draws on the thoughts of
officers and men in the waterlogged trenches turn fondly homeward
to mothers, wives and sweethearts:</p>

<blockquote>Cheer up! I'm calling far away;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wireless you can hear.<br>
Cheer up! You know you'd have me stay<br>
And keep on trying day by day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We're winning, never fear.<br></blockquote>

<p>Christmas at least brings the children's truce, and that is something
to be thankful for, but it is not the Christmas that we
knew and long for:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the dull earth is stained with red,<br>
Fearless she fronts the gates of Hell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shields the unforgotten dead.<br>

<p>Yet we have our minor war gains in the temporary disappearance
of cranks and faddists, some of whom have sunk
without a ripple. And though the Press Censor's suppressions
and delays and inconsistencies provoke discontent in the House
and out of it, food for mirth turns up constantly in unexpected
quarters. The Crown Prince tells an American interviewer
that there is no War Party in Germany, nor has there ever been.
The <a name="German_General_Staff"></a>German General Staff have begun to disguise set-backs
under the convenient euphemism that the situation has
developed &quot;according to expectation.&quot; An <a name="English_village"></a>English village
worthy, discussing the prospects of invasion, comes to the
reassuring conclusion that &quot;there can't be no battle in these
parts, Jarge, for there bain't no field suitable, as you may say;
an' Squire, 'e won't lend 'em the use of 'is park.&quot; The troubles
of neutrality are neatly summed up in a paper in a recent
geography examination. &quot;Holland is a low country, in fact
it is such a very low country that it is no wonder that it is
dammed all round.&quot;</p>

not receded into its true perspective; shirkers are more

<p>Germany, says the <i>Cologne Gazette</i> in an article on the
food question, &quot;has still at hand a very large supply of pigs&quot;--even
after the enormous number she has exported to Belgium.
Germany, however, does not only export pigs; her trade in
&quot;canards&quot; with neutrals grows and grows, chiefly with the
United States, thanks to the <a name="untiring_mendacity_of_Bernstorff"></a>untiring mendacity of Bernstorff

<p>As the British armies increase, the moustache of the British
officer, one of the most astonishing products of these
astonishing times, grows &quot;small by degrees and beautifully
less.&quot; Waxed ends, fashionable in a previous generation, are
now only worn by policemen, taxi-drivers and labour leaders.
The Kaiser remains faithful to the Mephistophelean form. But
in proof of his desire to make the best of both worlds, nether and
celestial, he continues to commandeer &quot;Gott&quot; on every occasion
as his second in command. <a name="Out-Heroding_Herod"></a>Out-Heroding Herod as a murderer

the mixture of &quot;cook's son and duke's son&quot; fifteen years ago.
The old Universities are now given up to a handful of coloured

however, a Swansea clergyman and football enthusiast has held
a &quot;thanksgiving service for their good fortune against Newcastle
United.&quot;<a name="Waterloo_campaign"></a> Meanwhile, the Under-Secretary for War has stated
that the army costs more in a week than the total estimates for
the Waterloo campaign, and that <a name="our_casualties"></a>our casualties on the Western

submarine losses, ubiquitous German spies, the German propaganda

grouses of course, but then he complains far more of the loss

than of the loss of a limb.</p>

<p>Germany's attitude towards the United States tempers the
blandishments of the serenader with the occasional discharge
of half-bricks. There is no such inconsistency in the expression
of her feelings about England. Articles entitled &quot;<i>Unser Hass
gegen England</i> &quot; constantly appear in the German Press, and
people are beginning to wonder whether the <i>Hass</i> is not the
Kaiser. Apropos of newspapers, we are beginning to harbour
a certain envy of the Americans. Even their provincial organs
often contain important and cheering news of the doings of
the British Army many days before the Censor releases the
information in England. <a name="Daylight_saving"></a>Daylight saving is again being talked
of, and it would surely be an enormous boon to rush the
measure through now so that the Germans may have less
darkness of which to take advantage. And there is a general
and reasonable feeling that more use should be made of bands
for recruiting. The ways of German musicians are perplexing.
Here is the amiable Herr Humperdinck, composer of &quot;H&auml;nsel

<p>A new and possibly momentous chapter has opened in
the history of the War by the attempt to force the
Dardanelles. At the end of February the Allied Fleet
bombarded the forts at the entrance, and landed a party of
bluejackets. Since then these naval operations have been
resumed, and our new crack battleship <i><a name="Queen_Elizabeth"></a>Queen Elizabeth</i> has
joined in the attack.<a name="Narrows"></a> We have not got through the Narrows,
and some sceptical critics are asking what we should do if we
got through to Constantinople, without a land force.<a name="Dardanelson"></a> It is a
great scheme, if it comes off; and the &quot;only begetter&quot; of it,
if report is true, is Mr. Winston Churchill, the strategist of the
Antwerp expedition, who now aspires to be the Dardanelson
of our age. Anyhow, the Sultan, lured on by the Imperial
William o' the Wisp, is already capable of envying even his
predecessor:</p>

<blockquote>Abdul! I would that I had shared your plight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Europe seen my heels,<br>
Before the hour when Allah bound me tight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To WILLIAM'S chariot-wheels!<br></blockquote>

<p>Germany, always generous with other people's property,
has begun to <a name="hint_to_Italy"></a>hint to Italy possibilities of compensation in the
shape of certain portions of Austro-Hungarian territory. She
has also declared that she is &quot;fighting for the independence of
the small nations,&quot; including, of course, Belgium. In further
evidence of her humanity she has taken to <a name="spraying_our_soldiers"></a>spraying our soldiers
in the West with flaming petrol and squirting boiling pitch over
our Russian allies. It is positively a desecration of the word
devil to apply it to the Germans whether on land, on or under
water, or in the air.</p>

<p>We have begun to &quot;push&quot; on the Western front, and
<a name="Neuve_Chapelle_captured"></a>Neuve Chapelle has been captured, after a fierce battle and at terrible
cost. Air raids are becoming common in <a name="East_Anglia"></a>East Anglia and
U-boats unpleasantly active in the North Sea. <a name="mine-sweepers"></a>Let us take
off our hats to the mine-sweepers and trawlers, the new and
splendid auxiliaries of the Royal Navy. <a name="Grimsby"></a>Grimsby is indeed a
&quot;name to resound for ages&quot; for what its fishermen have done
and are doing in the war against mine and submarine:</p>

<blockquote>Soles in the Silver Pit--an' there we'll let 'em lie;<br>
Cod on the Dogger--oh, we'll fetch 'em by an' by;<br>
War on the water--an' it's time to serve an' die,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For there's wild work doin' on the North Sea ground.<br>
An' it's &quot;Wake up, Johnnie!&quot; they want you at the trawlin'<br>
(With your long sea-boots and your tarry old tarpaulin);<br>
All across the bitter seas duty comes a-callin'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Winter's weather off the North Sea ground.<br>
It's well we've learned to laugh at fear--the sea has taught us how;<br>
It's well we've shaken hands with death--we'll not be strangers now,<br>
With death in every climbin' wave before the trawler's bow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An' the black spawn swimmin' on the North Sea ground.<br></blockquote>

<p>These brave men and their heroic brothers in the trenches
are true sportsmen as well as patriots, not those who interpret
the need of lightheartedness by the cult of &quot;sport as usual&quot; on
the football field and the racecourse. And the example of the
Universities shines with the same splendour.<a name="O.T.C."></a> Of the scanty
remnant that remain at Oxford and Cambridge all the physically
fit have joined the O.T.C. <a name="Boat-race_day"></a>Boat-race day has passed, but the
crews are gone to &quot;keep it long&quot; and &quot;pull it through&quot;
elsewhere:</p>

<p><a name="St._James's_Park"></a>London changes daily. The sight of the female Jehu

<p><a name="Spy-hunting"></a>Spy-hunting is prevalent in East Anglia, but the amateurs
have not achieved any convincing results. Spring poets are
suffering from suspended animation; there is a slump in
crocuses, snowdrops, daffodils and lambkins. Their &quot;musings
always turn away to men who're arming for the fray.&quot; The
clarion and the fife have ousted the pastoral ode. And our
military and naval experts, harassed by the Censor, take refuge
in psychology.</p>

<p>The <i><a name="K&ouml;lnische_Zeitung"></a>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i> has published a whole article on
&quot;Mr. Punch.&quot; The writer, a Herr Professor, finds our cartoons
lacking in &quot;modest refinement.&quot; Indeed, he goes so far as to
say that the treatment of the Kaiser savours of blasphemy.
One is so apt to forget that the Kaiser is a divinity, so prone
to remember that Luther wrote, &quot;We Germans are Germans,
and Germans we will remain--that is to say, pigs and brutish
animals.&quot; This was written in 1528: but &quot;the example of the
Middle Ages&quot; is held up to-day by German leaders as the true
fount of inspiration.</p>

<h2><a name="April,_1915."></a><i>April, 1915</i>.</h2>

<p>A hundred years ago <a name="Bismarck"></a>Bismarck was born on April 1,
the man who built with blood and iron, but now only
the blood remains. Yet one may doubt whether even
that strong and ruthless pilot would have commended the
submarine crew who sank the <a name="liner_Falaba"></a>liner <i>Falaba</i> and laughed at the
cries and struggles of drowning men and women. Sooner or
later these crews are doomed to die the death of rats:</p>

<blockquote>But you, who sent them out to do this shame;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From whom they take their orders and their pay;<br>
For you--avenging wrath defers its claim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Justice bides her day.<br></blockquote>

<p>The tide of &quot;<a name="frightfulness"></a>frightfulness&quot; rolls strong on land as on sea.
The <a name="second_battle_of_Ypres"></a>second battle of Ypres has begun and the enemy has
resorted to the use of a new weapon--poison gas. He had
already <a name="poisoned_wells"></a>poisoned wells in South West Africa, but this is an
uglier outcome of the harnessing of science to the Powers of
Darkness. Italy grows restive in spite of the blandishments
of Prince B&uuml;low, and as the month closes we hear of the landing
of the <a name="Allies_in_Gallipoli"></a>Allies in Gallipoli, just two months after the unsupported
naval attempt to force the Dardanelles. British and Australian
and New Zealand troops have achieved the impossible by
incredible valour in face of murderous fire, and a foothold has
been won at tremendous cost of heroic lives. Letters from the
Western front continue cheerful, but it does not need much
reading between the lines to realise the odds with which our
officers and men have to contend, the endless discomfort and
unending din. They are masters of a gallant art of metaphor
which belittles the most appalling horrors of trench warfare;
masters, too, of the art of extracting humorous relief from the
most trivial incidents.</p>

<p>On the home front we have to contend with a dangerous
ally of the <a name="enemy_in_Drink"></a>enemy in Drink, and with the self-advertising
politicians who do their bit by asking unnecessary questions.
Sometimes, but rarely, they succeed in eliciting valuable information,
as in Mr. Lloyd George's statement on the situation
at the front. We have now six times as many men in the field
as formed the original Expeditionary Force, and in the few
days fighting round <a name="Neuve_Chapelle"></a>Neuve Chapelle almost as much ammunition
was expended by our guns as in the whole of the two and
three-quarter years of the Boer War.</p>

<p>The Kaiser has been presented with <a name="another_grandson"></a>another grandson, but

<p>We often think that we must have got to the end of German
&quot;frightfulness,&quot; only to have our illusions promptly shattered
by some fresh and amazing explosion of calculated ferocity. Last month
it was poison gas; now it is the <a name="sinking_of_the_Lusitania"></a>
sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>. Yet Mr.
Punch had read the omens some seven and a half years ago, when the
records established by that liner had created a jealousy in Germany
which the Kaiser and his agents have now appeased, but at what a cost!
The House of Commons is an odd place, unique in its <a name="characteristics"></a>characteristics.
Looking round the benches when it reassembled on May 10th, and noting
the tone and purport of the inquiries addressed to the First Lord, one
might well suppose that nothing remarkable had happened since Parliament
adjourned. The questions were numerous but all practical, and as
unemotional as if they referred to outrages by a newly-discovered race
of fiends in human shape peopling Mars or Saturn. The First Lord,
equally undemonstrative, announced that the Board of Trade have ordered
an inquiry into the circumstances attending the disaster. Pending the
result, it would be premature to discuss the matter. Here we have the
sublimation of officialism and national phlegm. Of the 1,200 victims who
went down in this unarmed passenger ship about 200 were Americans. What
will America say or do?</p>

SCENE: The Ramparts of the White House.<br>

PRESIDENT WILSON: &quot;The time is out of joint, O cursed spite,<br>
                   That ever I was born to set it right!&quot;<br>

VOICE OF ROOSEVELT (<i>off</i>): &quot;That's so!&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<blockquote>In silence you have looked on felon blows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On butcher's work of which the waste lands reek!<br>
Now in God's name, from Whom your greatness flows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister, will you not speak?<br></blockquote>

<p>Many unofficial voices have been raised in horror, indignation,
and even in loud calls for intervention. The leaven works,
but <a name="President_Wilson_lusitania"></a>President Wilson, though not unmoved, gives little sign
of abandoning his philosophic neutrality.</p>

<p>In Europe it is otherwise. <a name="Italy_has_declared_war_on_Austria"></a>Italy has declared war on Austria;
her people have driven the Government to take the
path of freedom and honour and break the shackles of
Germanism in finance, commerce and politics.</p>

<p>Italy has not declared war on Germany yet, but the fury of
the German Press is unbounded, and for the moment Germany's
overworked Professors of Hate have focused their energies on
the new enemy, and its army of &quot;vagabonds, convicts, ruffians
and mandolin-players,&quot; conveniently forgetting that the spirit
of <a name="Garibaldi"></a>Garibaldi is still an animating force, and that the King
inherits the determination of his grandfather and namesake.</p>

<p>On the Western front the enemy has been <a name="repulsed_at_Ypres"></a>repulsed at Ypres.
<a name="Lord_Kitchener_has_asked"></a>Lord Kitchener has asked for another 300,000 men, and speaks
confidently of our soon being able to make good the shortage

<p>On the Eastern front the Grand Duke Nicholas has been
forced to give ground; in Gallipoli slow progress is being made
at heavy cost on land and sea. The Turk is a redoubtable
trench fighter and sniper; the difficulties of the <i>terrain</i> are
indescribable, yet our men continue the epic struggle with
unabated heroism. King Constantine of Greece, improved in
health, construes his neutrality in terms of ever increasing
benevolence to his brother-in-law the Kaiser.</p>

<p>At home the great event has been the formation of a
Coalition Government--a two-handed sword, as we hope, to
smite the enemy; while practical people regard it rather as a
&quot;Coal and Ammunition Government.&quot; The cost of the War
is now Two Millions a day, and a new campaign of
<a name="Posters_and_Publicity"></a>Posters and Publicity has been inaugurated to promote recruiting.
<a name="Volunteers"></a>Volunteers, with scant official recognition, continue their
training on foot; the Hurst Park brigade continue their
activities, mainly on rubber wheels. An evening paper
announces:</p>

<h4>VICTORY IN GALLIPOLI.<br>
<br>
LATE WIRE FROM CHESTER.</h4>

<p>Mr. Punch is prompted to comment:</p>

<blockquote>For these our Army does its bit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While they in turn peruse<br>
Death's honour-roll (should time permit)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Betting News.<br></blockquote>

<p>More agreeable is the <a name="sportsmanship_of_the_trenches"></a>sportsmanship of the trenches, where
a correspondent tells of the shooting of a hare and the recovery
of the corpse, by a reckless Tommy, from the turnip-field which
separated our trenches from those of Fritz.</p>

<p>Amongst other signs of the times the emergence of the
<a name="Spy_Play"></a>Spy Play is to be noted, in which the alien enemy within our gates
is gloriously confounded. Yet, if a certain section of the Press
is to be believed, the dark and sinister operations of the
<a name="Hidden_Hand"></a>Hidden Hand continue unchecked.</p>

<p>The Germans as unconscious humorists maintain their
supremacy <i>hors concours</i>.<a name="Prince_Rupprecht"></a> A correspondent of the <i>Cologne
Gazette</i> was with other journalists recently entertained to dinner
in a French villa by the Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria.
&quot;The party, while dining,&quot; we are told, &quot;talked of the defects
of French taste, and Prince Rupprecht said that French houses
were full of horrors.&quot; True, O Prince, but the French are
determined to drive them out. <a name="panegyric"></a>Better still, in the month which
witnessed the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> we read this panegyric
of the Teuton in <i>Die Welt</i>: &quot;Clad in virtue and in peerless
nobility of character, unassailed by insidious enemies either
within or without, girded about by the benign influences of
Kultur, the German, whether soldier or civilian, pursues his
destined way, fearless and serene.&quot;</p>

<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>
<h2><i><a name="June,_1915."></a>June, 1915.</i></h2>

<p>The weeks that have passed since the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i> have left Germany not merely impenitent but
glorying in her crime. &quot;The destruction of the
<i>Lusitania</i>,&quot; says Herr Baumgarten, Professor of Theology,
&quot;should be greeted with jubilation and enthusiastic cheering,
and everybody who does not cheer is no real or true German.&quot;
Many harsh things have been said of the Germans, but nothing
quite so bitter as this suggestion for a test of nationality. But
while Germany jubilates, her Government is painfully anxious
to explain everything to the satisfaction of America. The
conversations between the two Powers are continuous but
abortive. President Wilson's dove has returned to him, with
the report &quot;Nothing doing,&quot; and the American eagle looks as
if he would like to take on the job.</p>

<p>Germany has had her first taste of real retaliation in the
<a name="bombardment_of_Karlsruhe_by_Allied_airmen"></a>bombardment of Karlsruhe by Allied airmen, and is furiously
indignant at the attack on an &quot;unfortified and peaceful&quot; town--which
happens to be the headquarters of the 14th German Army
Corps and to contain an important arsenal as well as large
chemical, engineering and railway works. Also she is very
angry with Mr. Punch, and has honoured him and other British
papers with a solemn warning. Our performances, it seems,
are &quot;diligently noted, so that when the day of reckoning arrives
we shall know with whom we have to deal, and how to deal
with them effectually.&quot; It is evident that in spite of Italy's entry
into the war the mass of the Germans are still true to their old
hate of England.</p>

memorandum on the captured submarine crews. As a result
39 imprisoned British officers, carefully selected, have been

the seclusion of the Duchy of Lancaster and the appointment
of <a name="Mr._Balfour_to_the_First_Lordship"></a>Mr. Balfour to the First Lordship of the Admiralty afford

hardship will not be unduly postponed. The Coalition Government

the Cabinet have decided to <a name="pool_their_salaries"></a>pool their salaries with a view to
their being divided equally. <a name="Mr._McKenna"></a>Mr. McKenna has made his first
appearance as Chancellor of the Exchequer and introduced a
Bill authorising the raising of a War Loan unlimited in extent,
but, being a man of moderate views, will be satisfied if nine
hundred millions are forthcoming. <a name="Lord_Haldane_succeeded"></a>Lord Haldane has been
succeeded in the Lord Chancellorship by <a name="Lord_Buckmaster"></a>Lord Buckmaster,
having caused by one unfortunate phrase a complete oblivion
of all the services rendered by his creation of the Territorial
system. The cry for &quot;more men&quot; has now changed to one
for &quot;more shells,&quot; and certain newspapers, always in search
of a scapegoat, have entered on a campaign directed against
Lord Kitchener, the very man whom a few short months ago
they hailed as the saviour of the situation. Finding that the
public cannot live on their hot air, they are doing their best
to make our flesh creep and keep our feet cold. Let us hope
that K. of K. will find the Garter some slight protection
against this hitting below the belt.</p>

exceedingly, under the patronage of a Prussianised Court.</p>

added to the ever growing vocabulary of the war in &quot;Anzac.&quot;

<p>The last month of the first year of the war brings no
promise of a speedy end; it is not a month of great battles
on land or sea, but rather of omens and foreshadowings,
good and evil. To the omens of victory belongs the sinking of
the <i><a name="Pommern"></a>Pommern</i>, named after the great maritime province, so long
coveted by the Brandenburgers, the makers of Prussia and the
true begetters of Prussianism. Of good omen, too, has been
the <a name="&quot;clean_sweep&quot;_made_by_General_Botha"></a>&quot;clean sweep&quot; made by General Botha in German South-West
Africa, where the enemy surrendered unconditionally on
July 9. And though the menace of the U-boat grows daily,
there <i>may</i> be limits to America's seemingly inexhaustible forbearance.
There are happily none to the fortitude of our bluejackets
and trawlers.</p>

<p><a name="invasion_by_sea"></a>Pundits in the Press, fortified by warnings from generals in
various Home Commands, display an increasing preoccupation
with the likelihood of invasion by sea. Mr. Punch naturally
inclines to a sceptical attitude, swayed by long adherence to
the views of the Blue Water School and the incredulousness of
correspondents engaged in guarding likely spots on the East
Coast. With<a name="runaway_raids"></a> runaway raids by sea we are already acquainted,
and their growing frequency from the air is responsible for
various suggested precautions, official and otherwise--pails of
sand and masks and anti-asphyxiation mixtures--which are not
viewed with much sympathy in the trenches. <i>There</i> the men
meet the most disconcerting situations--as, for example, the
problem of spending a night in a flooded meadow occupied by
a thunderstorm--with irrelevant songs or fantasias on the
mouth-organ.</p>

<br><br>
<p>When officers come home on leave and find England standing
where she did, their views support the weather-beaten major
who said that it was &quot;worth going to a little trouble and
expense to keep <i>that</i> intact.&quot; But you can hardly expect people
who live in trenches which have had to be rebuilt twice daily for
the last few months and are shelled at all hours of the day or
night, to compassionate the occasional trials of the home-keeping
bomb-dodger. The war, as it goes on, seems to bring

<p>There is, however, some excuse for those importunates who

help his country in her hour of need is excellent. But the
Government do not seem to have realised that half a million
volunteer soldiers have been waiting and ready for a job for
the last six months:</p>

<blockquote>And when at last you come and say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What can you do? We ask for light<br>
On any service you can pay,&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is: &quot; <i>You</i> know all right,<br>
And all this weary while you knew it;<br>
The trouble was you wouldn't let us do it.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The <a name="German_Press"></a>German Press is not exactly the place where one expects
to find occasion for merriment. Yet listen to this from the
<i>Neueste Nachrichten</i>: &quot;Our foes ask themselves continuously,
How can we best get at Germany's vital parts? What are her
most vulnerable points? The answer is, her humanity--her
trustful honesty.&quot; Here, on the other hand, thousands of
people, by knocking months and years off their real age, have
been telling good straightforward lies for their country. At the
<a name="Front_euphemism"></a>Front euphemism in describing hardship is mingled with
circumlocution in official terminology. Thus one C.O. is reported
to refer to the enemy not as Germans but &quot;militant
bodies of composite Teutonic origin.&quot;</p>

<p>A new and effectual cure for the conversion of <a name="pessimists"></a>pessimists
at home has been discovered. It is simply to out-do the
prophets of ill at their own game. The result is that they seek
you out to tell you that an enemy submarine has been sunk
off the Scillies or that the Crown Prince is in the Tower. It
is the old story that optimists are those who have been
associating with pessimists and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. But seriousness is
spreading. We are told that even actresses are now being
photographed with their mouths shut, though one would have
thought that at such a time all British subjects--especially the
&quot;Odolisques&quot; of the variety stage--ought to show their teeth.</p>

<p>Ordinary anniversaries lead to retrospect: after a year
of the greatest of all wars it is natural to indulge in a
stock-taking of the national spirit, and comforting to
find that, in spite of disillusions and disappointments, the
alternation of exultations and agonies, the soul of the fighting
men of England remains unshaken and unconquerable. Three
of the Great Powers of Europe espoused the cause of Liberty
a year ago; now there are four, and the aid of Italy in engaging
and detaching large Austrian forces enables us to contemplate
with greater equanimity a month of continuous Russian withdrawal,<a name="Brest-Litovsk"></a>
and the tragic loss of Warsaw and the great fortresses
of Novo-Georgievsk and Brest-Litovsk. And if there is no
outward sign of the awakening of Germany, no slackening in
frightfulness, no abatement in the blasphemous and overweening
confidence of her Ruler and his War-lords who can tell
whether they have not moments of self-distrust?</p>

<p><a name="British_submarines"></a>At any rate, we know for certain that British submarines have
made their way into the Baltic, a &quot;sea change&quot; extremely
disquieting to the Germans, who, for the rest, have suffered in
a naval scrap in the <a name="Gulf_of_Riga"></a>Gulf of Riga with the Russians. On the
Western front our troops are suffering from two plagues--large
shells and little flies. These troubles have not prevented
them from scoring a small though costly <a name="success_at_Hooge"></a>success at Hooge.
<a name="Anzac"></a>From Gallipoli comes the news of fresh deeds of amazing
heroism at Suvla Bay and Anzac.</p>

<p>The <a name="war_of_Notes"></a>war of Notes goes on with unabated energy between
Germany and the U.S.A. At home a brief period has been
set to the pernicious activities of importunate inquisitors by
the adjournment of the House till mid-September. &quot;Dr.
Punch&quot; is of opinion that the Mother of Parliaments is sorely
in need of a rest and needs every hour of a seven weeks'

everybody expects that everybody else should do his duty; and
the universal<a name="eruption_of_posters"></a> eruption of posters imploring us to subscribe to
the War Loan indicates the emergence of a new Art--that of
Government by advertisement. To the obvious appeals to duty,
patriotism, conscience, appeals to shame, appeals romantic and
even facetious are now added. It may be necessary, but the
method is not dignified. All that can be said is that &quot;Govertisement,&quot;
or government by advertisement, is better than Government
by the Press, a new terror with which we are daily
threatened.</p>

<a name="landscape_painting"></a>
<p>Mr. Winston Churchill, the greatest of our quick-change

<p><a name="The_Archbishop_of_Cologne"></a>The Archbishop of Cologne says that, on being congratulated
on his Eastern successes, the Kaiser &quot;turned his eyes to
heaven with the most indescribable expression of intense
gratitude and religious fervour.&quot; Yes, we can quite imagine
that it beggared description. But there is no difficulty in
finding the right phrase for his address to the inhabitants of
Warsaw: &quot;We wage war only against hostile troops, not
against peaceful citizens.&quot; It is not &quot;<i>splendide mendax</i>.&quot; That
is the due of boys who overstate, and men who understate, their
age in order to serve their country in the field.</p>

<p><a name="A_correspondent_reminds"></a>A correspondent reminds Mr. Punch that four years ago
he wrote as follows: &quot;Lord Haldane, in defending the
Territorials, declared that he expects to be dead before any
political party seriously suggests compulsory military service.
We understand that, since making this statement, our War
Minister has received a number of telegrams from Germany
wishing him long life.&quot; But we suspect that when he said
dead he meant politically dead. Still, we owe <a name="Lord_Haldane"></a>Lord Haldane
the Territorials, and they are doing great work in Europe and
most valuable, if thankless, work in India. As &quot;One of the
<i>Punch</i> brigade&quot; writes: &quot;The hearts of very few of the
Territorials now garrisoning India are in their work, though,
of course, we know that actually it is essential duty we are
performing.&quot; &quot;They also serve,&quot; who patiently endure the
dull routine of existence largely spent in a stifling fort on the
blistering and dust-swept plains, and find relief in the smallest
incident that breaks the monotony. As, for example, when a
quartermaster-sergeant was held up by a native guard at a
bridge, and, on demanding an explanation, had his attention
directed to the notices on the wall, &quot;Elephants and traction
engines are not allowed to cross this bridge.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Generalissimo"></a>The Tsar has succeeded the Grand Nicholas as Generalissimo
of his armies, and the great Russian retreat has
ended. Yet it would be rash to say that the one event
has caused the other. Lord Kitchener's statement that on the
Eastern front the Germans had &quot;almost shot their last bolt&quot;
is a better summary, and when we reflect on their enormous
superiority in artillery and equipment, that is a great tribute
to the strategy of the Grand Duke in conducting the most
difficult retreat of modern times. Germany, though a mistress
of the entire alphabet of frightfulness, is making increasing
play with the <i>U</i>'s and <i>Z</i>'s, and Admiral Percy Scott, who
predicted the dangers of the former, is now entrusted with the
task of coping with the latter menace.</p>

<p>Five months have elapsed since the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>

active than ever, thanks to the untiring <a name="efforts_of_Count_Bernstorff"></a>efforts of Count Bernstorff

to be rushed by the interventionists, and is giving his detached
consideration to the &quot;concessions&quot; of the German Government
in regard to submarine warfare. But three thousand miles of
ocean no longer keep America free from strife. The enemy
is within her gates, plotting, spying and bribing. The lesser

<br><br>
<p>By way of a sidelight on what happens on the Western
front, a wounded officer sends a characteristic account of his
experiences after &quot;going over the top&quot; at 3 A.M. &quot;The first
remark, as distinct from a shout that I heard after leaving our
parapet, came from Private Henry, my most notorious malefactor.
As the first attempt at a wire entanglement in our new
position went heavenward ten seconds after its emplacement,
and a big tree just to our right collapsed suddenly like a dying
pig, he turned round with a grin, observing: 'Well, sir, we
<i>do</i> see a bit of life, if we <i>don't</i> make money.' I never saw a
man all day who hadn't a grin ready when you passed, and
a bit of a <i>riposte</i> if you passed the time of day with him.&quot; Our
officers only think of their men, and the men of their officers.
In Gallipoli our soldiers have discovered a new method of
annoying the Turk:</p>

<blockquote>We go and bathe, in shameless scores<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath his baleful een,<br>
Disrobe, unscathed, on sacred shores<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wallow in between;<br>
Nor does a soldier then assume<br>
His university costume,<br>
And though it makes the Faithful fume,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes the Faithless clean.<br></blockquote>

<p>The <a name="return_of_the_wounded"></a>return of the wounded to England is marked by strange
incidents, pathetic and humorous. Thus it has been reserved
for an officer, reported dead in the casualty list, to ring up his
people on the telephone and correct &quot;this silly story about my
being killed.&quot; And the cheerfulness of the limbless men in
blue is something wonderful. They &quot;jest at scars,&quot; but not
because they &quot;never felt a wound.&quot; It is a high privilege to
entertain these light-hearted heroes, one of whom recently
presented his partner in a lawn tennis match with a fragment
of shell taken direct from his &quot;stummick.&quot; And the recipient
rightly treasures it as a love-token.</p>

<p>Parliament has reassembled, the inquisitors returning (unhappily)
like giants refreshed after their holiday. But they
sometimes contribute to our amusement, as when one relentless
and complacent critic declared that, on the matter of conscription,
he should himself &quot;prefer to be guided--very largely--by
Lord Kitchener.&quot; The concession is something. Most of the
importunate questionists are on the other side:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Take from us any joys you like,&quot; they cry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'd bear the loss, however much we missed 'em;<br>
Let truth and justice, fame and honour die,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But spare, O spare, our Voluntary System!&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p><a name="girl_gardeners"></a>Amongst other signs of the times the increase of girl gardeners and
the <a name="sacrifice_of_flower_beds"></a>sacrifice of flower beds to vegetables are to be noted.
<a name="tramcar"></a> But War
changes are sometimes disconcerting, even when they are most salutary.
For example, there is the <i>cri de coeur</i> of a passenger on a Clydebank
tramcar in Glasgow on Saturday night, with a lady conductor: &quot;I

arm-chair experts. The strangely named &quot;Archie,&quot; and
&quot;Pacifist,&quot; the dismay of scholars--a word &quot;mean as what
it's meant to mean&quot;--now come to be added to the list. A new and
admirable explanation of the R.F.A., &quot;Ready for anyfink,&quot; is
attributed to a street Arab. Our children are mostly lapped in blissful
ignorance, but their comments are often illuminating. As, for instance,
the suggestion of a small child asked to give her idea of a suitable
future for Germany and the Kaiser: &quot;After the war I wouldn't let
Heligoland belong to anybody. I would put the Germans there, and they
should dig and dig and dig until it was all dug into the sea. The Kaiser
should be sent to America, and they should be as rude as they liked to
him. If he went in a train no one was to offer him a seat; he was to
hang on to a strap, and he is to be called Mr. Smith.&quot; Cooks are
being bribed to stay by the gift of War Bonds. <a name="Smart_fashionables"></a>Smart fashionables are
flocking to munition works, and some of them sometimes are not
unnaturally growing almost frightened at the organising talents they are
developing. So are other people.</p>

<p>A vigorous campaign against flies has been initiated by
the journal which describes itself as &quot;that paper which gets

announced that &quot;<a name="Lord_Northcliffe"></a>Lord Northcliffe is travelling and will be

Even he must have an occasional rest from his daily mail.</p>

<p>We have to apologise for any suggestion to the effect that
the Huns are devoid of humour. The German Society for the
Protection and Preservation of Monuments has held a meeting
in Brussels and expressed its thanks to the German Military
Authorities for the care they had taken of the Monuments in
Belgium. The function ended with an excursion to Louvain,
where the delegates, no doubt, enjoyed a happy hour in the

<a name="offensive_in_Champagne"></a><p>September ended with the Western front once more
ablaze, with bitter fighting at Loos and a great French
offensive in Champagne. With October the focus of

occupied Belgrade. The Allies have landed at Salonika, and
Ferdinand of Bulgaria has <a name="declared_war_on_Serbia"></a>declared war on Serbia. Thus a
new theatre of war has been opened, and though it is well to
be rid of a treacherous neutral, the conflict enters on a fresh
and formidable phase. When Ferdinand went to Bulgaria he
is said to have resolved that if ever there were to be any
assassinations he would be on the side of the assassins. He
has been true to his word ever since the removal of Stamboloff:</p>

<blockquote>Here stands the Moslem with his brutal sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still red and reeking with Armenia's slaughter;<br>
Here, fresh from Belgium's wastes, the Christian Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart unsated by the wrong he wrought her;<br>
And you between them, on your brother's track,<br>
Sworn, for a bribe, to stick him in the back.<br></blockquote>

<p>France and England have declared their intention of rendering
all possible help to Serbia in her new ordeal, but <a name="Greece"></a>Greece,
false to her treaty with Serbia, and dominated by a pro-German
Court and Government, hampers us at every turn.
&quot;'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more.&quot; So <a name="Byron"></a>Byron sang,
and a Byron <i>de nos jours</i> adds a new stanza to his appeal:</p>

<blockquote>Lo, a new curse--the Teuton bane!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again rings out the trumpet call;<br>
France, England, Russia, joined again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For freedom fight, for Greece, for all;<br>
And Greece--shall she that call ignore?<br>
Then is she living Greece no more!<br></blockquote>

<p><a name="guarding_the_King's_highway"></a>Life in the trenches grows more strenuous as the output
of high explosive increases, and the daily toll of our best and
bravest makes grievous reading for the elders at home, &quot;who
linger here and droop beneath the heavy burden of our years,&quot;
though many of them cheerfully undertake the thankless fatigues
of guarding the King's highway as specials. But letters from
the front still show the same genius for making light of hardship
and deadly peril, the same happy gift of extracting amusement
from trivial incidents. So those who spend their days
and nights under heavy shell fire and heavy rain write to tell
you that &quot;tea is the dominating factor of war,&quot; or that &quot;the
mushrooming and ratting in their latest quarters&quot; are satisfactory.
And even the wounded, in comparing the hazards
of London with those at the front, only indulge in mild irony
at the expense of the &quot;staunch dare-devil souls who stay at
home.&quot;</p>

<p>In Parliament <a name="Sir_Edward_Carson"></a>Sir Edward Carson has explained the reasons
of his resignation of office--his difference from his colleagues
in the difficulties arising in the Eastern theatre of war; and
a resolution has been placed on the order-book proposing the
appointment of a Committee of Inquiry on the Dardanelles
campaign. No abatement of the plague of questions is yet
noticeable, but some slight excuse may be found for the
&quot;ragging&quot; of the Censor. This anonymous worthy, it appears,
recently excised the words &quot;and the Kings&quot; from the well-known
line in<a name="Mr._Kipling"></a> Mr. Kipling's &quot;Recessional&quot;:</p>

the truth unwittingly. Meanwhile the Hamburg <i>Fremdenblatt</i>
asserts that, &quot;We Germans would gladly follow the Kaiser's
lead through the very gates of hell, were it necessary.&quot; The
qualification is surely superfluous, in the light of the murder

on October 12. Her life was one long act of mercy. She

<p>A new phase has been reached in the Conscription controversy,
and the burning question appears to be whether the
necessary men are to be compelled to volunteer or persuaded to
be compulsorily enrolled. One of our novelist military experts,
who is not always lucky with figures, though he thoroughly
enjoys them, is alleged to have discovered that there are no
more men than can be raised by conscription, but that the same
does not, of course, apply to the voluntary system.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> asks, &quot;Have we a Foreign Office?&quot; We

that he has made himself an accomplished landscape painter

<p>A visitor to a remote East Anglian village in search of
rest has found recreation in discussing with the inhabitants
the Great War, of which he found some of them had heard.
&quot;Them there Zett'lins,&quot; said one old woman, &quot;I almost shruk
as I heerd the mucky varmints a-shovellin' on the coals--dare,

had seen a bomb drop near a church, informed the visitor
that it &quot;fared to him like the body of the chach a-floatin'
away--that it did and all! It made a clangin' like a covey of
lorries with their innards broke loose.&quot; Another inhabitant
said that he had two boys fighting. &quot;One on 'em is in France,
wherever that might be, and Jimmy's in that hare old Dardelles.&quot;
He couldn't rightly say when the elder had gone
out, &quot;but it might be a yare ago come muck-spreadin'.&quot;</p>

<p>In Flanders the rain has begun its winter session, and, as
a military humorist put it, trench warfare is becoming a constant
drain. The problem of parapet mending has been reduced
to arithmetical form <i>&agrave; la</i> Colenso, as follows: &quot;If two inches
of rain per diem brings down one quarter of a company's
parapet, and one company, working about twenty-six hours
per diem, can revet one-eighth of a company's parapet, how
long will your trenches last--given the additional premisses
that no revetments to speak of are to be had, and that two
inches of rain is only a minimum ration?&quot;<a name="R.F.C."></a> The infantryman

&quot;These airy fellows talk of war as if it were a day's

sends a pleasant account of the mutual estimates of
French and English, prompted by their experiences as brothers
in arms. &quot;Our idea of our Ally as a soldier is that his <i>&eacute;lan</i>
and gay courage are very much more remarkable even than
supposed; but for the dull, heavy work of continued warfare
there is wanted, if we may say so without offence, the more
stolid qualities of the English. On the other hand, the French
opinion of their Ally as a soldier is that his dash and devilment
are really astonishing, even to the most expectant critic;
but for the sordid, monotonous strain of this trench business it
needs (a thousand pardons!) the duller persistence of the

<p>In Greece the quick change of Premiers proceeds with
kaleidoscopic rapidity. The attitude of the successive Prime
Ministers has been described as (1) Tender and affectionate
neutrality toward the Entente Powers; (2) Malevolent impartiality
toward the Central Powers; (3) Inert cupidity toward
all the belligerent Powers; (4) Genial inability; (5) Strict
pusillanimity.</p>

<p><a name="Lord_Milner"></a>Lord Milner has gone so far in the House of Lords as to say that
&quot;such war news as is published has from first to last been
seriously misleading.&quot; The <a name="Balkan_intelligence"></a>Balkan intelligence that is allowed to
reach us does not exactly deserve this censure. To call it misleading
would be too high praise; it seldom rises beyond a level of blameless
irrelevance. It is hardly a burlesque of the facts to say that a cable
from Amsterdam informs us that the Copenhagen correspondent of the <i>Echo
de Paris</i> learns from Salonika, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Lemnos and Nijni Novgorod,
that in high official circles in Bukarest it is rumoured that in
Constantinople the situation is considered grave; and then we are warned
that too much credence must not be given to this report. The number of
Censors at the Press Bureau being exactly forty, and their minute
knowledge of English literature having been displayed on several
occasions, it is said that Sir John Simon contemplates their
incorporation as an Academy of &quot;Immortals--for the duration of the
War.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Mr._Punch's_correspondent"></a>Mr. Punch's correspondent &quot;Blanche&quot; sends distressing
details of some of the new complaints contracted by smart war workers.
These include munition-wrists, shell-makers' crouch,
neuro-committee-itis, and Zeppelin-eye through looking up into the sky
too long with a telescope.</p>

<p>A great deal depends on what you look at and what you
look through. Thus Mr. <a name="Walter_Long"></a>Walter Long says that when he reads
carping criticisms upon the conduct of the War he looks
through his window at the people in the street and is always
surprised to see the quiet steadfast manner in which they are
going about their business. It is a good plan, but not always
successful. The Kaiser got his view of the Irish people
through a Casement, and it was entirely erroneous.</p>

<p>The <i>Cologne Gazette</i> has stated that &quot;there is in England
no real soldiers' humour such as we have.&quot; Certainly we have
nothing like it, though we confess to preferring the home-grown
brand.</p>

Westerners and the Easterners, and the former, pointing to
the <a name="evacuation_of_Gallipoli"></a>evacuation of Gallipoli, are loud in their denunciations of
costly &quot;side-shows,&quot; and the folly of strengthening Germany's
hold on Turkey by killing out the Turks, instead of concentrating
all our forces on killing the Germans on the Western
front. The time is not yet come to decide which is right. But
all are agreed with the British officer who described the
<a name="Australian_soldier_at_Gallipoli"></a>Australian soldier at Gallipoli as &quot;the bravest thing God ever

England is taking no risks on the strength of these
irregular &quot;overtures.&quot; A vote has been passed for a further
increase of our &quot;contemptible little Army&quot; to four millions;

as Commander-in-Chief of our Armies in France; Sir
William Robertson is the new Chief of Staff--Scotsmen both
of the finest type--and the appointments are universally
approved, even by the <i>Daily Mail</i>. The temper of the men in
France is well hit off by an officer when he says that &quot;Atkins
is really best when an ordinary mortal might be contemplating
suicide or desertion.&quot; And officers arriving on leave at Victoria
at 2 A.M. are driven to the conclusion that they are sent back
to England from time to time to check their optimism, which
at the front survives even being sent to so-called rest camps
in the middle of a malodorous marsh for nine hours' military
training <i>per diem</i>. The &quot;<a name="philosophy_of_Thomas"></a>philosophy of Thomas&quot; is inscrutable,
but no doubt he derives satisfaction from comparisons:</p>

<blockquote>If we're standin' in two foot o' water, you see<br>

An' though the keen frost may be ticklin' our toes,<br>
'Oo doubts that the Boches' 'ole bodies is froze?<br>

'Tis balm to our souls, as we grumble an' cuss,<br>

<p>Hardest of all is the lot of the trooper in the trenches, who

beyond abstaining from voting any addition to their salary of

<h2><i><a name="January,_1916"></a>January, 1916</i>.</h2>

<p>The New Year brings us a mixed bag of tricks, good and
bad. Our armies grow in numbers and efficiency, in
men and munitions. The new Commander-in-Chief
on the Western front, and his new Chief of Staff, inspire
confidence in all ranks, combatant and non-combatant.
<a name="John_Ward"></a>John Ward, the Labour Member, hitherto a strong opponent
of conscription, and now a full-blown Colonel, has hurried
over from the front to defend the Compulsory Service Bill
in a manly and animated speech, and the Bill, despite the
&quot;Pringling&quot; and pacificism of a small but local minority, has
passed through Committee.</p>

<p>Against these encouraging omens we have to set the
<a name="complete_evacuation_of_Gallipoli"></a>complete evacuation of Gallipoli, the scene of unparalleled heroism
and unavailing sacrifice, the <a name="fall_of_Monastir"></a>fall of Monastir, the overrunning
of Serbia, <a name="labour_troubles_on_the_Clyde"></a>labour troubles on the Clyde, and the ignominious
<a name="exemption_of_Ireland"></a>exemption of Ireland from the Military Service Bill. General
Townshend, <i>rebus angustis animosus</i>--&quot;in a tight place but
full of beans&quot;--is besieged in Kut, and the relieving forces
have not been able to dislodge the Turks. Climate and weather
and <i>terrain</i> are all against us.</p>

<p><a name="piteous_lamentations"></a>Humanitarian Pacificists are much impressed by Germany's
piteous lamentations over the brutality of the blockade. In these
appeals to America optimists detect signs of cracking. Cooler
observers explain them as evidence of her policy of shamming
dead.</p>

<p>English mothers who have lost their only sons cannot be
expected to show sympathy for an Emperor who combines the
professions of a Jekyll with the ferocity of a Hyde. Yet few
of them would rewrite the record of these short lives; their
pride is greater than their pain.</p>

<p>While the daily toll of life is heavy, War, shorn of its
pomp and pageantry, drags wearily in the trenches. The
<a name="Lovelace"></a>Lovelace of to-day is a troglodyte, biding his time patiently,
but often a prey to <i>ennui</i>. This is how he writes to Lucasta
to correct the portrait painted by her fancy:</p>

<blockquote>Above, the sky is very grey, the world is very damp.<br>
His light the sun denies by day, the moon by night her lamp;<br>
Across the landscape, soaked and sad, the dull guns answer back,<br>
And through the twilight's futile hush spasmodic rifles crack.<br>
<br>
The papers haven't come to-day to show how England feels;<br>
The hours go lame and languidly between our Spartan meals;<br>
We've written letters till we're tired, with not a thing to tell<br>
Except that nothing's doing, weather beastly, writer well.<br>
<br>
So when you feel for us out here--as well I know you will--<br>
Then sympathise with thousands for their country sitting still;<br>
Don't picture battle-pieces by the lurid Press adored,<br>
But miles and miles of Britishers, in burrows, badly bored.<br></blockquote>

<p>Small wonder that Lovelace in the trenches envies the
Flying Man:</p>

<blockquote>He rides aloof on god-like wings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking no thought of wire or mud,<br>
Saps, smells, or bugs--the mundane things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sour our lives and have our blood.<br>
<br>
The roads we trudged with feet of lead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows of his pinions skim;<br>
The river where we piled our dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but a silver thread to him.<br></blockquote>

<p>Lovelace in the air might tell another story; but both are
at one with their prototype in the spirit which made him say:
&quot;I could not love thee, dear, so much, loved I not honour
more,&quot; though neither of them would say it.</p>

<p>In this context one may add that the Flying Men are not
alone in exciting envy. Bread is the staff of life, and in the
view of certain officers in the trenches the life of the Staff is
one long loaf.</p>

<p>The discussion on the withdrawal of Members' salaries has
died down. The incident is now buried, and here is its
epitaph:</p>

<blockquote>Some three-score years or so ago six hundred gallant men<br>
Made a charge that cost old England dear; they lost four hundred then:<br>
To-day six hundred make a charge that costs the country dear,<br>
But now they take four hundred each--four hundred pounds a year.<br></blockquote>

<p>Our <a name="journalists"></a>journalists have been visiting the Fleet, and one of them, in a
burst of candour tempered with caution, declares that &quot;one would
like to describe much more than one has seen, but that is
impossible.&quot; Some other correspondents have found no such
difficulty. But for <a name="admirable_candour"></a>admirable candour
commend us to the <i>Daily Mail</i> of December 24, where we read, &quot; The

seize the occasion to-day of bidding our readers a Merry
Christmas&quot;--and a very good reason too. Mr. Punch is glad to
reprint a ten-year-old girl's essay on &quot;Patriotism&quot;:
&quot;Patriotism is composed of patriots, and they are people who live
in Ireland and want Mr. Redmond or other people to be King of Ireland.
They are very brave, some of them, and are so called after St. Patrick,
who is Ireland's private saint. The patriots who are brave make splendid
soldiers. The patriots who are not brave go to America.&quot; And here
is a topical extract from a letter written to a loved one from the
Front:</p>

<p>&quot;I received your dear little note in a sandbag. You say
that you hope the sandbag stops a bullet. Well, to tell the
truth, I hope it don't, as I have been patching my trousers
with it.&quot;</p>

own work to do, and means to do it thoroughly.</p>

<p>The miraculous <a name="forbearance_of"></a>forbearance of President Wilson, in face
of the activities of Count Bernstorff, is even more trying to a
good many of his countrymen than it is to the belligerent
Briton. Mr. Roosevelt, for instance, derives no satisfaction
from being the fellow-countryman of a man who can &quot;knock
spots&quot; off Job for patience. The <i><a name="New_York_Life"></a>New York Life</i> has long
criticised the President with a freedom far eclipsing anything

principles which were applied by the American Government in the war between North
and South--to apply those principles to modern conditions and to do our best to prevent
trade with the enemy through neutral countries? If the answer is that we are not entitled to
do that, then I must say definitely it is a departure from neutrality.&quot;--SIR EDWARD GREY.

The <a name="new_submarine"></a>new submarine &quot;frightfulness&quot; began on the 1st,
and the battle round Verdun, in which the fate of Paris, to say
the least, is involved, has raged with unabated fury throughout

<p>On our share of the Western front there is still what is
nominally described as a &quot;lull.&quot; But, as a young Officer writes,
&quot;you must not imagine that life here is all honey. Even here
we do a bit for our eight-and-sixpence.&quot; Once upon a time
billets were billets. They now very often admit of being shelled
with equal exactitude from due in front and due in rear, and
water is laid on throughout. &quot;It is a fact well known to all our
most widely circulated photographic dailies that the German
gunners waste a power of ammunition. The only criticism I
have to make is that I wish they would waste it more carefully.
The way they go strewing the stuff about around us is such that
they're bound to hit someone or something before long. Still,
we have only two more days in these trenches, and they seldom
give us more than ten thousand shells a day.&quot;</p>

<br><br>
<p>Letters from second-lieutenants seldom go beyond a gentle
reminder that their life is not an Elysium. They offer a strange
contrast to the activities of Parliamentary grousers and scapegoat
hunters. If the Germans were in occupation of the Black
Country, if Oxford were being daily shelled as Rheims is, and
if with a favouring breeze London could hear the dull rumble
of the bombardment as Paris can, one wonders if Members
would still be encumbering the Order-paper with the vexatious
trivialities that now find place there, or emitting what a
patriotic Labour Member picturesquely described as &quot;the
croakings and bleatings of the fatted lambs who have besmirched
their country.&quot; <i>Per contra</i> we welcome the optimism
of Mr. Asquith in <a name="discussing_new_Votes_of_Credit"></a>discussing new Votes of Credit, though
he reminds us of Micawber calculating his indebtedness for
the benefit of Traddles. It will be remembered that when the
famous IOU had been handed over, Copperfield remarked,
&quot;I am persuaded not only that this was quite the same to Mr.
Micawber as paying the money, but that Traddles himself
hardly knew the difference until he had had time to think about
it.&quot; Then we have had the surprising but welcome experience
of Mr. <a name="Tim_Healy"></a>Tim Healy championing the Government against Sir John
Simon's attack on the Military Service Bill; and have listened
to Lord Montagu of Beaulieu's urgent plea in the Lords for
unity of air control, a proposal which Lord Haldane declared
could not be adopted without some &quot;violent thinking.&quot; Most
remarkable of all has been Mr. Churchill's intervention in the
debate on the Naval Estimates, his gloomy review of the
situation--Mr. Churchill is always a pessimist when out of
office--and the marvellous magnanimity of his suggestion that
Lord Fisher should be reinstated at the Admiralty, on the
ground that his former antagonist was the only possible First
Sea Lord. Mr. Balfour dealt so faithfully with these criticisms
and suggestions that there seems to be no truth in the report that
Mr. Churchill has been asked to join the Government as Minister
of Admonitions. A new and coruscating star has swum into our
Parliamentary ken in the shape of the <a name="Member_for_Mid-Herts"></a>Member for Mid-Herts,
and astronomers have labelled it &quot;Pegasus [Greek: pi beta].&quot; When the
House of Commons passed the Bill prohibiting duels it ought to
have made an exception in favour of its own Members. Nothing
would have done more to raise the tone of debate, for offenders
against decorum would gradually have eliminated one another.
Yet Parliament has its merits, not the least of them being the
scope it still affords for hereditary talent. Lord Derby, at the
moment the most <a name="prominent_man_on_the_Home_Front"></a>prominent man on the Home Front after
the Premier, is the grandson of the &quot;Rupert of Debate,&quot; and the
<a name="new_Minister_of_Blockade"></a>new Minister of Blockade enters on his duties close on fifty
years after another Lord Robert Cecil entered the Cabinet of
Lord Derby. So history repeats itself with a difference. In
spite of the Coalition, or perhaps because of it, the old <a name="strife_revived"></a>strife of
Whigs and Tories has revived, though the lines of cleavage are
quite different from what they were. Thus the new Tories are
the men who believe that the War is going to be decided by
battles in Flanders and the North Sea, and would sacrifice
everything for victory, even the privilege of abusing the
Government. The new Whigs are the men who consider that
the House of Commons is the decisive arena, and that even the
defeat of the Germans would be dearly purchased at the cost of
the individual's right to say and do what he pleased.</p>

<p>After the exhibition of Mr. <a name="Augustus_John's_portrait"></a>Augustus John's portrait of Mr.
Lloyd George,<a name="Tirpitz"></a> the most startling personal event of the month
has been the dismissal of Grand Admiral Tirpitz. According
to one account, he resigned because he could not take the
German Fleet out. According to another, it was because he
could no longer take the German people in.</p>

<p>At Oxford the Hebdomadal Council have suspended the
filling of the Professorship of Modern Greek for six months.
Apparently there is no one about just now who understands
the modern Greek. A French correspondent puts it somewhat
differently:<br> &quot;<i>La Gr&egrave;ce Antique</i>: Hellas. <i>La Gr&egrave;ce Moderne</i>: H&eacute;las!&quot;</p>

<p>Who would have thought when the month opened that
at its close a new front within the Four Seas would
be added to our far-flung line, Dublin's finest street
half ruined,<a name="martial_law"></a> Ireland placed under martial law? Certainly not
Mr. Birrell or Mr. Redmond or the Irish Nationalist Members.
The staunchest Unionist would acquit Mr. William O'Brien
of any menace when in the Budget Debate, three weeks before
the Rebellion of Easter Week, he gave it as his opinion that
Ireland ought to be omitted from the Budget altogether. So,
too, with Mr. Tim Healy, whose principal complaint was that
the tax on railway tickets would put a premium on foreign
travel; that people would go to Paris instead of Dublin, and
Switzerland instead of Killarney. No, so far as the Government
and Ireland's Parliamentary representatives went, it was a
bolt from the blue--or the green. Mr. Birrell, Chief Secretary
for Ireland for nine years, a longer period than any of his
predecessors, has shown himself conspicuous at once by his
absence and his innocence, and England in her hour of need,
with the submarine peril daily growing and all but starved out
after a heroic defence, stands to pay dearly for the privilege
of entrusting the administration of Ireland to an absentee
humorist.</p>

<p><a name="closing_in_on"></a>On the Western front Verdun still rivets all eyes. The
German hordes are closing in on the fortress, but at a heavier
cost for each mile gained than they have ever paid before.</p>

<p>Germany's colossal effort would inspire admiration as well
as respect if she would only fight clean. The ugly stories of
her <a name="treatment_of_prisoners"></a>treatment of prisoners have now culminated in the terrible

<p>In Parliament we have had the biggest Budget ever known
introduced in the shortest Budget speech of the last half-century,
at any rate. <a name="Mr._Pemberton_Billing"></a>Mr. Pemberton Billing is doing his best every
Tuesday to bring the atmosphere of the aerodrome into the
House. Mr. Tennant has promised his sympathetic consideration
to Mr. Billing's offer personally to organise raids on the
enemy's aircraft bases, and the House is bearing up as well as can
be expected under the shadow of this impending bereavement.
Mr. <a name="Swift_MacNeill"></a>Swift MacNeill is busy with his patriotic effort to purge the
roll of the Lords of the peerages now held by enemy dukes. For
the rest, up to Easter Week, the Parliamentary situation has
been described as &quot;a cabal every afternoon and a crisis every
second day.&quot;</p>

<p>It is one of the strange outcomes of this wonderful time that there
is more <a name="gaiety"></a>gaiety as well as more suffering in hospitals during the War
than in peace. Certainly such a request would never have been heard in
normal years as that recently made by a nurse to a roomful of
irrepressible Tommies at a private hospital:</p>

<p>&quot;A message has just come in to ask if the hospital will make a
little less noise as the lady next door has a touch of
headache.&quot;</p>

<p>For shouting &quot;The Zepps are coming!&quot; a Grimsby girl has
been fined &pound;1. It was urged in defence that the girl suffered from
hallucinations, one being that she was a daily newspaper proprietor. But
the <a name="recent_Zeppelin_raids"></a>recent Zeppelin raids have not been without their advantages. In a

<h2><i><a name="May,_1916"></a>May, 1916</i>.</h2>

<p>Verdun still holds out: that is the best news of the
month. The French with inexorable logic continue to
exact the highest price for the smallest gain of ground. If
the Germans are ready to give 100,000 men for a hill or part
of a hill they may have it. If they will give a million men they
may perhaps have Verdun itself. But so far their Pyrrhic
victories have stopped short of this limit, and Verdun, like
Ypres, battered, ruined and evacuated by civilians, remains a
symbol of Allied tenacity and the will to resist.</p>

<p>The months in war-time sometimes belie their traditions, but
it is fitting that in May we should have enlisted a new Ally--the
Sun. The<a name="Daylight_Saving_Bill"></a> Daylight Saving Bill became Law on May 17.
Here is a true economy, and our only regret is that Mr. Willett,
the chief promoter of a scheme complacently discussed during
his lifetime as ingenious but impracticable, should not have
lived to witness its swift and unmurmuring acceptance under
stress of war.</p>

<p>The official <i>communiqu&eacute;s</i> from the Irish Front in the earlier
stages of the Dublin rebellion did not long maintain their roseate
complexion. Even before the end of April a Secret Session--the
second in a week--was held to discuss the Irish situation.
By a strange coincidence this Secret Session immediately
followed the grant by the Commons of a Return relating to Irish
Lunacy accounts. From the meagre official summary we gather
that the absence of reporters has at least the negative advantage
of shortening speeches. In a very few days, however, the
Prime Minister discarded reticence, admitting the gravity of
the situation, the prevalence of street fighting, the spread of
the <a name="insurrection_in_the_West"></a>insurrection in the West, the appointment of
<a name="Sir_John_Maxwell"></a>Sir John Maxwell to the supreme command, and the placing of the Irish
Government under his orders. The inevitable sequel--the
execution of the responsible insurrectionist leaders--has led to
vehement protests from Messrs. Dillon and O'Brien against
militarist brutality. The House of Commons is a strange place.
When <a name="Mr._Birrell"></a>Mr. Birrell rose on May 3 to give an account of his nine
years' stewardship, the Unionists, and not the Unionists alone,
were thinking of a lamp-post in Whitehall. When he had
concluded his pathetic apologia and confessed his failure to
estimate accurately the strength of Sinn Fein, members were
almost ready to fall on his neck, but they no longer wanted
his head.</p>

<p>Even Sir Edward Carson admitted that Mr. Birrell
had been well intentioned and had done his best. By the middle
of the month <a name="Mr._Asquith_had_gone_to_Ireland"></a>Mr. Asquith had gone to Ireland, in the hope of
discovering some arrangement for the future which would
commend itself to all parties. By the 25th he was back in his
place after nine days in Dublin. But he had no panacea of
his own to prescribe; no cut-and-dried plan for the regeneration
of Ireland. All he could say was that Mr. Lloyd George had
<a name="been_deputed"></a>been deputed by the Cabinet to confer with the various Irish
leaders, and the choice is generally approved. If anyone knows
how to handle high explosives without causing a premature
concussion it should be the Minister of Munitions.</p>

<p>Ireland has dominated the political scene at home, for it is
impossible not to connect our new commitments across St.
George's Channel with the introduction and passing of the new
Military Service Bill establishing compulsion for all men,
married or single--always excepting Ireland. The question of
man-power is paramount. Mr. Asquith is at last convinced that
&quot;Wait and See&quot; must yield to &quot;Do it Now&quot;: that the nation
won't have the sword of Damocles hanging over its head any
longer, but will have compulsion in its hand at once. On the
progress of the War Mr. Asquith has said little in Open
Session, but any omission on his part has been made good by
Mr. Churchill, now home on unlimited leave, who has spoken at
great length on the proper use of armies.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Ponsonby and Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, who
raised the question of Peace on Empire Day, urging the
Government to open negotiations with Germany, have elicited
from the Foreign Secretary the deliberate statement that the
only terms of peace which the German Government had ever
put forward were the terms of victory for Germany, and that
we could not reason with the German people so long as they
were fed with lies.</p>

<p><a name="Mr._Henry_James"></a>Mr. Henry James, who so nobly repaid the hospitality
England was proud to show him by adopting her nationality in
her hour of greatest need, said shortly before his death that
nothing grieved him more than the constant loss of England's
&quot;best blood, seed and breed.&quot; The mothers of England &quot;give
their sons,&quot; but they know that the choice did not rest with
them:</p>

<blockquote>We did not give you--all unasked you went,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sons of a greater motherhood than ours;<br>
To our proud hearts your young brief lives were lent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then swept beyond us by resistless powers.<br>
Only we hear, when we have lost our all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That far clear call.<br></blockquote>

<p>But how can the grief be measured of those</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose best,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eager to serve a higher quest<br>
And in the Great Cause know the joy of battle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallant and young, by traitor hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leagued with a foe from alien lands,<br>
Struck down in cold blood, fell like butchered cattle?<br></blockquote>

<p>Though Ireland is not for the moment a source of humour
she contrives to be the cause of it in others. A daily paper
tells us that Sir Robert Chalmers is to be &quot;Permanent Under-Secretary
of Ireland <i>pro tem</i>.&quot; Another daily paper, the <i>Daily
Mail,</i> to be precise, has discovered a new test of valour: &quot;Mr.
Hellish, a regular reader of the <i>Daily Mail</i> for years, was
awarded the V.C. last month for conspicuous bravery.&quot;</p>

<p>At last the long vigil in the North Sea has ended in the
glorious if indecisive <a name="battle_of_Jutland"></a>battle of Jutland, the greatest sea
fight since Trafalgar. Yet was it indecisive? After the momentary
dismay caused by the first Admiralty <i>communiqu&eacute;</i> with
its over-estimate of our losses, public confidence, shaken where
it was strongest, has been restored by further information and
by the admissions of the enemy. We have to mourn the loss of
many ships, still more the loss of splendid ships' companies
and their heroic captains. We can sympathise with the cruel
disappointment of those who, after bearing the brunt of the
action, were robbed of the opportunity of overwhelming their
enemy by failing light and the exigencies of a strategy governed
in the last resort by political caution. But look at the sequel.
The German Fleet, badly battered, retires to port; and despite
the p&aelig;ans of exultation from their Admirals, Kaiser, and
Imperial Chancellor, remains there throughout the month.
Will it ever come out again? Meanwhile, <a name="Wilhelmshaven"></a>Wilhelmshaven is
closed indefinitely, and nobody is allowed to see those sheep in
Wolff's clothing--the &quot;victorious fleet.&quot; The true verdict, so
far as we can judge, may be expressed in homely phrase: The
British Navy has taken a knock but given a harder one. We
can stand it and they can't.</p>

<h4>THE LOST CHIEF<br>
<br>
In Memory of Field-Marshal Earl Kitchener, Maker of Armies
</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Within a week of Jutland the Empire has been stirred to
its depths by the <a name="tragic_death_of_Lord_Kitchener"></a>tragic death of Lord Kitchener in the
<i>Hampshire</i>, blown up by a mine off the Shetlands on her
voyage to Archangel. On the eve of starting on his mission
to Russia his last official act had been to meet his critics of the
House of Commons face to face, reply to their questions and
leave them silenced and admiring. <a name="eulogies"></a> On the day of the battle of
Jutland these critics had moved the Prime Minister to declare
that Lord Kitchener was personally entitled to the credit for
the amazing expansion of the army. Sir Mark Sykes, no mean
authority, asserted that in Germany our War Secretary was
feared as a great organiser, while in the East his name was one
to conjure with; and Sir George Reid, a worthy representative
of the Dominions, observed that his chief fault was that he was
&quot;not clever at circulating the cheap coin of calculated civilities
which enable inferior men to rise to positions to which they
are not entitled.&quot; These tributes were delivered in his lifetime;
they deserve to be contrasted with the appreciations of those
journalists who clamoured for his appointment, then clamoured
for his dismissal, and profaned his passing with their insincere
eulogies. Three weeks of Recess elapsed before the Houses
could render homage to the illustrious dead. In the Lords the
debt has been paid by a statesman, Lord Lansdowne, a soldier,
Lord French, and a friend, Lord Derby. In the Commons the
speeches were all touched with genuine emotion and the sense
of personal loss. Through all these various tributes rang the
note of duty well done, and Mr. Bonar Law did well to remind
the House of the sure instinct which caused Lord Kitchener to
realise at the very outset the gigantic nature of the present
War. In a sense his loss is irreparable, yet his great work was
accomplished before he died. Sometimes accused of expecting
others to achieve the impossible, he had achieved it himself in
the crowning miracle of his life, the improvisation of the New
Armies.</p>

<p>The <a name="violation_of_Greek_territory"></a>violation of Greek territory by the Bulgarian troops,
as might be expected, has not led to any effective protest from
King Constantine. On the contrary, one seems to hear this
benevolent neutral deprecating any apology on the part of King
Ferdinand: &quot;Please make yourself at home. This is Liberty
Hall.&quot;</p>

<p>It is otherwise with the irruption of the Russians under
<a name="General_Brusiloff"></a>General Brusiloff. His great offensive is a source of offence to
the Austrians, who have good reason to complain that the
&quot;steam-roller&quot; is exceeding the speed limit. Or to change the
metaphor, the bear and his tormentor have changed places.</p>

<p>Ireland has receded a little from her place in the limelight,
and though debates on martial law continue, and Irish members
ask an inordinate number of questions arising out of the hot
Easter week in Dublin, the temperature is no longer &quot;98 in
the shade&quot; as a local wit described it at the time. Ministers
are extremely economical of information: the anticipated
settlement still hangs fire, and there are increasing fears that
it will not hold water.</p>

<p>A number of professional fortune-tellers have been fined at
Southend for having predicted Zeppelins. The fraudulent nature
of their pretensions was sufficiently manifest, since even the
authorities had been unable to foresee the Zeppelins until some
time after they had arrived.</p>

<p>The discussions in Parliament and out of it of the way in
which things get into the papers which oughtn't to, are dying
down. A daily paper, however, has revived them by the headline,
&quot;Cabinet leekage.&quot; Now, why, in wonder, do they spell
it in that way?</p>

<p><a name="incarnations_of_women"></a>It is quite impossible to keep pace with all the new
incarnations of women in war-time--'bus-conductress,
ticket-collector, lift-girl, club waitress, post-woman, bank clerk,

is nothing new in the function of ministering angel: the
myriad nurses in hospital here or abroad are only carrying out,
though in greater numbers than ever before, what has always
been woman's mission.<a name="proud_and_delighted"></a> But whenever he sees one of these new
citizens, or hears fresh stories of their address and ability,
Mr. Punch is proud and delighted. Perhaps in the past, even
in the present, he may have been, or even still is, a little given
to chaff Englishwomen for some of their foibles, and even their
aspirations. But he never doubted how splendid they were at
heart; he never for a moment supposed they would be anything
but ready and keen when the hour of need struck.</p>

<p><a name="battle_of_the_somme"></a>On the home front we have long been accustomed to the
sound of guns, small and great, but it has come from
training camps and inspires confidence rather than
anxiety. We have been spared the horrors of invasion,
occupation, wholesale devastation. In certain areas the noise
of bombs and anti-aircraft guns has grown increasingly familiar,
and on our south-east and east coasts war from the air, on the
sea, and under the sea has become more and more audible as
the months pass by. But July has brought us a new experience--the
sound fifty or sixty miles inland in peaceful rural
England, amid glorious midsummer weather, of the continual
throbbing night and day of the great guns on the Somme, where
our first great offensive opened on the 1st, and has continued
with solid and substantial gains, some set-backs, heavy losses
for the Allies, still heavier for the enemy. Names of villages
and towns, which hitherto have been to most of us mere names
on the map, have now become luminous through shining deeds
of glory and sacrifice--Contalmaison and Mametz, Delville
Wood, Thiepval and Beaumont-Hamel, Serre and Pozi&egrave;res.</p>

<p>The victory, for victory it is, has not been celebrated in the
German way. England takes her triumphs as she takes defeats,
without a sign of having turned a hair:</p>

<blockquote>Yet we are proud because at last, at last<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We look upon the dawn of our desire;<br>
Because the weary waiting-time is passed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have tried our temper in the fire;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And proving word by deed<br>
Have kept the faith we pledged to France at need.<br>
<br>
But most because, from mine and desk and mart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Springing to face a task undreamed before,<br>
Our men, inspired to play their prentice part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like soldiers lessoned in the school of war,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True to their breed and name,<br>
Went flawless through the fierce baptismal flame.<br>
<br>
And he who brought these armies into life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And on them set the impress of his will--<br>
Could he be moved by sound of mortal strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There where he lies, their Captain, cold and still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the shrouding tide,<br>
How would his great heart stir and glow with pride!<br></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Punch finds the usual difficulty in getting any details
from his correspondents when they have been or are in the
thick of the fighting. Practically all that they have to say is
that there was a &quot;damned noise,&quot; that breakfast was delayed
by the &quot;morning hate,&quot; or that an angry sub besought a weary
O.C. &quot;to ask our gunners not to serve faults into our front
line wire.&quot; One of them, however, a very wise young man,
ventures on the prediction that the War will last well into 1918.
As the result of a brief leave he has learned an important truth.
&quot;In England they assume that you, having just arrived from
France, <i>know</i>. When you return to France, it is assumed that

<p>In Parliament Ireland is beginning to suffer from a rival in
unenviable notoriety. Mesopotamia does not smell particularly
sweet just now, but that may add to its usefulness as a red
herring. Geographers are said to have some difficulty in
defining its exact boundaries, but the Government are probably
quite convinced that it is situate between the Devil and the
Deep Sea. Two <a name="Special_Commissions"></a>Special Commissions are to be set up to
inquire into the Mesopotamian and Dardanelles Expeditions.
Public opinion has been painfully stirred by the harrowing
details which have come to light of the preventible sufferings
endured by British troops. From their point of view the
supply of their medical needs, now guaranteed, is worth a
wilderness of Special Commissions. But Ireland still holds
the floor, though Mr. Asquith is frugal of information as to
the prospective Irish Bill and has deprecated discussion of
the <a name="Hardinge_Report"></a>Hardinge Report, the most scarifying public document of
our times. The Lords, unembarrassed by any embargo, have
discussed the Report in a spirit which must make Mr. Birrell
thank his stars that he got in his confession first. But why,
he may ask, should he be judged by Lord Hardinge, himself
a prospective defendant at the bar of public opinion?</p>

<p>Following the lead of a certain section of the Press, certain
Members have begun to wax vocal on the subject of reprisals,
uninterned Aliens, and the Hidden Hand. Their appeals to
the Home Office to go on the spy-trail have not met with much
sympathy so far. An alleged Austrian taxi-driver has turned
out to be a harmless Scotsman with an impediment in his
speech. More interesting has been the sudden re-emergence
of <a name="Mr._John_Burns"></a>Mr. John Burns. He sank without a trace two years ago,
but has now bobbed up to denounce the proposal to strengthen
the Charing Cross railway-bridge. We could have wished
that he had been ready to &quot;keep the bridge&quot; in another sense;
but at least he has been a silent Pacificist. Mr. Winston
Churchill, when his journalistic labours permit, has contributed
to the debates, and <a name="Lord_Haldane_education"></a>Lord Haldane has again delivered his
famous lecture on the defects of English education. But for
Parliamentary sagacity <i>in excelsis</i> commend us to Mr.
McCallum Scott. He is seriously perturbed about the shortage
of sausage-skins and, in spite of the bland assurance of Mr.
Harcourt that supplies are ample, is alleged to be planning a
fresh campaign with the assistance of Mr. Hogge. Another
shortage has given rise to no anxiety, but rather the reverse. In
a police court it was recently stated that there are no longer any
<a name="tramps_in_England"></a>tramps in England. Evidently the appeal of that stirring old
song, &quot;Tramp! tramp! tramp! the boys are marching,&quot; has
not been without its effect.</p>

<h4>CONJURER (unconscious of the approach of hostile aircraft): &quot;Now, Ladies
and Gentlemen, I want you to watch me closely.&quot;]</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Yet another endurable shortage is
reported from the seaside, where an old sailor on the local sea
front has been lamenting the spiritual starvation brought about
by the war. &quot;Why,&quot; he said, &quot;for the first time for twenty
years we ain't got no performing fleas down here.&quot; And performers,
when they do come, are not always successful in
riveting the attention of their audience.</p>

<h2><i><a name="August,_1916"></a>August, 1916</i>.</h2>

<p>The third year of the War opens well for the Allies; so
well that the Kaiser has again issued a <a name="statement_denying"></a>statement denying
that he is responsible for it. The Big Push on the
Somme goes on steadily, thanks to fine leadership, the steadfast
heroism of the New Armies, and the loyal co-operation of the
munition-workers at home, who have deferred their holiday
rather than hamper their brothers in the trenches by a lessened
output.</p>

<p>Here one fact may suffice as a sample. The weekly consumption
of high explosives by the Army is now between eleven
and twelve thousand times as much as it was in September,
1914. Yet when a lieutenant is asked to state what it is really
like being along with the B.E.F. when it is in its pushful
mood, he sedulously eschews heroics, and will not commit
himself to saying more than that it's all right--that he doesn't
think there is any cause for anxiety. &quot;We seem to have ceased
to have sensations out here. It is a matter of business; the only
question is how long is it going to take to complete.&quot; So, too,
with the Tommies. &quot;Wonderful,&quot; declares the man in the
ranks to persistent seekers after thrilling descriptions of
war. &quot;You never see the like. Across in them trenches there
was real soda-water in bottles.&quot; To return to our lieutenant,
he &quot;simply can't help being a little sorry for the Boche now that
his wild oats are coming home to roost.&quot; Even his poetic
friends, formerly soulful and precious, take this restrained view.
The Attributes of the Enemy are thus summed up by one
trench bard:</p>

<blockquote>If Boches laughed and Huns were gents,<br>
They'd own their share of continents;<br>
There'd be no fuss, and, what is more,<br>
There wouldn't even be a war.<br>
Whereas the end of all this tosh<br>
Can only be there'll be no Boche.<br></blockquote>

<a name="THE_BIG_PUSH"></a>
<center><img src="images/118.png" alt="THE BIG PUSH"></center>
<h4>THE BIG PUSH<br>
<br>
MUNITION WORKER: &quot;Well, I'm not taking a holiday myself just
yet, but I'm sending these kids of mine for a little trip on the
Continent.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Another poet, an R.F.C. man, adopts the same vein, void
alike of hate or exultation:</p>

<blockquote>Returning from my morning fly<br>
I met a Fokker in the sky,<br>
And, judging from its swift descent,<br>
It had a nasty accident.<br>
On thinking further of the same<br>
I rather fear I was to blame.<br></blockquote>

<p>It is easy to understand why the enemy nations find
England so disappointing and unsatisfying to be at war
with.</p>

<p>Italy, too, has had her Big Push on the <a name="Isonzo"></a>Isonzo, capturing
Monte Sabotino, which had defied her for fifteen months, and
Gorizia--a triumph of scientific preparation and intrepid
assault. The Austrian poison-gas attack on the Asiago plateau
has been avenged, and the objectives of the long and ineffectual
offensive of the previous winter carried with thousands of
prisoners at a comparatively cheap price. To add to Austria's
humiliation her armies on the Eastern Front have been placed
under the Prussian <a name="Hindenbur"></a>Hindenburg.<a name="Rumania"></a> And Rumania has joined
the Allies at the end of what has been a very bad month for
the Central Empires. English newspapers have been excluded
from Germany, and Berlin has added truthless to meatless days.
But the Germans have long since found a <a name="substitute"></a>substitute for
veracity as well as for leather and butter and rubber and bread.
They are said to have found a substitute for International Law,
and it is an open secret that they are even now in search of
a substitute for victory. We might even suggest a few more
substitutes which have not yet been utilised. As, for example,
a substitute for Verdun with the German flag flying over it;
substitutes for several German Colonies; a substitute for
Austria as an ally; and substitutes for Kultur and Organisation
and Efficiency and World Power and the Mailed Fist
and the Crown Prince and the Kaiser and the War and
all the things that haven't come off.</p>

<p>Various momentous decisions have been arrived at in Parliament.
The Cabinet are <i>not</i> to be cinematographed, and
unnecessary taxi-whistling is to be suppressed, without any
prejudice to the squealing of importunate chatterers below the
gangway. Ireland has again dominated the Parliamentary
scene; the Nationalists have resumed their freedom of action
with <a name="attacks_on_Sir_John"></a>attacks on Sir John Maxwell and martial law, and are
displaying an embarrassing industry reminiscent of the
'Eighties. Mr. Ginnell has been removed by order of the
Speaker; Mr. Duke has succeeded Mr. Birrell; and the discussion
of three Irish Bills has bulked so large that one might
almost forget we were at war. In such brief moments as could
be spared from Irish affairs the Premier has proposed a fresh
Vote of Credit for 450 millions, has introduced a Bill for extending
the <a name="life_of_Parliament"></a>life of Parliament, and another establishing a new
Register. The last has been unmercifully belaboured in
debate, the Prime Minister himself describing it as &quot;a halting,
lopsided, temporary makeshift.&quot; The apparently insoluble
problem is that of enabling soldiers in the trenches to exercise
the franchise. Soldiers and sailors can very well wait for their
votes, but not for their money, and the delays in providing
pensions for discharged men have been condemned by members
of all parties. So the War is not altogether forgotten by the
House. Mr. Lloyd George, the new <a name="War_Secretary"></a>War Secretary, without
wasting breath on the pessimistic comments of his colleague
Mr. Churchill, has given an encouraging survey of the general
situation. The cry has gone up that Mr. Hughes Must Come
Back from Australia, and Mr. Swift MacNeill has been rewarded
for his pertinacity by extracting a promise from Mr. Asquith
that he will <a name="purge_the_Peerage_of_its_enemy_Dukes"></a>purge the Peerage of its enemy Dukes. Better still
is the solemn assurance of the Premier that the Government
are taking steps to discover the identity of all those who are in
any way responsible for the judicial murder of <a name="Captain_Fryatt"></a>Captain Fryatt--the
worst instance of calculated atrocity against non-combatants
since the murder of Nurse Cavell.</p>

<p>The <a name="education_of_our_New_Armies"></a>education of our New Armies is full of strange and
noble surprises. Now it is an ex-shop boy converted into an
R.H.A. driver. Or again it is a Tommy learning to appreciate
the heroism of a French peasant woman:</p>

<blockquote>'Er bloke's out scrappin' with the rest,<br>

<p>Or once more it is the young officer shaving himself in a
captured German dug-out before an old looking-glass looted
from a <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> by a dead German, and apologising to its
rightful owner:</p>

<blockquote>Madame, at the end of this long campaign,<br>
When France comes into her own again<br>
In the setting where only she can shine,<br>
As you in your mirror of rare design--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me, who dare<br>

<a name="Combles"></a>
<p>September has brought us good tidings by land and air.
Thiepval and Combles are ours, and the <a name="plague_of_the_Zeppelins"></a>plague of the Zeppelins
has been stayed. The <a name="downing_of_the_Zepp_at_Cuffley"></a>downing of the Zepp at Cuffley by
Lieutenant Robinson gave North London the most thrilling
aerial spectacle ever witnessed. There has been much diversity
of opinion as to the safest place to be in during a Zeppelin
raid--under cover or in the open, on the top floor or in the
basement; but recent experiences suggest that by far the
most dangerous place on those occasions is in a Zeppelin.
<a name="coming_of_the_Tanks"></a>But perhaps the most momentous event of the month has been
the coming of the Tanks, a most humorous and formidable
addition to the <i>fauna</i> of the battlefield--half battleship, half
caterpillar--which have given the Germans the surprise of their
lives, a surprise all the more effective for being sudden and
complete. The Germans, no doubt, have their surprise packets
in store for us, but we can safely predict that they are not likely
to be at once so comic and so efficient as these unlovely but
painstaking monsters. As an officer at the front writes to a
friend: &quot;These animals look so dreadfully competent, I am
quite sure they can swim. Thus, any day now, as you go to
your business in the City, you may meet one of them trundling
up Ludgate Hill, looking like nothing on earth and not
behaving like a gentleman.&quot; As for the relations between the
Allies in the field the same correspondent contributes some
enlightening details. The French aren't English and the
English aren't French, and difficulties are bound to arise. The
course of true love never did run smooth. Here it started, as
it generally does, with a rush; infatuation was succeeded by
friction, and that in turn by the orthodox aftermath of reconciliation.
&quot;How do we stand now? We have settled down
to one of those attachments which have such an eternity before
them in the future that they permit of no gushing in the
present.&quot; <a name="active_participation"></a>The War goes well on the Western Front, the worst

<h2><i><a name="October,_1916"></a>October, 1916</i>.</h2>

<p><a name="Mr._Punch's_correspondents"></a>Mr. Punch's correspondents at the Front have an incorrigible
habit of euphemism and levity. Even when
things go well they are never betrayed into heroics, but
adhere to the schoolboy formula of &quot;not half bad,&quot; just as in the
blackest hours they would not admit that things were more than
&quot;pretty beastly.&quot; Yet sometimes they deviate for a moment into
really enlightening comment. No better summary of the situation
as it stands in the third year of the War can be given than
in the words of the faithful &quot;Watch-dog,&quot; who has long been
on duty in trench and dug-out and crater-hole:--</p>

<p>&quot;This War has ceased to become an occupation befitting a
gentleman--gentleman, that is, of the true Prussian breed. It
was a happy and honourable task so long as it consisted of
civilising the world at large with high explosive, poisonous
gas and burning oil, and the world at large was not too ready
to answer back. To persist in this stern business, in face of the
foolish and ignoble obstinacy of the adversary, required great
courage and strength of mind; but the Prussian is essentially
courageous and strong. Things came to a pretty pass, however,
when the wicked adversary made himself some guns and shells
and took to being stern on his own. People who behave like
that, especially after they have been conquered, are not to be
mixed with--anything to keep aloof from such. One had to
leave Combles, one had to leave Thiepval, one may even have
to leave Bapaume to avoid the pest; these nasty French and
English persons, with their disgusting tanks, intrude everywhere
nowadays.&quot; The German engineer is being hoist with
his own petard:</p>

<blockquote>Yet you may suck sweet solace from the thought<br>
&nbsp;That not in vain the seed was sown,<br>
That half the recent havoc we have wrought<br>
&nbsp;Was based on methods all your own;<br>
And smile to hear our heavy batteries<br>
Pound you with imitation's purest flatteries.<br></blockquote>

<p>Yet, at best, this is sorry comfort for the Kaiser.</p>


<p>It is not a picnic for the men in our front line. Reports
that the situation is &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;quiet&quot; or &quot;uneventful&quot;
represent more or less correctly what is happening at G.H.Q.,
Divisional Headquarters, Brigade Headquarters, or even Battalion
Headquarters. They represent understatement to the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup>
when applied to the front trenches. But listen again to the
&quot;Watch-dog.&quot; He admits that some of our diamonds are not
smooth, but adds &quot;for myself I welcome every touch of nature
in these our warriors. It is good to be in the midst of them,
for they thrive as never before, and their comforts are few
enough these wet bloody days.&quot;</p>

As for his future, Mr. Punch ventures on a prediction:</p>

<blockquote>Tino, if some day Hellas should arise<br>

<p>Members have
returned to St.
Stephen's refreshed
by seven
weeks' holiday,
and the Nationalists have been recruiting their energies, but unfortunately
nothing else, in <a name="Ireland"></a>Ireland. By way of signalising his
restoration, after an apology, Mr. Ginnell handed in
thirty-nine questions--the fruits of his enforced leisure.
The woes of the interned Sinn Feiners who have been
condemned to sleep in a disused distillery at Frongoch have
been duly brought forward and the House invited to declare that
&quot;the system of government at present maintained in Ireland
is inconsistent with the principles for which the Allies are
fighting in Europe.&quot; The system of administration in Ireland
is, and always has been, inconsistent with any settled principles
whatsoever; but to propose such a motion now is equivalent
to affirming that Ireland is being treated by Great Britain as
Belgium and Poland and Serbia have been treated by Germany.
Mr. Redmond made no attempt to prove this absurd thesis,
but when he demanded that martial law should be withdrawn
and the interned rebels let loose in a Home-ruled Ireland--while
the embers of the rebellion were still dangerously
smouldering--he asked too much even of that amicable and
trustful beast, the British Lion. Mr. Duke is not exactly a
sparkling orator, but he said one thing which needed saying,
namely, that Irishmen ought to work out a scheme of Home
Rule for themselves, and lay it before Parliament, instead of
expecting Englishmen to do their work for them and then complaining
of the result. In the division-lobby the Nationalists
received the assistance of some forty or fifty British Members,
who supported the motion, Mr. Punch suspects, more out of
hatred of the Coalition than of love for Ireland. But they were
easily out-voted by British Home Rulers alone. The impression
left by the debate was that the Nationalist Members had a
great deal more sympathy with the Sinn Feiners than they had
with the innocent victims of the rebellion.</p>

<p><a name="Monastir_has_been_recaptured"></a>Monastir has been recaptured by the Serbians and French;
but Germany has had her victories too, and, continuing her
warfare against the Red Cross, has sunk <a name="two_hospital_ships"></a>two hospital ships.
Germany's U-boat policy is going to win her the War. At
least so Marshal Hindenburg says, and the view is shared by
that surprising person the neutral journalist. But in the meantime
it subjects the affections of the neutral sailorman to a
severe trial.</p>

<p>King Constantine, however, remains unshaken in his
devotion to German interests. <a name="University_Professors"></a>He has also shown marked
originality by making up a Cabinet exclusively composed of
University Professors. But some critics scent in his action a
hint of compulsory Ministerial Service, and predict Labour
troubles.</p>

<p><a name="Food_Control"></a>At home we have to note the steady set of the tide of public
opinion in favour of Food Control. The name of the Dictator
is not yet declared, but the announcement cannot be long
postponed. Whoever he may be, he is not to be envied. We
have also to note the steady growth on every side of
<a name="Government_bungalows"></a>Government bungalows--the haunts (if some critics are to be believed) of the
Great Uncombed, even of the Hidden Hand. The <a name="men_of_forty-one"></a>men of forty-one
were not wanted last March. Mr. Lloyd George tells
us that they are wanted now, or it would mean the loss of two
Army Corps. The Germans, by the way, appear to be arriving
at a just conception of their relative value. <a name="English_civilian_prisoners"></a>Lord Newton has
informed the Lords that the enemy is prepared to release 600
English civilian prisoners in return for some 4,000 to 7,000
Germans. Parliament has developed a new grievance:
Ministers have confided to Pressmen information denied to
M.P.'s. And a cruel wrong has been done to Erin, according
to Mr. Dillon, by the application of <a name="Greenwich_time"></a>Greenwich time to Ireland,
by which that country has been compelled to surrender its
precious privilege of being twenty-five minutes behind the
times. The injustice is so bitter that it has reconciled Mr. Dillon
and Mr. Healy.</p>

<p><a name="Secret_Session"></a>The Premier has hinted that if the House insisted on having
fuller information than it receives at present another Secret Session
might be held. When one considers the vital problems
on which Parliament now concentrates its energies--the supply
of cocaine to dentists, the withholding of pictures of the Tanks,
etc.--one feels that there should be a Secret Session at least once
a week. Indeed, if the House were to sit permanently with
closed doors, unobserved and unreported, the country might be
all the better for it.</p>

<br><br>
<p>It is the fashion in some quarters to make out that fathers
do not realise the sacrifice made by their sons, but complacently
acquiesce in it while they sit comfortably at home over the fire.
Mr. Punch has not met these fathers. The fathers--and still
more the mothers--that he knows recognise only too well the
unpayable nature of their debt.</p>

<blockquote>They held, against the storms of fate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In war's tremendous game,<br>
A little land inviolate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a world of flame.<br>
<br>
They looked on scarred and ruined lands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On shell-wrecked fields forlorn,<br>
And gave to us, with open hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full fields of yellow corn;<br>
<br>
The silence wrought in wood and stone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose aisles our fathers trod;<br>
The pines that stand apart, alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sentinels of God.<br>
<br>
With generous hands they paid the price,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious of the cost,<br>
But we must gauge the sacrifice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By all that they have lost.<br>
<br>
The joy of young adventurous ways,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of keen and undimmed sight,<br>
The eager tramp through sunny days,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreamless sleep of night,<br>
<br>
The happy hours that come and go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In youth's untiring quest,<br>
They gave, because they willed it so,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With some light-hearted jest.<br>
<br>
No lavish love of future years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No passionate regret,<br>
No gift of sacrifice or tears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can ever pay the debt.<br></blockquote>

<p>Yet if ever you try to express this indebtedness to the
wonderful young men who survive, they turn the whole thing
into a jest and tell you, for example, that only two things really
interest them, &quot;Europe and their stomachs&quot;--nothing in
between matters.</p>

 <a name="Defence_of_the_Realm_Act"></a>
<p>Guy Fawkes Day has come and gone without fireworks,
pursuant to the Defence of the Realm Act. Even Parliament
omitted to sit. Apropos of Secret Sessions, Lord Northcliffe has
been accused of having had one all to himself and some five
hundred other gentlemen at a club luncheon. The <i>Daily Mail</i> describes the debate on the subject as a &quot;gross waste of time,&quot;
which seems to come perilously near <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;!</i> But then, as
a writer in the <i>Evening News</i>--another Northcliffe paper--safely
observes, &quot;It is the failing of many people to say what
they think without thinking.&quot;</p>

<h2><i><a name="December,_1916"></a>December, 1916</i>.</h2>

<p>Rumania has unhappily given Germany the chance of a
cheap and spectacular triumph--of which, after being
badly pounded on the Somme, she was sorely in need.
Here was a comparatively small nation, whom the Germans
could crush under their heel as they had crushed Belgium and
Serbia. So in Rumania they concentrated all the men they
could spare from other fronts and put them under their best
generals. Their first plans were thwarted, but eventually the
big guns had their way and <a name="Bukarest_fell"></a>Bukarest fell. Then, after the usual
display of bunting and joy-bells in Berlin, was the moment to
make a noble offer of peace. The German <a name="peace_overtures"></a>peace overtures remind
one of Mr. Punch's correspondents of the American
advertisement: &quot;If John Robinson, with whose wife I eloped
six months ago, will take her back, all will be forgiven.&quot;</p>

<p>The shadowy proposals of those who preach humanity while
they practise unrestricted frightfulness have not deceived the
Allies. They know, and have let the enemy know, that they
must go on until they have made sure of an enduring peace by
reducing the Central Empires to impotence for evil.</p>

<p>When Mr. Asquith announced in the House on December 4
the King's approval of Reconstruction, few Members guessed that
in twenty-four hours he would have <a name="ceased_to_be_Prime_Minister"></a>ceased to be Prime Minister
and that Mr. Lloyd George would have begun Cabinet-making.
There has been much talk of intrigue. But John Bull doesn't
care who leads the country so long as he leads it to victory.
And as for Certain People Somewhere in France, we shall
probably not be far wrong in interpreting their view of the
present change as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Thank God, we keep no politicians here;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting's our game, not talking; all we ask<br>
Is men and means to face the coming year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And consummate our task.<br>
<br>
Give us the strongest leaders you can find,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tory or Liberal, not a toss care we,<br>
So they are swift to act and know their mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too well to wait and see.<br></blockquote>

<p><a name="Press_Campaign"></a>The ultimate verdict on Mr. Asquith's services to the State
as Prime Minister for the first two and a half years of the
War will not be founded on the Press Campaign which has
helped to secure his downfall. But, as one of the most bitterly
and unjustly assailed ex-Ministers has said, &quot;personal reputations
must wait till the end of the War.&quot; Meanwhile, we have
a Premier who, whatever his faults, cannot be charged with
supineness.</p>

first appearance as Chancellor of the Exchequer. <a name="daily_cost_of_the_War"></a>Moving a

that the daily cost of the War was nearer six than five millions.
In regard to the peace proposals he found himself unable to
better the late Prime Minister's statement that the Allies would
require &quot;adequate reparation for the past and adequate security
for the future.&quot; In lucidity and dignity of statement Mr.
Asquith was certainly above criticism. <a name="Lord_Devonport"></a>Lord Devonport has
been appointed Food Controller and warned us of rigours to
come. The <a name="most_thrilling_speech"></a>most thrilling speech heard at Westminster this
month has been that of Major Willie Redmond, fresh from the
invigorating atmosphere of the front. While some seventy odd
Nationalist Members are mainly occupied in brooding over
Ireland's woes, two are serving in the trenches--William
Redmond and Stephen Gwynn, both of them middle-aged men.
<i>O si sic omnes</i>!</p>

<p>Our wounded need all their patience to put up with the
curiosity of non-combatants. A lady, after asking a Tommy
on leave what the stripes on his arm were for, being told that
they were one for each time he was wounded, is reported to
have observed, &quot;Dear me! How extraordinary that you should
be wounded three times in the same place!&quot; Even real affection
is not always happily expressed.</p>

of Commerce are diverted from their own business for the
benefit of the country. In spite of all rumours to the contrary
Lord Northcliffe remains outside the new Government, but his
interest in it is, at present, friendly. It is very well understood,
however, that everyone must behave. And in this context Mr.
Punch feels that a tribute is due to the outgoing Premier.
Always reserved and intent, he discouraged Press gossip to
such a degree as actually to have turned the key on the Tenth
Muse. Interviewers had no chance. He came into office, held
it and left it without a single concession to Demos' love of
personalia.</p>

<h4>THE DAWN OF DOUBT<br>
<br>
GRETCHEN: &quot;I wonder if this gentleman really is my good angel
after all!&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Germany has not yet changed her Chancellor, though he is
being bitterly attacked for his &quot;silly ideas of humanity&quot;--and
her rulers have certainly shown no change of heart. General
von Bissing's <a name="retirement_from_Belgium"></a>retirement from Belgium is due to health, not
repentance. The Kaiser still <a name="talks_of_his_&quot;conscience&quot;"></a>talks of his &quot;conscience&quot; and
&quot;courage&quot; in freeing the world from the pressure which
weighs upon all. He is still the same Kaiser and Constantine
the same &quot;Tino,&quot; who, as the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> bluntly
remarks, &quot;has as much right to be heard as a common
criminal.&quot; Yet signs are not wanting of misgivings in the
German people.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson has launched <a name="a_new_phrase"></a>a new phrase on the world--&quot;Peace
without Victory&quot;; but War is not going to be
ended by phrases, and the man who is doing more than anyone
else to end it--the British infantryman--has no use for
them:</p>

<blockquote>The gunner rides on horseback, he lives in luxury,<br>
The sapper has his dug-out as cushy as can be,<br>
The flying man's a sportsman, but his home's a long way back,<br>
In painted tent or straw-spread barn or cosy little shack;<br>
Gunner and sapper and flying man (and each to his job say I)<br>
Have tickled the Hun with mine or gun or bombed him from on high,<br>
But the quiet work, and the dirty work, since ever the War began,<br>
Is the work that never shows at all, the work of the infantryman.<br>
<br>
The guns can pound the villages and smash the trenches in,<br>
And the Hun is fain for home again when the T.M.B.s begin,<br>
And the Vickers gun is a useful one to sweep a parapet,<br>
But the real work is the work that's done with bomb and bayonet.<br>
Load him down from heel to crown with tools and grub and kit,<br>
He's always there where the fighting is--he's there unless he's hit;<br>
Over the mud and the blasted earth he goes where the living can;<br>
He's in at the death while he yet has breath, the British   infantryman!<br>
<br>
Trudge and slip on the shell-hole's lip, and fall in the clinging mire--<br>
Steady in front, go steady! Close up there! Mind the wire!<br>
Double behind where the pathways wind! Jump clear of the ditch, jump clear!<br>
Lost touch at the back? Oh, halt in front! And duck when the shells come near!<br>
Carrying parties all night long, all day in a muddy trench,<br>
With your feet in the wet and your head in the rain and the sodden khaki's stench!<br>
Then over the top in the morning, and onward all you can--<br>
This is the work that wins the War, the work of the infantryman.<br></blockquote>

<p>And if anyone should think that this means the permanent
establishment of militarism in our midst let him be comforted
by the saying of an old sergeant-major when asked to give a
character of one of his men. &quot;He's a good man in the trenches,
and a good man in a scrap; but you'll never make a soldier of
him.&quot; The new armies fight all the harder because they want
to make an end not of this war but of all wars. As for the
regulars, there is no need to enlarge on their valour.<a name="officer's_servant"></a> But it is
pleasant to put on record the description of an officer's servant
which has reached Mr. Punch from France: &quot;Valet, cook,
porter, boots, chamber-maid, ostler, carpenter, upholsterer,
mechanic, inventor, needlewoman, coalheaver, diplomat,
barber, linguist (home-made), clerk, universal provider, complete
pantechnicon and infallible bodyguard, he is also a
soldier, if a very old soldier, and a man of the most human
kind.&quot;</p>

<p>Parliament is not sitting, but there is, unfortunately, no
truth in the report that in order to provide billets for 5,000 new
typists and incidentally to win the War, the Government has
commandeered the Houses of Parliament. The <i>Times Literary
Supplement</i> received 335 books of original verse in 1916, and it
is rumoured that Mr. Edward Marsh may very shortly take up
his duties as Minister of Poetry and the Fine Arts. Mr. Marsh
has not yet decided whether he will appoint Mr. Asquith or
Mr. Winston Churchill as his private secretary. Meanwhile,
a full list of the private secretaries of the new private secretaries
of the members of the new Government may at any moment be
disclosed to a long suffering public.</p>

<p>On the Home Front the situation shows that a famous
literary critic was also a true prophet:</p>

<blockquote>O Matthew Arnold! You were right:<br>
We need more Sweetness and more Light;<br>
For till we break the brutal foe,<br>
Our sugar's short, our lights are low.<br></blockquote>

<p>The <a name="domestic_problem"></a>domestic problem daily grows more acute. A maid,
who asked for a rise in her wages to which her mistress
demurred, explained that the gentleman she walked out with
had just got a job in a munition factory and she would be
obliged to dress up to him.</p>

<center><img src="images/147.png" alt="COOK (who, after interview with prospective mistress, is going to think it over)"></center>

meself to 'ave come.&quot;<br>

THE PROSPECTIVE MISTRESS: &quot; Oh! B-but if you think the place would otherwise
suit you, I dare say we could board the children out.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Maids are human, however, though their <a name="psychology"></a>psychology is
sometimes disconcerting. One who was told by her mistress
not to worry because her young man had gone into the trenches
responded cheerfully, &quot;Oh, no, ma'am, I've left off worrying

<h2><i><a name=">February,_1917."></a>February, 1917</i>.</h2>

<p>The rulers of Germany--the Kaiser and his War-lords--proclaimed
themselves the enemies of the human race in
the first weeks of the War. But it has taken two years
and a half to break down the apparently inexhaustible patience
of the greatest of the neutrals. A year and three-quarters has
elapsed since the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>. The forbearance of
President Wilson--in the face of accumulated insults, interference
in the internal politics of the United States, the promotion
of strikes and <i>sabotage</i> by the agents of Count
Bernstorff--has exposed him to hard and even bitter criticism
from his countrymen. Perhaps he over-estimated the strength
of the German-American and Pacificist elements. But his
difficulties are great, and his long suffering diplomacy has at
least this merit, that if America enters the War it will be as a
united people. Germany's decision to resort to unrestricted
submarine warfare on February 1 is the last straw: now even
<a name="Mr._Henry_Ford"></a>Mr. Henry Ford has offered to place his works at the disposal
of the American authorities.</p>

<p>Day by day we read long lists of merchant vessels sunk by
U-boats, and while the Admiralty's reticence on the progress
of the anti-submarine campaign is legitimate and necessary,
the withholding of statistics of new construction does not make
for optimism. Victory will be ours, but not without effort. The
great crisis of the War is not passed. That has been the burden
of all the speeches at the opening of Parliament from the
King's downward.</p>

<p>Lord Curzon, who declared that we were now approaching
&quot;the supreme and terrible climax of the War,&quot; has spoken of
the late Duke of Norfolk as a man &quot;diffident about powers
which were in excess of the ordinary.&quot; Is not that true of the
British race as a whole? Only now, under the stress of a
long-drawn-out conflict, is it discovering the variety and strength of
its latent forces. <a name="Mesopotamia"></a>The tide is turning rapidly in Mesopotamia.
<a name="Kut"></a>General Maude, who never failed to inspire the men under his
command on the Western front with a fine offensive spirit, has
already justified his appointment by capturing Kut, and starting
on a great drive towards Baghdad.</p>

<br><br>
<p>At home the commandeering of hotels to house the new
Ministries proceeds apace, and a request from an inquiring peer
for a comprehensive return of all the buildings requisitioned
and the staffs employed has been declined on the ground that
to provide it would put too great a strain on officials engaged
on work essential to winning the War.</p>

<p>The criticisms on the late Cabinet for its bloated size have
certainly not led to any improvement in this respect, and one
of the late Ministers has complained that the Administration
has been further magnified until, if all its members, including
under-secretaries, were present, they would fill not one but
three Treasury Benches. Already this is a much congested
district at question-time and the daily scene of a great push.
Up to the present there are, however, only thirty-three actual
Ministers of the Crown, and their salaries only amount to the
trifle of &pound;133,000. The setting up of a<a name="War_Cabinet"></a> War Cabinet, &quot;a body
utterly unknown to the law,&quot; has excited the resentment of
Mr. Swift MacNeill, whose reverence for the Constitution (save
in so far as it applies to Ireland) knows no bounds; and Mr.
Lynch has expressed the view that it would be a good idea if
Ireland were specially represented at the Peace Conference, in
order that her delegates might assert her right to self-government.</p>

<p>England, in February, 1917, seems to deserve the title of &quot;the
great Loan Land.&quot; Amateurs of anagrams have found satisfaction in
the identity of &quot;Bonar Law&quot; with &quot;War Loan B.&quot; As a
cynic has remarked, &quot;in the midst of life we are in debt.&quot; But
the champions of national economy are not happy. The staff of the new
Pensions Minister, it is announced, will be over two thousand. It is
still hoped, however, that there may be a small surplus which can be
devoted to the needs of disabled soldiers. Our great warriors are in
danger of being swamped by our small but innumerable officials.</p>

the legend of the &quot;Little Father.&quot; <a name="Rasputin"></a>But the forces of &quot;unholy
Russia&quot;--Pro-German Ministers and the sinister figure of Rasputin--have
combined to his undoing, and now none is so
poor to do him reverence. In the House of Commons everybody
seems pleased, including Mr. Devlin, who has been quite statesmanlike
in his appreciation, and the Prime Minister, in one of
his angelic visits to the House, evoked loud cheers by describing
the Revolution as one of the landmarks in the history of the
world. But no one noticed that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's
outburst in 1906, just after the dissolution of
Russia's first elected Parliament: &quot;<i>La Duma est morte; vive
la Duma</i>! &quot; has now been justified by the event--at any rate
for the moment, for Revolutions are rich in surprises and reactions.
The capture of Baghdad inspires no misgivings, except
in the bosoms of Nationalist members, who detect in the
manifesto issued by General Maude fresh evidences of British
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The fleet of <a name="Dutch_merchantmen"></a>Dutch merchantmen, which has been sunk by
a waiting submarine, sailed under a German guarantee of &quot;relative
security.&quot; Germany is so often misunderstood. It
should be obvious by this time that her attitude to International
Law has always been one of approximate reverence. The shells
with which she bombarded Rheims Cathedral were contingent
shells, and the <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk by a relative torpedo.
Neutrals all over the world, who are smarting just now under
a fresh manifestation of Germany's respective goodwill, should
try to realise before they take any action what is the precise
situation of our chief enemy: He has (relatively) won the War;
he has (virtually) broken the resistance of the Allies; he has
(conditionally) ample supplies for his people; in particular he
is (morally) rich in potatoes. His finances at first sight appear
to be pretty heavily involved, but that soon will be adjusted
by (hypothetical) indemnities; he has enormous (proportional)
reserves of men; he has (theoretically) blockaded Great Britain,
and his final victory is (controvertibly) at hand. But his most
impressive argument, which cannot fail to come home to
hesitating Neutrals, is to be found in his latest exhibition of
offensive power, namely, in his (putative) advance--upon the
Ancre.</p>

to the<a name="recent_losses"></a> recent losses of the Royal Flying Corps on the Western
front and the <a name="increased_activity_of_the_German_airmen"></a>increased activity of the German airmen has
created some natural depression. The command of the
air fluctuates, but the spirit of our airmen is a sure earnest
that the balance will be redressed in our favour. Mr. Punch
has already paid his tribute to the British infantryman. Let
him now do his homage to the heroes whose end is so often
disguised under the laconic announcement: &quot;One of our
machines did not return.&quot;</p>

<p>Parliament has been occupied with many matters, from the
Report of the <a name="Dardanelles_Commission"></a>Dardanelles Commission to the grievances of
Scots bee-keepers. The woes of Ireland have not been forgotten,
and the Nationalists have been busily engaged in getting
Home Rule out of cold storage. Hitherto every attempt of the
British Sisyphus to roll the Stone of Destiny up the Hill of
Tara has found a couple of Irishmen at the top ready to roll
it down again. Let us hope that this time they will co-operate
to install it there as the throne of a loyal and united Ireland.
Believers in the &quot;Hidden Hand &quot; have been on the war-path,
and as a result of prolonged discussion as to the responsibility
for the failure of the effort to force the Dardanelles, the House
is evidently of opinion that Lord Fisher might now be let alone
by foes and friends. The idea of blaming <i>Queen Elisabeth</i>
for the fiasco is so entirely satisfactory to all parties concerned
that one wonders why the Commission couldn't have thought
of that itself.</p>

<p><a name="Mr._Bernard_Shaw"></a>Mr. Bernard Shaw, returned from his &quot;joy-ride&quot; at the Front,
has declared that &quot;there is no monument more enduring than
brass&quot;; the general feeling, however, is that there is a kind
of brass that is beyond enduring. Armageddon is justified
since it has given him a perfectly glorious time. He is obliged,
in honesty, to state that the style of some of the buildings
wrecked by the Germans was quite second rate. He entered
and emerged from the battle zone without any vulgar emotion;
remaining immune from pity, sorrow, or tears. In short:</p>

<blockquote>He went through the fiery furnace, but never a hair was missed<br>
From the heels of our most colossal Arch-Super-Egotist.<br></blockquote>

<p>According to the latest news from Sofia, 35,000 Bulgarian
geese are to be allowed to go to Germany. As in the case of
the Bulgarian Fox who went to Vienna, there appears to be
little likelihood that they will ever return.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Apropos of food supplies, Lord Devonport has developed a
sense of judicial humour, having approved a <a name="new_dietary"></a>new dietary for
prisoners, under which the bread ration will be cut down to
63 ounces per week, or just one ounce less than the allowance of
the free and independent Englishman. The latest morning
greeting is now: &quot;<i>Comment vous Devonportez-vous?</i>&quot;</p>

<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>
<h2><a name="April,_1917."></a><i>April, 1917</i>.</h2>

<p>Once more the rulers of Germany have failed to read the
soul of another nation. They thought there was no
limit to America's forbearance, and they thought wrong.
<a name="America_is_now_&quot;all_in&quot;"></a>America is now &quot;all in&quot; on the side of the Allies. The Stars
and Stripes and the Union Jack are flying side by side over
the Houses of Parliament. On the motion introduced in both
Houses to welcome our new Ally, Mr. Bonar Law, paraphrasing
Canning, declared that the New World had stepped in to redress
the balance of the old; Mr. Asquith, with a fellow-feeling, no
doubt, lauded the patience which had enabled President Wilson
to carry with him a united nation; and Lord Curzon quoted
Bret Harte. The memory of some unfortunate phrases is
obliterated by the President's historic message to Congress,
and his stirring appeal to his countrymen to throw their entire
weight into the Allied scale. The War, physically as well as
morally, is now <i>Germania contra Mundum</i>. Yet, while we hail
the advent of a powerful and determined Ally, there is no
disposition to throw up our hats. The raw material of manpower
in America is magnificent in numbers and quality, but
it has to be equipped and trained and brought across the
Atlantic. Many months, perhaps a whole year, must elapse
before its weight can be felt on the battle front. The transport
of a million men over submarine-infested seas is no easy task.
But while we must wait for the coming of the Americans on
land, their help in patrolling the seas may be counted on
speedily.</p>

<p>The British have entered <a name="P&eacute;ronne"></a>P&eacute;ronne; the Canadians have
captured Vimy Ridge. But the full extent of German
frightfulness has never been so clearly displayed as in their
retreat. Here, for once, the German account of their own doings
is true. &quot;In the course of these last months great stretches
of <a name="French_territory"></a>French territory have been turned by us into a dead country.
It varies in width from 10 to 12 or 13 kilometres, and extends
along the whole of our new positions. No village or farm was
left standing, no road was left passable, no railway track or
embankment was left in being. Where once were woods, there
are gaunt rows of stumps; the wells have been blown up....
In front of our new positions runs, like a gigantic ribbon, our
Empire of Death&quot; (<i>Lokal Anzeiger</i>, March 18, 1917). The
general opinion of the Boche among the British troops is that
he is only good at one thing, and that is destroying other
people's property. One of Mr. Punch's correspondents writes
to say that while the flattened villages and severed fruit trees
are a gruesome spectacle, for him &quot;all else was forgotten in
speechless admiration of the French people.</p>

<p>&quot;Their self-restraint and adaptability are beyond words.
These hundreds of honest people, just relieved from the
domineering of the Master Swine, and restored to their own
good France again, were neither hysterical nor exhausted.&quot;<a name="Hunding"></a> The
names of the new German lines--Wotan and Siegfried and
Hunding--are not without significance. We accept the omen:
it will not be long before we hear of fresh German activities
in the <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i> line. <a name="Reventlow"></a>Count Reventlow has informed
the Kaiser that without victory a continuation of the Monarchy
is improbable. The &quot;repercussion&quot; of Revolution is making
itself felt. Even the <a name="Crown_Prince_is_reported"></a>Crown Prince is reported to have felt
misgivings as to the infection of anti-monarchial ideas, and
Mr. Punch is moved to forecast possibilities of upheaval:</p>

<blockquote>Not that the Teuton's stolid wits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are built to plan so rude a plot;<br>
Somehow I cannot picture Fritz<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Careering as a <i>sans-culotte</i>;<br>
Schooled to obedience, hand and heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine nothing odder<br>
Than such behaviour on the part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of inoffensive cannon-fodder.<br>
<br>
And yet one never really knows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot feed his massive trunk<br>
On fairy tales of beaten foes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Hindenburg's &quot;victorious&quot; bunk;<br>
And if his rations run too short<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this accursed British blockade,<br>
Even the worm may turn and sport<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A revolutionary cockade.<br></blockquote>

<p>On the German Roll of Dishonour this month appears the
name of one who has been <i>grande et conspicuum nostro quoque
tempore monstrum</i>. Baron Moritz Ferdinand <a name="von_Bissing"></a>von Bissing, the
German Military Governor-General of Belgium, who was largely
responsible for the murder of Nurse Cavell and the chief instigator
of the infamous Belgian deportations, after being granted
a rest from his labours, is reported to have died &quot;of overwork.&quot;
Here for once we find ourselves in perfect agreement with the
official German view. In a recent character sketch of the deceased
Baron, the <i>Cologne Gazette</i> observed, &quot;He is a fine
musician, and his execution was good.&quot; It would have been.</p>

<p>The proceedings in Parliament do not call for extended
comment. Mr. Asquith has handsomely recanted his
<a name="hostility_to_women's_suffrage"></a>hostility to women's suffrage, admitting that by their splendid services
in the war women have worked out their own electoral salvation.
An old spelling-book used to tell us that &quot;it is agreeable to
watch the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar when
gauging the symmetry of a peeled pear.&quot; Lord Devonport,
occupied in deciding on the exact architecture and decoration
of the Bath bun (official sealed pattern), would make a companion
picture. For the rest the House has been occupied
with the mysteries of combing and re-combing. The best War
saying of the month was that of Mr. Swift MacNeill, in reference
to proposed
peace overtures,
that it would be
time enough to
talk about peace
when the Germans
ceased to
blow up hospital
ships.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Although the streets may have been sweetened by the <a name="absence_of_posters"></a>absence of posters,
days will come, it must be remembered, when we shall badly miss
them. It goes painfully to one's heart to think that the embargo, if it
is ever lifted, will not be lifted in time for most of the events which
we all most desire -events that clamour to be recorded in the largest
black type, such as &quot;Strasbourg French Again,&quot; &quot;Flight of
the Crown Prince,&quot; &quot;Revolution in Germany,&quot; &quot;The
Kaiser a Captive,&quot; and last and best of all, &quot;Peace.&quot; But
Mr. Punch, with many others, has no sympathy to spare for the sorrows of
the headline artist deprived for the time being of his chief opportunity
of scaremongering.</p>

<p>In the competition of heroism and self-sacrifice the prize must
fall to the young--to the Tommy and the Second Lieutenant
before all. Yet a very good mark is due to the <a name="retired_Admirals"></a>retired Admirals

<p>According to the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, Mr. Lloyd George's
double was seen at Cardiff the other day. The suggestion that
there are two Lloyd Georges has caused consternation among
the German Headquarters Staff. But we are not exempt from
troubles and anxieties in England. The bones of a woolly
rhinoceros have been dug up twenty-three feet below the surface
at High Wycombe, and very strong language has been used in
the locality concerning this gross example of food-hoarding.
The weather, too, has been behaving oddly. On one day of
Eastertide there was an inch of snow in Liverpool, followed by
hailstones, lightning, thunder, and a gale of wind. Summer
has certainly arrived very early. But at least we are to be spared
a General Election this year--for fear that it might clash with
the other War.</p>

<p><a name="Food_and_Food_Production"></a>In England, once but no longer merry though not downhearted,
in this once merry month of May, the question of
Food and Food Production now dominates all others. It is
the one subject that the House of Commons seems to care about.
John Bull, who has invested a mint of money in other lands,
realises that it is high time that he put something into his own
--in the shape of Corn Bounties. <a name="Corn_Production_Bill"></a>Mr. Prothero, in moving
the second reading of the Corn Production Bill, while admitting

agriculture, showed all the zeal of the convert--to the dismay

<p>The Food Controller asks us to <a name="curtail_our_consumption"></a>curtail our consumption of
bread by one-fourth. Here, at least, non-combatants have an

<br><br>
<p>On the Western Front the German soldiers' opinion of
&quot;retirement according to plan&quot; may be expressed as &quot;each for
himself and the Devil take the Hindenburg.&quot; One of them,
recently taken prisoner, actually wrote, &quot;When we go to the
Front we become the worst criminals.&quot; This generous attempt
to shield his superiors deserves to be appreciated, but it does
not dispel the belief that the worst criminals are still a good
way behind the German lines. The inspired German Press has
now got to the point of asserting that &quot;there is no Hindenburg
line.&quot; Well, that implies prophetic sense:</p>

<blockquote>And if a British prophet may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopt their graphic present tense,<br>
I would remark--and so forestall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A truth they'll never dare to trench on--<br>
<i>There is no Hindenburg at all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or none worth mention</i>.<br></blockquote>

<p>According to our <a name="Watch_Dog_correspondent"></a>Watch Dog correspondent, recent movements
show that the lawless German &quot;has attained little by his
destructiveness save the discomfort of H.Q. Otherwise the
War progresses as merrily as ever; more merrily, perhaps,
owing to the difficulties to be overcome. Soldiers love difficulties
to overcome. That is their business in life.&quot; This is the
way that young officers write &quot;in the brief interludes snatched
from hard fighting and hard fatigues.&quot; Their letters &quot;never
pretend to be more than the gay and cynical banter of those
who bring to the perils of life at the Front an incurable habit
of humour, and they are typical of that brave spirit, essentially
English, that makes light of the worst that fate can send.&quot;
That is how one brave officer wrote of the letters of a dead
comrade to <i>Punch</i> only a few weeks before his own death.</p>

expenditure at 5&frac12; millions a day when it turned out to be

predecessor, Mr. McKenna. The Budget debate was held with
open doors, but produced a number of speeches much more
suitable for the Secret Session which followed, and at which
it appears from the Speaker's Report that nothing sensational
was revealed.</p>

<p>The House of Commons, unchanged externally, has deteriorated

<p>News comes from Athens that King Constantine is realising
his position and contemplates abdication in favour of the Crown
Prince George. It is not yet known in whose favour the
Crown Prince George will abdicate. In this context the
<i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i> is worth quoting. &quot;The German people,&quot;
it says, &quot;will not soon forget what they owe to their future
Emperor.&quot; This spasm of candour is not confined to the
Rhineland. The keenest minds in Germany, says a Berlin
correspondent, are now seeking to discover the secret of the
Fatherland's world-wide unpopularity. It is this absurd sensitiveness
on the part of our cultured opponent that is causing
some of her best friends in this country to lose hope.</p>

<h4>A WORD OF ILL OMEN<br>
<br>
CROWN PRINCE (to Kaiser, drafting his next speech): &quot;For
Gott's sake, father, be careful this time, and don't call the
American Army 'contemptible.'&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>A new feature of the German armies are the special &quot;storm-troops&quot;;
men picked for their youth, vigour, and daring, and
fortified by a specially liberal diet for the carrying out of
counter-attacks. Even our ordinary British soldiers, who are
constantly compelled to take these brave fellows prisoners,
bear witness to the ferocity of their appearance.</p>

<p>On our Home Front the Germans have shown considerable
activity of late. <a name="Daylight_air-raids"></a>Daylight air-raids are no longer the monopoly
of the South-east coast; they have extended to London. And
a weekly paper, conspicuous for the insistence with which it
proclaims its superiority to all others, has been asking: If
17 German aeroplanes can visit and bomb London in broad
daylight, what is to prevent our enemy from sending 170 or
even 1,700? Fortunately the average man and woman pays no
heed to this scare-mongering, and goes about his or her
business, if not rejoicing, at any rate in the conviction that the
Gothas are not going to have it all their own way.</p>

<p>Considering that the &quot;Fort of London&quot; had been drenched
with the &quot;ghastly dew&quot; of aerial navies barely three hours
before Parliament met on June 13, Members showed themselves
uncommon calm. They were at their best a few days earlier
in paying homage to <a name="Major_Willie_Redmond"></a>Major Willie Redmond. It had been
his ambition to be Father of the House: he had been elected
thirty-four years ago; but in reality he was the Eternal Boy
from the far-off time when it was his nightly delight to &quot;cheek&quot;
Mr. Speaker Brand with delightful exuberance until the moment
of his glorious death in Flanders, whither he had gone at
an age when most of his compeers were content to play the
critic in a snug corner of the smoking-room. Personal affection
combined with admiration for his gallantry to inspire the
speeches in which Mr. Lloyd George, Mr. Asquith, and Sir
<a name="Edward_Carson"></a>Edward Carson enshrined the most remarkable tribute ever paid
to a private Member.</p>

<p><a name="Mr._Balfour_has_returned"></a>Mr. Balfour has returned safe and sound from his
Mission to the States, and received a warm welcome on all sides. Even
the ranks of Tuscany, on the Irish benches, could not forbear to cheer
their old opponent. Besides securing American gold for his country, he
has transferred some American bronze to his complexion. If anything, he
appears to have sharpened his natural faculty for skilful evasion and
polite repartee by his encounter with Transatlantic journalists. In fact
everybody is pleased to see him back except perhaps certain curious
members, who find him even more chary of information than his deputy,
Lord Robert Cecil. The mystery of <a name="Lord_Northcliffe's_visit_to_the_States"></a>Lord Northcliffe's visit to the States
has been cleared up. Certain journals, believed to enjoy his confidence,
had described him as &quot;Mr. Balfour's successor.&quot; Certain other
journals, whose confidence he does not enjoy, had declined to believe
this. The fact as stated by Mr. Bonar Law is that &quot;it is hoped that
Lord Northcliffe will be able to carry on the work begun by Mr. Balfour
as head of the British Mission in America. He is expected to co-ordinate
and supervise the work of all the Departmental Missions.&quot; It has
been interesting to learn that his lordship &quot;will have the right of
communicating direct with the Prime Minister&quot;--a thing which, of
course, he has never done before. Meanwhile, the fact remains that his
departure has been hailed with many a dry eye, and that the public seem
to be enduring their temporary bereavement with fortitude.</p>

<p>Far too much fuss has been made about trying to stop Messrs. Ramsay
MacDonald and Jowett from leaving England. So far as we can gather they
did not threaten to return to this country afterwards. There is no end
to the woes of Pacificists, conscientious or otherwise. The Press
campaign against young men of military age engaged in Government offices
is causing some of them sleepless days. Even on the stage the
&quot;conchy&quot; is not safe.</p>

<p><a name="The_King"></a>The King has done a popular act in abolishing the German
titles held by members of his family, and <a name="beer_is_a_food"></a>Mr. Kennedy Jones
has won widespread approval by declaring that beer is a food.</p>

<p>Lord Devonport's <a name="retirement_from_the_post_of_Food_Controller"></a>retirement from the post of Food Controller
has been received with equanimity. There is a
touch of imagination, almost of romance, in the appointment
of his successor, the <a name="redoubtable_Lord_Rhondda"></a>redoubtable Lord Rhondda, who as
&quot;D.A.&quot; was alternately the bogy and idol of the Welsh miners,
and who, after being the head of the greatest profit-making
enterprise in the Welsh coalfields, is now summoned to carry
on war against the profiteers in the provision trade.</p>

<p>In Germany a number of <a name="lunatics"></a>lunatics have been called up for
military service, and the annual report of one institution at
Stettin states that &quot;the asylums are proud that their inmates

that the results are not always satisfactory, though no complaints
have been heard on our side.</p>

<p>The War, so Lord Northcliffe has informed the Washington
Red Cross Committee, has only just begun.
Whether this utterance be regarded as a statement of fact
or an explosion of rhetoric, it has at least one merit. The
United States cannot but regard it as a happy coincidence
that their entry into the War synchronises with the initial
operations. The dog-days are always busy times for the Dogs
of War, and the last month of the third year opened with the
<a name="new_Russian_Offensive_under_Brusiloff"></a>new Russian Offensive under Brusiloff, and closed with the
beginning of the <a name="Third_Battle_of_Ypres"></a>Third Battle of Ypres. The War in the air and
under the sea rages with unabated intensity, <a name="reprisals_on_German_cities"></a>and in both Houses
the policy of unmitigated reprisals on German cities has found
strenuous advocates. But <a name="Lord_Derby"></a>Lord Derby, our new Minister of War,
will have none of it. British aeroplanes shall only be employed
in bombing where some distinctly military object is to be
achieved. But this decision does not involve any slackness in
defensive measures. We have learned how to deal with the
Zepp, and now we are going to attend to the Gotha. As for
the U-boats, the Admiralty says little but does much. And
we are adding to vigilance, valour, and the resources of applied
science the further aid of agriculture.</p>

<p>In the old days the Kaiser was once described as &quot;indefatigably

He has congratulated his Bayreuth Dragoons on
their prowess, which has given joy &quot;to old Fritz up in
Elysian fields&quot;:</p>

<br><br>
<p><i>Delirant reges</i>: but there are bright exceptions. On July 17
our <a name="King_in_Council"></a>King in Council decreed that the Royal House should be
known henceforth as the House of Windsor. Parliament has
been flooded with the backwash of the Mesopotamia Commission,
and at last on third thoughts the Government has decided
not to set up a new tribunal to try the persons affected by the
Report. <a name="Mr._Austen_Chamberlain"></a>Mr. Austen Chamberlain has resigned office amid
general regret. The Government have refused, &quot;on the representations
of the Foreign Secretary,&quot; to accept the twice
proffered resignation of Lord Hardinge. The plain person is
driven to the conclusion that if there are no unsinkable ships
there are some unsinkable officials. For the rest the question
mainly agitating Members has been &quot;to warn or not to warn.&quot;
The Lord Mayor has announced that he will not ring the great
bell of St. Paul's; but the Home Secretary states that the public
will be warned in future when an air raid is actually imminent.</p>

<p>During these visitations there is nothing handier than a
comfortable and capacious Cave, but the Home Secretary has
his limitations. When Mr. King asked him to be more careful
about interning alien friends without trial,<a name="Trotsky"></a> since he (Mr. King)
had just heard of the great reception accorded in Petrograd
to one Trotsky on his release from internment, Sir George
Cave replied that he was sorry he had never heard of Trotsky.</p>

<p>Lord Rhondda reigns in Lord Devonport's place, and will
doubtless profit by his predecessor's experience. It is a thankless
job, but the great body of the nation is determined that he
shall have fair play and will support him through thick and thin
in any policy, however drastic, that he may recommend to their
reason and their patriotism. This business of food-controlling
is new to us as well as to him, but we are willing to be led, and
we are even willing to be driven, and we are grateful to him for
having engaged his reputation and skill and firmness in the
task of leading or driving us.</p>

<p>The War has its <i>grandes heures</i>, its colossal glories and
disasters, but the tragedy of the &quot;little things&quot; affects the mind
of the simple soldier with a peculiar force--the &quot;little gardens
rooted up, the same as might be ours&quot;; &quot;the little 'ouses all in
'eaps, the same as might be mine&quot;; and worst of all, &quot;the little
kids, as might 'ave been our own.&quot; Apropos of resentment,
England has lost first place in Germany, for America is said
to be the most hated country now. The &quot;morning hate&quot; of
the German family with ragtime obbligato must be a terrible
thing! <a name="General_von_Blume"></a>General von Blume, it is true, says that America's
intervention is no more than &quot;a straw.&quot; But which straw?

<p>A recent resolution of the Reichstag has been welcomed
by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald as the solemn pronouncement of
a sovereign people, only requiring the endorsement of the
British Government to produce an immediate and equitable
peace. But not much was left of this pleasant theory after
Mr. Asquith had dealt it a few sledge-hammer blows. &quot;So

negligible quantity.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a name="Reminiscences_of_Mr._Gerard"></a>Reminiscences of Mr. Gerard, the late German Ambassador

to talk to Fritz, but of the Tommy who, after a short
&quot;leaf,&quot; goes cheerfully back to France to fight him. And the
fomenters of class hatred will not find much support from
the &quot;men in blue.&quot; Mr. Punch has had occasion to rebuke the
levity of smart fashionables who visit the wounded and weary
them by idiotic questions. <a name="tribute_paid_to_the_V.A.D."></a>He is glad to show the other side
of the picture in the tribute paid to the V.A.D. of the proper

<p>Our Grand Fleet keeps its strenuous, unceasing vigil in the
North Sea. But we must not forget the merchant mariners now
serving under the Windsor House Flag in the North Atlantic

of Mr. Henderson's visit to Paris in company with Mr. Ramsay
MacDonald to attend a Conference of French and Russian
Socialists. As member of the War Cabinet and Secretary of
the Labour Party he seems to have resembled one of those twin
salad bottles from which oil and vinegar can be dispensed
alternately but not together. The attempt to combine the two
functions could only end as it began--in a double fiasco. <a name="Minister_of_Munitions"></a>Mr.
Henderson has resigned, and Mr. Winston Churchill has been
appointed Minister of Munitions. Many reasons have been
assigned for his reinclusion in the Ministry. Some say that it
was done to muzzle Mr. MacCallum Scott, hitherto one of the
most pertinacious of questionists, who, as Mr. Churchill's
private secretary, is now debarred by Parliamentary etiquette
from the exercise of these inquisitorial functions. Others say
it was done to muzzle Mr. Churchill. Contrary to expectation,
Mr. Churchill has succeeded in piloting the Munitions of War
Bill through its remaining stages in double quick time. Its
progress was accelerated by his willingness to abolish the
leaving certificate, which a workman hitherto had to procure
before changing one job for another. Having had unequalled
experience in this respect, he is convinced that the leaving
certificate is a useless formality.</p>

<p>When Parliament is not sitting and trying to make us &quot;sit

fall into a mood of wistful reverie, and <a name="contrast"></a>contrast the

<blockquote><p><a name="A_LOST_LAND"></a>A LOST LAND</p>

A childhood land of mountain ways,<br>
Where earthy gnomes and forest fays,<br>
Kind, foolish giants, gentle bears,<br>
Sport with the peasant as he fares<br>
Affrighted through the forest glades,<br>
And lead sweet, wistful little maids<br>
Lost in the woods, forlorn, alone,<br>
To princely lovers and a throne.<br>
<br>
Dear haunted land of gorge and glen,<br>
Ah me! the dreams, the dreams of men!<br>
<br>
A learned law of wise old books<br>
And men with meditative looks,<br>
Who move in quaint red-gabled towns,<br>
And sit in gravely-folded gowns,<br>
Divining in deep-laden speech<br>
The world's supreme arcana--each<br>
A homely god to listening youth,<br>
Eager to tear the veil of Truth;<br>
<br>
Mild votaries of book and pen--<br>
Alas, the dreams, the dreams of men!<br>
<br>
A music land whose life is wrought<br>
In movements of melodious thought;<br>
In symphony, great wave on wave--<br>
Or fugue elusive, swift and grave;<br>
A singing land, whose lyric rhymes<br>
Float on the air like village chimes;<br>
Music and verse--the deepest part<br>
Of a whole nation's thinking heart!<br>
<br>
Oh land of Now, oh land of Then!<br>
Dear God! the dreams, the dreams of men!<br>
<br>
Slave nation in a land of hate,<br>
Where are the things that made you great?<br>
Child-hearted once--oh, deep defiled,<br>
Dare you look now upon a child?<br>
<br>
Your lore--a hideous mask wherein<br>
Self-worship hides its monstrous sin--<br>
Music and verse, divinely wed--<br>
How can these live where love is dead?<br>
<br>
Oh depths beneath sweet human ken,<br>
God help the dreams, the dreams of men!<br></blockquote>

<p>The Norwegian explorer, <a name="Roald_Amundsen"></a>Roald Amundsen, is preparing
for a trip to the North Pole in 1918. Additional interest now
attaches to this spot as being the only territory whose neutrality
the Germans have omitted to violate. <a name="U-boat_interned_at_Cadiz"></a>Apropos of neutrals,
the crew of the U-boat interned at Cadiz has been allowed to
land on giving their word of honour not to leave Spain during
the continuance of the War. The mystery of how the word

easier to explain that the Second Division, in which Mr. E.D.

of Mons.</p>

<h2><i><a name="October,_1917"></a>October, 1917</i>.</h2>

<p>Another month of losses and gains. Against the breakthrough
at <a name="Caporetto"></a>Caporetto on the Isonzo we have to set the
<a name="steady_advance_of_Allenby"></a>steady advance of Allenby on the Palestine front, and
the decision arrived at by an extraordinary meeting of German
Reichstag members that the Germans cannot hope for victory
in the field. We see nothing extraordinary in this. The
<a name="Reichstag"></a>Reichstag may not yet be able to influence policy, but it is
not blind to facts--to the terribly heavy losses involved in our
enemy's desperate efforts to prevent us from occupying the
ridges above the Ypres-Menin road, and so forcing him to
face the winter on the low ground. Then, too, there has been
the ominous <a name="mutiny"></a>mutiny of the German sailors at Kiel. The ringleaders
have been executed, but they may have preferred death
to another speech from the Kaiser. <a name="Dr._Michaelis_dismissed"></a>Dr. Michaelis, that
&quot;transient embarrassed phantom,&quot; has joined the ranks of the
dismissed. No sooner had the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> pointed out
that &quot;Dr. Michaelis was a good Chancellor as Chancellors go&quot;
than he went. Another of the German doctor politicians has
been delivering his soul on the failure of Pro-German propaganda
in memorable fashion. <a name="Dr._Dernburg"></a>Dr. Dernburg, in <i>Deutsche
Politik</i>, tells us that &quot;steadfastness and righteousness are the
qualities which the German people value in the highest degree,
and which have brought it a good and honourable reputation
in the whole world. When we make experiments in lies and
deceptions, intrigue and low cunning, we suffer hopeless and
brutal failure. Our lies are coarse and improbable, our ambiguity
is pitiful simplicity. The history of the War proves
this by a hundred examples. When our enemies poured all
these things upon us like a hailstorm, and we convinced ourselves
of the effectiveness of such tactics, we tried to imitate
them. But these tactics will not fit the German. We are
rough but moral, we are credulous but honest.&quot; Before this
touching picture of the German Innocents very much
abroad, the Machiavellian Briton can only take refuge in
silent amazement.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Parliament has reassembled, and Mr. Punch has been moved
to ask Why? Various reasons would no doubt be returned by
various members. The Chancellor of the Exchequer wants to
obtain a further Vote of Credit. The new <a name="National_Party"></a>National Party wish
to justify their existence; and those incarnate notes of interrogation--Messrs.
King, Hogge and Pemberton Billing--would
like Parliament to be in permanent session in order that
the world might have the daily benefit of their searching investigations.
<a name="Sinn_Fein_excesses"></a>There has been a certain liveliness on the
Hibernian front, but we hope that Mr. Asquith was justified
in assuming that the Sinn Fein excesses were only an expression
of the &quot;rhetorical and contingent belligerency&quot; always
present in Ireland, and that in spite of them the Convention
would make all things right. Meanwhile, the Sinn Feiners
have refused to take part in it. And not a single Nationalist
member has denounced them for their dereliction; indeed, Mr.
T.M. Healy has even given them his blessing, for what it is
worth. <a name="Air_Ministry"></a>Of more immediate importance has been Mr. Bonar
Law's announcement of the Government's intention to set up
a new Air Ministry, and &quot;to employ our machines over German
towns so far as military needs render us free to take such

GRETCHEN: &quot;Yes, dearest, but may it not show up the
Fatherland to the brutal enemy one of these nights?&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>In the earlier stages of the War we looked on the moon
as our friend. Now that inconstant orb has become our enemy,
and the only German opera that we look forward to seeing is
<i>Die Gothad&auml;mmerung</i>.
A circular
has been issued
by the Feline Defence
League appealing
to owners
of cats to bring
them inside the
house during air-raids.
When they
are left on the roof
it would seem that
their agility
causes them to be
mistaken for
aerial torpedoes.
We note that the
practice of giving
air-raid warnings
by notice published
in the following
morning's
papers has been
abandoned only
after the most exhaustive
tests.
The advocates of
&quot;darkness and
composure&quot; have
not been very happy in their arguments, but they are at least
preferable to the members of Parliament deservedly trounced by
Mr. Bonar Law, who declared that if their craven squealings
were typical he should despair of victory. Meanwhile, we have
to congratulate our <a name="gallant_French_allies"></a>gallant French allies on their splendid bag
of Zepps. But the space which our Press allots to air raids
moves Mr. Punch to wonder and scorn. Our casualties from
that source are never one-tenth so heavy as those in France on
days when G.H.Q. reports &quot;everything quiet on the Western
front.&quot; Still worse is the temper of some of our society weeklies,
which have set their faces like flint against any serious
reference to the War, and go imperturbably along the old ante-bellum
lines, &quot;snapping&quot; <a name="smart_people"></a>smart people at the races or in the
Row, or reproducing the devastating beauty of a revue chorus,
and this at a time when every day brings the tidings of
irreparable loss to hundreds of families.</p>


<blockquote><p><a name="MISSING"></a>MISSING</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With light dew falling on your upturned face?<br>
<br>

<p>The discomforts of <a name="railway_travelling"></a>railway travelling do not diminish. But impatient
passengers may find comfort in a maxim of R. L. Stevenson: &quot;To
travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive.&quot; And further
solace is forthcoming in the fact that our enemies are even worse off
than we are. Railway fares in Germany have been doubled; but it is
doubtful if this transparent artifice will prevent the Kaiser from going
about the place making speeches to his troops on all the fronts. Here
all classes are united by the solidarity of inconvenience. And they all
have different ways of meeting it. But we really think more care should
be taken by the authorities to see that while waging war on the
Continent they do not forget the defence of those at home. The fact that
Mr. Winston Churchill and <a name="Mr._Horatio_Bottomley"></a>Mr. Horatio Bottomley were away in France at
the same time looks like gross carelessness. In this context we may note
the report that the Eskimos had not until quite recently heard of war,
which seems to argue slackness on the part of the circulation manager of
the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>

<h2><i><a name="November,_1917"></a>November, 1917</i>.</h2>

<p>The best and the worst news comes from the outlying
fronts. Allenby's triumphant advance is unchecked in
Palestine. <a name="Gaza_has_fallen"></a>Gaza has fallen. The British are in Jaffa.
Jerusalem is threatened. The German-Austrian drive which
began at Caporetto has been stemmed,<a name="on_the_Piave"></a> and the Italians, stiffened
by a British army under General Plumer, are standing firm
on the Piave. <a name="gallant_Maude"></a>In Mesopotamia we deplore the death of the
gallant Maude, a great general and a great gentleman, beloved
by all ranks, whose career is an abiding answer to those who
maintain that no good can come out of our public schools or
the Staff training of regular officers. In Russia the Bolshevist
<i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> has <a name="overthrown_the_Kerensky"></a>overthrown the Kerensky <i>r&egrave;gime</i> and installed
as dictator Lenin, a <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;</i> aristocrat, always the most
dangerous of revolutionaries. On the Western front the tide
has flowed and ebbed.<a name="Passchendaele"></a> The Germans have yielded ground on
the <i>Chemin des Dames</i>, the British have stormed Passchendaele
Ridge, but at terrible cost, and General Byng's brilliant surprise
attack and <a name="victory_at_Cambrai"></a>victory at Cambrai has been followed by the
fierce reaction of ten days later. But perhaps the greatest sensation
of the month has been Mr. Lloyd George's Paris speech,
with its disquieting references to the situation on the Western
front, and its announcement of the formation of the <a name="new_Allied Council"></a>new Allied
Council. The Premier's defence of, and, we may perhaps say,
recomposition of his Paris oration before the House of
Commons has appeased criticism without entirely convincing
those who have been anxious to know how the Allied Council
would work, and what would be the relations between the
Council's military advisers and the existing General Staff of
the countries concerned. But as Mr. Lloyd George confessed
that he had deliberately made a &quot;disagreeable speech&quot; in Paris
in order to get it talked about, the Press critics whom he rebuked
will probably consider themselves absolved.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Parliament has for once repelled the gibe that it has ceased
to represent the people in the tribute of praise paid by Lords
and Commons to our sailors and soldiers and all the other
gallant folk who are helping us to win the War. On the strength
of this capacity for rising to the occasion one may pass over
the many sittings at which a small minority of Pacificists and
irrelevant inquisitors have dragged the House down to the
depths of ineptitude or worse. In the debate on the Air Force
in Committee, one member, if we count speeches and interruptions,
addressed the House exactly one hundred times, and it
is worthy of note that his last words were: &quot;This is what you
call muzzling the House of Commons.&quot; If we were to believe
some critics, the British Navy is directed by a set of doddering
old gentlemen who are afraid to let it go at the Germans, and
cannot even safeguard it from attack. The truth, as expounded
by the First Lord, <a name="Sir_Eric_Geddes"></a>Sir Eric Geddes, in his maiden speech, is
quite different. Despite the Jeremiads of superannuated sailors
and political longshoremen, the Admiralty is not going to
Davy Jones's locker, but under its present chiefs, who have,
with very few exceptions, seen service in this War, maintains
and supplements its glorious record.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Save for an occasional game of &quot;tip and run,&quot; as with the
North Sea convoy, enemy vessels have disappeared on the
surface of the ocean; and the long arm of the British Navy
is now stretching down into the depths and up into the skies
in successful pursuit of them. If the nation hardly realises
what it owes to the men of the Fleet and their splendid comrades
of the Auxiliary Services, it is because this work is done
with such thoroughness and so little fuss, and, as Mr. Asquith
put it, &quot;in the twilight and not in the limelight.&quot;</p>

<p>The general sense of the community is now practically
agreed that compulsory <a name="rationing_must_come"></a>rationing must come, and the sooner
the better. Lord Rhondda is still hopeful that John Bull will
tighten his own belt and save him the trouble. But if we fail,
the machinery for compulsion is all ready.</p>

<p>Reuter reports that a <a name="British_prisoner_has_been_sentenced"></a>British prisoner has been sentenced
to a year's imprisonment for calling the Germans &quot;Huns.&quot;
On the Western front Tommy usually calls them &quot;Allymans,&quot;
&quot;Jerry,&quot; or &quot;Fritz.&quot; But even if this prisoner did use the word
he cannot be blamed. <a name="Attila's_understudy"></a>The choice was the Kaiser's when, as
Attila's understudy, &quot;Go forth,&quot; he said, &quot;my sons. Go and
behave exactly as the Huns.&quot;</p>

<p>Apropos of the Kaiser, it appears that a certain Herr
Stegerwald, addressing a Berlin meeting, said: &quot;We went
to war at the side of the Kaiser, and the All-Highest will return
from war with us.&quot; If we may be permitted to say anything,
we expect he will be leading by at least a couple of lengths.</p>

<p>The versatility and inventive genius of the Prime Minister
provoke mingled comment. An old Parliamentarian, when
asked to what party Mr. Lloyd George now belonged,
recently answered: &quot;He used to be a Radical; he will some
day be a Conservative; and at present he is the leader of the
Improvisatories.&quot;</p>

vulgar repetition of the journalist, has redeemed its significance
in the dispatches from our Palestine front. The simplicity and
dignity of General Allenby's entry into the Syrian town--</p>

<blockquote>Where on His grave with shining eyes<br>

<p>afford a happy contrast to the boastful pagentry of the Kaiser's

<p>Where Russia is concerned Mr. Balfour wisely declines to
be included among the prophets; all he knows is that she has
not yet evolved a Government with which we can negotiate.</p>

<a name="letter_to_the_Daily_Telegraph"></a>
<p>There <i>is</i> a Government in Germany, but neither Government
nor people afford excuse for the negotiations which Lord
Lansdowne, in a fit of war-weariness, has advocated in his
letter to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. His unfortunate intervention,
playing into the hands of Pacificists and Pro-Boches, is all the
more to be deplored in a public servant who has crowned a
long, disinterested and distinguished career by an act of
grievous disservice to his country. British grit will win,
declares Sir William Robertson; but our elderly statesmen
must refrain from dropping theirs into the machinery. Happily
the Government are determined to give no more publicity to
the letter than they can help. On the Vote of Credit for
550 millions the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been invited
by Mr. Dillon to make a survey of the military situation, and has
replied that all the relevant facts are known already. &quot;The
War is going on; the Government and the country intend it
shall go on; and money is necessary to make it go on.&quot; That
was a good answer to a member who has certainly done little
to receive special consideration. Not only do we need money;
we need men to supply the gaps caused by our withdrawal of
troops to Italy and the constant wastage on all fronts.</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour, as we have seen, abstains from prophecy.
Mr. Dillon, who, with other Nationalists, bitterly resents the
decision of the Government to apply the rules of arithmetic
to the redistribution of seats in their beloved country, has
indulged in a terrifying forecast which ought to be placed on
record. He has threatened the House with the possibility that
at the next General Election he and his colleagues might be
wiped out of existence.</p>

<p>Tommy is a very great man, but he is not a great linguist,
though he always gets what he wants by the aid of signs or telepathy.
Three years and some odd months have not changed
his point of view, and now for Thomas to find himself in Italy
is only to discover another lot of people who cannot understand
or make themselves understood. &quot;Alliances,&quot; as a correspondent
from Italy puts it, &quot;are things as wonderful to see as
they are magnificent to read about. I do, however, regard with
something approaching alarm the new language which will
be evolved to put the lot of us on complete speaking terms.&quot;</p>

<p>Lord Rhondda, who listened from the Peers' gallery to
the recent debate in the Commons on Food Control, has received
a quantity of advice intended to help him in minding
his p's and q's, particularly the latter. <a name="In_China"></a>In China, we read in
the <i>Daily Express</i>, a chicken can still be purchased for sixpence;
intending purchasers should note, however, that at
present the return fare to Shanghai brings the total cost to a
figure a trifle in excess of the present London prices. More
bread is being eaten than ever, according to the Food Controller:
but it appears that the stuff is now eaten by itself instead
of being spread thinly on butter, as in pre-war days. <a name="Bloaters"></a>Bloaters
have reached the unprecedented price of sixpence each. This
is no more, as we have seen, than a chicken fetches in China,
but it is enough to dispel the hope that bloaters, at any rate
over the Christmas season, would remain within the reach of
the upper classes. At a Guildford charity <i>f&ecirc;te</i> the winner of
a hurdle race has been awarded a new-laid egg. If he succeeds
in winning it three years in succession it is to become his own
property.</p>

<p>Christmas has come round again, and peace still seems
a far-off thing. &quot;What shall he have that killed the deer?&quot;
someone asks somebody else in <i>As You Like It</i>. But
there is a better question than that, and it is this: &quot;What
shall they have that preserve the little dears?&quot; And the
answer is--honour and support. For there can be no doubt
that in these critical times, when the life of the best and
bravest and strongest is so cheap, no duty is more important
than the cherishing of infancy, and the provision of seasonable
joys to the youngest generation, gentle and simple. More than
ever Mr. Punch welcomes the coming of <a name="Santa_Klaus"></a>Santa Klaus:</p>

<blockquote>Thou who on earth was nam&egrave;d Nicholas--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There be dull clods who doubt thy magic power<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To tour the sleeping world in half-an-hour,<br>
And pop down all the chimneys as you pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With woolly lambs and dolls of frabjous size<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For grubby hands and wonder-laden eyes.<br>
<br>
Not so thy singer, who believes in thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has a young and foolish spirit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the simple faith that bards inherit<br>
Of happiness is still the master key,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening life's treasure-house to whoso clings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the dim beauty of imagined things.<br></blockquote>

<h2><i><a name="January,_1918"></a>January, 1918</i>.</h2>

<p>While avoiding as a rule the fashionable <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
prophet, Mr. Punch is occasionally tempted to indulge
in prediction. The year 1918, in which France is
greeting in increasing numbers the heirs of the Pilgrim Fathers,
is going to be America's year. As <a name="for_the_Kaiser"></a>for the Kaiser,</p>

<blockquote>A Fatherland Poet was busy of late<br>
In making the Kaiser a new Hymn of Hate;<br>
Perhaps, ere its echoes have time to grow dim,<br>
The Huns may be learning a new Hate of Him.<br></blockquote>

<p>In this prophetic strain Mr. Punch has been musing on the
fortunes of the Hohenzollerns under a German Republic. Will
the ex-Kaiser be appointed to the post of official Gatherer of
Scraps of Paper, or start in business as a second-hand wardrobe
dealer with a large assortment of slightly soiled uniforms?
Or will he be ordered to ring a joy-bell on the anniversary of
the inauguration of the German Republic?</p>

<h4>The ex-Kaiser is appointed to the post of official gatherer of scraps of paper.</h4>

<p>These are attractive speculations, but a trifle previous, while
hospital ships are still being torpedoed, <a name="U-boats_are_busy"></a>U-boats are busy at
Funchal, and the bonds of German influence and penetration
are being forged anew at Brest-Litovsk. The latest news
from that quarter seems to indicate that the Kaiser desires
peace--at any rate for the duration of the War. And
already there is a talk of a German counter-offensive on a
colossal scale on the Western front. So that Mr. Punch's
message for the New Year is couched in no spirit of premature
jubilation, but rather appeals for fortitude and endurance.</p>

<p>How needful such an appeal is may be gathered from the
proceedings at Westminster, less fit for the Mother than the
Mummy of Parliaments, where &quot;doleful questionists&quot; exhume

the increase in pay recently granted to fighting men for
<a name="conscientious_objectors_in_the_Non-Combatant_Corps"></a>conscientious objectors in the Non-Combatant Corps. The
interest taken by one of this group in Army Dentistry inspires
the wish that &quot;the treatment of jaw-cases&quot; mentioned by the
Under-Secretary for War could be applied on the Parliamentary
front. Head-hunting is in full swing. This classical sport,
as practised in Borneo, involved the discharge of poisoned
darts through a blow-pipe, and the House of Commons has
not materially altered the method. In the attack of January 23
it is supposed that the Head of the Government was aimed
at; but most of the shots went wide and hit the Head of our
Army in France. Ministers have not distinguished themselves
except by their capacity for &quot;butting-in &quot; and eating their
words. Public opinion has been inflamed rather than enlightened
by the discussions on unity of command, and the
newspaper campaign directed against our War chiefs. <a name="Suffragists"></a>Meanwhile,
the Suffragists have triumphantly surmounted their last
obstacle in the House of Lords, and Votes for Women is now
an accomplished fact. But the Irish Andromeda still awaits
her Perseus, gazing wanly at her various champions in Convention.

has been rejected after Sir Auckland Geddes had declared that
it would be of no use as a solution of the present difficulty.
He did not give his reasons, but they are believed to be Conventional.
Mr. Barnes has described the Government as
&quot;living on the top of a veritable volcano,&quot; but, in spite of the
context, the phrase must not be taken to refer to the Minister
of Munitions, who, as everybody knows, cannot be sat upon.</p>

<p><a name="&quot;Q&quot;_war"></a>Military experts tell us that this is a &quot;Q&quot; war, meaning
thereby that the Quartermaster-General's department is the
one that matters. Naval experts sometimes drop hints attaching
another significance to that twisty letter. Harassed house-keepers
are beginning to think that this is a &quot;queue-war,&quot; and
look to Lord Rhondda to end it.<a name="elusive_rabbit"></a> For the moment the elusive rabbit
has scored a point against the Food Controller, but public
confidence in his ability is not shaken. All classes are being
drawn together by a communion of inconvenience. The sporting
miner's wife can no longer afford dog biscuits: &quot;Our dog's got
to eat what we eats now.&quot; And the pathetic appeal of the smart
fashionable for lump sugar, on the ground that her darling
Fido cannot be expected to catch a spoonful of Demerara from
the end of his nose, leaves the grocer cold. A dairyman
charged with selling unsatisfactory milk has explained to the
Bench that his cows were suffering from shell-shock. He himself is now
suffering from shell-out-shock. At Ramsgate a shopkeeper has exhibited a
notice in his window announcing that &quot;better days are in
store.&quot; What most people want is butter days.</p>

<br><br>
<p>The disquieting activities of the &quot;giddy <a name="Gotha"></a>Gotha&quot; involve
drastic enforcement of the lighting orders, and the moon is still an
object of suspicion. Pessimists and those critics who are never content
unless each day brings a spectacular success, seem to have taken for
their motto: &quot;It's not what I mean, but what I say, that
matters.&quot; But the moods of the non-combatant are truly chameleonic.
Civilians summoned to the War Office pass from confidence to abasement,
and from abasement to megalomania in the space of half an hour.</p>

<p><a name="for_funds"></a>Turkey, it appears, has sent an urgent appeal to Berlin
for funds. The disaster to the <i><a name="Goeben"></a>Goeben</i> can be endured, since
the Sultan can now declare a foreshore claim, and do a little
salvage profiteering; but Palestine is another matter. Since
General Allenby's advance &quot;running&quot; expenses have swallowed
up a formidable total. <a name="geography"></a>The War is teaching us many things,
including geography. We are taking a lively interest in the
Ukraine, and the newspapers daily add to our stock of interesting
knowledge. Apropos of General Allenby's entry into
Jerusalem, we learn that &quot;the predominance of the tar brush
in the streets added to the brightness of the scene,&quot; and in
connection with his return to Cairo, that &quot;the <a name="MacCabean_Boy_Scouts"></a>MacCabean Boy Scouts&quot;
took part in the reception--presumably the Cadet Corps
of the Jordan Highlanders. But the most reassuring news
comes from the enemy Press. &quot;It is simply a miracle,&quot; says
the <i>Cologne Gazette</i>, &quot;that the Germans have so loyally stood
by their leaders,&quot; and for once we are wholly in agreement with
our German contemporary.</p>

<p>If Mr. Punch may exert his privilege of turning abruptly
to grave from gay, the claim may be allowed on behalf of the
youngest generation, already remembered in the chronicle of
last month.</p>

<p>The first <a name="Brest-Litovsk_Treaty"></a>Brest-Litovsk Treaty has been signed, followed
in nine days by the German invasion of Russia, an apt comment
on what an English paper, by a misprint which is really
an inspiration, calls &quot;the Brest Nogotiations.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="massacre_of_the_innocents"></a>The record of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime is already deeply
stained with the massacre of the innocents, but Lenin and
Trotsky can plead an august example. More than fourteen
thousand British non-combatants--men, women and children--have
been murdered by the Kaiser's command. And the

test of his recent avowals of sympathy with democratic ideals.
By way of a set-off the German Press Bureau has circulated
a legend of civil war in London, bristling with circumstantial
inaccuracies. The enemy's successes in the field--the occupation
of Reval and the recapture of Trebizond--are the direct
outcome of the Russian <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>. Our <a name="capture_of_Jericho"></a>capture of Jericho marks
a further stage in a sustained triumph of good generalship
and hard fighting, which verifies an <a name="old_prophecy"></a>old prophecy current
among the Arabs in Palestine and Syria, viz. that when the
waters of the Nile flow into Palestine, a prophet from the
West will drive the Turk out of the Arab countries. The first
part of the prophecy was fulfilled by the pipe-line which has
brought Nile water (taken from the fresh-water canal) for the
use of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force across the Sinai
desert to the neighbourhood of Gaza. The second part was
fulfilled by the fact that General Allenby's name is rendered
in Arabic by exactly the same letters which form the words
&quot;El Nebi,&quot; i.e. the Prophet.</p>

<p>At home we have seen the end of the seventh session of a
Parliament which by its own rash Act should have committed
suicide two years ago. Truly the Kaiser has a lot to answer
for. On the last day but one of the session 184 questions were
put, the information extracted from Ministers being, as usual,
in inverse ratio to the curiosity of the questioners. The opening
of the eighth session showed no change in this respect.
The debate on the Address degenerated into a series of personal
attacks on the Premier by members who, not without high
example, regard this as the easiest road to fame. The only
persons who have a right to congratulate themselves on the
discussion are the members of the German General Staff, who
may not have learned anything that they did not know before,
but have undoubtedly had certain shrewd suspicions confirmed.
Mr. Bonar Law, in one of his engaging bursts of self-revelation,
observed that he had no more interest in this Prime Minister
than he had in the last; but the House generally seemed to
agree with Mr. Adamson, the Labour leader, who, before
changing horses again, wanted to be sure that he was going
to get a better team.<a name="took_his_seat"></a> A week later, on the day on which the
Prince of Wales took his seat in the Lords, Lord Derby
endeavoured to explain why the Government had parted with
Sir William Robertson, the Chief of the Imperial Staff, and
replaced him by General Wilson. It is hard to say whether
the Peers were convinced. Simultaneously in the House of
Commons the Prime Minister was engaged in the same task,
but with greater success. Mr. Lloyd George has no equal
in the art of persuading an audience to share his faith in himself.
How far our military chiefs approved the recent decision
of the <a name="Versailles_Conference"></a>Versailles Conference is not known. <a name="Eastern_Command_at_home"></a>But everyone
applauds the patriotic self-effacement of Sir William Robertson
in silently accepting the Eastern Command at home.</p>

<p>In Parliament the <a name="question_of_food"></a>question of food has been discussed in
both Houses with the greatest gusto. Throughout the country
it is the chief topic of conversation.</p>

GEORGE: &quot;It's all right, dear. A brainy idea of mine to get the garden
dug up. I wrote an anonymous letter to the Food Controller and told him
there was a large box of food buried there.&quot;<br>

</h4>
<br><br>
<p>To the <a name="ordinary_queues"></a>ordinary queues
we now have to add processions of conscientious disgorgers
patriotically evading prosecution. The problem &quot;Is tea a
food or is it not? &quot; convulses our Courts, and the axioms of
Euclid call for revision as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;Parallel lines are those which in a queue, if only produced
far enough, never mean meat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If there be two queues outside two different butchers'
shops, and the length and the breadth of one queue be equal
to the length and breadth of the other queue, each to each,
but the supplies in one shop are greater than the supplies in
the other shop, then the persons in the one queue will get
more meat than those in the other queue, which is absurd, and
Rhondda ought to see about it.&quot;</p>

<p>All the same, Lord Rhondda is a stout fellow who goes on
his way with an imperviousness to criticism--criticism that is
often selfish and contemptible--which augurs well for his
ultimate success in the most thankless of all jobs.</p>

<br><br>
<p><a name="Food_at_the_front"></a>Food at the front is another matter, and Mr. Punch is glad
to print the tribute of one of his war-poets to the &quot;Cookers&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>The Company Cook is no great fighter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's never a medal for <i>him</i> to wear,<br>
Though he camps in the shell-swept waste, poor blighter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a cook has &quot;copped it&quot; there;<br>
But the boys go over on beans and bacon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tommy is best when Tommy has dined,<br>
So here's to the Cookers, the plucky old Cookers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sooty old Cooks that waddle behind.<br></blockquote>

<p>&quot;It is Germany,&quot; says a German paper, &quot;who will speak
the last word in this War.&quot; Yes, and the last word will be
&quot;Kamerad!&quot; But that word will be spoken in spite of many
pseudo-war-workers on the Home Front.</p>

<p>Among the many wonders of the War one of the most
wonderful is the sailor-man, three times, four times, five times
torpedoed, who yet wants to sail once more. But there is one
thing that he never wants to do again--to &quot;pal&quot; with Fritz
the square-head:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;When peace is signed and treaties made an' trade begins again,<br>
There's some'll shake a German's 'and an' never see the stain;<br>
But <i>not me</i>,&quot; says Dan the sailor-man, &quot;not me, as God's on high--<br>
Lord knows it's bitter in an open boat to see your shipmates die.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Among the ignoble curiosities of the time we note the
following advertisements in a Manchester newspaper of &quot;wants&quot;
in our &quot;indispensable&quot; industries: &quot;Tennis ball inflators,
cutters and makers&quot; and &quot;Caramel wrappers&quot;; while a
Brighton paper has &quot;Wanted, two dozen living flies weekly
during the remainder of winter for two Italian frogs.&quot;</p>

<p>The situation in Ireland remains unchanged, and suggests
the following historical division of eras. (1) Pagan era;
(2) Christian era; (3) De Valera.</p>

<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>

<h2><i><a name="March,_1918"></a>March, 1918</i>.</h2>

<p>Once again the month of the War-God has been true
to its name. March, opening in suspense, with the
Kaiser and his Chancellor still talking of peace, has
closed in a crisis of acute anxiety for the Allies. The expected
has happened; the long-advertised German attack has been
delivered in the West, and the war of movement has begun.</p>

<p>Breaking through the <a name="Fifth_British_Army"></a>Fifth British Army, in five days the
Germans have advanced twenty-five miles, to within artillery
range of Amiens and the main lateral railway behind the British
lines. <a name="Bapaume"></a>Bapaume and P&eacute;ronne have fallen. The Americans
have entered the war <a name="in_the_firing_line"></a>in the firing line. It is the beginning
of the end, the supreme test of the soul of the nation:</p>

<blockquote>The little things of which we lately chattered--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dearth of taxis or the dawn of Spring;<br>
Themes we discussed as though they really mattered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like rationed meat or raiders on the wing;--<br>
<br>
How thin it seems to-day, this vacant prattle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowned by the thunder rolling in the West,<br>
Voice of the great arbitrament of battle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That puts our temper to the final test.<br>
<br>
Thither our eyes are turned, our hearts are straining,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where those we love, whose courage laughs at fear,<br>
Amid the storm of steel around them raining,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to their death for all we hold most dear.<br>
<br>
New-born of this supremest hour of trial,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In quiet confidence shall be our strength,<br>
Fixed on a faith that will not take denial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor doubt that we have found our soul at length.<br>
<br>
O England, staunch of nerve and strong of sinew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Best when you face the odds and stand at bay;<br>
Now show a watching world what stuff is in you!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now make your soldiers proud of you to-day!<br></blockquote>

<p><a name="Of_our_soldiers"></a>Of our soldiers we at home cannot be too proud, from
Field-Marshal to officer's servant. As one of Mr. Punch's
correspondents at the front writes: &quot;Dawn to me hereafter
will not be personified as a rosy-fingered damsel or a lovely
swift-footed deity, but as a sturdy little man in khaki,
crimson-eared
with cold, heralded and escorted by frozen wafts of outer
air, bearing in one knobby fist a pair of boots, and in the other
a tin mug of black and smoking tea.&quot; As for the charities and
courtesies of war, as interpreted by our soldiers, Mr. Punch
can wish for no better illustration than in these lines on &quot;The
German graves&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>I wonder are there roses still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ablain St. Nazaire,<br>
And crosses girt with daffodil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that old garden there.<br>
I wonder if the long grass waves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With wild-flowers just the same,<br>
Where Germans made their soldiers' graves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the English came?<br>
<br>
The English set those crosses straight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept the legends clean;<br>
The English made the wicket-gate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left the garden green;<br>
And now who knows what regiments dwell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ablain St. Nazaire?<br>
But I would have them guard as well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The graves we guarded there.<br>
<br>
And when at last the Prussians pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those mounds and see<br>
The reverent cornflowers crowd the grass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of you and me,<br>
They'll give, perhaps, one humble thought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the &quot;English fools&quot;<br>
Who fought as never men have fought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But somehow kept the rules.<br></blockquote>

<br><br>
<p>To turn from the crowning ordeal of our Armies to the
activities of British politicians on the eve of the great German
attack is not a soul-animating experience. Indeed, the efforts
of Messrs. Snowden and Trevelyan, Pringle and King almost
justify the assumption that Hindenburg would have launched
his offensive earlier but for his desire not to interfere with the
great offensive conducted by his friends on the Westminster
front. Our <a name="anti-patriots"></a>anti-patriots, however, are placed in a dilemma.
They were bound to side with Germany, because of their
rooted belief that England always must be wrong. They were
bound to hail the Bolshevik self-determinators because of their
entirely sound views on peace at any price. But now their two
loves are fighting like cats. Hence the problem: &quot;Which am I
(both can't well be right), Pro-German or Pro-Trotskyite?&quot;
Discussions of pig shortage, commandeered premises, the
relations of the Government and Press, and the duties of the
Directors of Propaganda leave us cold or impatient.<a name="Mr._John_Redmond"></a> But
members of all parties have been united in genuine grief over
the death of Mr. John Redmond, snatched away just when
his distracted country most needed his moderating influence.
For in their anxiety not to interfere with the deliberations of
those patriotic Irishmen who are trying to settle how Ireland
shall be governed in the future, the Government are allowing
it to become ungovernable by anybody. <a name="diagram"></a>A new and agreeable
Parliamentary innovation has been introduced by Sir Eric
Geddes in the shape of an immense diagram showing the
downward tendency of the U-boat activities. Other orators
might with advantage follow this method. Indeed, there are
some whose speeches would be more enjoyable if they were
all diagrams. As for that pledge of the New Citizenship, the
<a name="Education_Bill"></a>Education Bill, the debate on the second reading has been
such a long eulogy of its author that <a name="Mr._Fisher"></a>Mr. Fisher would be

<p>We have reached the darkest hours of the War and
the clouds have not yet lifted, though the rate of the
German advance has already begun to slow down.
On the 11th the enemy <a name="broke_through_at_Armenti&egrave;res"></a>broke through at Armenti&egrave;res and
pushed their advantage till another wedge was driven into the
British line. On the 12th <a name="Sir_Douglas_Haig_issued"></a>Sir Douglas Haig issued his historic
order: &quot;With our backs to the wall, and believing in the justice
of our cause, each one of us must fight to the end. The safety
of our homes and the freedom of mankind depend alike upon
the conduct of each one of us at the critical moment.&quot; The
Amiens line being under fire, it was impossible to bring French
reinforcements north in time to save Kemmel Hill and stave off
the menace to the Channel ports. The tale of our losses is
grievous, and for thousands and thousands of families
nothing can ever be the same again. The <a name="ordeal_of_Paris"></a>ordeal of Paris
has been renewed by shelling from the German long-distance
gun, the last and most sensational of German surprise-packets.
These are indeed dark days, yet already lit by hopeful omens--the
closer union of the Allies, the appointment of the greatest
French military genius, <a name="General_Foch,_as_Generalissimo"></a>General Foch, as Generalissimo of the
Allied Forces, and his calm assurance that we have as yet lost
&quot;nothing vital.&quot; America is pouring men into France and,
without waiting to complete the independent organisation of
her Army, has chivalrously sent her troops forward to be
brigaded with French and British units. Even now there are
optimists, who are not fools, who maintain that Germany has
shot her last bolt and knows that she is losing. It is at least
remarkable that German newspapers are daily excusing the
failure of their offensive to secure all its objectives. There is
clearly something wrong with the time-table and, in the race of
Man Power, time is on the side of the Allies.</p>

<p>Truth, long gagged and disguised, is coming to light in
Germany. This has been the month of the <a name="Lichnowsky"></a>Lichnowsky disclosures--the
Memoir of their Ambassador, vindicating British
diplomacy and saddling Germany with the responsibility for

<br><br>
<p>And what has England's answer been, apart from the
stubborn and heroic resistance of her men on the Western
Front? The answer is to be found in the immediate resolve
to raise the age limit for service to 50, still more in the glorious
<a name="exploit_of_Zeebrugge"></a>exploit of Zeebrugge and Ostend, in the incredible valour
of the men who volunteered for and carried through what is
perhaps the most astonishing and audacious enterprise in the
annals of the Navy.</p>

<p>The pageantry of war has gone, but here at least is a magnificence
of achievement and self-sacrifice on the epic scale which
beggars description and transcends praise. The hornet's nest
that has pestered us so long, if not rooted out, has been badly
damaged; our sailors, dead and living, have once more proved
themselves masters of the impossible.</p>

<p><a name="Irish_bog"></a>At home Parliament, resuming business after the Easter
recess, began by giving a second Reading to a Drainage Bill,
and ended its first sitting in an Irish bog. Ireland throughout
the month has dominated the proceedings, aloof and irreconcilable,
brooding over past wrongs, blind to the issues of the
War and turning her back on its realities. Mr. Lloyd George's
plan of making Home Rule contingent on compulsory service
has been described by Mr. O'Brien as a declaration of war
on Ireland. Another Nationalist Member, who at Question
time urged on the War Office the necessity of according to its
Irish employees exactly the same privileges and pay as were
given to their British confr&egrave;res, protested loudly a little later
on against a Bill which <i>inter alia</i> extends to Irishmen the
privilege of joining in the fight for freedom. Mr. Asquith
questioned the policy of embracing Ireland in the Bill unless
you could get general consent. Mr. Bonar Law bluntly replied
that if Ireland was not to be called upon to help in this time of
stress there would be an end of Home Rule, and that if the
House would not sanction Irish conscription it would have to
get another Government. It remained for <a name="Lord_Dunraven"></a>Lord Dunraven,
before the passing of the Bill in the House of Lords, to produce
as &quot;a very ardent Home Ruler&quot; the most ingenious excuse for
his countrymen's unwillingness to fight that has yet been heard.
Ireland, he tells us, has been contaminated by the British
refugees who had fled to that country to escape military service.</p>

<h4>DRAKE'S WAY<br>
<br>
Zeebrugge, St. George's Day, 1918<br>

ADMIRAL DRAKE (to Admiral Keyes): &quot;Bravo, sir. Tradition
holds. My men singed a King's beard, and yours have singed a
Kaiser's moustache.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>The Prime Minister, in reviewing the military situation, has
attributed the success of the Germans to their possessing the
initiative and to the weather. Members have found it a little
difficult to understand why, if even at the beginning of March
the Allies were equal in numbers to the enemy on the West and
if, thanks to the <a name="foresight_of_the_Versailles"></a>foresight of the Versailles Council, they knew in
advance the strength and direction of the impending blow,
they ever allowed the initiative to pass to the Germans. It is
known that hundreds of thousands of men have been rushed out
of England since the last week of March. Why, if Sir Douglas
Haig asked for reserves, were they not sent sooner? These
mysteries will be resolved some day.<a name="Trenchard"></a> Meanwhile General
Trenchard, late chief of the Air Staff, and by general consent
an exceptionally brilliant and energetic officer, has retired into
the limbo that temporarily contains Lord Jellicoe and Sir William
Robertson. But Lord Rothermere (Lord Northcliffe's brother),
who still retains the confidence of Mr. Pemberton Billing.
remains, and all is well. The enemy possibly thinks it even
better. &quot;At least we should keep our heads,&quot; declared Mr.
Pringle during the debate on the Man-Power Bill. We are
not sure about this. It depends upon the heads.</p>

<p>It is a pity that the &quot;New Oxford Dictionary&quot; should have
so nearly reached completion before the War and the emergence
of hundreds of new words, now inevitably left out. The
Air service has a new language of its own, witness the conversation
faithfully reported by an expert:</p>

<p>SCENE: R.F.C. CLUB.
TIME: EVERY TIME.</p>

<p><i>First Pilot</i>. Why, it's Brown-Jones!</p>

<p><i>Second Pilot</i>. Hullo, old thing! What are you doing now?</p>

<p><i>First Pilot</i>. Oh, I'm down at Puddlemarsh teaching huns--monoavros, pups and dolphins.</p>

<p><i>Second Pilot</i>. I'm on the same game, down at Mudbank--sop-two-seaters
and camels. We've got an old tinside, too, for joy-riding.</p>

<p><i>First Pilot</i>. You've given up the rumpety, then?</p>

<p><i>Second Pilot</i>. Yes. I was getting ham-handed and mutton-fisted,
flapping the old things every day; felt I wanted to stunt
about a bit.</p>

<p><i>First Pilot</i>. Have you ever butted up against Robinson-Smith
at Mudbank? He was an ack-ee-o, but became a hun.</p>

<p><i>Second Pilot</i>. Yes, he crashed a few days ago--on his first
solo flip, taking off--tried to zoom, engine konked, bus stalled--sideslip--nose-dive. Not hurt, though. What's become of Smith-Jones? Do you know?</p>

<p><i>First Pilot</i>. Oh, yes. He's on quirks and ack-ws. He tried
spads, but got wind up. Have you seen the new-----?</p>

<p><i>Second Pilot</i>. Yes, it's a dud bus--only does seventy-five on
the ceiling. Too much stagger, and prop stops on a spin. Besides,
I never did care for rotaries. Full of gadgets too.</p>

<p><i>First Pilot</i>. Well, I must tootle off now. I'm flapping from
Northbolt at dawn if my old airship's ready--came down there
with a konking engine--plug trouble.</p>

<p><i>Second Pilot</i>. Well, cheerio, old thing--weather looks dud--you're
going to have it bumpy in the morning, if you're on a pup.</p>

<p><i>First Pilot</i>, Bye-bye, you cheery old bean.

<h4>THE POLITICIAN WHO ADDRESSED THE TROOPS</h4>
<br><br>
<p>The Emperor Karl of Austria, by his recent indiscretions,
is winning for himself the new title of &quot;His Epistolic Majesty.&quot;
His <a name="suggestion_that_France_ought_to_have_Alsace-Lorraine"></a>suggestion that France ought to have Alsace-Lorraine has
grated on the susceptibilities of his brother Wilhelm. But a
new fastidiousness is to be noted in the Teuton character.
&quot;Polygamy,&quot; says an article in a German review, &quot;is essential
to the future of the German race, but a decent form must be
found for it.&quot;</p>


<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>
<h2><a name="May,_1918."></a><i>May, 1918</i>.</h2>

<p>With the coming of May the Vision of Victory which
had nerved Germany to her greatest effort seemed
fading from her sight. <a name="Chemin_des_Dames"></a>With its last days we see them
making a second desperate effort to secure the prize, capturing
Soissons and the Chemin des Dames and pushing on to the
Marne. This time the French have borne the burden of the
onslaught, but Rheims is still held, the Americans are pouring
in to France at the rate of 250,000 a month, and have proved
their mettle at <a name="Cantigny"></a>Cantigny, a small fight of great importance, as
it &quot;showed their fighting qualities under extreme battle conditions,&quot;
in General Pershing's words, and <a name="earned_the_praise"></a>earned the praise
of General Debeney for the &quot;offensive valour&quot; of our Allies.</p>

<a name="The_Threatened_Peace_Offensive"></a>
<center><img src="images/236.png" alt="The Threatened Peace Offensive"></center>
<h4>THE THREATENED PEACE OFFENSIVE<br>
<br>
GERMAN EAGLE (to British Lion): &quot;I warn you--a little more of this obstinacy and you'll
rouse the dove in me!&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>The British troops have met Sir Douglas Haig's appeal as
we knew they would:</p>

<blockquote>Their <i>will</i> to <i>win</i> let Boches bawl<br>
As loudly as they choose,<br>
When once our back's against the wall<br>
'Tis not our <i>wont to lose</i>.<br></blockquote>

<p>Those who have gone back at the seventh wave are waiting
for the tide to turn. To the fainthearted or shaken souls who
contend that no victory is worth gaining at the cost of such
carnage and suffering, these lines addressed &quot;To Any Soldier&quot;
may serve as a solvent of their doubts and an explanation of
the mystery of sacrifice:</p>

<blockquote>If you have come through hell stricken or maimed,<br>
Vistas of pain confronting you on earth;<br>
If the long road of life holds naught of worth<br>
And from your hands the last toil has been claimed;<br>
If memories of horrors none has named<br>
Haunt with their shadows your courageous mirth<br>
And joys you hoped to harvest turn to dearth,<br>
And the high goal is lost at which you aimed;<br>
<br>
Think this--and may your heart's pain thus be healed--<br>
Because of me some flower to fruitage blew,<br>
Some harvest ripened on a death-dewed field,<br>
And in a shattered village some child grew<br>
To womanhood inviolate, safe and pure.<br>
For these great things know your reward is sure.<br></blockquote>

<p>The Germans have reached <a name="Sevastopol"></a>Sevastopol, but the Kaiser's
Junior Partner in the South is only progressing in the wrong
direction. While Wilhelm is laboriously struggling to get
nearer the sea, Mehmed is getting farther and farther away
from it. The attitude of Russia remains obscure. Mr. Balfour
tells us that it is not the intention of the Government to appoint
an Ambassador to Russia. But there is talk of sending out
an exploration party to find out just where Russia has got
to. Russia, however, is not the only country whose attitude
is obscure. The Leader of the Irish Nationalist Party is reported
to have said to a New York interviewer: &quot;We believe
that the cause of the Allies is the cause of Freedom throughout
the world.&quot; At the same time, while repudiating the policy of
the Sinn Feiners, he admitted that he had co-operated with
them in their resistance to the demand that Ireland should
defend the cause of Freedom. The <a name="creed_of_Sinn_Fein"></a>creed of Sinn Fein--&quot;Ourselves
Alone&quot;--is at least more logical than that of these
neutral Nationalists:</p>

<blockquote>And is not ours a noble creed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Self uplifted on the throne?<br>
Why should we bleed for others' need?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our motto is &quot;Ourselves Alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why prate of ruined lands out there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of churches shattered stone by stone?<br>
We need not care how others fare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We care but for &quot;Ourselves Alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Though mothers weep with anguished eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tortured children make their moan,<br>
Let others rise when Pity cries;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We rise but for &quot;Ourselves Alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let Justice be suppressed by Might,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mercy's seat be overthrown;<br>
For Truth and Right the fools may fight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We fight but for &quot;Ourselves Alone.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the gentle <a name="Mr._Duke_has_retired"></a>Mr. Duke has retired from the Chief
Secretaryship to the Judicial Bench; <a name="Mr._Shortt"></a>Mr. Shortt, his successor,
recently voted against conscription for Ireland; Lord French,
<a name="the_new_Viceroy"></a>the new Viceroy, is believed to favour it. The appointments
seem to have been made on the cancelling-out principle, and
are as hard to reconcile as the ministerial utterances on the recent
German push. Thus Mr. Macpherson declared that the crisis
came upon us like a thief in the night, while on the same day
Mr. Churchill observed that the German offensive had opened
a month later than we had calculated, and consequently our
reserves in munitions were correspondingly larger than they
would have been. Anyhow, it is a good hearing that the lost
guns, tanks, and aeroplanes have all been more than replaced,
and the stores of ammunition completely replenished, while
at the same time munition workers have been released for the
Army at the rate of a thousand <i>a</i> day. These results have been
largely due to the wonderful work of the women, who turned
out innumerable shells of almost incredible quality--not like
that depicted by our artist.</p>

<a name="THE_DUD"></a>
<center><img src="images/239.png" alt="THE DUD"></center>
<h4>THE DUD</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Mr. Bonar Law has brought in his Budget and asked for
a trifle of 842 millions. We are to pay more for our letters,
our cheques, and our tobacco. The <a name="Penny_Postage"></a>Penny Postage has gone,
and the Penny Pickwick with it.<a name="Maurice_Affair"></a> For the rest we have had the
Maurice Affair, which looked like a means of resurrecting the
Opposition but ended in giving the Government a new lease of
life, and<a name="pill-boxes"></a> Sir Eric Geddes has given unexpected support to the
allegations that the German pill-boxes were made of British
cement. At least he admitted that the port of Zeebrugge was
positively congested with shiploads of the stuff. <a name="Proportional_Representation"></a>Proportional Representation
has been knocked out for the fifth time in this
Parliament; and we have to thank Sir Mark Sykes for telling
us that the <a name="Whip's_definition_of_a_crank"></a>Whip's definition of a crank is &quot;a wealthy man who
does not want a Knighthood, or a nobleman who does not want
to be an Under-Secretary.&quot;</p>

<p>War is a great leveller.<a name="opera_by_an_English_composer"></a> The Carl Rosa Company are about
to produce an opera by an English composer. And war <i>is
</i> teaching us to revise our histories. For example, &quot;'Nelson,'
the greatest naval pageant film ever attempted, will,&quot; says the
<i>Daily News</i>, &quot;tell the love story of Nelson's life and the outstanding
incidents of his career, including the destruction of
the Spanish Armada.&quot; No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, we
trust. The <i><a name="Daily_News"></a>Daily News</i>, by the way, is much exercised by
Mr. Punch's language towards the enemy, which it describes
as being in the Billingsgate vein. In spite of which rebuke,
and at the risk of offending the readers of that patriotic organ,
Mr. Punch proposes to go on saying just what he thinks of
the Kaiser and his friends.</p>

<p>The price of tobacco, as we have seen, is becoming a serious
matter, but Ireland proposes to grapple with the problem in
her own way. The Ballinasloe Asylum Committee, according
to an announcement in the <i>Times</i> of May 14, have decided,
with the sanction of the authorities, to grow tobacco leaf for
the use of their inmates. &quot;A doctor said that if the patients
were debarred from an adequate supply of tobacco there would
be no controlling them.&quot;</p>

<p>As a set-off to the anti-&quot;Cuthbert&quot; campaign in the Press
the War Cabinet has in its Report declared that &quot;the whole
Empire owes the Civil Service a lasting debt of gratitude.&quot;
It looks as if there was something in red tape after all. We
must not, however, fail to recognise the growth of the new
competitive spirit in the sphere of production, and Mr. Punch
looks forward to the establishment of Cup Competitions for
Clydesdale Riveters and London <a name="Allotment_workers"></a>Allotment workers. Woman's
work in munition factories has already been applauded; her
services on the land are now more in need than ever.</p>

<br>
CERES: &quot;Speed the plough!&quot;<br>

PLOUGHMAN: &quot;I don't know who you are, ma'am, but it's no good speeding
the plough unless we can get the women to do the harvesting.&quot;<br>

(Fifty thousand more women are wanted on the land to take the place of men called to
the colours, if the harvest is to be got in.)</h4>

<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>
<h2><a name="June,_1918."></a><i>June, 1918</i>.</h2>

<p>The danger is not past, but grounds for hope multiply.
The new German assault between Montdidier and Noyon
has brought little substantial gain at heavy cost.
The attacks towards Paris have been held, and Paris, with
admirable fortitude, makes little of the attentions of &quot;Fat
Bertha.&quot; &quot;The struggle must be fought out,&quot; declared the
Kaiser in the recent anniversary of his accession to the throne.
In the meanwhile no opportunities of talking it out will be overlooked
by the enemy. He is once more playing the old game of striving to
promote discord between the Allies. At the very moment when the official
communiqu&eacute;s announced the capture of 45,000 prisoners, the
Chancellor began a <a name="new_peace_offensive"></a>new peace offensive, aimed primarily at France, and
supported by mendacious reports that the French Government were starting
for Bordeaux, Clemenceau overthrown, and Foch disgraced. But the
<a name="campaign_of_falsehood"></a>campaign of falsehood has proved powerless to shake France or impose on
the German people. Commandeered enthusiasm is giving place to grave
discontent. The awakening of Germany has begun, and the promise of a
speedy peace falls on deaf ears. In the process of enlightenment the
Americans have played a conspicuous part, in spite of the persistent
belittlement of the military experts in the official German Press. The
stars in their courses have sometimes seemed to fight for Germany, but
they are withdrawing their aid.</p>

<br><br>
<p>The long struggle between <a name="von_K&uuml;hlmann"></a>von K&uuml;hlmann and the generals
has ended in the fall of the Minister; but not before he had
indicated to the Reichstag the possibility of another Thirty
Years' War, and asserted that no intelligent man ever entertained
the wish that Germany should attain world-domination.
There was a time when this frank reflection on the Hohenzollern
intelligence would have constituted <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;.</i>
Coming from a Minister it amounts to a portent. Now he has
gone, but the growing belief that military operations cannot
end the war has not been scotched by his fall, and <a name="Hertling"></a>Herr Erzberger
vigorously carries on the campaign against Chancellor
Hertling and the generals. Austria has been at last goaded
into resuming the offensive on the Italian Front and met with
<a name="a_resounding_defeat"></a>a resounding defeat. It remains to be seen how Turkey and
Bulgaria will respond to the urgent appeals of their exacting
master.</p>

<p>The <a name="ordeal"></a>ordeal of our men on the Western Front is terrible,
but they have at least one grand and heartening stand-by in
the knowledge that they have plenty of guns and no lack of
shells behind them. This is the burden of the &quot;<a name="Song_of_Plenty"></a>Song of Plenty&quot;
from an old soldier to a young one:</p>

<blockquote>The shelling's cruel bad, my son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't you look too black,<br>
For every blessed German one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He gets a dozen back--<br>
But I remember the days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When shells were terrible few<br>
And never the guns could bark and blaze<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as they do for you.<br>
<br>
But they sat in the swamp behind, my boy, and prayed for a tiny shell,<br>
While Fritz, if he had the mind, my boy, could give us a first-class hell;<br>
And I know that a 5.9 looks bad to a bit of a London kid,<br>
But I tell you you were a lucky lad to come out when you did.<br>
<br>
Up in the line again, my son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dirty work, no doubt,<br>
But when the dirty work is done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll take the Regiment out--<br>
But I remember a day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When men were terrible few<br>
And we hadn't reserves a mile away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as there are for you,<br>
<br>
But fourteen days at a stretch, my boy, and nothing about relief;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fight and carry and fetch, my boy, with rests exceeding brief;<br>
And rotten as all things sometimes are, they're not as they used to be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you ought to thank your lucky star you didn't come out with me.</blockquote>


<p>Our mercurial Premier lays himself open to a good deal
of legitimate criticism, but for this immense relief, unstinted
thanks are due to his energy and the devoted labours of the
munition workers, women as well as men.</p>

<p>The Admiralty have decided not to publish the Zeebrugge
<a name="Zeebrugge dispatches"></a>
dispatches for fear of giving information to the enemy.  <a name="Keyes"></a>All
he knows at present is that a score and more of his torpedo-boats,
submarines, and other vessels have been securely locked
up in the Bruges Canal by British Keyes. The Minister of
Pensions has told the House the moving story of what has
already been done to restore, so far as money and care can do
it, the broken heroes of the War, and Lord Newton's alleged
obstructiveness in regard to the treatment and exchange of
prisoners has been discussed in the Lords. Mr. Punch's own
impression is that Lord Newton owes his unmerited position
as whipping boy to the fact that he does not suffer fools gladly,
even if they come in the guise of newspaper reporters; and
that, unlike his illustrious namesake, he has no use for the
theory of gravity. Meanwhile the Kaiser, with a sublime disregard
for sunk hospital-ships and bombed hospitals, continues
to exhibit his bleeding heart to an astonished world.</p>

<br><br>
<p>It is remarkable how the British soldier will pick up languages,
or at least learn to interpret them. Only last week an
American corporal stopped a British Sergeant and said: &quot;Say,
Steve, can you put me wise where I can barge into a boiled-shirt
biscuit-juggler who would get me some eats?&quot; And the
Sergeant at once directed him to a caf&eacute;. The <a name="training_of_the_new_armies"></a>training of the new armies,
to judge by the example depicted by our artist,
affords fresh proof of the saying that love is a <i>liberal</i> education.</p>

<p>The situation on the Parliamentary Front has been fairly
quiet. The popular pastime of asking when the promised Home
Rule Bill is to be introduced is no longer met by suitably
varied but invariably evasive replies. The Government has
now frankly admitted that the policy of running Home Rule
and Conscription in double harness has been abandoned, and
expects better things from the new pair: Firm Government and
Voluntary Recruiting. But sceptics are unconvinced that the
Government will abandon the leniency prompted by &quot;the insane
view of creating an atmosphere in which something incomprehensible
is to occur.&quot;</p>

<br><br>

<p><a name="Order_of_the_British_Empire"></a>The lavish and, in many cases, inexplicable distribution of
the Order of the British Empire bids fair to add a peculiar
lustre to the undecorated. The War has produced no stranger
paradox than the case of the gentleman who within the space
of seven days was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for
a breach of the Defence of the Realm regulations and recommended
for the O.B.E. on account of good services to the
country. The fact that the recommendation was withdrawn
hardly justified the assumption of a Pacificist Member that a
sentence under the Defence of the Realm Act was regarded as
the higher honour of the two.</p>

<p>There is one thing, however, that war at its worst cannot
do. It cannot make an Englishman forgo that peculiar and
blessed birthright which enables him to overthrow the Giant
Despair with the weapon of whimsical humour--in other words,
to write, as a young officer has written for Mr. Punch, such a
set of verses as the following in June, 1918:</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="THE_BEST_SMELL_OF_ALL"></a>THE BEST SMELL OF ALL</p>

When noses first were carved for men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of varied width and height,<br>
Strange smells and sweet were fashioned then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all might know delight--<br>
Smells for the hooked, the snub, the fine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pug, the gross, the small,<br>
A smell for each, and one divine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Last smell to soothe them all.<br>
<br>
The baccy smell, the smell of peat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough gruff smell of tweed,<br>
The rain smell on a dusty street<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are all good smells indeed;<br>
The sea smell smelt through resinous trees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of burning wood,<br>
The saintly smell of dairies--these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are all rich smells and good.<br>
<br>
And good the smell the nose receives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From new-baked loaves, from hops,<br>
From churches, from decaying leaves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From pinks, from grocers' shops;<br>
And smells of rare and fine bouquet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proceed, the world allows,<br>
From petrol, roses, cellars, hay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrubbed planks, hot gin and cows.<br>
<br>
But there's a smell that doth excel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All other smells by far,<br>
Even the tawny stable smell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the boisterous smell of tar;<br>
A smell stupendous, past compare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of smells, the prize,<br>
That smell which floods the startled air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When home-cured bacon fries!<br>
<br>
All other smells, whate'er their worth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though dear and richly prized,<br>
Are earthy smells and of the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are smells disparadised;<br>
But when that smell of smells awakes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From ham of perfect cure,<br>
It lifts the heart to heaven and makes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The doom of Satan sure.<br>
<br>
How good to sit at twilight's close<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a warm inn and feel<br>
That marvellous smell caress the nose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With promise of a meal!<br>
How good when bell for breakfast rings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To pause, while tripping down,<br>
And snuff and snuff till Fancy brings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All Arcady to Town!<br>
<br>
But best, when day's first glimmerings break<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through curtains half withdrawn,<br>
To lie and smell it, scarce awake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In some great farm at dawn;<br>
Cocks crow, the milkmaid clanks the pails,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The housemaid bangs the stairs;<br>
And BACON suddenly assails<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nostrils unawares.<br>
<br>
Noses of varied width and height<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth kindly Heaven bestow,<br>
And choice of smells for our delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all some joy may know;<br>
Noses and smells for all the race<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That on this earth do dwell,<br>
And for a final act of grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The astounding bacon smell.<br></blockquote>

<p>But the War has its drawbacks, and owing to its unexpected
prolongation there is a rumour that Mr. H.G. Wells
will readjust his ideas on the subject quarterly instead of twice
a week as before.</p>

A Champagne Counter-Offensive</h4>
<br><br>
<p>On the 15th the Germans launched their great offensive.
On the 20th they recrossed the Marne, and are now entitled to
complain that General Foch not only took over the French
and British armies, but has recently started taking over a good
part of the German army. The neighbourhood has never been
a healthy one for the Huns since the days of Attila.</p>

<p>Fritz has crossed the Marne and recrossed it--according to
plan--and is already on the way to the Aisne. The battle
of the rivers has begun again, but on new lines. Yet this amazing
turn of the tide has been taken very quietly in France and
England. The Allies have rung no joy-bells; they are content
with doing their best to give Germany no occasion for further
indulgence in that form of jubilation. And Germany is meeting
them more than half way, their authorities having ordered
a supplementary <a name="requisition_of_those_church-bells"></a>requisition of those church-bells which were
exempted when the first confiscation was made. &quot;At this heavy
hour,&quot; said von K&uuml;hlmann to the Reichstag, &quot;none of us fully
realise what we owe to the German Emperor.&quot; That was a
month ago; the realisation of their indebtedness has since
advanced by leaps and bounds. There are now 1,000,000
Americans in France. But the Kaiser and his War-lords are
still passing their victims through the fire to the Pan-German
Moloch, and threatening to send German generals to teach
the Austrian Army how to win offensives. It is even reported
that the Germans contemplate placing the ex-king of Greece
on the throne of Finland. <a name="Ekaterinburg"></a>Fantastic rumours are rife in these
days; but there is only too good reason to believe the report
that the ex-Tsar, the Tsaritsa, and their daughters have all been
murdered by their brutal captors at Ekaterinburg. It seems
but yesterday when Nicholas was acclaimed as the Saviour
and regenerator of his people, and now Tsardom, irrevocably
fallen from its high estate, has gone down amid scenes of
butchery and barbarity that eclipse the Reign of Terror in
France.</p>

<p>Little has happened at Westminster to indicate a consciousness
on the part of the members of the great and glorious
events in France. The Irish Expeditionary Force, after an
absence of three months and a severe training at home, has
returned to the Parliamentary Front, and their war-cry is
&quot;Devlin's the friend, not Shortt!&quot; But the Chief Secretary
was able to make the gratifying announcement that the voluntary
recruiting campaign is to be assisted by several Nationalist
M.P.'s, including Captain Stephen <a name="Gwynn"></a>Gwynn, who has been
serving in the trenches, and Colonel Lynch, who, having raised
one Irish brigade to fight against us in the Boer War, and been
sentenced to death for doing it, has now, with an inconsistency
we cannot too gratefully recognise, undertaken to raise another
to fight on our side. Mr. Bonar Law has revealed the interesting
fact that only 288 members of the House of Commons have
received titles, decorations, or offices of profit since it was
elected in December, 1910. The unnoticed residue are probably
wondering whether it is their own modesty or the shortsightedness
of Ministers that has caused them to be passed over. Mr.
Billing, after several pathetic but futile efforts to regain his
place in the limelight, has at last succeeded in getting himself
named, <a name="suspended"></a>suspended, and forcibly assisted by four stalwart
officials in his exit from the House--the most salutary movement,
in the opinion of most members, with which he has yet
been connected.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir <a name="Rosslyn_Wemyss"></a>Rosslyn Wemyss, in a recent speech, said that
the association between the two Services, the Royal Navy and
the Mercantile Marine, had been so close during the War,
whatever that association might have been before, that it seemed
to him almost incredible that it could ever be broken asunder.
The First Sea Lord's statement is welcome and natural. But
there is nothing really new in this solidarity of the seas. The
Secret of the Ships is an old story:</p>

<blockquote>On their ventures in the service of a Tudor King or Queen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the ships were just as like as they could be,<br>
For the merchantman gave battle, while the Royal ship was seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As a not too simple trader over-sea:<br>
Being heirs to ancient customs, when their upper sails came down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As a token of respect in passing by,<br>
They would add the salutation in a language of their own,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;God speed you, we be sisters, thou and I.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the centuries receded came a parting of the ways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in time the separation went so far<br>
That a family was founded who were traders all their days,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And another who were always men-of-war;<br>
But whene'er they dipped their colours, one in faith, they understood--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sea, who taught them both, could tell you why--<br>
That the custom never altered, so the greeting still held good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;God speed you, we be sisters, thou and I.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then in days of common sacrifice and peril was it strange<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That they ratified the union of the past?<br>
While their Masters, unsuspecting, greatly marvelled at the change,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But they prayed with all their souls that it would last;<br>
And the ships, who know the secret, go rejoicing on their way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For whatever be the ensign that they fly,<br>
Such as keep the seas with honour are united when they pray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;God speed you, we be sisters, thou and I.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>No record of the month would be complete without notice
of the unique way in which the<a name="Fourth_of_July"></a> Fourth of July has been celebrated

<br><br><hr style="width: 35%;"><br><br>
<h2><i><a name="August,_1918"></a>August, 1918</i>.</h2>

<p>July was a glorious month for the Allies, and August is
even better. It began with the recovery of Soissons; a week
later it was the turn of the British, and Sir Douglas Haig
struck hard on the Amiens front; since then the enemy have
been steadily driven back by the unrelenting pressure of the
Allies, <a name="Bapaume_and_Noyon"></a>Bapaume and Noyon have been recaptured, and with
their faces set for home the Germans have learnt to recognise
in a new and unpleasant sense the truth of the Kaiser's saying,
&quot;The worst is behind us.&quot; The 8th of August was a bad day
for Germany, for it showed that the counter-offensive was not
to be confined to one section; that henceforth no respite would
be allowed from hammer-blows. The German High Command
endeavours to tranquillise the German people by <i>communiqu&eacute;s</i>,
the gist of which may thus be rendered in verse:</p>

<blockquote>In those very identical regions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sunder the Marne from the Aisne<br>
We advanced to the rear with our legions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago and have done it again;<br>
Fools murmur of errors committed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But every intelligent man<br>
Has accepted the view that we flitted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;According to plan.<br></blockquote>

<p>The <a name="French_rivers"></a>French rivers have found their voice again:</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twas the voice of the Marne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That began it with &quot;Garn!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full speed, Fritz, astarn!&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Ourcq and the Crise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sang &quot;Move on, if you please.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ardre and the Vesle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Took up the glad tale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And cried to the Aisne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Wash out the Hun stain.&quot;<br>
So all the way back from the Marne the French rivers<br>
Have given the Boches in turn the cold shivers.<br></blockquote>

<br><br>
<p>Hindenburg has confided to a newspaper correspondent that
the German people need to develop the virtue of patience.
According to the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> he has declared that he
was not in favour of the July offensive. Ludendorff, on the
other hand, may fairly point out that it isn't his offensive any
longer. Anyhow, Hindenburg is fairly entitled to give Ludendorff
the credit of it since Ludendorff's friends have always
said that he supplied the old Mud-Marshal with brains. The
amenities of the High Command are growing lively, since the
Navy is also concerned, and the failure of the U-boats to check
the influx of American troops needs a lot of explaining away.
The good news from the Front has been received at home
with remarkable composure, when one considers the acute
anxiety of the last four months. But it is the way of England
to endure felicity with calmness and adversity with fortitude.
In the House of Lords Lord Inchcape and Lord Emmott have
been propitiating Nemesis by their warnings of the gloomy
financial future that is in store for us, while in the Commons
the Bolshevist group below the gangway are apparently much
perturbed by the prospect that Russia may be helped on to
her legs again by the Allies. Mr. Dillon's indictment of the
Government for their treatment of Ireland has had, however,
a welcome if unexpected result. Mr. Shortt, the new Chief
Secretary, an avowed and unrepentant Home Ruler, has been
telling Mr. Dillon's followers a few plain truths about themselves:
that they have made no effort to turn the Home Rule
Act into a practical measure; that instead of denouncing Sinn
Fein they had followed its lead; that they had attacked the
Irish executive when they ought to have supported it, and by
their refusal to help recruiting had forfeited the sympathy of
the British working classes. Mr. Lloyd George, in his review
of the War, <a name="warned_the_peacemongers"></a>warned the peacemongers not to expect their efforts
to succeed until the enemy knew he was beaten, but vouchsafed
no information as to his alleged intention to go to the country
in the political sense. In spite of the Premier's warning the
Pacificists made another futile attempt on the very next day
to convince the House that the Germans were ready to make
an honest peace if only our Government would listen to it.
They were well answered by Mr. Robertson, who was a Pacificist
himself until this War converted him, and by Mr. Balfour,
who declared that we were quite ready to talk to Germany as
soon as she showed any sign of a change of heart. Up to the
present there has been no sign of it.</p>

<p>Food is still the universal topic. Small green apples, says
a contemporary, are proving popular. A boy correspondent,
however, desires Mr. Punch to say that he has a little inside
information to the contrary. Nottingham children, it is stated, are to
be paid 3d. a pound for gathering blackberries, but they are not to use
their own receptacles. Captain Amundsen is on his way to the Pole, but
we fear that he will not find any cheese there. The vocabulary of food
control has even made its way to the nursery. A small girl on being
informed by her nurse that a new little baby brother had come to live
with her promptly replied: &quot;Well, he can't stay unless he's brought
his coupons,&quot;</p>

<h4>LATEST ADDITION TO MINISTRY STAFF: &quot;What's
the tea-time here?&quot;<br>
CICERONE: &quot;Usual--three to five-thirty.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Yet one of Mr.
Punch's poets, in prophetic and optimistic strain, has
actually dared to speculate on the delights of life without
&quot;Dora&quot;; Dickens, with the foresight of genius, wrote in
&quot;David Copperfield&quot; how his hero &quot;felt it would have been
an act of perfidy to Dora to have a natural relish for my dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>The enterprise of <i>The Times</i> in securing the reminiscences of
the Kaiser's American dentist (or gum-architect, as he is called
in his native land) has aroused mingled feelings. But the
Kaiser is reported to have stated in no ambiguous terms that
if, after the War, any Americans are to be given access to him,
from Ambassadors downwards, they must be able neither to
read nor write. <i>The Times</i> is also responsible for the headline:
&quot;The Archangel Landing.&quot; There was a rumour of something
of this kind after Mons, but this is apparently official.</p>

<p>One prominent effect of the War has been to make two
Propagandist Departments flourish where none grew before, and
it is to be feared that the reflection on the industry of our new
officials implied in the picture on the previous page is not without
foundation.</p>

<p><a name="poetry"></a>War has not only stimulated the composition, but the
perusal of poetry, especially among women:</p>

<blockquote>When the Armageddon diet<br>

She prescribes herself (from Pope)<br>

<h2><i><a name="September,_1918"></a>September, 1918</i>.</h2>

<p>Since July 15th, when the Kaiser mounted a high observation
post to watch the launching of the offensive which
was to achieve his crowning victory, but proved the
prelude of the German collapse, the conflict has raged continuously
and with uninterrupted success for the Allied Armies.
The Kaiser Battle has become the Battle of Liberation. The
French bore the initial burden of the attack, but since August 8
&quot;hundreds of thousands of unbeaten Tommies,&quot; to quote the
phrase of a French military expert, have entered into action in
a succession of attacks started one after the other all the way up
to Flanders. Rawlinson, Horne, and Byng have carried on the
hammer work begun by Mangin, Gouraud, and Debeney.
<a name="Drocourt-Qu&eacute;ant"></a>P&eacute;ronne has been recovered, the famous Drocourt-Qu&eacute;ant
switch-line has been breached, the Americans have flattened
out the St. Mihiel salient. The perfect liaison of British and
French and Americans has been a wonderful example of combined
effort rendered possible by unity of command. &quot;Marshal
Foch strikes to-day at a new front,&quot; is becoming a standing
headline. And this highly desirable &quot;epidemic of strikes&quot;
is not confined to the Western Front. As Generalissimo of all
the Allied Forces the great French Marshal has planned and
carried out an <i>ensemble</i> of operations designed to shatter and
demoralise the enemy at every point. The <a name="long_inaction"></a>long inaction on
the Salonika Front has been ended by the rapid and triumphant
advance of the British, French, Serbians, and Greeks under
General Franchet d'Esperey. Eight days sufficed to <a name="smash_the_Bulgarians"></a>smash the Bulgarians,
and the armistice then granted was followed four
days later by the <a name="surrender_of_Bulgaria"></a>surrender of Bulgaria. In less than a fortnight
<a name="General_Allenby_pushed_north"></a>General Allenby pushed north from Jerusalem, annihilated
the Turkish armies in Palestine, and <a name="captured_Damascus"></a>captured Damascus.
<a name="way_of_the_wotan"></a>And by the end of the month the <a name="Hindenburg_line"></a>Hindenburg line had been
breached and gone the way of the &quot;Wotan&quot; line. Wotan was
not a happy choice:</p>

<blockquote>But even super-Germans are wont at times to nod,<br>

For dark decline o'erwhelmed his line: he saw his god-head wane,<br>
And his stately palace vanish in a red and ruinous vain.<br></blockquote>

Prince thinks the German Sovereign worth. But the end is
not yet. Our pride in the achievements of our Armies and
Generals, in the heroism of our Allies and the strategy of
Marshal Foch does not blind us to the skill and tenacity with
which the Germans are conducting their retreat. Fritz is a
tough fighter; if only he had fought a clean fight we could look
forward to a thorough reconciliation. But that is a far cry
for those who have been in the war, farthest of all for our
sailormen, who can never forget certain acts of frightfulness.</p>

<a name="Cambrai"></a>Every day brings tidings of a new victory. St.
Quentin, Cambrai, and Laon had all been recaptured in the
first fortnight.<a name="Douai_were_regained"></a> On the 17th Ostend, Lille, and Douai were regained,
<a name="Bruges_was_reoccupied"></a>Bruges was reoccupied on the 19th, and by the 20th
the <a name="Belgian_Army_under_King_Albert"></a>Belgian Army under King Albert, reinforced by the French
and Americans, and with the Second British Army under
General Plumer on the right, had compelled the Germans to
evacuate the whole <a name="coast_of_Flanders"></a>coast of Flanders. The Battle of Liberation,
which began on the Marne in July, is now waged uninterruptedly
from the Meuse to the sea. Only in Lorraine has the
advance of the American Army been held up by the difficulties
of the <i>terrain</i> and the exceptionally stubborn resistance of the
Germans.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the &quot;war of movement &quot; has gone on with unrelenting
energy according to Foch's plan, which suggests a
revision of Pope:</p>

<blockquote>Great Foch's law is by this rule exprest,<br>
Prevent the coming, speed the parting pest.<br></blockquote>

<p>The German, true to his character of the world's worst loser
and winner, leaves behind him all manner of booby-traps, some
puerile, many diabolical, which give our sappers plenty of
work, cause a good many casualties, and only confirm the
resolve of the victors.</p>

<p>According to a German paper--the <i>Rhenish Westphalian
Gazette</i>--ex-criminals are being drafted into the German Army.
But the Allies propose to treat them without invidious distinction.
The Crown Prince recently observed that he had
&quot;many friends in the Entente countries&quot;; as a matter of fact,
we seem to be getting them at the rate of about twenty-five
thousand a week.<a name="Leinster"></a> The criminals in the German Navy have
again been busy, adding to their previous exploits the sinking
of the passenger steamer <i>Leinster</i>, in the Irish Channel, with
heavy loss of life, the worst disaster of the kind since the
torpedoing of the <i>Lusitania</i>. Yet it is Germany that is the
sinking ship. <a name="Ferdinand_of_Bulgaria"></a>Ferdinand of Bulgaria has joined the League
of Abdication, and according to a Sofia telegram, will devote himself to
scientific pursuits. His only regret is that the Allies thought of it
first. Prince Friedrich Karl of Hesse says that his accession to the
throne of Finland will not take place for two years, and for the first
time since his emergence into publicity we find ourselves in agreement
with this monarch-elect. <a name="Ludendorff"></a>Ludendorff has resigned.
<a name="Austria_is_suing"></a>Austria is suing for
peace; <a name="Count_Tisza"></a>Count Tisza asks: &quot;Why not admit frankly that we have lost
the War?&quot; <a name="Piave"></a>The Italians have crossed the Piave, and the Serbians
have <a name="reached_the_Danube"></a>reached the Danube. Turkey has been granted an armistice, and with
the daily victories of the Allies comes the daily report that the Kaiser
has abdicated.</p>

<br><br>
<p><a name="Prince_Max"></a>Prince Max of Baden, the successor of Hertling in the
Chancellorship, whose appointment hardly bears out the
promise of popular government, has issued a pacific Manifesto
which inspires an &quot;Epitaph in anticipation&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>In memory of poor Prince Max,<br>
Who, posing as the friend of Pax,<br>
Yet was not noticeably lax<br>
In the true Teuton faith which hacks<br>
Its way along; forbidden tracks,<br>
Marks bloody dates on almanacs<br>
And holds all promises as wax;<br>
Breeding, where once we knew Hans Sachs,<br>
A race of monomaniacs....<br>
But now illusion's mirror cracks,<br>
The radiant vision fades, the axe<br>
Lies at the root. So farewell, Max!<br></blockquote>

<p>Certain people have proclaimed their opinion that the
German nation ought not to be humiliated. When all is said,
Mr. Punch saves his pity for our murdered dead.</p>

<p>Parliament has met again, not that there is any very
urgent need for their labours just now.<a name="discuss_a_military_situation"></a> With a caution that
seemed excessive Mr. Bonar Law has thought it premature
to discuss a military situation changing every hour--though
happily always for the better--or even to propose a formal Vote
of Thanks to men who are daily adding to their harvest of
laurels. <a name="fourteen_points"></a>On better grounds discussion of Mr. Wilson's famous
&quot;fourteen points&quot; and of demobilisation has been deprecated.
The suggestion--made opportunely on Trafalgar Day--for
securing marks of distinction for our merchant seamen gained
a sympathetic hearing, and the proposal to make women
eligible for Parliament has been carried after a serious debate
by an overwhelming majority in which the <i>ci-devant</i> anti-suffragists
were as prominent as the others. Five years ago
such a motion would have furnished an orgy of alleged humour,
and been laughed out of the House. Mr. Dillon and his colleagues
have put a great many questions about the torpedoing
of the <i>Leinster</i> and the lack of an escort. But it is unfortunate
that their tone suggested more indignation with the alleged
laches of the Admiralty than horror at the German crime.
Irish indignation over the outrage, according to a Nationalist
M.P., is intense; but not to the point of expressing itself in
khaki.</p>

<p>The woes of the Irish <a name="harvest_labourers"></a>harvest labourers in England have
not yet been fully appreciated, and seem to demand a revised
version of &quot;Moira O'Neill's&quot; beautiful poem:</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="THE_IRISH_EXILE"></a>THE IRISH EXILE</p>

the steady growth of goat-keeping, and the exactions of taxi-drivers.
It is now suggested that if one of these pirates should

<p>Mr. Bonar Law has been <a name="making_trips_to_and_from_France"></a>making trips to and from France
by aeroplane. The report that a number of members of the
Opposition have been invited by the Admiralty to make a
descent in a depth-charge turns out to be unfounded. The
prospects of peace are being discussed on public platforms, but,
as yet, with commendable discretion. <a name="Mr._Roberts"></a>Mr. Roberts, our excellent
Minister of Labour, has made bold to say that &quot;the happenings
of the last six weeks justify us in the belief that peace is much
nearer than it was during the earlier part of the year.&quot; And
a weekly paper has offered a prize of &pound;500 to the reader who
predicts the date when the War will end. Meanwhile, Hanover
is said to have made <a name="Hindenburg_a_birthday_present"></a>Hindenburg a birthday present of a

<h2><i><a name="November,_1918"></a>November, 1918</i>.</h2>

<p>The end has come with a swiftness that has outdone
the hopes of the most sanguine optimists. In
the first eleven days of November we have seen history
in the making on a larger scale and with larger possibilities
than at any time since the age of Napoleon, perhaps since the
world began.</p>

<p>To take the chief events in order, the <a name="Versailles_Conference_opened"></a>Versailles Conference opened
on the 1st; on the 3rd <a name="Austria_gave_in"></a>Austria gave in and the resolve of
the German Naval High Command to challenge the Grand Fleet
in the North Sea was paralysed by the mutiny at Kiel; on the 5th
the Versailles Conference gave full powers to <a name="Marshal_Foch"></a>Marshal Foch to
arrange the terms of an armistice,<a name="last_of_his_Notes"></a> and President Wilson
addressed the last of his Notes to Germany;<a name="Sedan"></a> on the 6th the
American Army reached Sedan; on the 9th <a name="Marshal_Foch_received"></a>Marshal Foch received
Erzberger and the other German Envoys, the Berlin
<a name="Revolution_broke_out"></a>Revolution broke out, and the Kaiser abdicated; on the 10th
the <a name="Kaiser_fled_to_Holland"></a>Kaiser fled to Holland, and the British reached Mons. The
wheel had come full circle. The Belgian, British, French, and
American Armies now formed a semi-circle from Ghent to
Sedan, and threatened to surround the German Armies already
in retreat and crowded into the narrow valley of the Meuse.
Everything was ready for Foch's final attack; indeed, he was
on the point of attacking when the Germans, recognising that
they were faced with the prospect of a Sedan ten times greater
than that of 1870, <a name="signed_on_November_11_an_armistice"></a>signed on November 11 an armistice which
was equivalent to a military capitulation, and gave Marshal
Foch all that he wanted without the heavy losses which further
fighting would have undoubtedly involved. <a name="greatest_military_genius"></a>He had shown
himself the greatest military genius of the War. Here, in the
words of one of his former colleagues at the Ecole de Guerre,
he proved himself free from the stains which have so often
tarnished great leaders in war, the lust of conquest and personal
ambition. Not only the Allies, but the whole world owes an
incalculable debt to this soldier of justice, compact of reason
and faith, imperturbable in adversity, self-effacing in the hour
of victory. Glorious also is the record of the other French
<a name="Generals"></a>Generals: the strong-souled P&eacute;tain, hero of Verdun; the heroic
Maunoury; Castlenau and Mangin, Gouraud, Debeney, and
Franchet d'Esperey, Captains Courageous, worthy of France,
her cause, and her indomitable <i>poilus</i>. In the record of acknowledgment
France stands first since her sacrifices and losses have
been heaviest, and she gave us in <a name="Foch_the_chief_organiser"></a>Foch the chief organiser of
victory, <a name="in_Clemenceau"></a>in Clemenceau the most inspiring example of intrepid
statesmanship. But the <a name="War_could_not_have_been_won"></a>War could not have been won
without England and the Empire; without the ceaseless vigil in
the North Sea; without the heroes of Jutland and Coronel, of the
Falkland Isles and Zeebrugge, of the Fleets behind the Fleet;
without the services of Smith-Dorrien at Mons, French at
Ypres; without the dogged endurance, the inflexible will and
the self-sacrificing loyalty of Haig; the dash of Maude and
Allenby; the steadfast leadership in defence and offence of
Plumer and <a name="Byng"></a>Byng,
Horne and Rawlinson and <a name="Birdwood"></a>Birdwood.</p>

<p>These are only some of the heroes who have added to the
glories of our blood and State, but the roll is endless--wonderful
gunners and sappers and airmen and dispatch riders, devoted
surgeons and heroic nurses, stretcher-bearers and ambulance
drivers. But Mr. Punch's special heroes are the Second Lieutenants
and the Tommy who went on winning the War all the
time and never said that he was winning it until it was won.</p>

<p>As for the <a name="young_officers"></a>young officers, dead and living, their record is
the best answer to the critics, mostly of the arm-chair type,
who have chosen this time to assail our public school system.
In the papers of one of them killed on August 28 there was
found an article written in reply to &quot;The Loom of Youth,&quot;
ending with these words: &quot;Perhaps the greatest consolation
of these attacks on our greatest heritage in England (for we
are the unique possessors of the Public Schools) is the conviction
that they will have but little effect. Every public school
boy is serving, and one in every six gives up his life. They
cannot be such bad places after all.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the <a name="great_mistakes"></a>great mistakes made by Germany perhaps the greatest
was in reckoning on the detachment of <a name="the_Dominions"></a>the Dominions. The
Canadians have made answer on a hundred stricken fields
before and after Vimy Ridge. Australia gave her goodliest at
Gallipoli, crowning the imperishable glory of those who died
there by her refusal to make a grievance of the apparent failure
of the expedition, and by the amazing achievement of her troops
in the last six months of the War.</p>

<p>The immortal dead, British, Australians, New Zealanders,
who fell in the great adventure of the narrow straits are not
forgotten in the hour of triumph.</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="GALLIPOLI"></a>GALLIPOLI</p>
<i>Qui procul hinc ante diem perierunt</i>.<br>
<br>
Ye unforgotten, that for a great dream died,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose failing sense darkened on peaks unwon,<br>
Whose souls went forth upon the wine-dark tide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To seas beyond the sun,<br>
Far off, far off, but ours and England's yet,<br>
Know she has conquered! Live again, and let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The clamouring trumpets break oblivion!<br>
<br>
Not as we dreamed, nor as you strove to do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The strait is cloven, the crag is made our own;<br>
The salt grey herbs have withered over you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars of Spring gone down,<br>
And your long loneliness has lain unstirred<br>
By touch of home, unless some migrant bird<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed eastward from the white cliffs to the brown.<br>
<br>
Hard by the nameless dust of Argive men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembered and remote, like theirs of Troy,<br>
Your sleep has been, nor can ye wake again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any cry of joy;<br>
Summers and snows have melted on the waves.<br>
And past the noble silence of your graves<br>

But not in vain, not all in vain, thank God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that you were and all you might have been<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With glories perishable of all things seen.<br>

Children of one dear land and every sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last fulfilment comes--the night is o'er;<br>
Now, as at Samothrace, swift Victory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walks winged on the shore;<br>
And England, deathless Mother of the dead,<br>
Gathers, with lifted eyes and unbowed head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silent sons into her arms once more.<br></blockquote>

<p>Crowns and thrones have rocked and toppled of late, but
<a name="our_King_and_Queen"></a>our King and Queen, by their unsparing and unfaltering
devotion to duty, by their simplicity of life and unerring instinct
for saying and doing the right thing, have not only set a fine
example, but strengthened their hold on the loyalty of all
classes. And <a name="King_Albert"></a>King Albert, who defied Germany at the outset,
shared the dangers of his soldiers in retreat and disaster, and
throughout the war proved an inspiration to his people, has
been spared to lead them to victory and has gloriously come
into his own again. His decision to resist Germany was perhaps
the most heroic act of the War, and he has emerged
from his tremendous ordeal with world-wide prestige and
unabated distaste for the limelight. The liberation and
<a name="resurrection_of_Belgium"></a>resurrection of Belgium and Serbia have been two of the most splendid
outcomes of the World War, as the <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> in Russia and the
<a name="martyrdom_of_Armenia"></a>martyrdom of Armenia have been its greatest tragedies.</p>

<p>Parliament has been seen at its best and worst. When the
Prime Minister rose in the House on the afternoon of the 11th
to announce the terms of the Armistice signed at 5 A.M. that
morning, members from nearly all parts of the House rose
to acclaim him. Even &quot;the ranks of Tuscany&quot; on the front
Opposition bench joined in the general cheering. Only Mr.
Dillon and his half-dozen supporters remained moody and
silent, and when Mr. Speaker, in his gold-embroidered joy-robes,
headed a great <a name="procession_to_St._Margaret's_Church"></a>procession to St. Margaret's Church,
and the ex-Premier and his successor--the man who drew the
sword of Britain in the war for freedom and the man whose
good fortune it has been to replace it in the sheath--fell in
side by side, behind them walked the representatives of every
party save one. Mr. Dillon and his associates had more urgent
business in one of the side lobbies--to consider, perhaps, why
Lord Grey of Falloden, in his eve-of-war speech, had referred
to Ireland as &quot;the one bright spot.&quot; This Irish aloofness is
wondrously illustrated by the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of Dublin,
which, in its issue of November 10, spoke of a racing event as
the only redeeming feature of &quot;an unutterably dull week.&quot; We
have to thank Mr. Dillon, however, for unintentionally enlivening
the dulness of the discussion on the relations of Lord Northcliffe
to the Ministry of Information and his forecast of the
peace terms. Mr. Baldwin, for the Government, while endeavouring
to allay the curiosity of members, said that
&quot;Napoleons will be Napoleons.&quot; Mr. Dillon seemed to desire
the appointment of a &quot;Northcliffe Controller,&quot; but that is
impracticable. All our bravest men are too busy to take on the
job. Better still was the pointed query of Lord Henry Bentinck,
&quot;Is it not possible to take Lord Northcliffe a little too
seriously?&quot; But there are other problems to which the
House has been addressing itself with a justifiable seriousness--and
demobilisation, the shortage of food and coal,
and the question how at the same time we are to provide for
the outlay of coals of fire and feed the Huns and not the guns.</p>

<p>And how has England taken the news? In the main soberly
and in a spirit of infinite thankfulness, though in too many
thousands of homes the loss of our splendid, noble and gallant
sons--alas! so often only sons--who made victory possible
by the gift of their lives, has made rejoicing impossible for
those who are left to mourn them. Yet there is consolation in
the knowledge that if they had lived to extreme old age
they could never have made a nobler thing of their lives.
Shakespeare, who &quot;has always been there before,&quot; wrote the
epitaph of those who fell in France when he spoke of one
who gave</p>

<blockquote>His body to that pleasant country's earth,<br>
And his pure soul unto his captain, Christ,<br>
Under whose colours he had fought so long.<br></blockquote>

<h4>ARMISTICE DAY<br>
<br>
SMALL CHILD (excitedly): &quot;Oh, Mother, what <i>do</i> you think? They've given
us a whole holiday to-day in aid of the war.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>And it is a source of unspeakable joy that our children
are safe. For though to most of them their ignorance has been
bliss, they have not escaped the horrors of a war in which
non-combatants have suffered worse than ever before. Only
the healing hand of time can allay the grief of those for whom
there can be no reunion on earth with their nearest and dearest:</p>

<blockquote>At last the dawn creeps in with golden fingers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking my eyes, to bid them open wide<br>
Upon a world at peace, where Sweetness lingers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Terror is at rest and Hate has died.<br>
<br>
Loud soon shall sound a p&aelig;an of thanksgiving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From happy women, welcoming their men,<br>
Life born anew of joy to see them living.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother of Pity, what shall I do then?<br></blockquote>

<p>Of the people at large Mr. Punch cannot better the praise
of one, the <a name="late_Mr._Henry_James"></a>late Mr. Henry James, who was nothing if not
critical, and who proved his love of England by adopting her
citizenship in the darkest hour of her need: &quot;They were about
as good, above all, when it came to the stress, as could well
be expected of people. They didn't know how good they were,&quot;
and if they lacked imagination they stimulated it immensely
in others.</p>

<p>Apart from some effervescence in the great cities, Armistice
Day was <a name="celebrated_without_exultation_or_extravagance"></a>celebrated without exultation or extravagance. In
one village that we know of the <a name="church_bells"></a>church bells were rung by
women. In London our deliverance was to many people
marked in the most dramatic way by the breaking of his long
silence by <a name="Big_Ben"></a>Big Ben:</p>

Gone are the days when sleep alone could break<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;War's grim and tyrannous spells;<br>
Now it is rest and joy to lie awake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And listen to the bells.<br>

<p>So the Great War ended. But there yet remained the most
dramatic episode of all--the <a name="surrender_of_the_German_Fleet"></a>surrender of the German Fleet
to Admiral Beatty at Scapa Flow--a surrender unprecedented
in naval history, a great victory won without striking a blow,
which yet brought no joy to our Grand Fleet. For our admirals
and captains and bluejackets felt that the Germans had smirched
the glory of the fighting men of the sea, hitherto maintained
in untarnished splendour by all vanquished captains from the
days of Carthage to those of Cervera and Cradock.</p>

German War machine had been smashed, and <a name="demobilisation"></a>demobilisation
began at a rate which led to inevitable congestion and disappointment.
The prosaic village blacksmith was not far out
when, in reply to the vicar's pious hope that the time had come
to beat our sword into a ploughshare, he observed, &quot;Well, I
don't know, sir. Speaking as a blacksmith of forty-five years'
experience, I may tell you it can't be done.&quot; &quot;The whole
position is provisional,&quot; said the <i>Times</i> at the end of November.
If Germany, Austria, and Russia were to be fed, how was it
to be done without disregarding the prior claims of Serbia and
Roumania? Even at home the food question still continued to
agitate the public mind.</p>

<p>The <a name="General_Election"></a>General Election of December, 1918, which followed
the dissolution of the longest Parliament since the days of
Charles II., was a striking, if temporary proof, of the persistence
of the rationing principle. It proved a <a name="triumph_for_the_Coalition"></a>triumph for the Coalition
&quot;Coupon&quot; and for Mr. Lloyd George; the extremists
and Pacificists were snowed under; <a name="Mr._Asquith_was_rejected"></a>Mr. Asquith was rejected
and his followers reduced to a mere handful; <a name="Labour_came_back"></a>Labour came back
with an increased representation, though not as great as it
desired or deserved. <a name="irreconcilables"></a>The triumph of the irreconcilables in
Ireland was a foregone but sinister conclusion to their activities
in the War, and an ominous prelude to their subsequent efforts
to wreck the Pence. <a name="The_pledges"></a>The pledges in regard to indemnities, the
treatment of the Kaiser, and conscription so lavishly given by
the Coalition Leaders caused no little misgiving at the time,
and pledges, like curses, have an awkward way of coming home
to roost. <a name="Mr._Punch's_views"></a>Mr. Punch's views on the Kaiser, expressed in his
Christmas Epilogue, are worth recalling. Mr. Punch did not
clamour for the death penalty, or wish to hand him over to
the tender mercies of German Kultur. &quot;The only fault he
committed in German eyes is that he lost the War, and I
wouldn't have him punished for the wrong offence--for something,
indeed, which was our doing as much as his. No, I
think I would just put him out of the way of doing further
harm, in some distant penitentiary like the Devil's Island, and
leave him to himself to think it all over; as <i>Caponsacchi</i> said
of <i>Guido</i> in 'The Ring and the Book':</p>

<blockquote>Not to die so much as slide out of life,<br>
Pushed by the general horror and common hate<br>
Low, lower--left o' the very edge of things.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<br>
Strasbourg, December 8th, 1918.</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Christmas, 1918, was more than &quot;the Children's Truce.&quot;
Our bugles had &quot;sung truce,&quot; the war cloud had lifted, the
invaded sky was once more free of &quot;the grim geometry of
Mars,&quot; and though very few households could celebrate the
greatest of anniversaries with unbroken ranks, the mercy of
reunion was granted to many homes. Yet Mr. Punch, in his
Christmas musings on the solemn memory of the dead who
gave us this hour, could not but realise the greatness of the task
that lay before us if we were to make our country worthy of
the men who fought and died for her. The War was over,
but another had yet to be waged against poverty and sordid
environment; against the disabilities of birth; against the abuse
of wealth; against the mutual suspicions of Capital and
Labour; against sloth, indifference, self-complacency, and
short memories.</p>

<p>So the Old Year passed, the last of a terrible <i>quinquennium,</i>
bringing grounds for thankfulness and hope along with
the promise of unrest and upheaval: with <a name="Alsace-Lorraine"></a>Alsace-Lorraine
reunited to France, with the British army holding its Watch
on the Rhine, and with all eyes <a name="fixed_on_Paris"></a>fixed on Paris, the scene of
the Peace Conference, already invaded by an international army
of delegates, experts, advisers, secretaries, typists, 500 American
journalists, and President Wilson.</p>

<p>Great Expectations and their Tardy Fulfilment, thus in headline
fashion might one summarise the story of 1919, with Peace,
the world's desire, waiting for months outside the door of the
Conference Chamber, with <a name="civil_war_in_Germany"></a>civil war in Germany, <a name="Berlin_bombed"></a>Berlin bombed
by German airmen, and anarchy in Russia, and here
at home impatience and discomfort, aggravated in the earlier
months by strikes and influenza, the largely increased numbers
of unemployed politicians, the weariest and dreariest of winter
weather.</p>

<center><img src="images/294.png" alt="RECONSTRUCTION: A NEW YEAR'S TASK"></center>
<h4>RECONSTRUCTION: A NEW YEAR'S TASK</h4>
<br><br>
<p>Yet even January had its alleviations in the <a name="return_of_the_banana"></a>return of the banana, the prospect of unlimited lard, a distinct improvement
in the manners of the retail tradesman, the typographical
fireworks of the <i>Times</i> in honour of President Wilson, and the
retreat of Lord Northcliffe to the sunny south. Lovers of
sensation were conciliated by the <a name="appointment_of_&quot;F.E.&quot;"></a>appointment of &quot;F.E.&quot; to the
Lord Chancellorship, the <a name="outbreak_of_Jazz"></a>outbreak of Jazz, and the discovery of
a French author that the plays usually attributed to Shakespeare
were written by Lord Derby, though not apparently the present
holder of the title. The loss, through rejection or withdrawal,
of so many of his old Parliamentary puppets was a serious blow
to Mr. Punch, but the old Liberals, buried like the Babes in the
Wood beneath a shower of Coalition coupons, already showed
a sanguine spirit, and the departure of the freaks could be contemplated
with resignation. The great <a name="Exodus_to_Paris"></a>Exodus to Paris began
in December, but it reached its height in January. The mystery
of the Foreign Office official who had <i>not</i> gone was cleared up
by the discovery that he was the caretaker, a pivotal man who
could not be demobilised. Another exodus of a less desirable
sort was that of the Sinn Fein prisoners, which gave rise to the
rumour that the Lord Lieutenant had threatened that if they
destroyed any more jails they would be rigorously released.
<a name="new_sort_of_war"></a>Sinn Fein, which refused to fight Germany, had already begun
to play at a new sort of war. Australia was preparing to welcome
the homing transports sped with messages of Godspeed from the
Motherland:</p>

<blockquote>Rich reward your hearts shall hold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;None less dear if long delayed,<br>
For with gifts of wattle-gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall your country's debt be paid;<br>
From her sunlight's golden store<br>
She shall heal your hurts of war.<br>
<br>
Ere the mantling Channel's mist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim your distant decks and spars,<br>
And your flag that victory kissed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Valhalla hung with stars--<br>
Crowd and watch our signal fly:<br>
&quot;Gallant hearts, good-bye! <i>Good-bye!&quot;</i><br></blockquote>

<a name="THE_1919_MODEL"></a>
<center><img src="images/296.png"  alt="THE 1919 MODEL"></center>
<h4>THE 1919 MODEL<br>
<br>
MR. PUNCH: &quot;They've given you a fine new machine, Mr.
Premier, and you've got plenty of spirit, but look out for bumps.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p><a name="reassembling_of_Parliament"></a>February, a month of comparative anti-climax, witnessed
the reassembling of Parliament, fuller than ever of members if
not of wisdom. As none of the Sinn Feiners were present, nor
indeed any representative of Irish Nationalism, the proceedings
were as orderly as a Quaker's funeral, save for the arrival of one
member on a motor-scooter. Perhaps the most interesting information
elicited during the debates was this--that every question
put down costs the tax-payer a guinea. On February 20th
there were 282 on the Order Paper, and Mr. Punch was moved
to wonder whether this cascade of curiosity might be abated if
every questionist were obliged to contribute half the cost, the
amount to be deducted from his official salary. <a name="The_Speaker"></a>The Speaker,
the greatest of living Parliamentarians, was re-elected by
acclamation. Though human and humorous, he has grown into
something almost more like an institution than a man, like Big
Ben, that great patriot and public servant who never struck
during the war. <a name="Clemenceau's_escape"></a>The best news in February was that of M.
Clemenceau's escape, though wounded, from the Anarchist
assassin who had attempted to translate Trotsky's threat into
action.<a name="Prinkipo"></a> But it did not help on the proposed Conference with the
Russians at Prinkipo or encourage the prospect of any tangible
results from the deliberation of the Prinkipotentiaries. The
plain man could see no third choice beyond supporting Bolshevism
or anti-Bolshevism. But according to our Prime
Minister, we were committed to a compromise. The Allies were
not prepared to intervene in force, and they could not leave
Russia to stew in her own hell-broth. Meanwhile the chief
criminal, Germany, had begun to utter <i>ad misericordiam</i>
appeals for the relaxation of the Armistice terms on the score
of their cruelty; and Count Brockdorff-Rantzau gave us a foretaste
of his quality by declaring that &quot;Germany cannot be
treated as a second-rate nation.&quot;</p>

<br><br>
<p>At home, though the rays of &quot;sweet unrationed revelry&quot;
were still to come, and <i>Dulce Domum</i> could not yet be sung in
every sense, February brought us some relief in the demobilisation
of the pivotal pig. <a name="National_Industrial_Conference"></a>And the decision to hold a
National Industrial Conference was of encouraging augury
for the settlement of industrial strife on the basis of a full
inquiry and frank statement of facts. In other walks of life
reticence still has its charms, and even in February people had
begun to ask who the General was who had threatened not
to write a book about the War.</p>

<p>March, the mad month, remained true to type. Even Mr.
Punch found it hard to preserve his equanimity:</p>

<blockquote>O Month, before your final moon is set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much may have happened--anything, in fact;<br>
More than in any March that I have met,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Last year excepted) fearful nerves are racked;<br>
Anarchy does with Russia what it likes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris is put conundrums very knotty;<br>
And here in England, with its talk of strikes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men, like your own March hares, seem going dotty.<br></blockquote>

<p>Abroad the <a name="ex-Kaiser"></a>ex-Kaiser was very busy sawing trees, possibly
owing to an hallucination that they were German Generals.</p>

<a name="THE_EASTER_OFFERING"></a>

<h4>THE EASTER OFFERING<br>
<br>
MR. LLOYD GEORGE (fresh from Paris): &quot;I don't say it's a
perfect egg, but parts of it, as the saying is, are excellent.&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>At home the Government decided to release such of the Sinn
Fein prisoners as had not already saved them the trouble, and
a <a name="Coal_Industry_Commission"></a>Coal Industry Commission was appointed on which no representative
of the general public was invited to sit--that is to say,
the patient, much enduring consumer, not the public which has
all along sought to discount peace by premature whooping,
jubilating, and Jazzing. For the Dove of Peace, though in
strict training, seemed in danger of collapsing under the weight
of the League of Nations' olive bough, to say nothing of other
perils, notably the Bolshy-bird, a most obscene brand of vulture.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson was once more on the Atlantic, and Mr. Lloyd
George, distracted between his duties in Paris and the <a name="demands_of_Labour"></a>demands of Labour,
recalled Sir Boyle Roche's bird, or the circus performer
riding two horses at once. In Parliament the interpretation
of election pledges occupied a good deal of time, and Mr.
Bonar Law twice <a name="declared_the_policy"></a>declared the policy of the Government in
regard to indemnities as being to demand the largest amount
that Germany could pay, but not to demand what we knew she
couldn't pay. It would have saved him a great deal of trouble
if at the General Election the Government spokesmen had
insisted as much upon the second half of the policy as they did<a name="appeals_for_economy"></a>
on the first. <a name="Civil_Service_Estimates"></a>Earnest appeals for economy were made from the
Treasury Bench on the occasion of the debate on the
Civil Service Estimates, now swollen to five times their pre-war
magnitude, and were heartily applauded by the House. To
show how thoroughly they had gone home, Mr. Adamson, the
Labour Leader, immediately pressed for an increase in the
salaries of Members of Parliament.</p>

fish-shop, 'as 'e, Ma?&quot;</h4>
<br><br>
<p>On the Rhine the efforts of our army of occupation to
present the stern and forbidding air supposed to mark our
dealings with the inhabitants were proving a lamentable failure.
<a name="imitation_of_a_Hun"></a>You can't produce a really good imitation of a Hun without
lots of practice. Gloating is entirely foreign to the nature of
Thomas Atkins, and he could not pass a child yelling in the
gutter without stooping to comfort it. At home his education
was proceeding on different lines. The period of reaction had
set in, and unwonted exertions were necessary to stimulate his
interest. Such artless devices were, however, preferable to the
pastime, already fashionable in more exalted circles, of kicking
a total stranger round the room to the accompaniment of
cymbals, a motor siren, and a frying pan.</p>

<p><a name="muzzling"></a>After a month of madness it was not to be wondered at that
we should have a month of muzzling, though the enforcement
of the order might have been profitably extended from dogs
to journalists. The <a name="secrecy_maintained_by_the_Big_Four"></a>secrecy maintained by the Big Four--a
phrase invented by America--the conflict of the idealists with
the realists,<a name="Orlando"></a> and the temporary break-away of the Italian
wrestler, Orlando, were bound to excite comment. But a
shattered world could not be rebuilt in a day, with Bolshevist
wolves prowling about the Temple of Peace, and the Dove at
sea between the Ark and Archangel. The Covenant of the
<a name="League_of_Nations"></a>League of Nations, though in a diluted form, had at last taken
shape, the Peace Machine had got a move on, and the Premier's
spirited, if not very dignified, retaliation on the newspaper
snipers led to an abatement of unnecessary hostilities, though the
pastime of shooting policemen with comparative impunity still
flourished in Ireland, and the numbers and cost of our &quot;army
of inoccupation&quot; still continued to increase. Innumerable
queries were made in Parliament on the subject of the
<a name="unemployment_dole"></a>unemployment dole, but the announcement that the Admiralty did
not propose to perpetuate the <a name="title_&quot;Grand_Fleet&quot;"></a>title &quot;Grand Fleet&quot; for the
principal squadron of His Majesty's Navy passed without
comment. The Grand Fleet is now a part of the History that
it did so much to make.</p>

<p>May and June were &quot;hectic&quot; months, in which the reaction
from the fatigues and restraints of War found vent in an
increased disinclination for work, encouraged by a tropical sun.
These were the months of the resumption of cricket, the Victory
Derby, the flood of honours, and the <a name="flying_of_the_Atlantic"></a>flying of the Atlantic,
with a greater display of popular enthusiasm over the gallant
airmen who failed in that feat than over the generals who had
won the War.<a name="oil_in_Derbyshire"></a> They were also the months of the duel between
Mr. Smillie and the Dukes, the discovery of oil in Derbyshire,
the privileged excursion into War polemics of Lord French,
unrest in Egypt, renewed trouble with the police, and a
shortage of beer, boots and clothes.</p>

<br><br>
<p>But though the Big Four had been temporarily reduced to
a Big Three by Italy's withdrawal, and though M. Clemenceau,
Mr. Lloyd George, and President Wilson had all <a name="suffered_in_prestige"></a>suffered in prestige
by the slow progress of the negotiations, Versailles,
with the advent of the German delegates, more than ever riveted
the gaze of an expectant world. <a name="To_sign_or_not_to_sign"></a>To sign or not to sign, or, in the
words of Wilhelm Shakespeare, <i>Sein oder nicht sein: hier ist
die Frage</i>--that was the problem which from the moment of his
famous opening speech <a name="Count_Brockdorff-Rantzau"></a>Count Brockdorff-Rantzau was up
against. <a name="French_flags_at_Berlin"></a>But, as the days wore on, in spite of official impenitence
and the double breach of the Armistice terms by the
scuttling of the German war-ships at Scapa and the burning
of the French flags at Berlin, the force of &quot;fierce reluctant
truculent delay&quot; was spent against the steadily growing volume
of national acquiescence, culminating in the decision of the
Weimar Assembly, the tardy choice of new delegates, and the
final scene in the Hall of Mirrors, haunted by the ghosts
of 1871.</p>

<p>Writing at the moment of the <a name="Signature_of_Peace"></a>Signature of Peace and in
deep thankfulness for the relief it brings to a stricken world, Mr.
Punch is too old to jazz for joy, but he is young enough to face
the future with a reasoned optimism, born of a belief in his race
and their heroic achievements in these great and terrible years.
Victory took us by surprise; and we were less prepared for
Peace at that moment than we had ever been for War. And
just as in the first days of the fighting we went astray, running
after the cry &quot;Business as usual,&quot; so to-day we are making as
bad a mistake when we run after &quot;Pleasure as usual&quot;--or rather
more than usual. But we soon revised that early error, and we
shall not waste much time about revising this. For though we
lacked imagination then, and still lack it, we have the gift,
perhaps even more useful if less showy, of commonsense. And
when commonsense is found in natures that are honest and
hearts that are clean, it may make mistakes, but not for long.
No, the spirit which won the War is not going to fail us at this
second call. Perhaps we have only been waiting for the actual
coming of Peace to settle down to our new and greater task.</p>

<p>But let us never forget the debt, unpaid and unpayable, to
our immortal dead and to the valiant survivors of the great
conflict, to whom we owe freedom and security and the
possibility of a better and cleaner world.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
