<p>Having resolved that the coronation of the Queen
should take place before his departure for Germany,
and being anxious to commence the projected campaign
with the least possible delay, Henry named
the 5th of May as the day on which the ceremony
was to be performed; but having learnt from a
private despatch that the Archduke had resolved at
the eleventh hour not to incur the hazard of a war
with France upon so frivolous a pretext as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page002" id="page002"></a>[pg 002]</span>
forcible retention of a Princess, who moreover,
remained under his charge against her own free
will, and that Madame de Cond was accordingly
about to return to the French Court, he resolved to
defer the pageant until the advent of the fair
fugitive who would, as he felt, constitute its brightest
ornament. The succeeding courier from the Low
Countries, however, dispelled this brilliant vision.
Whatever might have been the personal inclination
of the Archduke, Philip of Spain determined to
retain his hostage; and the return of the Princess
to France was interdicted. Enraged by the deceit
which had been practised upon him, but unwilling
to forfeit his word to the Queen, Henry had no
alternative save to order the instant renewal of the
preparations which he had himself suspended; and
despite the entreaties of the municipal authorities of
Paris, who represented the impossibility of completing
their arrangements before the end of the
month, he persisted in his resolution of causing the
Queen to be crowned on the 13th, and commanded
her public entry into Paris for the following
Sunday.<a id="footnotetag001" name="footnotetag001"></a><a href="#footnote001">[1]</a></p>

<p>On the 11th (Tuesday) he said to those around
him, "I shall sleep at St. Denis to-morrow night,
and return to Paris on Thursday; I shall arrange
all my private affairs on Friday; on Saturday I
shall drive about the city; Sunday will be the state
entry of the Queen; on Monday my daughter De
Vendme will be married; on Tuesday the banquet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page003" id="page003"></a>[pg 003]</span>
will take place; and on Wednesday I mount for
Germany." <a id="footnotetag002" name="footnotetag002"></a><a href="#footnote002">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Court accordingly slept at St. Denis on the
night of the 12th, in order to be in readiness for the
ceremony of the morrow; and the morning of the
eventful day which was to witness the crowning
triumph of Marie de Medicis at length dawned. A
brilliant spring sun robed the earth in brightness;
but nowhere did it light up a scene of greater
magnificence than when, filtered through the windows
of stained glass, it poured itself in a living
mosaic over the marble pavement of the cathedral,
and flashed upon the sumptuous hangings and
golden draperies which were distributed over the
spacious area of the edifice. Immediately in front
of the high altar a platform had been erected eleven
feet in height, and upwards of twenty feet square, in
the centre of which was a das richly carpeted, supporting
the throne of the Queen, covered with
crimson velvet embroidered with <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> in
gold, and overshadowed by a canopy of the same
material. On either side of this throne two other
platforms were appropriated to the Princes of the
Blood, the Knights of the several Orders, the
Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, the great nobles, the
foreign ambassadors, and the ladies of the Queen's
household. Within the altar-rail on the left hand, a
bench draped with cloth of gold was prepared for
the cardinals; and behind this was a second bench
reserved for the archbishops, bishops, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page004" id="page004"></a>[pg 004]</span>
ecclesiastics who were to assist at the ceremony;
while on the same side of the shrine stood a table
overlaid by a costly drapery, upon which were to be
deposited the crown, the coronet, the sceptre, the
hand of justice, and the ring destined to be employed
during the ceremony. On the right hand of the
altar was placed a <i>prie-dieu</i> covered with violet
velvet bordered and fringed with gold, upon which
were placed two cushions of the same material for
the use of the Cardinal de Joyeuse, who was to
officiate; and behind this was a table corresponding
with that on the left, and covered by a similar
drapery, supporting the bread, wine, and waxen
tapers which the master of the ceremonies was
instructed to deliver to the ladies who were selected
to make the offering for the Queen.</p>

<p>The floor of the choir extending from the
principal platform to the high altar was carpeted
with crimson velvet edged with gold; and above
this was stretched a second drapery of cloth of gold
for the passage of her Majesty; myriads of lights
were grouped about the lateral shrines, the carved
columns of the venerable edifice were veiled by
magnificent hangings, and the gorgeous vestments
of the prelates cumbered the open presses of the
sacristy.</p>

<p>An hour after dawn a compact crowd peopled the
vast interior of St. Denis; persons of all ranks, from
the artizan to the petty noble and his family, rushed
tumultuously towards the sacred edifice, in order to
secure a sight of the august solemnity; and great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page005" id="page005"></a>[pg 005]</span>
was the surprise of all to find themselves already
preceded by the King, who came and went throughout
the early part of the morning, superintending
every arrangement in person, and apparently overlooking
his bodily ailments in the extraordinary
excitement under which he laboured.</p>

<p>The Dauphin, Madame the elder Princess, the
ex-Queen Marguerite, the Princes of the Blood, and
great dignitaries who were summoned to assist at
the ceremony, accompanied by the Cardinals de
Gondy and de Sourdis, proceeded at an early hour to
the Louvre to conduct the Queen to the cathedral;
and it was no sooner announced that her Majesty
was prepared to set forth than the procession
formed.</p>

<p>The ceremonial had not, however, been definitively
arranged without considerable difficulty. Marguerite,
who, whatever might be her errors, could
not contemplate her presence at this solemnity as a
mere spectator without considerable heart-burning,
considered herself aggrieved by the fact that instead
of following immediately behind the Queen, she
was to be preceded by Madame Elisabeth, still
a mere child; and so great was her indignation at
this discovery, that she was very reluctantly induced
to abandon her intention of pretexting illness, and
absenting herself entirely from the pageant. The
earnest remonstrances of her friends, who represented
to her the certainty of the King's serious
displeasure, alone determined her to sacrifice her
dignity; and although she ultimately consented to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page006" id="page006"></a>[pg 006]</span>
submit to an arrangement which she considered as
an encroachment upon her rights as the daughter of
a long line of sovereigns, rather than draw down
upon herself the resentment of the monarch, she
wept bitterly while she prepared to swell the retinue
of her successor.<a id="footnotetag003" name="footnotetag003"></a><a href="#footnote003">[3]</a> The Comte de Soissons was less
compliant; for it was no sooner announced to him
that the Duchesse de Vendme, the wife of the
King's natural son, was to appear in a mantle embroidered
with <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> similar to those worn by
the Princesses of the Blood, than he loudly declared
that he would not countenance so disgraceful an
innovation; and having ordered his household to
prepare for an instant departure from Paris, he left
the capital with the Princess his wife, and retired to
one of his country seats.<a id="footnotetag004" name="footnotetag004"></a><a href="#footnote004">[4]</a></p>

<p>Despite this secession, however, the suite of
Marie de Medicis was one of supreme magnificence.
The procession was opened by the Swiss Guards,
habited in velvet vests of her own colours, tawny,
blue, crimson, and white; then followed two companies,
each composed of a hundred nobles, the first
wearing habiliments of tawny-coloured satin braided
with gold, and the second pourpoints of white satin
and breeches of tawny colour; these were succeeded
by the Lords of the Bedchamber, chamberlains, and
other great officers of the royal household, superbly
attired; who were, in their turn, followed by the
Knights of the Holy Ghost wearing the collar of
their Order. A body of trumpeters walked after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page007" id="page007"></a>[pg 007]</span>
them richly dressed in blue velvet; and then came
the heralds in full armour, and the Ushers of the
Chamber with their maces.</p>

<p>When these had passed the more important personages
of the procession issued from the gates of
the Louvre; and the glorious spring sun flashed
upon the jewelled caps and capes of the Princes of
the Blood, glistened over their vests of cloth of gold,
and toyed with the gemmed hilts of their diamond-studded
weapons. Preceding the Queen were the
Prince de Conti and the Comte d'Anquien;<a id="footnotetag005" name="footnotetag005"></a><a href="#footnote005">[5]</a> while
immediately before her walked the Dauphin clad in
a habit of cloth of silver, profusely ornamented with
precious stones; and then came Marie herself, in the
full glory of conscious dignity and triumph, wearing
a coronet of jewels, a richly-gemmed stomacher,
a surcoat of ermine, and a royal mantle seven
French ells in length, composed of purple velvet
embroidered with <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> in gold and diamonds,
and bordered with ermine, which was borne on
either side of her by the two Cardinals, and at its
extremity by the Dowager Princess of Cond,<a id="footnotetag006" name="footnotetag006"></a><a href="#footnote006">[6]</a> the
Princesse de Conti, the Dowager Duchess of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page008" id="page008"></a>[pg 008]</span>
Montpensier, and the Duchesse de Mercoeur;<a id="footnotetag007" name="footnotetag007"></a><a href="#footnote007">[7]</a> whose
trains were in like manner supported by four nobles
habited in cloth of gold and silver, and covered with
jewels.</p>

<p>Then followed Madame Elisabeth de France and
the ex-Queen Marguerite, wearing mantles covered
with <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> embroidered in gold, carried by four
nobles richly attired, with their capes and caps laced
with jewels; and the gorgeous train was finally
closed by the Princesses of the Blood and Duchesses,
whose trains were in like manner borne by some of
the principal noblemen of the Court. All these
ladies wore their coronets enriched with pearls and
diamonds, save such as were widows, to whom the
use of gems was interdicted by the fashion of
the age.</p>

<p>To these succeeded the ladies of the Queen's
household, among whom the Marquise de Guercheville<a id="footnotetag008" name="footnotetag008"></a><a href="#footnote008">[8]</a>
and Madame de Concini excited the most
curiosity; the latter from the high favour which she
enjoyed, and the extraordinary elevation to which
it had conduced; and the former from a cause
infinitely more honourable to her as a woman.
While the widow of her first husband, Henri de
Silly, Comte de la Rochepot, her grace and beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page009" id="page009"></a>[pg 009]</span>
attracted Henri IV, who pertinaciously endeavoured
to win her affections. His degrading suit was,
however, so resolutely although respectfully rejected,
that the King, impressed by her merit, on one
occasion declared that the title which would be the
most applicable to her would be that of a lady of
honour, and that such she should become whenever
another Queen ascended the throne of France.
The Marquise curtsied her thanks, without attaching
any importance to so very prospective a distinction;
but six years subsequently, when the Court of Marie
de Medicis was formed, the promised appointment
was conferred upon her; and she fulfilled the duties
of her office with a dignified and unobtrusive zeal
which secured to her the esteem and respect of her
royal mistress.<a id="footnotetag009" name="footnotetag009"></a><a href="#footnote009">[9]</a></p>

<p>Thus escorted, Marie de Medicis entered the
cathedral; where, having been conducted to the
front of the high altar, she knelt upon a cushion
near which stood the Cardinal de Joyeuse in his
pontifical robes, surrounded by a group of high
ecclesiastical dignitaries, and supported by the
Cardinal Duperron. When the Queen had concluded
her prayer, and kissed the reliquary which
was presented to her by Mgr. de Joyeuse, she was
led to her throne in the same state as that with
which she had approached the altar; and she had
no sooner taken her place than the Dauphin seated
himself in the chair which had been prepared for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page010" id="page010"></a>[pg 010]</span>
him; and Madame and the ex-Queen, followed by
the Princesses of the Blood and the great ladies of
the Court, after having successively made a profound
curtsey to the Queen, followed his example.
This done, the Cardinals de Gondy and de Sourdis
descended from the platform, and took up their
position on the left of the altar, while the Princes
were marshalled to their places by the royal ushers;
and meanwhile the musicians of her Majesty performed
divers melodies suited to the place and the
occasion.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few moments the two Cardinals
again ascended the platform to reconduct her
Majesty to the altar, which she reached in the same
order as she had previously done, save that the
Dauphin now walked on her right hand and Madame
Elisabeth upon her left. Having knelt as before in
silent prayer, she was ultimately raised by the
Prince and Princess, and stood with her head bowed
upon her breast while the Cardinal de Joyeuse
commenced the appropriate orisons, and received
from the hand of two of the bishops the vase containing
the holy oil, and the platen. Having poured
out a portion of the former, the prelate anointed the
Queen upon the head and chest; after which he
received from a third bishop the consecrated ring,
which he placed upon her finger.</p>

<p>The sceptre and the hand of justice were then
tendered to him, and transferred to the august recipient;
and finally the crown of state was presented
upon a cushion, and held above her head by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page011" id="page011"></a>[pg 011]</span>
Dauphin and Madame Elisabeth, by whom it was
subsequently consigned to the keeping of the Prince
de Conti, while another of smaller size, enriched
with a profusion of diamonds, rubies, and pearls of
immense value, was placed upon her brow; and
Marie de Medicis at length stood in the midst of
her assembled Court the crowned and anointed
Queen of France.</p>

<p>A vigorous flourish of trumpets proclaimed the
termination of the ceremony. Marie resigned the
sceptre and the hand of justice to the two Princes
who stood next to her, and once more ascended the
throne; where she was no sooner seated than M.
de Conti placed before her the crown of state which
he had carried upon a stool covered with cloth of
gold, and knelt beside it. The Prince who bore the
sceptre then assumed the same attitude on the right
hand of the Queen, and his companion carrying the
hand of justice upon her left. A solemn high mass
was next performed, and at its close the herald-at-arms
cast, in the Queen's name, a shower of gold
and silver coin among the crowds who thronged
the church; while Marie herself, descending from
the platform, and attended as before, slowly left
the sacred edifice and returned to the robing-room.</p>

<p>The King, who had witnessed the whole ceremony
from his private tribune, was more rapid in
his movements, and hastened to regain his chamber;
whence he watched the brilliant procession as it
advanced with an undisguised delight that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page012" id="page012"></a>[pg 012]</span>
inexplicable to those who were aware of the reluctance
with which he had yielded to the desire of
the Queen, and who had consequently anticipated
no demonstration on his part save one of irritation
and annoyance. Greatly, therefore, were they surprised
when, as she passed beneath the window at
which he had taken up his station, they saw him
scatter some perfumed water on her head in order
to induce her to look up; after which he hurriedly
descended the great staircase to receive and welcome
her, and with every possible exhibition of affection
and respect conducted her to the hall in which the
banquet had been prepared.</p>

<p>Throughout this sumptuous repast the gaiety of
the monarch excited the comments of all by whom
he was surrounded; and it was generally remarked
that he had not for many months yielded to such an
effervescence of spirits. At length, however, the
festival drew to its close; lords and ladies were
alike overwhelmed by the fatigues of the past day;
and their Majesties, having taken a gracious leave
of their illustrious guests, entered one of the royal
carriages and proceeded to the Louvre.<a id="footnotetag010" name="footnotetag010"></a><a href="#footnote010">[10]</a></p>

<p>The numerous foreigners who had assembled
from every part of Europe in order to witness the
ceremony were lost in astonishment at the profusion
of jewels displayed upon the occasion, declaring that
they had never before witnessed such a spectacle;
and that even at the world-famed entry of the
Spanish Queen into Madrid, where Italy and Spain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page013" id="page013"></a>[pg 013]</span>
had alike exhibited all their riches, they could not
be compared with those possessed by the French
Court alone; nor was their surprise diminished
when they learnt that on the following Sunday,
when Marie de Medicis was to enter Paris in state,
they would be convinced that they had not as yet
seen a tithe of the splendour which the great nobles
and ladies of the kingdom were enabled to display
upon such occasions.<a id="footnotetag011" name="footnotetag011"></a><a href="#footnote011">[11]</a></p>

<p>From the moment in which the King decided
upon personally superseding the Marchal de
Lesdiguires<a id="footnotetag012" name="footnotetag012"></a><a href="#footnote012">[12]</a> in his command of the army in
Champagne, he had been unwearied in his advice to
the Queen for the efficient government of the
country. He exhorted her to great caution in
changing her ministers, earnestly impressing upon
her the danger of entrusting state affairs to individuals
whose probity and experience were not
well assured, or of displacing others without great
and serious cause. He, moreover, especially besought
her never to permit the interference of foreigners in
the internal economy of the kingdom, as by such ill-placed
confidence she could not fail to alienate from
herself the affections of all true Frenchmen; to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page014" id="page014"></a>[pg 014]</span>
uphold the authority of the Parliament, but on no
account to countenance its dictation, confining its
operations to their legitimate sphere, and enforcing
its submission to her own delegated supremacy;
never to suffer herself to be misled by her passions
or prejudices, but to weigh all her measures
maturely before she insisted upon their enforcement;
to protect the Jesuits, but at the same time to be
careful not to allow them to increase their numbers,
or to form establishments upon the frontiers; to
attach the nobility by favours which could not
endanger the interests of the throne, but to be
cautious in her concessions where they might tend
to any undue aggrandizement of their former power
and influence; and, above all, not rashly to undertake
any war against the Huguenots until she had
received full assurance of being enabled to terminate
it successfully. As regarded the Dauphin, he
declared that his greatest desire was to see him the
husband of Mademoiselle de Lorraine, provided the
Duke should not have other children; as, in such
case, the French nation would be aggrandized by
the territories of a state from which it had received
much and grievous injury. He expressed, moreover,
the greatest repugnance to the proposed marriage
between Madame Elisabeth and the Infant of Spain,
alleging as his reason the perpetual rivalry of the
two powers, and the circumstance that the prosperity
of the one must necessarily involve the abasement
of the other; and finally he declared that were he
compelled to give the hand of his daughter to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page015" id="page015"></a>[pg 015]</span>
Spanish Prince, it should be to a younger brother
who might be declared Duke of Flanders, and not
to the heir to the throne.<a id="footnotetag013" name="footnotetag013"></a><a href="#footnote013">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Queen, while listening to these counsels, did
not cease her entreaties that he would abandon his
intention of quitting the kingdom, and leave the
conduct of the campaign to his generals. She
represented her own inexperience in state affairs,
the extreme youth of the Dauphin, and the long life
which he himself might still enjoy if he did not
voluntarily place himself in situations of peril, which
was the less required of him as he had already
established his fame as a soldier throughout the
whole of Europe. Henry answered only by a jest.
Love and ambition alike lured him on; and beneath
their baneful influence prudence and reason were
silenced.<a id="footnotetag014" name="footnotetag014"></a><a href="#footnote014">[14]</a></p>

<p>On the morning succeeding the coronation of his
royal consort, the King attended mass at the church
of the Feuillants, where he was accompanied by the
Duc de Guise and M. de Bassompierre; and as he
was still in the same exuberant spirits as on the
preceding day, a great deal of light and desultory
conversation took place during their return to the
palace; which was, however, abruptly terminated by
Henry, whose countenance became suddenly overcast
as he said in reply to a gay remark made by
M. de Guise&mdash;</p>

<p>"Even you do not understand me now; but one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page016" id="page016"></a>[pg 016]</span>
of these days, when I am dead, you will learn my
value."</p>

<p>"My God! Sire," exclaimed Bassompierre,
"will you never cease to pain us by these constant
allusions to your approaching death? These are
things which should not be said. You will live,
please God, long and happy years. What fate can
be more enviable than your own? You are now in
the prime of life, strong and healthy; surrounded
by honour and respect; in tranquil possession of
the most flourishing kingdom upon earth; adored
by your subjects; rich in money, palaces, and lands;
wooed by fair women; loved by handsome
favourites; with a host of noble children growing
up about you. What can you require beyond this,
and what more do you wish?"</p>

<p>"My friend," replied the King with a long-drawn
sigh, "I must resign all these things."</p>

<p>As he uttered these words, the usher on duty
threw open the door of his closet; and extending
his hand to his two companions, which they successively
raised to their lips, he disappeared.<a id="footnotetag015" name="footnotetag015"></a><a href="#footnote015">[15]</a></p>

<p>As the Queen was to dance a <i>branle</i> and to
appear in a ballet that evening at the Louvre, she
was on the King's return closeted with the Princesse
de Conti, the Marchale de Fervaques,<a id="footnotetag016" name="footnotetag016"></a><a href="#footnote016">[16]</a> the
Comtesse du Fargis,<a id="footnotetag017" name="footnotetag017"></a><a href="#footnote017">[17]</a> and Madame Concini, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page017" id="page017"></a>[pg 017]</span>
ladies of honour, busied in the selection of the
costume in which she purposed to appear. Having
ascertained this fact, Henry remained alone in his
apartment, until it was announced to him that the
Duc de Vendme solicited the honour of a private
audience. He was instantly admitted; and after
having excused himself for thus intruding upon the
privacy of the monarch at a moment when, as he
was well aware, the mind of the King was occupied
by subjects of importance both to himself and to the
state, he informed his royal father that La Brosse, a
famous astrologer, had declared that the constellation
under which his Majesty was born threatened him
with imminent danger during that particular day;
and that he consequently implored of him to be
more than usually cautious until its close.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed the King gaily; "La
Brosse is an old sharper who is anxious to obtain
some of your money; and you are a young fool to
believe him. My days are numbered before God."</p>

<p>When he had dined Henry threw himself upon
his bed, but he tried in vain to sleep; he then rose
and paced gloomily about the room for a considerable
time, after which he once more lay down; but
the result proving the same, he again sprang to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page018" id="page018"></a>[pg 018]</span>
feet, and turning abruptly to the <i>exempt</i> of the
guard, he demanded to know the time.</p>

<p>"It is just four o'clock, Sire," replied the officer;
"and I would venture to suggest to your Majesty
to try the effect of the open air, as you appear
harassed and out of spirits."</p>

<p>"You are right," said the King; "cause my
coach to be prepared, and I will go to the Arsenal
and visit the Duc de Sully, who is unwell, and takes
a bath to-day."</p>

<p>When the carriage was announced, the King
stepped into it, followed by the Ducs de Montbazon
and d'Epernon, the Marchaux de Lavardin and de
Roquelaure, the Marquises de Mirabeau and de la
Force, and M. de Liancourt, his first equerry.</p>

<p>Being anxious to obtain a good view of the
preparations which were making for the entry of
the Queen, Henry desired that the leathern curtains,
which were at that period the clumsy substitute for
windows, should be looped back; and during this
operation M. de Vitry presented himself, with the
intention of escorting the royal equipage with his
company of the bodyguard.</p>

<p>"No, no," said the King impatiently; "remain
in the palace, and see that everything goes on
as I have ordered, and with as much speed as
possible."</p>

<p>"At least, Sire, suffer my guards to attend you,"
urged De Vitry.</p>

<p>"I will neither take you nor your guards," was
the abrupt reply; "I want no one near me."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page019" id="page019"></a>[pg 019]</span>

<p>And upon this command the disappointed
courtier was compelled to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Drive from the palace," shouted the monarch in
a tone of excitement; "in the direction of the
Htel de Longueville." The carriage started at a
rapid pace, and it had no sooner reached the spot
indicated, than he again exclaimed, "And now to
the Cross of Trahoir." <a id="footnotetag018" name="footnotetag018"></a><a href="#footnote018">[18]</a> Arrived at this wretched
nook, he next desired to be driven to the Cemetery
of the Innocents, for which purpose it was necessary
to pass from the Rue St. Honor into that of La
Ferronnerie, which was at that period extremely
narrow, and rendered still more so by the numerous
shops built against the cemetery wall. On reaching
this point the progress of the royal carriage was
impeded by two heavily-laden waggons, and the
footmen who had hitherto run beside it pressed
forward towards the end of the thoroughfare in order
to rejoin it at the other extremity of the street.
Two attendants only remained at their station, one
of whom was employed in hastening the movements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page020" id="page020"></a>[pg 020]</span>
of the embarrassed waggoners, while the other was
engaged in arranging some portion of his dress
which had become displaced. At this moment a
man advanced towards the King's equipage,
wrapped in a wide mantle, and carefully picked his
way between the trading-booths and the carriage,
which he had no sooner reached than, placing one
of his feet on a spoke of the wheel, and the other
on a doorstep, he plunged a knife into the side of the
King, who was at that moment engaged in reading
a letter.</p>

<p>As he felt the blow Henry exclaimed, "I am
stabbed!" While he uttered the words, he flung up
his arms, an action by which the assassin profited
to take a surer and more fatal aim; and before the
horror-stricken companions of the unfortunate
monarch could make a movement to prevent it, a
second thrust pierced the lobe of his heart. The
blood gushed in torrents from his mouth, and from
the wound itself, when again the remorseless knife
descended, but only to become entangled in the
sleeve of the Duc d'Epernon;<a id="footnotetag019" name="footnotetag019"></a><a href="#footnote019">[19]</a> while with one thick
and choking sob Henri IV fell back a corpse.</p>

<p>No one had seen by what hand the King had
fallen; and had the regicide flung away his weapon,
he might have stood unquestioned among the crowd
which instantly collected upon seeing the six nobles
who had accompanied the sovereign spring to the
ground, with loud exclamations of dismay; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page021" id="page021"></a>[pg 021]</span>
Ravaillac<a id="footnotetag020" name="footnotetag020"></a><a href="#footnote020">[20]</a> stood firm, with his reeking and two-edged
knife still in his hand, and avowed his crime
with a boldness which in a better cause would have
savoured of heroism.<a id="footnotetag021" name="footnotetag021"></a><a href="#footnote021">[21]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile one of the royal party, perceiving
that Henry remained perfectly motionless, while the
carriage was inundated with his blood, incautiously
exclaimed, "The King is dead!" upon which a
loud wail arose from the assembled spectators; and
the agitation of the crowd became so excessive that
the Duc d'Epernon called loudly for a draught of
wine, asserting that his Majesty was faint from a
hurt, and required refreshment. A number of the
inhabitants of the adjacent houses thereupon
hastened to procure the desired beverage; while
the companions of the monarch, profiting by the
movement, let fall the leathern curtains of the coach,
and informed the populace that they must immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page022" id="page022"></a>[pg 022]</span>
convey his Majesty to the Louvre in order to
secure proper assistance.<a id="footnotetag022" name="footnotetag022"></a><a href="#footnote022">[22]</a> This was done with all
speed, while as they passed through the city the
attendants replied to the inquiries which were made
on every side that the King was merely wounded;
and on arriving at the palace the body was stretched
upon a bed, without having been cleansed or
clothed, and in this state it remained for several
hours, exposed to the gaze of all who thought
proper to visit the chamber of death.<a id="footnotetag023" name="footnotetag023"></a><a href="#footnote023">[23]</a></p>

<p>During this time the Queen, fatigued by her
previous exertions, was lying upon a sofa in her
private cabinet, in order to recruit her strength
against the evening, which was, as we have shown,
to have been one of gaiety and gala, when her
affrighted attendants hastened to convey to her the
fatal tidings of her widowhood. In a paroxysm of
uncontrollable anguish she rushed towards the door
of the closet, and was about to make her way to the
chamber in which the royal body had been deposited,
when she was met by the Chancellor, to whom the
fearful news had already been communicated, and
who obstructed her passage.</p>

<p>"Let me pass, Sir," she faltered out, "the King
is dead."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Madame," said Sillery, still impeding
her purpose, "the Kings of France never
die. Return, I implore of you, to your apartment.
Restrain your tears until you have insured your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page023" id="page023"></a>[pg 023]</span>
safety and that of your children; and instead of
indulging in a grief which can avail you nothing,
exert all your energies to counteract the possible
effects of this disastrous and lamentable event."</p>

<p>M. de Vitry was immediately instructed to
assemble all the royal children in the same apartment,
and not to permit any one, whatever might
be his rank or authority, to have access to them;
an order which was implicitly obeyed; and meanwhile
six-and-twenty physicians and surgeons, who
had been hastily summoned to the palace, commenced
opening the corpse, which was discovered
to be so universally healthy as to promise a long
life. The intestines were, according to the prescribed
custom, at once forwarded to St. Denis;
while the Jesuits demanded the heart, in order to
convey it to their church of La Flche; and it was
no sooner removed from the body, and placed in a
silver basin, than it was eagerly pressed to the lips
of all the nobles who assisted at the operation; each
of those who carried away traces of the blood which
issued from it upon his moustachios, esteeming
himself highly honoured by the vestiges of the
contact.<a id="footnotetag024" name="footnotetag024"></a><a href="#footnote024">[24]</a></p>

<p>The royal remains were then embalmed, and
placed in a sumptuous coffin upon a bed of state, in
one of the most spacious apartments of the Louvre,
which was hung with the richest tapestry appertaining
to the crown. A magnificent canopy of
cloth of gold surmounted the bier, and on either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page024" id="page024"></a>[pg 024]</span>
side of the catafalque were placed two temporary
altars; ten others having been erected in the state-gallery,
at which the bishops and the curs of the
several metropolitan parishes daily performed six
high and one hundred low masses. Platforms
covered with cloth of gold had been prepared for
the cardinals and prelates; and at the foot of the
royal body, cushions of black velvet were arranged
for the Princes of the Blood and the higher nobility.
A golden crucifix and a silver vase containing holy
water were deposited on a table of carved oak; and
at the extremity of the room were grouped enormous
tapers of wax, near which stood two heralds-king-at-arms,
in their splendid state costume, leaning upon
their swords. The face of the corpse was exposed,
the head covered by a cap of crimson velvet laced
with gold, and the body attired in a vest of white
satin, over which was flung a drapery of cloth of
gold, having in the centre a cross elaborately embroidered
in silver.<a id="footnotetag025" name="footnotetag025"></a><a href="#footnote025">[25]</a></p>

<p>On the day which succeeded the embalmment,
while the clergy were praying in suppressed voices
at the several altars, a distant sound was heard,
which gradually approaching nearer and nearer to
the death-chamber, became ere long blent with
their murmured orisons; and as they looked towards
the entrance of the apartment, they saw the young
King standing upon the threshold, attended by a
numerous suite of Princes and nobles. Louis XIII
was wrapped in a mourning cloak of violet-coloured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page025" id="page025"></a>[pg 025]</span>
velvet; his vest was of dark silk; and his pale and
melancholy face was half-hidden by the hood which
had been drawn over his head. The high dignitaries
who composed his retinue wore mantles
of black velvet, and were entirely without arms.
The two younger sons of France, the Ducs
d'Orlans and d'Anjou, walked on either side of the
new-made sovereign, each grasping a fold of his
heavy cloak; and immediately behind them came
the Cardinals de Joyeuse and de Sourdis. The
Prince de Cond, the Comte de Soissons, the Duc
de Guise, the Prince de Joinville, and the Duc
d'Elboeuf bore the royal train; and were in their
turn succeeded by the prelates who assisted at the
ceremony, each wearing his mitre, and carrying his
crozier. In the rear followed a crowd of nobles and
great officers of the household, who, however,
advanced only a few yards from the doorway, while
Louis and his immediate attendants slowly approached
the bier. The scene was an affecting one:
the boy-King, timid and trembling, surrounded by
the flower of his nation's chivalry and greatness,
moved with a faltering step towards the resting-place
of that father who had so lately wielded like
a toy the sceptre which he was himself still too
impotent to bear, and whose bold spirit had been
quenched while it was yet strong within him. On
every side the vanity of human pride, which will not
learn a lesson even under the stern teaching of
death, was contrasted with the awe that sat upon
the faces of the assistants, and with the immobility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page026" id="page026"></a>[pg 026]</span>
of the livid countenance which gleamed out pale
and ghastly from amid its glittering drapery!</p>

<p>As the youthful mourner reached the death-couch,
the kings-at-arms were about to present to him the
aspergillus, in order that he might sprinkle the
corpse with the consecrated water, when a movement
among the nobles who stood near the entrance
of the apartment caused them to pause; and in
another moment a group of ladies, attired in deep
mourning, appeared beneath the portico; where,
separating into two ranks, they left a passage open
for the widowed Queen; who, clad in violet velvet
like her son, with a high ruff, and her head uncovered,
advanced with an unsteady step and
streaming eyes towards her children.</p>

<p>"Pray with me, my son," she murmured amid
her sobs as she stood beneath the mortuary canopy;
"there lies your happiness and mine. May it please
God that our hopes may not also have expired with
him who was but a few short hours ago the glory
and the greatness of his kingdom! The sturdy tree
has fallen, and the saplings are still weak and frail.
The mission of the great Henry is accomplished,
and the weight of sovereignty is transferred to your
own brow. And you also, my beloved ones," she
continued, glancing towards her younger sons,
"come nearer to me, and let us kneel together
beside the body of your august and lamented
father."</p>

<p>The two young Princes relaxed their hold of
the royal mantle, and placed themselves beside their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page027" id="page027"></a>[pg 027]</span>
mother. The illustrious widow and her orphans then
sank upon their knees, and continued for a considerable
time absorbed in silent and earnest prayer. At
intervals a sob which could not be controlled broke
upon the stillness, but at length the mourners rose;
and Marie, taking the hand of the boy-King, drew
him towards her, and murmured in his ear a few
hurried words which were inaudible to all save
himself. As she ceased speaking, Louis glanced up
into her face for an instant; and then, extending his
right hand towards the corpse, he said in a clear
and steady voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, I swear to do so."</p>

<p>Even at that awful moment a strange light
flashed from the eyes of the Queen, and a smile,
which was almost one of triumph, played about her
lips as she glanced at the assembled nobles; but the
emotion, by whatever cause produced, was only
momentary; and after having cast another long and
agonized look upon the face of the dead monarch,
and aspersed the body with holy water, she bent
her head reverentially to the King, and withdrew,
followed by her ladies.</p>

<p>When the whole of the royal party had paid this
last mark of respect to the remains of the deceased
sovereign, the coffin was finally closed; and the
death-room, in which the corpse was to remain for
the space of eighteen days, was opened to the public
from ten o'clock in the morning until six in the
evening. Then, indeed, as the vast crowds succeeded
each other like the ceaseless waves of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page028" id="page028"></a>[pg 028]</span>
incoming sea, the bitter wail of universal lamentation
rang through the halls and galleries of the palace.
Henri IV had been essentially the King of the
People; and, with few and rare exceptions, it was
by the people that he was truly mourned; for his
sudden decease had opened so many arenas to
ambition, hatred, jealousy, and hope, that the great
nobles had no time to waste in tears, but were
already busily engaged in the furtherance of their
own fortunes.</p>

<p>During the exposition of the body the necessary
preparations had been completed for the interment
of the deceased King, which exceeded in magnificence
all that had previously been attempted on a
similar occasion; and this pomp was rendered even
more remarkable by the privacy with which his
predecessor Henri III had been conveyed to St.
Denis only a week previously, the remains of the
latter sovereign having hitherto been suffered to
remain in the church of St. Camille at Compigne,
whence they were removed under the guard of the
Ducs d'Epernon and de Bellegarde, his former
favourites; the etiquette in such an emergency not
permitting the inhumation of the recently deceased
King in the vaults of the royal abbey until his
predecessor should have occupied his appointed
place.</p>

<p>The first stage of the funeral procession was
Notre-Dame; and as the gorgeous <i>cortge</i> approached
the church, all its avenues, save that
which was kept clear by the Swiss Guards, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page029" id="page029"></a>[pg 029]</span>
thronged by the citizens and artizans of the capital;
sounds of weeping and lamentation were to be heard
on every side; yet still, divided between grief and
curiosity, the crowd swept on; and as the last section
of the melancholy procession disappeared beneath
the venerable portals of the cathedral, its vast
esplanade was alive with earnest and eager human
beings, who, fearful of exclusion from the interior
of the building, pressed rudely against each other,
overthrowing the weak and battling with the strong
in their anxiety to assist at the awful and solemn
ceremony which was about to be enacted.</p>

<p>Only a few moments had consequently elapsed
ere a dense mass of the people choked almost to
suffocation the gothic arches and the nave of the
sacred edifice, while the aisles were peopled by the
more exalted individuals who had composed the
funeral procession. Upwards of three thousand
nobles, and a great number of ladies, all clad in
mourning dresses, and attended by their pages and
equerries, blended their melancholy voices with the
responses of the canons of the cathedral; the bishops
of the adjacent sees, and the archbishops in their
rich raiment of velvet and cloth of silver, carried in
their hands tapers of perfumed wax; Oriental myrrh
and aloes burned in golden censers, and veiled the
lofty dome with a light and diaphanous vapour which
gave an unearthly aspect to the building; the organ
pealed forth its deep and thrilling tones; and amid
this scene of excitement, splendour, and suffering,
the Cardinal de Gondy celebrated the mass, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page030" id="page030"></a>[pg 030]</span>
the Bishop of Aire delivered the funeral oration.
The coffin was then raised, and the crowd, hurriedly
escaping from the church, once more spread itself
over the neighbouring streets until the procession
should again have formed; after which all this
immense concourse of people accompanied the body
of their beloved monarch to St. Lazare, where the
clergy halted and returned to Paris; while the
nobles who were to escort the mortuary-car to St.
Denis, and who had hitherto followed it on foot,
either mounted on horseback, or entered their carriages,
in order to reach the Leaning Cross at the
same time as the corpse.</p>

<p>There, the grand prior and the monks of the
royal abbey, in their mourning hoods, received the
body of Henri IV from the hands of De Gondy, the
Archbishop of Paris; and on the following day
the Cardinal-Duc de Joyeuse celebrated a solemn
mass and performed the funeral service of his late
sovereign.</p>

<p>At the close of the lugubrious ceremony the iron
gates of the house of death swung hoarsely upon
their hinges. The "De Profundis" pealed from the
high altar, and Henry the Great was gathered to his
ancestors.</p>

 Charlotte Catherine de la Trmouille, Princess Dowager of
Cond, was the daughter of Louis III, Seigneur de la Trmouille,
and was born in 1568. The Prince de Cond, the chief of the
Protestant party, enamoured of her beauty, made her his wife in
1586; and having died by poison two years subsequently, suspicion
fell upon the Princess and some of her confidential attendants, several
of whom were put to death as accessories to the crime. Madame de

which were in a state of dangerous dilapidation; the broken casements

filthy nook were of the lowest and most depraved description, and no
other tenants could indeed have been found to make their dwelling

deeply-sunk and humid soil, which in fact formed an open sewer

through the female line of Poltrot de Mr, the assassin of the
Due de Guise. He had been originally destined to follow the
profession of his father, but the loss of a lawsuit having reduced his
parents to beggary, he took refuge in the monastery of the Feuillants,
where he entered upon his novitiate. His weakness of intellect and
extreme irritability caused him, however, to be rejected by that
community; and he returned to his native province, where he was imprisoned
for twelve months as an accomplice in a case of manslaughter.
During his confinement he had, as he affirmed, visions connected
with the conduct of the King which determined him to take his life;
and for three years he had persisted in this horrible design, in
furtherance of which he had thrice visited Paris. Upon the last of
these occasions he had reached the capital during the Easter festivals,
but he determined to delay his purpose until after the coronation of
the Queen.</blockquote>

<p>The news of the King's decease had no sooner been
communicated to Marie de Medicis than, profiting
by the advice of the Chancellor, she made a violent
attempt at composure; and although still with streaming
eyes and ill-suppressed sobs, she gave her assent
to the suggestions of her councillors. The Ducs de
Guise and d'Epernon were instructed to mount upon
the instant, and to assemble as many of the nobles
as were within reach, whom they were to accompany
through the streets of the city, declaring upon their
way that the King was not dead, although grievously
wounded; the city gates were ordered to be closed,
the keys delivered to the lieutenant of police, and
strict commands issued to prevent all gatherings
of the populace in the thoroughfares; while the
guards who were distributed through the faubourgs
were hastily concentrated in the environs of the
Parliament, in order, should such a measure become
necessary, to enforce the recognition of the Queen
as Regent of the kingdom.</p>

<p>These arrangements made, MM. de Guise,
d'Epernon, de Villeroy, and de Lavardin demanded
an audience of the august widow, at which,
kneeling before her, they kissed her hand, and
assured her of their unalterable devotion. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page034" id="page034"></a>[pg 034]</span>
example was imitated by all the great nobles of the
Court, with the sole exception of the Duc de Sully,
who was encountered by Bassompierre in the Rue
St. Antoine, accompanied by about forty mounted
followers, and evidently in a state of intense agitation.
"Gentlemen," he exclaimed, as the two
parties met, "if the loyalty which you each vowed
to the monarch whom we have just been unhappy
enough to lose is as deeply impressed upon your
hearts as it should be upon those of all faithful
Frenchmen, swear at this precise moment to preserve
the same fidelity towards the King his son
and successor, and that you will employ your blood
and your life to avenge him."</p>

<p>"Sir," haughtily replied Bassompierre, who had
probably more deeply mourned the death of his
royal master and friend than any other individual of
the Court, and who was consequently revolted by
the imperious tone of this address, "it is we who
have been enjoined to enforce this oath upon others,
and we do not need any exhortations to do our
duty."</p>

<p>Sully regarded the speaker gloomily for an
instant, and then, as though overcome by some
sudden apprehension, he coldly saluted the group of
nobles, and retraced his steps to the Bastille, where
he forthwith closed the gates; having previously, on
his way thither, caused his attendants to carry off
all the bread which they could collect either in the
shops or markets. He, moreover, no sooner thus
found himself in safety than he despatched a courier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page035" id="page035"></a>[pg 035]</span>
to his son-in-law, the Duc de Rohan, who was with
the army in Champagne at the head of six thousand
Switzers, desiring him to march straight upon Paris;
an indiscretion which he was subsequently destined
to expiate, from the heavy suspicion which it
necessarily entailed upon him. Vainly did MM. de
Praslin and de Crquy, who were sent to summon
him to the presence of the young King, endeavour
to induce him to lose no time in presenting himself
at the Louvre; the only concession which he could
be prevailed upon to make, was to desire the
Duchess, his wife,<a id="footnotetag026" name="footnotetag026"></a><a href="#footnote026">[26]</a> to hasten to the palace, and to
offer to the Regent and her son his sincere condolence
upon their irreparable misfortune.<a id="footnotetag027" name="footnotetag027"></a><a href="#footnote027">[27]</a></p>

<p>The Duc d'Epernon, after having stationed the
guards at the palace, was instructed by the Queen
to proceed at once to the Parliament, which was
then assembled, and to inform its members that her
Majesty had in her possession a decree signed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page036" id="page036"></a>[pg 036]</span>
sealed by the late King, conferring upon herself the
regency of the kingdom during the minority of her
son; entreating them at once to ratify the appointment
in order to ensure the public tranquillity. She
also privately despatched a messenger to the President
de Harlay, whom she knew to be attached to
her interests, and to be at once able and zealous, to
instruct him to assemble the Court without delay,
and to use all his influence to enforce her rights.
De Harlay, who on receipt of her message was
confined to his bed by gout, immediately caused
himself to be dressed, and proceeded in a chair to
the Augustine monastery; where he had scarcely
arrived when the Duc d'Epernon entered the hall,
and declared the will of the late King, and the
confidence felt by the Queen that the Parliament
would, without repugnance, recognize her right to
the dignity thus conferred upon her.<a id="footnotetag028" name="footnotetag028"></a><a href="#footnote028">[28]</a> This they
immediately did; and owing to the absence of the
Prince de Cond and the Comte de Soissons, both
of whom aspired to the high office about to be filled
by Marie de Medicis, without the slightest opposition
or disturbance.</p>

<p>This happy intelligence was conveyed to the
Queen by M. d'Epernon, who returned to the
palace accompanied by one of the members of the
Parliament, when the latter, after having been presented
to his royal mistress, on whose right hand
sat the young King bewildered by what was passing
about him, bent his knee before their Majesties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page037" id="page037"></a>[pg 037]</span>
and tendered to Marie a scroll, which having been
returned by her to the accredited envoy of the
supreme court, was read aloud as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, having represented to
the Parliament in full assembly that the King having
just expired by the act of a most cruel, most inhuman,
and most detestable regicide committed
upon his sacred person, it became necessary to
provide for the safety of the reigning monarch and
of his kingdom, required that an order should be
promptly issued concerning his safety and that of
the state, which could only be ruled and governed
by the Queen during the minority of the said Lord
her son; and that it should please the said Court to
proclaim her Regent, in order that it might, through
her, administer the affairs of the realm;
The subject having been duly considered, the said
Court declared, and still declares, the said Queen,
the King's mother, Regent of France, to be entrusted
with the administration of all matters of
state during the minority of the said Lord her son,
with all power and authority.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Done in Parliament, this 14th of May, 1610.</p>

<p>"(Signed) DU TILLET." <a id="footnotetag029" name="footnotetag029"></a><a href="#footnote029">[29]</a></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>During the course of the day guards had been
sent to the residence of the several foreign ambassadors,
in order to protect them from the violence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page038" id="page038"></a>[pg 038]</span>
of the populace, and especially to that of the Spanish
minister, who was peculiarly obnoxious to the Parisians.
The governors of provinces and fortresses
who chanced to be at that moment sojourning in
the capital were ordered to repair without delay
to their several commands, to maintain tranquillity
within their separate jurisdictions; and, save the
audible lamentations which throughout the night
broke the silence of the mourning city, all was
calm and quiet, except in the immediate neighbourhood
of the Augustine monastery, where the
Attorney-General had authorized the workmen to
prepare the great hall for the reception of the young
King, and where the necessary preparations for his
presence on the following day were continued until
dawn.<a id="footnotetag030" name="footnotetag030"></a><a href="#footnote030">[30]</a></p>

<p>The parliamentary envoy having quitted the
palace, and the crowd of nobles, by whom its
spacious halls and galleries had been filled, having
retired, Marie was at length left at liberty to indulge
her grief, rendered only the more poignant from the
constraint to which she had been so long subjected.
Her first impulse was to command that the bed of
the young sovereign should be removed to her own
chamber, and this done, she abandoned herself to all
the bitterness of her sorrow.</p>

<p>She had, indeed, legitimate cause for tears.
With a son still almost a child, ambitious nobles
jealous of her power, and a great nation looking
towards herself for support and consolation, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page039" id="page039"></a>[pg 039]</span>
might well shrink as she contemplated the arduous
task which had so suddenly devolved upon her.
Moreover, death is the moral crucible which cleanses
from all dross the memories of those who are submitted
to its unerring test; and in such an hour she
could not but forget the faults of the husband in
dwelling upon the greatness of the monarch. Who,
then, shall venture to follow her through the reveries
of that fatal night? Who shall dare, unrebuked, to
assert that the ambition of the woman quenched the
affection of the wife? or that Marie, in the excess
of her self-gratulation, forgot the price at which her
delegated greatness had been purchased? That
some have been found bold enough to do this says
little for their innate knowledge of human nature.
The presence of death and the stillness of night are
fearful chasteners of worldly pride, and with these
the daughter of the Medici was called upon to contend.
Her position demanded mercy at the hands
of her historians, and should not have sought it in
vain.</p>

<p>From one reproach it is, however, impossible to
exonerate her, and that one was the repugnance
which she evinced to encourage any investigation
into the real influence under which Ravaillac had
committed the murder of the King. In vain did
she receive communications involving individuals
who were openly named; she discouraged every
report; and although among these the Duc d'Epernon
made a conspicuous figure, she treated the
accusation with indifference, and continued to display
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page040" id="page040"></a>[pg 040]</span>
towards him an amount of confidence and favour to
which he had never previously attained.</p>

<p>Indignant at this extraordinary supineness, the
President de Harlay only increased his own efforts
to unravel so painful a mystery; and refusing all
credence to the assertion of the regicide that he
had been self-prompted&mdash;an assertion to which he had
perseveringly adhered amid torture, and even unto
death, with a firmness truly marvellous under the
circumstances&mdash;the zealous magistrate carefully examined
every document that was laid before him,
and interrogated their authors with a pertinacity
which created great alarm among the accused parties,
of whom none were so prominent as Madame de
Verneuil and the Duc d'Epernon.</p>

<p>The latter, indeed, considered it expedient to
wait upon the commissioners appointed by the
Parliament to investigate these reports, in order to
urge the condemnation of their authors; these
being, as he asserted, not only guilty of defaming
innocent persons, but also of exciting a dangerous
feeling among the people, at all times too anxious
to seek the disgrace and ruin of their superiors.
He found, however, little sympathy among those
whom he sought to conciliate; and on addressing
himself to the President, whom he entreated to
inform him of the details of the accusation made
against himself, that magistrate, without any effort
to disguise his feeling of repulsion towards the
applicant, coldly replied, "I am, Sir, not your
prosecutor, but your judge."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page041" id="page041"></a>[pg 041]</span>

<p>"I ask this of you as my friend," was the retort
of the Duke.</p>

<p>"I have no friend," said the uncompromising
minister. "I shall do you justice, and with that you
must content yourself."</p>

<p>So uncourteous a reception excited the indignation
of M. d'Epernon, who forthwith hastened to
the Louvre to complain to the Regent of the insult
to which he had been subjected; and Marie had no
sooner been apprised of the affair than, with a want
of caution highly detrimental to her own reputation,
she despatched a nobleman of her household to M.
de Harlay, to inform him that she had just learnt
with extreme regret that he had failed in respect to
the Duke, and that she must request that in future
he would exhibit more deference towards a person
of his quality and merit. This somewhat abrupt
injunction, addressed to the first magistrate of the
kingdom, and under circumstances so peculiar, only
tended, however, to arouse M. de Harlay to an
assumption of the dignity attached to his office, and
he replied with haughty severity to the individual
who had been charged with the royal message:&mdash;</p>

<p>"During fifty years I have been a judge, and for
the last thirty I have had the honour to be the head
of the sovereign Court of Peers of this kingdom;
and I never before have seen either duke, lord, or
peer, or any other man whatever might be his
quality, accused of the crime of <i>lse-majest</i> as M.
d'Epernon now is, who came into the presence of
his judges booted and spurred, and wearing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page042" id="page042"></a>[pg 042]</span>
sword at his side. Do not fail to tell the Queen
this." <a id="footnotetag031" name="footnotetag031"></a><a href="#footnote031">[31]</a></p>

<p>So marked an exhibition of the opinion entertained
by the Parliament on the subject of the
complicity of the Duke in the crime then under
investigation, did not fail to produce a powerful
effect upon all to whom it became known, but it
nevertheless failed to shake the confidence of Marie
de Medicis in the innocence of a courtier who had,
in the short space of a few days, by his energy and
devotion, rendered himself essential to her; while
thus much must be admitted in extenuation of her
conduct, reprehensible as it appeared, that every
rumour relative to the death of her royal consort
immediately reached her, and that two of these
especially appeared more credible than the guilt of a
noble, who could, apparently, reap no benefit from
the commission of so foul and dangerous a crime.
In the first place, the Spanish Cabinet had been long
labouring to undermine the power of France, in
which they had failed through the energy and
wisdom of the late King, whose opposition to the
alliance which they had proposed between the
Dauphin and their own Infanta had, moreover,
wounded their pride, and disappointed their projects;
and there were not wanting many who
accused the agents of Philip of having instigated
the assassination; while another rumour, less generally
disseminated, ascribed the act of Ravaillac to
the impulse of personal revenge, elicited by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page043" id="page043"></a>[pg 043]</span>
circumstance that Henry had first dishonoured and
subsequently abandoned a sister to whom he was
devotedly attached.</p>

<p>That M. d'Epernon was politic enough to impress
upon the mind of the Queen the extreme probability
of either or both of these facts, there can be little
doubt, as it would appear from the testimony of
several witnesses that the intention of the murderer
was known for some time before the act was committed;
and nothing could be more rational than the
belief that if the agents of Spain were indeed
seeking to secure a trusty tool for the execution of
so dark a deed, they would rather entrust it to one
who could by the same means satiate his own thirst
for private revenge, than to a mere bravo who
perilled life and salvation simply from the greed
of gain.</p>

<p>Day by day, moreover, the ministers were overwhelmed
by accusations which pointed at different
individuals. Those who had opposed the return of
the Jesuits to France openly declared that they
were the actual assassins; while even in the provinces
several persons were arrested who had predicted
before its occurrence the death of the King,
and the means by which it was to be accomplished;
and finally the affair became so involved that, with the
exception of the woman De Comans to whom allusion
has been elsewhere made, and who was condemned
to imprisonment for life, all the suspected persons
were finally acquitted.<a id="footnotetag032" name="footnotetag032"></a><a href="#footnote032">[32]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page044" id="page044"></a>[pg 044]</span>

<p>At eight o'clock on the morning succeeding the
assassination of the King all the members of the
different Chambers assembled in their scarlet robes
and capes, the presidents wearing their cloaks and
mortar-shaped caps; and half an hour afterwards
the Chancellor, accompanied by several masters of
the Court of Requests, and dressed from head to
foot in black velvet, took his place below the First
President in the great hall of the Augustine
monastery, where the young King was to hold his
Bed of Justice, the ordinary place of meeting being
still encumbered with the costly preparations which
had been made for the state-reception of the Queen.
This ceremonial was essential to the legal tenure of
the regency by his mother, which required the
ratification of the sovereign; and his assent in the
presence of his princes, dukes, peers, and officers of
the Crown, to her assumption of entire and complete
control over his own education, and the administration
of the government during his minority, as well
as his approval of the decree delivered on the
previous day by the Parliament.<a id="footnotetag033" name="footnotetag033"></a><a href="#footnote033">[33]</a></p>

<p>Then arrived in rapid succession the Duc de
Mayenne, the Conntable de Montmorency, the
cardinals, prelates, and other great dignitaries; who
were finally succeeded by the King himself, habited
in a suit of violet velvet, and surrounded and followed
by a numerous retinue of princes, dukes,
nobles, and high officers of the Court. Louis himself
was mounted on a white palfrey, but all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page045" id="page045"></a>[pg 045]</span>
members of his suite, whatever their rank, were on
foot. The Queen came next in her coach, attended
by the Princesses of the Blood and the other great
ladies of her household; not as she had anticipated
only two days previously, blazing with jewels and
clad in royal robes, but covered with an ample
mourning drapery of black crape.</p>

<p>The necessary ceremonies having been observed,
the King at length took his place upon the Bed of
Justice, having the Queen upon his right hand;
while below their Majesties were seated the Prince
de Conti, the Comte d'Enghien, who represented
his father, M. de Soissons, the Duc de Guise, the
Duc de Montmorency, the Duc d'Epernon, the Duc
de Sully, all peers of France, and the Marchaux
de Brissac,<a id="footnotetag034" name="footnotetag034"></a><a href="#footnote034">[34]</a> de Lavardin, and de Bois-Dauphin;<a id="footnotetag035" name="footnotetag035"></a><a href="#footnote035">[35]</a>
while the other dignitaries of the State and Church
were arranged upon either hand of the young
monarch, and the body of the hall was occupied by
the members of the several Courts.</p>

<p>When all had taken their places, and silence was
restored, the Queen, rising from her seat, and
throwing back her veil, proceeded to address the
assembly, but for a time her voice was inaudible,
and choked with sobs. At length, however, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page046" id="page046"></a>[pg 046]</span>
mastered her emotion, and with a gesture full of
mournful dignity, she besought all present to continue
to her son and to herself the same loyalty and
devotion which they had exhibited towards the
monarch of whom the state had been so cruelly
bereft; assuring them that it should be her study to
induce the King to be guided by their counsels in
all things, and imploring of them to afford him such
advice as should on all occasions be compatible with
his own dignity and the welfare of the country over
which he was called upon to rule.</p>

<p>Short as was this harangue, it was not without
considerable difficulty that she accomplished its
utterance. More than once, suffocated by her grief,
she was compelled to pause until she could regain
her voice; and when at its close she drew her veil
once more over her head, and prepared to leave the
hall, the assembly rose simultaneously, and implored
of her to honour the meeting by her presence until
it should be dissolved. Exhausted and wretched,
Marie strove to utter her thanks, and to retire; but
the opposition offered to this resolution was so great
and so unanimous that she was at length prevailed
upon to resume her seat; and she had no sooner done
so than Louis, raising for a moment the cap from his
head, in his turn addressed the Court.</p>

<p>The reply of the Chancellor was pregnant with
wisdom and loyalty; in it he assured the King of the
fidelity and devotion of all ranks of his subjects, and
confirmed the Queen in her regency; after which
the Attorney-General having spoken at great length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page047" id="page047"></a>[pg 047]</span>
to the same effect, the royal and august personages
rose and returned to the Louvre in the same order
as they had observed on their arrival, followed
throughout the whole distance by the acclamations
of the citizens, and reiterated cries of "Vive le
Roi!" <a id="footnotetag036" name="footnotetag036"></a><a href="#footnote036">[36]</a></p>

<p>An hour or two subsequently Marie de Medicis
accorded an audience to the Duc de Sully, who had,
with considerable difficulty, been induced by M. de
Guise to present himself at the palace, to offer his
condolences to the young sovereign and his august
mother;<a id="footnotetag037" name="footnotetag037"></a><a href="#footnote037">[37]</a> and he was accordingly introduced into the
private apartment of the Queen, where he found her
surrounded by the ladies of her household, and
absorbed in grief. As he was announced she burst
into a passion of tears, and for a time was unable to
welcome him; but having at length succeeded in
controlling her emotion, she desired that the King
should be brought to her; and he had no sooner
appeared than she pointed out to him the Duc de
Sully, when the young monarch threw himself into
his arms, and loaded him with the most affectionate
caresses.</p>

<p>"You do well, my son," sobbed Marie, as she
remarked the emotion of the boy; "you must love
M. de Sully, who was one of the best and most
faithful servants of the King your father, and who
will, I trust, continue to serve you with the same
zeal." <a id="footnotetag038" name="footnotetag038"></a><a href="#footnote038">[38]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page048" id="page048"></a>[pg 048]</span>

<p>The interview was a lengthy one, and the urbanity
of the Queen produced so powerful an effect upon
the mind of the finance minister that he ceased to
apprehend any diminution of his influence, and
accordingly sent to countermand the return of the
Duc de Rohan, who had already advanced a day's
march towards the capital.<a id="footnotetag039" name="footnotetag039"></a><a href="#footnote039">[39]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Dowager-Princesse de Cond had
hastened to inform her son of the assassination of
the King, and to urge his instant return to the
capital; a summons to which he replied by forwarding
letters of condolence both to the King and
the Regent, containing the most earnest assurances
of his loyalty and devotion alike to their personal
interests and to those of the nation; and declaring
that he only awaited their commands to return to
Court, in order to serve them in any manner which
they might see fit to suggest.</p>

<p>The Comte de Soissons, who had left Paris only
a few days before the coronation of the Queen, for
the reason elsewhere stated, and who had retired to
his estate near Chartres, was invited by a messenger
despatched by Marie to return without delay to the
capital, where the interests of the state required his
presence. This command he prepared to obey with
alacrity; but his zeal was greatly damped when, on
arriving at St. Cloud, he ascertained that the Queen
had been already recognized by the Parliament as
Regent of the kingdom, and that her dignity had
been publicly confirmed by the young sovereign.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page049" id="page049"></a>[pg 049]</span>
On first receiving this intelligence his rage was
without bounds; he even questioned the legality of
an arrangement of this description made without
his sanction, he being, during the absence of the
Prince de Cond, the first subject in France after
the Queen herself; and then, moderating the
violence of his expressions, he complained that
by the precipitation of the Parliament, he had been
deprived of the privilege of signifying his assent to
the nomination, as he had previously pledged himself
to do. He next questioned the right of the
Parliament to interfere in so important a measure;
declaring that their fiat was null and void, as the
Chambers had no authority to organize a government,
and still less to appoint a regency, which
could only be effectively done by a royal testament,
a declaration made before death, or by an assembly
of the States-General. He, moreover, insisted that
the case was without precedent; that the power of
the Parliament was restricted to the administration
of justice; and that while it was desirable that the
mothers of princes, heirs to the throne, should be
entrusted with the care of their education, the
government of the country belonged by right to
the Princes of the Blood, to the exclusion of all other
claimants.<a id="footnotetag040" name="footnotetag040"></a><a href="#footnote040">[40]</a></p>

<p>Every effort was made to calm his anger; and it
is probable that the representations of his personal
friends convinced him of the impolicy of further
opposition; although he so long delayed his arrival
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page050" id="page050"></a>[pg 050]</span>
in the capital that he could only explain his tardiness
by declaring that the sudden intelligence of the
King's murder had so seriously affected his health
that he was unable to obey the summons of the
Queen until the 16th of May, when he was met at
the gate of the city by the Duc d'Epernon, at the
head of a large body of the nobility.</p>

<p>The pomp in which he reached Paris, however,
sufficed to prove that he was totally unprepared for
the existing posture of affairs, and that he had taken
every precaution to enforce his claims, should he
find the public mind disposed to admit them. His
retinue consisted of three hundred horse, and he
travelled with all the pretensions of royalty. A
few words, nevertheless, sufficed to dispel the
illusion under which he laboured, and once convinced
that the supreme authority of the Queen
had been both recognized and ratified, he had no
other alternative save to offer his submission; which
he did, moreover, with so good a grace that Marie
bestowed upon him, in token of welcome, the
government of Normandy, which had hitherto been
held by the Dauphin; while a short time subsequently,
when he manifested fresh symptoms of
discontent, the Duc de Bouillon was instructed to
inquire by what means he could be conciliated;
upon which he demanded a pension of fifty thousand
livres, the reversion of the government of Dauphiny
for his son, who had not at that time attained his
fifth year, and the sum of two hundred thousand
crowns with which to pay a debt to the Duke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page051" id="page051"></a>[pg 051]</span>
Savoy, contracted on the duchy of Moncalieri belonging
to his wife. These exorbitant claims were
at once admitted, and M. de Soissons forthwith
declared himself the firm ally of the Queen.<a id="footnotetag041" name="footnotetag041"></a><a href="#footnote041">[41]</a></p>

<p>All the cities and provinces of the kingdom
hastened to despatch deputations to the capital, to
present their assurances of respectful homage to the
young sovereign, and to recognize the regency of
his mother; and these were shortly afterwards succeeded
by the plenipotentiaries and envoys of the
different European states, whose condolences and
congratulations were graciously acknowledged by
Marie and her ministers in the name of the new
monarch.</p>

<p>On the 18th of the month the regicide Ravaillac
was put upon his trial, during which he exhibited
a stoical indifference, that filled his judges with
astonishment. Far from seeking to evade the
penalty of his crime, he admitted it with a calmness
and composure perfectly unshaken; and on the 27th
his sentence was pronounced and executed with such
barbarity that we shall avoid the detail.</p>

<p>On the following day the Duc de Bouillon arrived
in Paris, and proceeded directly to the palace to kiss
the hand of the Queen-Regent and take the oath of
fidelity to the King, by both of whom he was warmly
welcomed; Marie being anxious to rally about her
all the high nobility, especially such as had formerly
exhibited symptoms of discontent. M. de Bouillon
had not, however, been long in the capital when a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page052" id="page052"></a>[pg 052]</span>
quarrel arose between himself and the Duc de Sully,
whom he accused of arrogance and presumption,
reminding him that he had not always been in the
exalted position which he then occupied, while as
regarded himself, he was born to higher fortunes
than he had yet attained. The anger of both parties
was so much excited during the interview, that great
apprehensions were entertained of the result of so
serious a misunderstanding; nor was it until the
Due de Guise had exerted all his influence with
both parties that a partial reconciliation took place,
which was subsequently completed through the good
sense of the two nobles themselves, who in their
cooler moments reflected upon the injury which
must accrue alike to the national interests and to
those of the reformed religion, of which they both
were adherents, should they permit their private
feelings to interfere with their public duties.</p>

<p>On the second day after the interment of the
King the Regent proceeded in state to Notre-Dame,
in order to assist at a solemn service which she had
caused to be celebrated for the repose of his soul.
The <i>cortge</i> consisted of seven coaches, containing
herself, the Princesses of the Blood, the Duchesses,
and other great ladies of her household, under a
strong escort of guards and harquebusiers, commanded
by M. de la Chtaigneraie. All the principal
nobility, with the exception of the Comte de
Soissons, attended by their several retainers, were
already mounted when she descended to the court
of the palace, and were awaiting her without the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page053" id="page053"></a>[pg 053]</span>
gates, when considerable excitement was created by
the Duc d'Epernon, who, detaching himself from his
followers, rode to the side of her carriage. As no
Prince of the Blood had ever assumed this privilege,
not even the Guises, lofty as were their pretensions,
a general murmur arose among the assembled
nobles; but M. d'Epernon, regardless of this
demonstration of displeasure, and aware that he
had already obtained considerable influence over the
mind of the Queen, retained his position, to the
extreme indignation of the other Princes.<a id="footnotetag042" name="footnotetag042"></a><a href="#footnote042">[42]</a></p>

<p>The Regent and her retinue first proceeded to
the Archbishop's palace, whence the procession was
formed to the cathedral. At its head walked the
Princes of the Blood then present at the Court, and
the principal nobles, with the exception of the
Prince de Conti and the Comte de Soissons, who
supported the Queen, whom they upheld by each
placing a hand beneath her arms. The Dowager
Princess of Cond, the Princesse de Conti, and the
Comtesse de Soissons bore her mourning train, which
was seven French ells in length; and after them
came Madame and the ex-Queen Marguerite, both
habited in the deepest black; who were in their turn
followed by all the great ladies of the Court and
household.<a id="footnotetag043" name="footnotetag043"></a><a href="#footnote043">[43]</a> At the conclusion of the service, the
Regent returned to the Louvre; and in the afternoon,
attended as she had been on the previous
occasion, she proceeded to perform her devotions in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page054" id="page054"></a>[pg 054]</span>
the church of St. Victor, amid the respectful salutations
of the assembled populace.</p>

<p>The grief of the citizens still continued unabated,
but it was apparent that a struggle for pre-eminence
had already commenced among the higher class.
The Regent, whose affliction was as brief as it had
been violent, seemed suddenly endowed with a new
nature. Her ambition grew with her responsibility,
and instead of participating in political questions as
she had previously done with undisguised reluctance,
she entered eagerly into public affairs, and sought
earnestly to establish her authority; an attempt in
which she was seconded by the principal ministers
of state, who at once felt that by supporting her
power they were consolidating their own.</p>

<p>M. de Cond, the first Prince of the Blood, was
still in Italy; his brother the Prince de Conti, being
totally deaf and partially dumb, was incapable of
government; the Comte de Soissons was at variance
with both; and the Duc de Nevers was commanding
the army in Champagne, until he should be superseded
by the arrival of the King in person, according
to the arrangement made by that unhappy monarch
before the departure of the troops from France;
while the Prince de Joinville, who, it may be
remembered, had been banished from the Court for
his intrigue with Madame de Verneuil, and who had
been travelling in England and Germany, and afterwards
retired to Lorraine until his brother the Duc
de Guise should be enabled to procure his recall,
was also absent. To each and all of these Princes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page055" id="page055"></a>[pg 055]</span>
Marie, who at once felt the necessity of their
immediate presence in order to give dignity and
stability to her position, hastened to forward messengers
to request their instant return; a summons
which was promptly obeyed by the Duc de Nevers
and all the principal officers under his command, as
well as by M. de Joinville, who also received a
pressing letter from the Duc de Guise, enjoining
him to profit without delay by so admirable an
opportunity of regaining his forfeited favour. But
whatever were the haste with which all endeavoured
to reach the Court, it still required time for them to
do so;<a id="footnotetag044" name="footnotetag044"></a><a href="#footnote044">[44]</a> and meanwhile the other great nobles were
anxious to shake off the control to which they had
been subjected during the previous reign. Individual
hatred came to the assistance of personal
ambition, and those whose talent enabled them to
acquire influence at Court began to exercise it no
less zealously in the ruin of others than in their own
aggrandizement.<a id="footnotetag045" name="footnotetag045"></a><a href="#footnote045">[45]</a></p>

<p>The Prince de Cond had no sooner forwarded
to the Queen the letter to which allusion has been
already made, than he received a pressing invitation
to return to France, for which purpose he prepared
to leave Milan; a step so obnoxious to Spain that
the Cond de Fuentes spared no pains in dissuading
him from its adoption. He represented in earnest
terms the exceptional position of the Prince, whose
rank as the first subject of the realm justified him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page056" id="page056"></a>[pg 056]</span>
in aspiring to a throne filled by a mere boy, who
could be considered only as a puppet in the hands
of an ambitious woman; following up his arguments
by an offer of efficient aid from his own monarch to
enable M. de Cond to enforce his pretensions; and
while he was thus endeavouring to shake the loyalty
of his guest, the Spanish Ambassador at the Court
of Rome was engaged with equal zeal in seeking to
impress the necessity of the same policy upon Paul
V. Both were, however, destined to fail in their
efforts, the Sovereign-Pontiff declining to interfere
in so extreme a case, and the Prince resolutely
refusing to adopt the course thus treacherously
suggested.</p>

<p>At Brussels the persecution was renewed by the
Spanish minister, seconded by the Papal Nuncio,
Cardinal Bentivoglio,<a id="footnotetag046" name="footnotetag046"></a><a href="#footnote046">[46]</a> whose zeal for the interests of
Spain caused him to overlook the wishes of the
Pope. All, however, proved unavailing; and the
Prince, after a brief sojourn in the Belgian capital,
finally departed for Paris; whither his wife had previously
repaired, accompanied by her step-sister the
Comtesse d'Auvergne, and where she had been
warmly and honourably welcomed by the Queen.<a id="footnotetag047" name="footnotetag047"></a><a href="#footnote047">[47]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, it having been considered advisable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page057" id="page057"></a>[pg 057]</span>
that the King should make a declaration on the
Edicts of Pacification, it became previously necessary
to form a council, under whose advice the
Queen-Regent might proceed to act. When preparing
to quit France, Henri IV had drawn up a
list of fifteen persons whom he had selected for this
purpose, and had decided that every question should
be determined by a majority of votes, the Queen
herself commanding only one vote; the death of the
King had, however, unfortunately tended to render
the execution of his purpose impossible, all the
Princes and great officers of the Crown asserting
their right to admission, and resolutely maintaining
their claim.</p>

<p>The Comte de Soissons urged his privilege of
birth, and haughtily declined to advance any other
plea; while the Conntable de Montmorency loudly
declared that no council could legally be formed
from which he was excluded; and the Cardinal de
Joyeuse maintained the same argument. As regarded
the Guises, who affected at this juncture a
perfect equality with the house of Bourbon, their
eagerness to hold office defeated its own object, the
Duc de Mayenne and the Duc de Guise equally
declaring their right to assist in the government of
the kingdom; while it was considered as incompatible
with the interests of the Crown that two members of
the same family should be admitted into so important
an assembly. The Duc de Nevers, who disputed
precedency with the Guises, also came forward
as a candidate; while the Ducs de Bouillon and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page058" id="page058"></a>[pg 058]</span>
d'Epernon, who were at open feud, and each ambitious
of power, heightened the difficulty by arrogantly
asserting their personal claims. To receive
both was impossible, as from their known enmity
nothing but opposition could be anticipated; and
thus, upon the threshold of her reign, Marie de
Medicis found herself trammelled by the very individuals
from whom she had hoped for assistance and
support.</p>

<p>To select between the two last-mentioned nobles
was difficult as well as dangerous; the position of
M. d'Epernon as colonel-general of the infantry, and
his immense possessions, rendering him a formidable
adversary; while the Duc de Bouillon was still more
powerful from his occupation of Sedan, his intelligence
with foreign states, and his influence over his
co-religionists. Moreover, Marie was no longer in
a position to oppose the pretensions of the Duc
d'Epernon, even had she felt it expedient to do so;
the unlimited confidence which she had reposed in
him since the death of her royal consort having
invested him with a factitious importance, by which
he was enabled to secure a strong party in his
favour upon every question in which he was personally
interested. She had assigned to his use a
suite of apartments in the Louvre, declaring that
his continual presence and advice were essential
to her; and, in addition to this signal favour,
she communicated to him the contents of all
the despatches which she received, and followed
his advice upon all matters of state as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page059" id="page059"></a>[pg 059]</span>
implicitly as though she considered it to be unanswerable.</p>

<p>His credit at Court was also greatly increased by
the Comte de Soissons, who, having ascertained the
extent of his favour with the Regent, spared no
pains to secure his friendship before the arrival of
the Prince de Cond, believing that the support of
one who was all-powerful for the moment might be
of essential service in counteracting the ambitious
views of so formidable a rival; and, moreover,
advantageous in assisting him to accomplish the
marriage of his son Louis de Bourbon with Mademoiselle
de Montpensier, an alliance which was the
great object of his ambition.<a id="footnotetag048" name="footnotetag048"></a><a href="#footnote048">[48]</a></p>

<p>Thus the Duc d'Epernon was not only powerful
in himself, but found his pretensions recognized and
sanctioned by a Prince of the Blood, an advantage
of which he was not slow to appreciate the value;
and he consequently listened to the expostulations
which were addressed to him by those who dreaded
the effects of his interference in state affairs with a
quiet indifference that satisfied them of their utter
inutility.</p>

<p>But while the Queen was bewildered by these
conflicting claims, her ministers, who were anxious
to retain the power in their own hands, were not
displeased to see the number of candidates for place
daily increase. They were aware that on the arrival
of the Prince de Cond he must necessarily take his
seat in the council, while it would be equally impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page060" id="page060"></a>[pg 060]</span>
to exclude the Comte de Soissons, the Duc de
Montmorency, or the Cardinal de Joyeuse; and
they felt that nothing could more effectually limit
the power of these great dignitaries than the admission
of so large a number as must tend to diminish
their influence over the Queen, and to create a confusion
in the management of public affairs which
would necessarily render her more dependent upon
their own wisdom and experience. Under this
persuasion they consequently impressed upon her
the absolute necessity of satisfying every claimant;
and a council was accordingly formed which was
more noisy than efficient; and where, although each
was free to deliver his opinion, the ministers were
careful, in their secret audiences of the Queen,
during which they exposed their own views and
sentiments, to carry out their preconceived measures.<a id="footnotetag049" name="footnotetag049"></a><a href="#footnote049">[49]</a></p>

<p>The struggle which the late King had foretold
between the Regent and her son had, meanwhile,
already commenced. The character of Louis XIII
was, from his earliest boyhood, at once saturnine
and obstinate; and thus, aware of the importance
which the Queen attached to the exercises of
religion, he commenced his predetermined opposition
to her will by refusing to observe them. Remonstrances
and arguments were alike unavailing;
the boy-King declined to listen to either; and Marie
ultimately commanded that he should undergo the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page061" id="page061"></a>[pg 061]</span>
chastisement of the rod. The order was given, but
no one volunteered obedience; the vengeance of the
man might hereafter compensate for the mortification
of the child; and the son of Marie de Medicis,
stolid and gloomy though he was, had already
imbibed a full sense of the respect due to his
sovereign rank.</p>

<p>"How now, M. de Souvr!" <a id="footnotetag050" name="footnotetag050"></a><a href="#footnote050">[50]</a> exclaimed the
Queen; "is the frown of a wayward boy more
dangerous than the displeasure of a mother? I
insist that the King shall undergo the chastisement
which he has so richly merited."</p>

<p>Thus urged, the unwilling governor was compelled
not only to lay his hands upon the sacred
person of royalty, but also to prepare to execute the
peremptory command of his irritated mistress; and
the young Louis no sooner perceived the impossibility
of escape than he coldly submitted to the
infliction, merely saying, "I suppose it must be so,
M. de Souvr, since it is the will of the Queen; but
be careful not to strike too hard."</p>

<p>An hour or two afterwards, when he paid his
usual visit to the Regent, her Majesty rose on his
entrance, according to the established etiquette, and
made him a profound curtsey. "I should prefer,
Madame," said the young Prince, "fewer curtseys
and fewer floggings." <a id="footnotetag051" name="footnotetag051"></a><a href="#footnote051">[51]</a></p>

<p>At the commencement of June intelligence
reached the Court of the death of the Archbishop of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page062" id="page062"></a>[pg 062]</span>
Rouen, the natural brother of the late King, and
it was no sooner authenticated than the Regent
hastened to bestow his abbey of St. Florent upon
M. de Souvr, and that of Marmoutier, one of the
most wealthy and beautiful in France, upon the
brother of her favourite Leonora,<a id="footnotetag052" name="footnotetag052"></a><a href="#footnote052">[52]</a> an unhappy being
who was not only deformed in person, but so wholly
deficient in intellect that every effort even to teach
him to read had proved ineffectual. So abject was
he, indeed, that Concini had been careful never to
allow him to come into contact with Henri IV lest
he should be banished from the Court; and this ill-advised
donation consequently excited great disapprobation,
and elicited fresh murmurs against the
Italian followers of the Queen.</p>

<p>These were, moreover, augmented by another
circumstance which immediately supervened. A
report was spread of the decease of M. de Boce,
the Governor of Bourg-en-Bresse, a brave and
faithful soldier, who had rendered good service to
his country; and the Queen, urged by her favourite,
was imprudent enough, without awaiting proper
confirmation of the rumour, to confer the government
upon Concini, whose arrogance, fostered as it
was by the indulgence of his royal mistress, was
already becoming intolerable to the native nobility.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page063" id="page063"></a>[pg 063]</span>
This fact was, however, no sooner made known to
M. de Boce, who had not, as it subsequently
appeared, even laboured under indisposition, than he
addressed a letter of respectful expostulation to the
Regent, in which he expressed his concern at the
necessity of interfering with the pleasure of her
Majesty in the rapid disposal of his government,
and assured her that he was still able and anxious to
discharge the duties of the trust confided to him by
the late King; informing her, moreover, that he
had in his possession a grant from her royal husband,
bestowing the survivorship of his appointment
upon his son, of which he solicited the confirmation
by herself, feeling convinced that she could never be
served by a more zealous or able subject.<a id="footnotetag053" name="footnotetag053"></a><a href="#footnote053">[53]</a></p>

<p>Concini was accordingly divested of his government
as abruptly as he had acquired it; reluctantly
resigning the coveted dignity amid the laughter and
epigrams of the whole Court.</p>

<p>In addition to these extraordinary instances of imprudence,
Marie de Medicis had also compromised
herself with the people by the reluctance which she
evinced to investigate the circumstances connected
with the murder of her husband. Ravaillac had
suffered, as we have shown, and that too in the most
frightful manner, the consequences of his crime;
persisting to the last in his assertion that he had
acted independently and had no accomplices; but his
testimony, although signed in blood and torture, had
failed to convince the nation which had been so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page064" id="page064"></a>[pg 064]</span>
suddenly and cruelly bereft of its monarch; and among
all classes sullen rumours were rife which involved
some of the highest and proudest in the land.<a id="footnotetag054" name="footnotetag054"></a><a href="#footnote054">[54]</a>
Among these the Duc d'Epernon, as already stated,
stood out so prominently that he had been compelled
to justify himself, while the favour which he had so
suddenly acquired turned the public attention towards
the Queen herself.</p>

<p>Suspicions of her complicity, however ill-founded,
had, indeed, existed even previously to this period,
for Rambure, when speaking of the visit of Sully to
the Louvre on the day after the assassination, a visit
in which he professes to have accompanied him,
says without any attempt at disguise, "The Queen
received us with great affability, and even mingled
her tears and sobs with ours, although we were both
aware of the satisfaction that she felt in being thus
delivered from the King, <i>of whose death she was not
considered to be wholly guiltless</i>, and of becoming her
own absolute mistress.... She then addressed
several other observations to the Duke, during
which time he wept bitterly, while she occasionally
shed a few tears of a very different description." <a id="footnotetag055" name="footnotetag055"></a><a href="#footnote055">[55]</a></p>

<p>These assertions, vague as they are, and utterly
baseless as they must be considered by all unprejudiced
minds, nevertheless suffice to prove that the
finger of blame had already been pointed towards
the unfortunate Marie; an unhappy circumstance
which doubled the difficulties of her position, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page065" id="page065"></a>[pg 065]</span>
should have tended to arouse her caution; but the
haughty and impetuous nature of the Tuscan Princess
could not bend to any compromise, and thus
she recklessly augmented the amount of dislike
which was growing up against her.</p>

<p>On the 8th of July the ex-Queen Marguerite gave
a magnificent entertainment to the Court at her
beautiful estate of Issy; on her return from whence
to the capital, the Regent mounted a Spanish jennet,
and, surrounded by her guards, galloped at full speed
to the faubourg, where she dismounted and entered
her coach, still environed by armed men. As she
had her foot upon the step of the carriage, a poor
woman who stood among the crowd exclaimed with
an earnestness which elicited general attention,
"Would to God, Madame, that as much care had
been taken of our poor King; we should not then
be where we are!"</p>

<p>The Queen paused for a moment, and turned
pale; but immediately recovering her self-possession,
she took her seat, and bowed affably to the people.
The greeting on their part was, however, cold and
reluctant. They were still weeping over the bier of
their murdered sovereign, and they could not brook
the apparent levity with which his widow had already
entered into the idle gaieties of the Court.<a id="footnotetag056" name="footnotetag056"></a><a href="#footnote056">[56]</a></p>

<p>"Only five months after Henry's assassination,"
says Rambure, "such of the nobles as were devoted
to his memory expressed among themselves their
indignation at the bearing of the Queen; who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page066" id="page066"></a>[pg 066]</span>
although compelled at intervals to assume some
semblance of grief, was more frequently to be seen
with a smiling countenance, and constantly followed
the hunt on horseback, attended by a suite of four
or five hundred princes and nobles." <a id="footnotetag057" name="footnotetag057"></a><a href="#footnote057">[57]</a></p>

<p>In order to avert all discontent among the people,
the ministers had induced the Regent not only to
diminish the duty upon salt, a boon for which they
were always grateful, but also to delay the enforcement
of several obnoxious commissions, and to
revoke no less than fifty-four edicts which had been
issued for the imposition of new taxes; while presents
in money were made to the most influential of
the Protestant party, and the Edict of Nantes was
confirmed.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the French Court on the
return of the Prince de Cond, whose arrival had
been anxiously anticipated by his personal friends
and adherents, and strongly urged by the Regent
herself; but when she ascertained that a large body
of nobles had gone as far as Senlis to receive him,
and that among these were all the Princes of
Lorraine, the Marchal de Bouillon, and the Duc de
Sully, she became apprehensive that a cabal was
about to be formed against her authority; a suspicion
which was augmented by the regal state in which he
entered the capital, attended and followed by more
than fifteen hundred individuals of rank.</p>

<p>Her fears were, moreover, eagerly fostered by
the Comte de Soissons, the Duc d'Epernon, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page067" id="page067"></a>[pg 067]</span>
Cardinal de Joyeuse, who, desirous of retaining the
influence which they had already acquired, neglected
no method of arousing her jealousy against the first
Prince of the Blood. In pursuance of this purpose
M. d'Epernon, to whom the safety of the city had
been confided during the first alarm created by the
murder of the King, no sooner learnt the approach
of the Prince than he doubled the guards at the
different gates, and even proposed to form garrisons
in the avenues leading to them; a circumstance which
was immediately made known to M. de Cond, who
expressed great indignation at such an imputation
upon his loyalty. This affront was, however,
remedied by the able courtier, who, being anxious to
conciliate both parties, had no sooner convinced the
Queen of his zeal for her interests than he proceeded,
accompanied by a hundred mounted followers,
to welcome the Prince before he could reach
the city.</p>

<p>M. de Cond dined at Le Bourget, where he expressed
his acknowledgments to the several nobles
by whom he was surrounded, and declared his intention
of upholding by every means in his power
the dignity and authority of the Regent. At the
close of the repast he once more ordered his horses,
and retraced his steps as far as St. Denis, where he
caused a mass to be said for the soul of the deceased
King, and aspersed the royal coffin; after which he
proceeded direct to Paris, receiving upon his way
perpetual warnings not to trust himself within the
gates of the capital. He, however, destroyed these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page068" id="page068"></a>[pg 068]</span>
anonymous communications one after the other, and
was rewarded by a note hastily written by the President
de Thou,<a id="footnotetag058" name="footnotetag058"></a><a href="#footnote058">[58]</a> in which he was entreated to disregard
the efforts which were made to dissuade him
from entering Paris, where the Queen was prepared
to receive him with all possible honour and welcome.</p>

<p>Thus assured, M. de Cond, mounted upon a pied
charger, which had been presented to him by the
Archduke, and habited in the deepest mourning,
continued his journey, having his brother-in-law the
Prince of Orange on his right hand and the Comte
de Beaumont on his left, with whom he occasionally
conversed; but it was remarked that as he drew
near the capital he became absent and ill at ease;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page069" id="page069"></a>[pg 069]</span>
and his discomposure was destined to be increased
by the circumstance that on his arrival at the Louvre
the gates were closed upon the greater number of
his followers, and only a slender retinue permitted
to enter with him. On ascending the great staircase,
in order to pay his respects to the King, he
was informed that his Majesty was in the Queen's
apartment, towards which he immediately proceeded.
His reception was gracious and affectionate,
and he had no sooner knelt and kissed
hands than the Regent assured him of the joy that
she felt at his return, and the confidence with which
she looked forward to his advice and assistance.
On quitting the royal presence, after a prolonged
interview, the Prince warmly expressed his gratification
at the welcome which had been accorded to
him, declaring that he should for ever hold himself
indebted to the Queen for an amount of affability
which he could not have anticipated.</p>

<p>From the palace M. de Cond proceeded to his
residence at the Htel de Lyon, accompanied by the
Duc de Guise, and followed by the same suite with
which he had entered the capital; and thence he
hastened to the residence of the Comtesse d'Auvergne
to greet the Princess. Their meeting was warm and
affectionate; both were anxious to forget the past,
and to profit by the future; while the sincerity of
the reconciliation on the part of Madame de Cond
was fully proved by her subsequent devotion to his
interests and happiness. Their interview was a
long and affecting one, and the Prince spent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page070" id="page070"></a>[pg 070]</span>
remainder of the day in her society, returning,
however, in the evening to the Louvre to be present
at the <i>coucher</i> of the King, whom he assisted to
undress; after which he waited upon the Queen, with
whom he remained until a late hour.<a id="footnotetag059" name="footnotetag059"></a><a href="#footnote059">[59]</a></p>

<p>During the ensuing week Cond was entirely
occupied in receiving the visits of the nobility, who
unanimously hastened to pay their respects, and to
solicit his protection. He held, in fact, a species of
court, upon which the favourites of the Regent did
not fail to comment with an emphatic bitterness that
once more awakened the suspicions of Marie; who,
aware of the popularity of the Prince, was easily
persuaded to believe that these demonstrations were
pregnant with danger to the interests of her son;
and, aware of the instability of her own position, the
prejudices which were entertained against her person,
and the ambition of the great nobles, she
listened with avidity to the suggestions of MM.
de Soissons, d'Epernon, and de Joyeuse, that she
should effect the arrest of Cond before he had time
to organize a faction in his favour. In addition to
the public homage of which he was the object, they
pointed out to her that frequent councils were held,
which were attended by all the chiefs of his party,
both at the Htel de Mayenne and at the Arsenal,
where the treasure amassed by the late King still
remained under the guardianship, and at the discretion
of, the Duc de Sully. They reminded her also
of the manner in which the Prince had quitted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page071" id="page071"></a>[pg 071]</span>
capital, and the vehemence with which he had
expressed his indignation at the treatment he had
received, not only to his personal friends, but also at
the foreign courts which he had visited during his
absence; and they besought her to take proper precautions
before it became too late.<a id="footnotetag060" name="footnotetag060"></a><a href="#footnote060">[60]</a></p>

<p>These arguments were also warmly advocated
by Concini and his wife, the Papal Nuncio, the
Spanish Ambassador, the Chancellor Sillery, Villeroy,
Jeannin, Arnaud,<a id="footnotetag061" name="footnotetag061"></a><a href="#footnote061">[61]</a> and the celebrated Pre Cotton,<a id="footnotetag062" name="footnotetag062"></a><a href="#footnote062">[62]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page072" id="page072"></a>[pg 072]</span>
who had fully possessed himself of the confidence of
the Queen, and who was admitted to all her private
councils.<a id="footnotetag063" name="footnotetag063"></a><a href="#footnote063">[63]</a> Fortunately, however, Marie hesitated
to hazard so extreme a step; and day after day
went by without any hostile manifestation on the
part of the Prince, who openly declared himself
resolved to support her authority. As her alarm on
this subject diminished, the private friends of the
Queen turned their attention to other matters of
political interest; and according to the testimony of
Sully, zealously employed themselves in contravening
all the wishes, and disappointing all the views,
of Henri IV. "There can be no difficulty," he
says with a bitterness which shows how deeply he
felt his own exclusion, "in deciding upon the subject
of their deliberations. The union of the crowns of
France and Spain, the abolition of ancient alliances
with foreign powers, the abolition of all the edicts of
pacification, the destruction of the Protestants, the
exclusion of those of the reformed religion from
places of trust, the disgrace of all who will not submit
to the yoke of the new favourites, the dissipation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page073" id="page073"></a>[pg 073]</span>
of the treasures amassed by the late King, in order
to secure the services of the greedy and the ambitious,
and to load with wealth and power such as
are destined to rise to the highest dignities in the
realm&mdash;that is to say, a thousand projects as pernicious
to the King and to the state as they were
advantageous to our most mortal enemies,&mdash;such
were the great objects of the deliberations of these
new counsellors." <a id="footnotetag064" name="footnotetag064"></a><a href="#footnote064">[64]</a></p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is certain that as regarded
the Prince de Cond, the Queen was better served
by accident than she would have been by the
dangerous advice of her friends. The wise precaution
which she had taken of arming the citizens of
Paris, and of placing them under the command of
individuals chosen by herself, and who had taken an
oath of fidelity to her service in the Htel de Ville,
secured the loyalty of the populace; while the
jealousy of the Guises, who, even while professing
the most ardent attachment to M. de Cond, were
gradually becoming cooler in his cause and quarrelling
among themselves, gave no encouragement to
an attempt at revolt on his part, even should he
have been inclined to hazard it.</p>

<p>The Duc de Bouillon alone laboured incessantly
to undermine the power of the Regent; and he at
length suggested to the Prince that in order to
counterbalance the authority of the Court, and to
maintain his own rightful dignity, he would do well
to return to his original religion, and to place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page074" id="page074"></a>[pg 074]</span>
himself at the head of the Protestants, who would
form a very important and powerful party. M. de
Cond, however, declined to follow this advice,
protesting that he had no desire to involve the
kingdom in intestine commotion, and was content
to await the progress of events.<a id="footnotetag065" name="footnotetag065"></a><a href="#footnote065">[65]</a> It is probable
that he was the more readily induced to exert this
forbearance from the extreme generosity of the
Queen, who, remembering the abruptness with
which he had been deprived, on the occasion of his
marriage, of the many lucrative appointments
bestowed upon him, hastened to present him with a
pension of two hundred thousand livres; to which
she added the Htel de Conti in the Faubourg St.
Germain, which she purchased for that purpose at
a similar sum, the county of Clermont, and other
munificent donations.<a id="footnotetag066" name="footnotetag066"></a><a href="#footnote066">[66]</a></p>

<p>Nor was M. de Cond the only recipient of her
uncalculating generosity, as may be gathered from
the following document from the pen of Richelieu:</p>

<p>"The good management of the savings fund of
the late King left us, when he was taken away, five
millions in the Bastille; and in the hands of the
treasurer of the fund from seven to eight millions
more, with which he had intended to pay the army
that he had raised in order to extend the limits of
his glory, which would admit no others than those
of the universe itself. The uncertainty in which we
were left by that fatal event rendering it necessary
that we should secure the safety of the state by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page075" id="page075"></a>[pg 075]</span>
counterpoise of a certain body of troops, we found
ourselves constrained to employ a portion of the
finances in maintaining during a few months a large
military force which had already been raised; so
that this outlay, the funeral of the King, and the
coronation of the Queen, of which the expenses
were not paid, reduced these savings very considerably.
After the death of that great Prince, who
was the actual ruler of the state, it was impossible
to prevent a certain disorder, which even went so
far as to induce several individuals, who measured
their deserts by their ambition, shamefully to seek,
and pertinaciously to persist in demanding, benefits
which they could never have hoped to secure during
his lifetime. They profit by the difficulties of the
period, offer to serve the state, declare how they
have it in their power to injure the national interests,
and, in short, make it clearly understood that they
will only do their duty upon the most advantageous
terms; and so conduct themselves that even those
who had assisted the King in amassing his treasure
advise the Queen to yield to the exigences of the
time, to open her hands, and to give largely to
every one.</p>

<p>"In accordance with these counsels she increases
the pensions and establishments of the Princes, the
nobles, and the old servants of the Crown; she
grants new ones; she augments the garrisons of her
fortresses, as much to satisfy those who hold them
as for the safety of the country, and maintains a
greater number of troops than formerly; the increase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page076" id="page076"></a>[pg 076]</span>
of these pensions amounting on an average to three
millions annually. The expense of the light horse
and infantry is at present (1617) three millions three
hundred thousand livres; while in 1610 it amounted
only to fifteen hundred thousand francs. She makes
numerous presents, and this under advice, without
increasing her receipts, as well as reducing them annually
two millions five hundred thousand livres by
the diminution of the duty on salt; and so augments
her expenses that, upon mature consideration, we
shall rather be applauded for being in the state we
still are after so many necessary outlays, than blamed
for having incurred them. M. le Prince (Cond)
received during six years three millions six hundred
and sixty thousand livres; the Prince and Princesse
de Conti above one million four hundred thousand;
the Duc de Guise nearly one million seven hundred
thousand; M. de Nevers one million six hundred
thousand; M. de Longueville<a id="footnotetag067" name="footnotetag067"></a><a href="#footnote067">[67]</a> one million two
hundred thousand; MM. de Mayenne, father and
son, two millions and several thousands; M. de
Vendme near six hundred thousand; M. d'Epernon
and his children near seven hundred thousand; and
M. de Bouillon near a million.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page077" id="page077"></a>[pg 077]</span>

<p>"All the Marshals of France, of which the
number was increased one half, received four times
as much as formerly, their pensions being augmented
twenty-four thousand livres, which, in six years,
allowing to each one hundred and forty-four thousand
livres, and calculating them at eight in number,
as they have always been, make, one with the other,
one million one hundred and fifty-two thousand
livres.</p>

<p>"Six other dukes, or officers of the Crown, received
the same allowance, augmenting the outlay
in six years by eighty-six thousand four hundred
livres. Hence it is easy to see how the treasury of
France was exhausted, since eleven or twelve
articles in favour of the great nobles of the state
carry off nearly seventeen millions, without including
all that was paid to them in the shape of salaries
and appointments, the <i>deniers du talion</i><a id="footnotetag068" name="footnotetag068"></a><a href="#footnote068">[68]</a> for their
companies of men-at-arms, grants for the maintenance
of the garrisons of their fortresses, and finally,
without calculating the troubles occasioned by
several among them; troubles which, having compelled
us on three several occasions to take up arms,
have cost us, upon a strict computation, more than
twenty millions of additional outlay." <a id="footnotetag069" name="footnotetag069"></a><a href="#footnote069">[69]</a></p>

<p>We have copied this document at full length, and
in this place, in order, in so far as we are enabled so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page078" id="page078"></a>[pg 078]</span>
to do, to exonerate Marie de Medicis from the
charge of reckless extravagance unsparingly brought
against her by the Duc de Sully. Richelieu himself,
at the period at which this report was furnished
to the ministers, was little disposed to extenuate the
errors of the Regent; and cannot, consequently, be
supposed to have volunteered any palliative circumstances.
Moreover, it is worthy of notice that the
enormous sums registered above were not lavished
upon the personal favourites of the Queen, but were
literally the price paid by the nation to purchase
the loyalty of its Princes and nobles; a frightful
state of things, which exhibits more forcibly than
any argument the utter powerlessness of Marie
to restrain the excessive expenditure by which the
kingdom was so soon reduced to the brink of
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The Regent having renewed all the alliances of
France with the several European powers, they at
this period accredited extraordinary ambassadors to
the French capital, to offer the condolences and congratulations
of their respective sovereigns to the
young King and his mother. Among these the
most interesting to the personal feelings of Marie
was Lord Wharton; who, in addition to the merely
verbal compliments common on such occasions,
presented to Louis XIII, in the name of his royal
master, James I, the Order of the Garter, accompanied
by his affectionate assurances that he had not
forgotten the promise exchanged between himself
and the late monarch, that whichever of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page079" id="page079"></a>[pg 079]</span>
survived would be as a father to the children of the
other; a pledge which he declared himself to be
both ready and anxious to ratify. Nor was this the
first proof of sympathy which the English monarch
had evinced towards Marie and her son, the Court
of London having immediately put on mourning on
learning the death of Henri IV, and a suspension
of all public amusements having taken place throughout
the capital. Gratified by so signal a demonstration
of respect and regard, the Regent accordingly
no sooner ascertained that the British envoy was
approaching Paris than she despatched a party of
four hundred mounted nobles to meet him outside
the gates, and herself took her station at a window
in order to see him pass; a condescension which
was considered to be a signal honour at that period.</p>

<p>The most important of these missions, politically
considered, was, however, that of the Duque de
Feria,<a id="footnotetag070" name="footnotetag070"></a><a href="#footnote070">[70]</a> who arrived in France with a brilliant suite,
charged with the most specious and high-sounding
professions and promises of Philip of Spain, who
pledged himself to support the Regency under all
circumstances, and to place at the disposal of the
Queen whatever assistance she might require against
both external and internal enemies. These magnificent
assurances were coldly received by most of his
hearers, who distrusted alike the Spanish monarch
and his envoy; and who had not yet forgotten that
only a few months had elapsed since Philip had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page080" id="page080"></a>[pg 080]</span>
himself endeavoured, not merely to dispossess Marie
of her authority, but also to incite M. de Cond to
dispute the throne itself with her young son. Upon
the Queen and her immediate friends they, however,
produced a contrary effect; her leaning towards the
Court of Spain inducing her to welcome every
symptom of a desire on the part of that Cabinet to
maintain a good understanding with her own Government.
Her reception of the Duque de Feria was
consequently so gracious that he immediately proceeded
to renew the negotiation already mooted for
the double alliance between the two nations, which
must, should it ever be effected, render their interests,
at least for a time, inseparable. No proposition
could be more acceptable to Marie de Medicis, who,
harassed and dispirited, gladly welcomed any prospect
of support by which she might hope to keep
her turbulent nobility in check; while Philip on his
side was anxious to effect so desirable an alliance, as
it would enable him, irrespectively of its contingent
advantages, to gain time, and thus secure the
means of settling the affairs of Germany, which
were embroiled by the misunderstanding between
the Emperor and his brothers.</p>

<p>The Spanish Cabinet was, moreover, desirous of
widening the breach between the Catholics and
Protestants of France, an attempt in which it was
zealously seconded by the Pope, who was readily
persuaded that no measure could be so desirable for
the accomplishment of such a purpose as a union
between the two crowns. Thus the objections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page081" id="page081"></a>[pg 081]</span>
which had appeared insuperable to Henri IV lost
all their weight in the mutual anxiety of Marie and
Philip to secure the advantages which each sought
to gain; and, as the youth of Louis XIII forbade
the immediate celebration of the marriage, a private
pledge was exchanged between the ministers of
France and the Spanish envoy, that the Regent
should not interfere with the measures of the House
of Austria in Germany, while Spain should refuse
all support to the malcontents in her own kingdom;
and this mutual understanding once established, the
double alliance was concluded.<a id="footnotetag071" name="footnotetag071"></a><a href="#footnote071">[71]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of the important interests by which
the mind of Marie de Medicis was at this period
occupied, a fresh demand upon her attention was
made by Madame de Verneuil, who on the 15th of
September laid before the Comte de Soissons, the
Cardinal de Joyeuse, and the Duc d'Epernon, the
written engagement which she had received from
the Duc de Guise, and urged its enforcement.
Her claim was warmly espoused by M. de Soissons,
who at once declared the document to be valid and
unanswerable; while it was admitted by all by
whom it was examined to be strictly legal in form,
and to authorize her in demanding its ratification.
Unlike that which she had previously extorted from
Henri IV, the promise which the Marquise now
produced was not only signed by M. de Guise himself,
but also by two notaries, a priest, and several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page082" id="page082"></a>[pg 082]</span>
witnesses. Unfortunately, however, whether by accident,
or intention on the part of the Duke, both the
notaries by whom it had been attested were aged
men, one of whom had subsequently died; while the
other had become so imbecile that when interrogated
upon the subject, he first doubted, and subsequently
denied, all knowledge of the transaction; but as
these contingencies did not affect the signature of
M. de Guise himself, his position was sufficiently
embarrassing; and the rather that, his passion for
the Marquise having been long extinguished, he
had become the acknowledged suitor of the Dowager
Duchess of Montpensier.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that had Henri IV still
lived Madame de Verneuil would have been enabled
to enforce her claim, as that monarch would not
have suffered so admirable an opportunity of mortifying
the Guises to have escaped him; and thus
individual imprudence would have afforded him a
triumph which the fortune of arms had hitherto
denied, and the most jealous watchfulness failed to
secure; but his death had changed the position of
all the parties interested in the affair, and Marie de
Medicis looked upon it with very different feelings.
Her old and still existing hatred of the Marquise
was renewed by an exhibition of arrogance which
recalled to memory some of the most bitter
moments of her existence; and her pride as
a sovereign was revolted at the prospect of
seeing the woman by whom her peace had been
destroyed elevated to the rank of a Princess of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page083" id="page083"></a>[pg 083]</span>
the Blood, and placed beside the very steps of her
throne.</p>

<p>She was, moreover, anxious to limit the power of
the Comte de Soissons, and to prevent the proposed
marriage of his son Louis de Bourbon with the
heiress of Montpensier, which would have opened
up a still wider field for his ambition. She accordingly
espoused the cause of the Duc de Guise, who,
having no other alternative by which to rid himself
of the Marquise, did not scruple to deny the
authenticity of the signature ascribed to him; and
he had no sooner resolutely done this, than the
Regent placed the affair in the hands of the President
Jeannin, who with his usual ability at length
succeeded in inducing Madame de Verneuil to
withdraw her claims. Aware that he could hope
nothing either from her generosity or her dread of
ridicule, the astute lawyer represented to her the inequality
of the contest in which she was about to
engage without any ulterior support; whereas the
Duc de Guise was not only powerful in himself,
but would necessarily be supported by all the
members of his family, as well as protected by the
Queen.</p>

<p>The Marquise for a time affected to believe that
the legality of the document in her possession must
enable her to triumph even over these obstacles,
formidable as they were; but Jeannin reminded
her of the death of one of her witnesses, the denial
of another, and the solemn declaration of the Duke
that his own signature was feigned; assuring her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page084" id="page084"></a>[pg 084]</span>
that these circumstances must prove more than
sufficient to prevent the recognition of the deed in
any court of law. When he found that this argument
had produced the desired impression, he next
proceeded to expatiate upon the benefit which she
could not fail to derive from the gratitude of the
Guises, should she voluntarily withdraw her claim
without subjecting the Duke to the annoyance of a
public lawsuit; during which, moreover, her former
<i>liaison</i> with his brother, the Prince de Joinville,
could not fail to be made matter of comment and
curiosity. He urged upon her the desirability of
avoiding a publicity which must tend to dishonour
both herself and her children; and, finally, he
pointed out the propriety and policy of seizing
so favourable an opportunity to secure the goodwill
of the Regent, who would as a natural
consequence be gratified by such a concession, and
be thus induced to bury the past in oblivion.</p>

<p>Madame de Verneuil wept and argued in vain.
Jeannin was indeed too subtle an antagonist
to afford her one inch of vantage-ground;
and he so thoroughly undermined the reasonings
which she advanced, that, wearied and discouraged,
she at length consented to forego her
claim.</p>

<p>Deprived of the position which she had
formerly held at the Court, she never re-appeared
there, but spent the remainder of her life
either on her estate at Verneuil, or in her
htel at Paris, in such complete retirement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page085" id="page085"></a>[pg 085]</span>
that nothing more is known of her save the
period of her death, which took place on the 9th
of February 1633, when she had reached her fifty-fourth
year.<a id="footnotetag072" name="footnotetag072"></a><a href="#footnote072">[72]</a></p>

 Madame de Sully, the second wife of the Duke, was Rachel de
Gochefilet, the daughter of Jacques, Seigneur de Vaucelas, and of
Marie d'Arbalte. She was first married to Franois Hurault, Sieur
de Chteaupers et du Marais, who died in 1590. She survived the
Duc de Sully, and died in 1659, at the age of ninety-three years.
The arrogance of this lady was so notorious that it became the subject
of one of those biting epigrams for which Henri IV had rendered
himself famous; for it is on record that upon an occasion when he
was a guest at the table of the finance minister, he drank her
health, accompanied by the following impromptu:&mdash;<br>

<blockquote>
"Je bois  <i>toi</i>, Sully;<br>
Mais j'ai failli;<br>
Je devois dire  <i>vous</i>, adorable Duchesse,<br>
Pour boire  vos appas<br>

 Jacques Auguste de Thou was the representative of an ancient
family of Champagne, celebrated alike in the magistracy and the
Church. One of his ancestors, Nicolas de Thou, clerk of the parliamentary
council, and Bishop of Chartres, performed the coronation
service of Henri IV in 1594, and died in 1598. Christophe de
Thou, the brother of Nicolas, was first president of the Parliament of
Paris, chancellor to the Ducs d'Anjou and d'Alenon, and a faithful
servant of Henri II, Charles IX, and Henri III, whom he served
with untiring zeal during the intestine troubles of the kingdom. He
died in 1582. His son, the subject of the present note, embraced
the legal profession, and became, from parliamentary councillor, president
<i> mortier</i>. In 1586, after the day of the Barricades, he left
Paris, and entered the service of Henri III, who confided to him
several missions in England and Italy. On the accession of Henri
IV, De Thou eagerly embraced his interests, and by this sovereign he
was also employed in negotiations of importance. At the death of
Amyot he was appointed grand master of the King's library. During
the regency of Marie de Medicis he became director-general of
finance, and was deputed, in conjunction with Cardinal Duperron,
to reform the University of Paris, and to aid in the construction of
the Royal College. Posterity is indebted to De Thou for a <i>History</i> of
his time, in one hundred and thirty-eight books, embracing sixty
years, from 1545 to 1607. His style is terse, elevated, and elegant,
and the work is full of elaborate and most minute detail. De Thou
died in 1617.

 Antoine Arnaud was the elder son of Antoine Arnaud, captain
of the light horse, and subsequently attorney and advocate-general of
Catherine de Medicis. The younger Arnaud embraced the legal
profession, and became an advocate of the Parliament of Paris,
where he distinguished himself by his probity and eloquence. Henri
IV rewarded his merit by the brevet of councillor of state, and Marie
de Medicis appointed him advocate-general. When offered the
dignity of secretary of state, he resolutely refused to accept it, representing
to the Regent that he could more effectually serve her as
advocate-general to the King than in the secretaryship. His able
and erudite speech in the celebrated Jesuit cause tried at Paris in
1594, in the presence of Henri IV and the Duke of Savoy, and his
work entitled <i>The Plain and True Discourse against the Recall of
the Order to France</i>, are well known. At the conclusion of the trial
named above the University offered him a handsome present; which,
however, he declined, declaring that he required no recompense, and
had given his services gratuitously; whereupon that learned body
passed a solemn act pledging itself to eternal gratitude alike towards
him and his posterity; an obligation which it would, however,
appear to have forgotten in 1656, in the case of his son. His
great talents and high character procured for him an alliance with
the first president, who bestowed upon him the hand of his daughter
Catherine, by whom he became the father of twenty children.
Although adverse to the League, Arnaud was a member of the Romish
Church.

 Pierre Cotton, subsequently so famous as the confessor of Henri
IV, was born at Nronde, in the department of the Loire, in 1564,
and was received into the Order of the Jesuits in 1585 at Arona, in
the Milanese, whence he was sent to Milan to study philosophy.
Thence he was removed to Rome, where he remained twelve months
engaged in the same pursuit; and finally he proceeded to Lyons,
where he completed his education, and began to preach. During a
sojourn at Grenoble he was presented to the Duc de Lesdiguires,
in whom he inspired so much confidence that it was to his good
offices that he was indebted for his selection as confessor to the
King. The Duke having represented him as a sound and eloquent
preacher, he was instructed to proceed to Paris, where his sermons
having realized the report of his patron, Henri IV at once adopted
him as his director. After the death of that monarch, he was for
some time the confessor of Louis XIII. In 1617 he abandoned the
Court, and travelled through the southern provinces as a missionary-apostle.
He was the author of several controversial and religious
works, and died in 1626.

<p>For a short time Marie began to hope that the
conciliatory measures she had adopted would ensure
the tranquillity of the country over which she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page087" id="page087"></a>[pg 087]</span>
been called to govern. All the cities and provinces
had sworn fidelity to the King, and obedience to
herself; all the governors of fortresses had followed
their example; and the great nobles, whose plans
were not yet matured, and whose cupidity was for
the moment satisfied, testified no inclination to
disturb, or to trammel the measures of the Government.
The relief afforded to the middle and lower
classes by the diminution of some of the national
imposts, and the abolition of others, began to produce
its effect upon the popular mind; and the young
King was received whenever he appeared in public
with warm and enthusiastic greetings. All the
members of the House of Guise, traditionally the
most dangerous enemies of the Crown, affected a
respectful deference towards the Regent, and an
earnest desire to uphold her authority; while the
Duc d'Epernon, who had, in her first hour of trial,
at once declared himself her devoted adherent,
appeared to exist only to fulfil her wishes. The
ministers deferred to her opinions with a respect
which caused their occasional opposition to be rather
matter of argument than mortification; and, finally,
Concini and his wife seemed to have forgotten their
own interests in those of their royal mistress.<a id="footnotetag073" name="footnotetag073"></a><a href="#footnote073">[73]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the bearing of the young sovereign,
ably prompted by the wisdom of M. de Souvr, was
admirable. Gifted with an intellect beyond his
years, and with an agreeable person, he soon
engaged the affections of the people; who, eager
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page088" id="page088"></a>[pg 088]</span>
to love the son of Henri IV, and to anticipate
under his rule the same glory and greatness which
had characterized the reign of his father, drew
the happiest auguries from his slightest actions;
while the modesty of his demeanour towards the
princes and nobles equally tended to establish a
feeling of interest and sympathy towards his person
which promised a favourable result. When he
received the homage of his Court on his accession
he said sadly: "Gentlemen, these honours have
devolved upon me too soon; I am not yet old
enough to govern; be faithful, and obey the
commands of the Queen my mother." <a id="footnotetag074" name="footnotetag074"></a><a href="#footnote074">[74]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ambition of Concini was more
powerful than his devotion to his benefactress; and
his influence continued unabated. Moreover, his
vanity was mortified, as he could not conceal from
himself that he was indebted for his position at
Court, indefinite as it was, to the affection of the
Regent for his wife; and he consequently urged
Leonora to induce the Queen to purchase for him
the town of Ancre in Picardy, whose possession
would invest him with the title of marquis, and
assure to him the consideration due to that rank.
Madame de Concini accordingly proffered her
request, which was conceded without difficulty; for
Marie was at that moment, to adopt the expression
of Richelieu, keeping her hands open; and this
purchase formed a comparatively unimportant item
in her lavish grants. Encouraged by so facile a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page089" id="page089"></a>[pg 089]</span>
success, the Italian adventurer was, however, by no
means disposed to permit even this coveted dignity
to satisfy his ambition, and through the same agency
he ere long became Governor of Pronne, Roye,
and Montdidier, which he purchased from M. de
Crquy for the sum of forty thousand crowns. The
Queen had been induced to furnish an order upon
the royal treasury for this amount, which was presented
without any misgiving by the exulting
favourite; but M. de Villeroy, who considered himself
to have been slighted on some occasion by her
Majesty, refused to countersign the document, an
opposition which so enraged Concini that he
hastened to pour out his complaints to Marie; who,
overcome by the wrath of the husband and the
tears of the wife, summoned the Duc de Sully, of
whom she inquired if it were not possible to procure
the requisite amount by having recourse to the
money lodged at the Arsenal. Sully replied in the
negative, declaring that the sums therein deposited
were not available for such a purpose, and reminding
her that seven millions of livres had already been
withdrawn since the death of the King.<a id="footnotetag075" name="footnotetag075"></a><a href="#footnote075">[75]</a> It was,
consequently, necessary to raise the desired purchase-money
by other means, which having been at length
effected, Concini found himself not only placed by
his court-appointment on a par with the peers of the
realm, but also enabled, by the munificence of the
Regent, and the revenues of his new government,
to rival them in magnificence.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page090" id="page090"></a>[pg 090]</span>

<p>Then it was that his talent for intrigue boldly
developed itself. In vain did his wife warn him of
the danger of further forcing his fortunes, and thus
drawing down upon himself the hatred and envy of
the native nobility; in vain did she represent that
by indulging his passion for power and display he
must eventually create enemies who were certain to
prove fatal to his prosperity; Concini, as weak and
vain as he was greedy and ambitious, disregarded
her advice, and strenuously turned his attention to
fomenting a misunderstanding among the most
influential of the nobles, in order to prevent a coalition
which threatened to diminish his own importance.
He was well aware of his unpopularity with
the Princes of the Blood, who could not without
indignation see themselves compelled to treat with
him almost upon equal terms, protected as he was
by the favour of the Queen; and he consequently
lived in perpetual apprehension of their forming a
cabal to effect his ruin. Skilfully, therefore, with a
smiling countenance, but an anxious heart, he
availed himself of every opportunity to foment the
jealousies and hatreds which policy had for a brief
while laid to rest. To each and all he appeared
zealous in their several interests, but to each and all
he was alike a traitor.</p>

<p>Nature had been lavish to Concini; his person
was well-formed and graceful, while his countenance
beamed with intelligence, and gave promise of far
greater intellect than he in reality possessed. It
was this handsomeness which had inspired Leonora
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page091" id="page091"></a>[pg 091]</span>
Galiga with a passion that was destined to be her
destruction, for no doubt can be entertained that had
she never become his wife her career might have
been one of happiness and honour; but while
Concini, absorbed in his wild schemes of self-aggrandizement,
trampled upon every consideration
of honour and honesty in order to attain his object,
Leonora, conscious of her own want of personal
attractions, and loving her husband with a devotion
made up of gratitude and admiration, suffered herself
to be overruled by his vanity and arrogance,
and sacrificed her reason and her judgment to her
affection.</p>

<p>The Marchal de Bouillon having failed in his
attempt to induce M. de Cond to revolt against the
authority of the Regent, by one of those sudden
transitions of feeling which formed so strange a
feature in his character, next sought to reconcile
that Prince and the Duc de Guise, who were already
at feud upon the prerogatives of their rank; and he
began to anticipate a successful issue to his enterprise,
when the ministers, being apprehensive that a
good understanding among the Princes of the Blood
would tend to weaken their own influence over the
Regent, gave him to understand that should M. de
Cond and the Due de Guise become firm friends,
his personal importance in the country would be
greatly lessened, if not entirely overthrown. This
argument was all-sufficient with the ambitious and
intriguing Bouillon, who forthwith began to slacken
in his exertions to restore peace. But these had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page092" id="page092"></a>[pg 092]</span>
already proceeded so far as to render his position
extremely embarrassing; and between his apprehension
of sacrificing his own interest on the one hand,
and of incurring suspicion upon the other, he was
somewhat at a loss how to proceed, when the adroit
interference of Concini, who deprecated the coalition
of the Princes as much as the ministers themselves,
furnished fresh fuel to the expiring flame, and
widened the chasm between them more hopelessly
than ever; and that, moreover, with such dexterity,
that M. de Bouillon never suspected what friendly
hand had come to his aid; although the Italian
favourite did not fail to propitiate the haughty
Duke by every means in his power, and so
thoroughly succeeded in flattering his vanity, and
encouraging his ambitious aspirations, that, anxious
to secure the interest and assistance of so influential
a person as the husband of the Queen's foster-sister
and confidential friend, M. de Bouillon was induced
to sell to him his office of First Lord of the Bedchamber;
a circumstance which at once secured a
permanent footing at Court to Concini, and opened
before him a long vista of prosperity.<a id="footnotetag076" name="footnotetag076"></a><a href="#footnote076">[76]</a></p>

<p>One of the first decisions arrived at by the
Regent was the completion of all the public edifices
commenced by the late King, and the erection of
such as he had resolved upon, but had not lived to
commence; an admirable act of policy by which she
at once evinced her respect for the memory of her
husband, and procured employment for hundreds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page093" id="page093"></a>[pg 093]</span>
workmen, who must otherwise have been severe
sufferers from want of occupation. Those which
were originated under her auspices were the castle
of Vincennes and the Royal College, the latter of
which she caused to be built strictly according to the
design executed by Henry himself; and the first
stone was laid on the 28th of August by the young
King, assisted by his whole Court. It bore the
arms of France and Medicis, and beneath them was
inscribed in deeply-chiselled characters: "In the
first year of the reign of Louis XIII, King of
France and Navarre, aged nine years, and of the
regency of the Queen Marie de Medicis his mother,
1610." Four medals, bearing the same inscription,
two of gold, and two of silver gilt, having been
placed at the corners of the stone, which was then
lowered, the Due de Sully presented the silver
trowel, while two of the attendant nobles alternately
offered the hammer and the silver trough containing
the mortar.</p>

<p>During the following month the Queen herself
performed the same ceremony at Vincennes, respecting
the fortress, and the magnificent tower
built by Charles VII, but erecting beneath its
shadow a commodious residence on the space which
had heretofore been cumbered with a mass of unsightly
buildings, totally unsuitable for the reception
of a Court.<a id="footnotetag077" name="footnotetag077"></a><a href="#footnote077">[77]</a></p>

<p>The Due de Mayenne, although suffering from
severe indisposition, had hastened to offer his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page094" id="page094"></a>[pg 094]</span>
services to the Regent; who, recognizing his ability,
and grateful for the zeal which he evinced in her
interests, expressed all the gratification that she
felt at his prompt and earnest offers of aid; which
he moreover followed up with such untiring
perseverance that he caused himself to be conveyed
every day to the Louvre in his chair, in
order to discuss with her Majesty the various
measures necessary to the peace and welfare of the
state. Above all he exhorted her to restrain her
munificence, by which not only the Treasury fund,
but also the revenues of the country could not fail
ere long to be dangerously affected; representing to
her the indecency of those who, profiting by the
calamity with which France had so suddenly been
stricken, were endeavouring to build up their own
fortunes upon the misfortune of the nation, and
who were aspiring to honours suited only to such as
by their high birth and princely rank were imperatively
called upon to uphold the dignity of the Crown.
This argument was warmly seconded by Sully,
Villeroy, and Jeannin; but Marie had already suffered
so deeply from the arrogance and presumption
of the nobles that she was anxious to purchase their
support, and her own consequent tranquillity, however
exorbitant might be the demands of those about
her; and, accordingly, scarcely a day passed in
which fresh claimants did not present themselves,
while the original recipients remained still unsatisfied.<a id="footnotetag078" name="footnotetag078"></a><a href="#footnote078">[78]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page095" id="page095"></a>[pg 095]</span>

<p>It was not long ere the parties most interested in
these donations became aware of the attempt made
to limit the liberality of the Queen, and they did
not affect to disguise their indignation at what they
designated as an interference with their just claims.
It appeared to have grown into an admitted opinion
that all who had not revolted against her authority
should be recompensed for their forbearance, as
though it had been some signal service rendered to
the state; and immediate deliberations were held as
to the best measures to be adopted in order to
silence the prudent counsels to which she could not
finally fail to yield. As regarded the Duc de
Mayenne, he was beyond the reach of the cabal;
while Jeannin and Villeroy could oppose nothing
save words; with Sully, however, the case was
widely different; he was not only finance minister,
but also keeper of the royal treasury, and his fearless
and sturdy nature was so well understood and
appreciated, that none who knew him doubted for
an instant that should the Regent persevere in her
generosity in opposition to his advice, he would
not hesitate to adopt the most extreme measures
to limit her power in the disposal of the public
funds.</p>

<p>Sully, meanwhile, like a generous adversary, had
not only endeavoured to restrain the liberality of the
Queen, but had even ventured to expostulate with
many of the applicants upon the ruinous extravagance
of their demands; a proceeding which was
resented by several of the great nobles, and by none
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page096" id="page096"></a>[pg 096]</span>
more deeply than the Prince de Cond, who was
upheld in his pretensions by his adherents, all of
whom alleged that as the royal treasury was daily
suffering diminution, and must soon become entirely
exhausted, he had a right to claim, as first Prince of
the Blood, the largest portion of its contents after
their Majesties. They also reminded him of the
offices and honours of which he had been despoiled
by the late King, when he would not consent to
retain them as the price of his disgrace; and, finally,
they bade him not to lose sight of the fact that
liberal as the Queen-Regent might have appeared
on his return to France, he did not yet possess the
revenues necessary to maintain his dignity as the
first subject in the realm. M. de Cond was
haughty and ambitious, and he consequently lent a
willing ear to these representations; nor was it long
ere he became equally convinced that his power was
balanced by that of Sully; that a Bourbon was
measured with a Bthune; a Prince of the Blood
with a <i>parvenu</i> minister; and that such must continue
to be the case so long as he permitted money
to be poised against influence.</p>

<p>The effect of these insidious counsels soon made
itself apparent in the altered manner of the Prince
towards the man whom he had thus been taught to
consider as the enemy of his greatness; for although
he endeavoured to conceal his growing dislike, his
nature was too frank, and moreover too impetuous,
to second his policy; and Sully, on his side, was far
too quick-sighted to be easily duped on so important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page097" id="page097"></a>[pg 097]</span>
a matter. The resolution of the Duke was therefore
instantly formed; eager as he had been for
office under the late King, he had, at the death of
that monarch, ceased to feel or to exhibit the same
energy. He already saw many of the favourite
projects of Henry negatived; much of his advice
disregarded; and as he looked into the future he
taught himself to believe that he contemplated only
a long vista of national decline and personal disappointment.
While he had preserved the confidence
and affection of his sovereign, he had held
popularity lightly, too lightly it may be, for he was
conscious of his strength, and scorned to seek for
support where he believed that he ought only to
afford it; but the knife of Ravaillac had changed the
whole tenor of his existence: he saw that he was
regarded with suspicion and distrust by those who
envied the greatness which he had achieved; that
however the Queen might veil her real feelings in
the garb of esteem and kindness, she shrank from
the uncompromising frankness of his disapproval,
and the resolute straightforwardness of his remonstrances;
that his desire to economize the resources
of the country rendered him obnoxious to the greedy
courtiers; and that his past favour tended to inspire
jealousy and misgiving in those with whom he was
now called upon to act. He was, moreover, no
longer young; his children were honourably established;
and, whatever it may have accorded with
the policy of his enemies to assume, there can be no
doubt that M. de Sully was perfectly sincere in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page098" id="page098"></a>[pg 098]</span>
desire which he at this period expressed to retire
from the cares and responsibilities of office to the
comfort and tranquillity of private life. That such a
resolution was most unpalatable to the Duchess is
equally certain; but Sully nevertheless persisted in
his intention, and even announced his proposed
resignation to the Regent, entreating at the same
time that she would not oppose the measure.</p>

<p>The moment was one of extreme difficulty for
Marie. On all sides she was pursued by complaints
of the finance minister, whose want of deference
wounded the pride of the Princes, while the ministers
reproached him with an undue assertion of authority,
and the nobles murmured at his interference in
matters unconnected with his official character. The
Marquis d'Ancre and his wife were, moreover,
among the most bitter of his enemies, and at this
precise period their influence was all-sufficient with
the Queen, who had so accustomed herself to be
guided by their advice, and led by their prejudices,
that they had obtained a predominance over her mind
which invested them with a factitious power against
which few ventured to contend. She endeavoured,
nevertheless, to temporize, for she was aware of the
absolute necessity of securing the services of Sully
until he could be satisfactorily replaced; and although
there were not wanting many about her who would
readily have undertaken to supersede him in his
ministry, Marie herself doubted that, wherever her
selection of a successor might be made, its duties
would be as efficiently fulfilled. She was, moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page099" id="page099"></a>[pg 099]</span>
at that particular time earnestly occupied with the
preparations necessary for the coronation of her son,
and the retirement of Sully could not fail to involve
her in embarrassment and difficulty; she consequently
sought to conciliate the veteran minister,
expressed her resentment at the annoyances of which
he complained, declared her perfect satisfaction with
everything that he had done since the recognition of
her regency, and finally entreated him to take time
and to reflect calmly upon the subject before he
pressed her to accede to his request.</p>

<p>Sully complied with her wishes, but he did so
without the slightest feeling of exultation. He was
convinced that his favour was undermined and his
removal from office already determined, and he
accordingly experienced no sensation of self-gratulation
at the expressed reluctance of the Queen to
deprive herself of the oldest and ablest servant of
her late consort. He was, perhaps, proud of being
so acknowledged, but he was also aware that what
he had been to the murdered King he could never
hope to become to the Regent, who had already
suffered herself to be governed by greedy sycophants
and ambitious favourites.</p>

<p>The most important subject which occupied the
Council at the commencement of the Regency was
the question of the expediency or non-expediency of
pursuing the design of the late King relative to the
duchies of Juliers and Clves. During the time
which had elapsed since the levy of the French
troops the several pretenders to the succession had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
not been idle, and hostile measures had already been
adopted. The Catholic Princes of Germany were
opposed to the claims of the Protestant party, the
Dutch and the Spaniards siding with the former and
the English with the latter; several towns had
already been taken by each faction, and the virulence
displayed on both sides threatened the infraction
of the truce with Flanders, if not a universal war
throughout Christendom. Nevertheless, the general
voice was against any interference on the part of
France, the ministers being anxious to avoid an outlay
which under the then circumstances of the kingdom
they deemed alike useless and impolitic, while
the nobles, fearing to lose the advantages which each
promised himself by confining the attention of the
Queen to the internal economy of the state, came to
the same decision. Sillery alone combated this resolution,
declaring that as the protection of the Princes
who had appealed to him for aid had been one of the
last projects of the late King, his will should be held
sacred and his intentions fully carried out.</p>

<p>To this declaration, which produced an evident
effect upon the Regent, Sully replied by asserting
that in order to have done this effectually, and with
the dignity worthy of a great nation, the French
troops should long ago have taken the field; whereas
they had been suffered to remain so long inactive
that their interference was no longer required, and
could only be regarded by all parties as superfluous,
the Prince of Orange having so skilfully invested the
city of Juliers that it would be impossible for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
enemy to make any effectual resistance; while Austria
remained perfectly inactive, evidently considering
the struggle at an end.<a id="footnotetag079" name="footnotetag079"></a><a href="#footnote079">[79]</a> The argument of the
Chancellor had, however, decided the Queen, who
exclaimed vehemently: "Say no more; I will
never abandon the allies of the French Crown; and
you have now, gentlemen, only to decide upon what
general it will be expedient to confer the command
of the campaign." <a id="footnotetag080" name="footnotetag080"></a><a href="#footnote080">[80]</a></p>

<p>The Duc de Bouillon, on ascertaining the decision
of the Regent, immediately advanced his claim. He
had already become weary of the Court, and he was,
moreover, anxious to obtain some employment which
might form an honourable pretext for his departure
before the approaching coronation of the King, at
which he could not assist owing to his religious principles.
This difference of faith, however, determined
the Council to decline his services, his ambition and
spirit of intrigue being so notorious as to render it
inexpedient to entrust him with a command of so
much importance, and one which must, moreover,
bring him into constant contact with his co-religionists;
a refusal by which he was so much mortified
that he made immediate preparations for retiring to
Sedan.<a id="footnotetag081" name="footnotetag081"></a><a href="#footnote081">[81]</a> The choice of the Council ultimately fell
upon the Marchal de la Chtre,<a id="footnotetag082" name="footnotetag082"></a><a href="#footnote082">[82]</a> who was appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
chief and lieutenant-general of the King's army, consisting
of twelve thousand infantry and two thousand
horse.</p>

<p>The brave old soldier was not, however, fated on
this occasion to add to his well-earned laurels, the
words of Sully having been verified to the letter.
Juliers was invested in the beginning of August,
and on the 18th of the same month, when the
French troops arrived before the city, the Prince of
Orange had already made himself master of the fortress;
and although the Imperial general gallantly
persisted in his defence, he found himself at its close
compelled to capitulate, being no longer able to resist
the cannonade of the enemy, who had effected an
irreparable breach in one of the walls, by which they
poured an unceasing fire into the streets of the
town.</p>

<p>The capitulation was signed on the 1st of September,
and executed on the morrow, after which M.
de la Chtre and his forces returned to France, and
the different Princes who had been engaged in the
campaign retired to their several states.<a id="footnotetag083" name="footnotetag083"></a><a href="#footnote083">[83]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Court of Paris was rapidly becoming
a scene of anarchy and confusion. The Prince
de Conti and the Comte de Soissons were alike
candidates for the government of Normandy, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
the Regent, from its importance and the physical
disqualifications of the Prince, conferred, despite the
solicitations of Madame de Conti, upon M. de Soissons;
and she had no sooner come to this decision
than the two Princes were at open feud, supported
by their several partisans, and the streets of the
capital were the theatre of constant violence and
uproar. The Duc d'Epernon, who was the open
ally of the Count, on his side supported M. de Soissons
in order to counterbalance the influence of the
Prince de Conti and the Guises; an unfortunate circumstance
for Marie, who had so unguardedly
betrayed her gratitude for his prompt and zealous
services at the first moment of her affliction, that the
vain and ambitious Duke had profited by the circumstance
to influence her opinions and measures so
seriously as to draw down the most malicious suspicions
of their mutual position, suspicions to which
the antecedents of M. d'Epernon unhappily lent only
too much probability.<a id="footnotetag084" name="footnotetag084"></a><a href="#footnote084">[84]</a></p>

<p>In addition to this open and threatening misunderstanding
between two of the first Princes of the
Blood, a new danger was created by the imprudence
of the same noble, who, presuming upon his newly-acquired
importance, uttered the most violent and
menacing expressions against the Protestants, declaring
that they had been tolerated too long, and that it
would soon become necessary to reduce them to a
proper sense of their insignificance; an opinion which
he had no sooner uttered than the Marquis d'Ancre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
in his turn assured the Regent that if she desired to
secure a happy and prosperous reign to her son, she
had no alternative but to forbid the exercise of the
reformed religion, to whose adherents the late King
had owed his death.<a id="footnotetag085" name="footnotetag085"></a><a href="#footnote085">[85]</a></p>

<p>Conscious of the cabal which was organizing
against them, and having been apprised that M.
d'Epernon had doubled the number of his guards,
the Ducs de Bouillon, de Guise, and de Sully adopted
similar precautions, and even kept horses ready
saddled in their stables in order to escape upon the
instant should they be threatened with violence.
The minor nobility followed the example of their
superiors, and soon every htel inhabited by men of
rank resembled a fortress, while the streets resounded
with the clashing of arms and the trampling of horses,
to the perpetual terror of the citizens.</p>

<p>Coupled with these purely personal feuds others
were generated of an official nature, no less subversive
of public tranquillity. M. de Villeroy had
purchased the government of Lyons from the Duc
de Vendme, for his son the Comte d'Alincourt,
having at the same time disposed of the appointment
of Lieutenant of the King previously held by the
Count, and this arrangement was no sooner concluded
than he resolved to solicit from the Queen a
force of three hundred Swiss Guards to garrison the
city; a demand in which he succeeded in interesting
Concini, and to which he consequently anticipated
no opposition on her part. He was correct in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
conclusion, but the sole consent of the Regent did
not suffice upon so important a question, which it
was necessary to submit to the consideration of the
Council, where it was accordingly mooted. Sully,
although previously solicited by the Queen to support
the proposal, resolutely refused to do so, alleging
that he would never consent to see the King subjected
to an outlay of twelve hundred thousand livres
in order to enable M. d'Alincourt to pocket one
hundred thousand, and that Lyons, by the treaty
concluded with the Duke of Savoy, had ceased to be
a frontier town, and consequently required no garrison.
This reply, which made considerable impression
upon Marie, she repeated to M. de Villeroy, who
retorted, loud enough to be heard by a friend of
Sully, that he was aware the Spaniards and Savoyards
were no longer to be feared, and that it was consequently
not against them that he was anxious to secure
the city of Lyons, but that the real enemies whom she
had to fear were the Huguenots, who were at that
moment better situated, more prepared, and probably
also more inclined to oppose her authority than they
had ever before been. This intemperate and ill-judged
speech was instantly reported to Sully, who,
rising indignantly from his seat, approached the
Queen and audibly informed her that he considered
it his duty to remark that, as in order to
render her favourable to the demand of his son, M.
de Villeroy had not scrupled to malign the Protestants,
but had designated them as more dangerous
enemies to herself and to the state than those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
were labouring to further the interests of Spain, he
only entreated her to afford to his denial the same
weight as that which she attached to the assertion
of the State Secretary, and by placing both upon the
same footing exclude them equally from the Council,
to which neither could any longer advance a claim
for admittance. To this bold and public accusation
M. de Villeroy attempted no reply, but thenceforward
the two ministers no longer maintained even a semblance
of amity.<a id="footnotetag086" name="footnotetag086"></a><a href="#footnote086">[86]</a></p>

<p>Hitherto M. de Cond had taken no part in the
dissensions which were going on about him, but on
the night of the 10th of July he in his turn received
a warning to be upon his guard, and in consequence
he caused a strong patrol to keep watch on all sides
of his palace. Not an hour passed in which the
gallop of a party of horsemen was not heard clattering
over the rough and ill-paved streets. At midnight
the Marquis d'Ancre waited upon the Prince
to convey to him an invitation from the Regent to
take up his abode in the Louvre should he not consider
himself safe in his own house, but M. de Cond
coldly declined to avail himself of the offer, alleging
that the manner in which her Majesty had replied
on the previous day, when he had informed her of
his having been assured of her intention to cause his
arrest, had given him no encouragement to become her
guest; an answer which by no means tended to relieve
the increasing apprehensions of the Queen, who felt
the necessity of appeasing at any sacrifice the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
discontent of the Princes. She accordingly desired the
presence of M. de Cond at the Louvre, a summons
which he reluctantly obeyed; and it was long before
the urbanity of her welcome assured him of the sincerity
with which she entreated him to endeavour in
her name to conciliate the Prince de Conti, who, on
the refusal of the coveted government, had quitted
Paris in disgust, and to induce his return to the
Court.</p>

<p>It was not the fashion of that period even for
Princes of the Blood to make concessions whence
they derived no personal benefit, and it was accordingly
without any compunction that M. de Cond
declared the terms upon which he would undertake
the proposed mission. He was to receive as recompense
for his condescension the sum of fifty thousand
crowns, with the first government which should
become vacant, and was authorized to promise two
hundred thousand crowns to the Duc de Guise for
the payment of his debts, as well as several lesser
sums to others of the Princes, on condition that they
should return to their allegiance and forego their
personal animosities.</p>

<p>These preliminary arrangements concluded, M.
de Cond hastened to represent to his uncle the
necessity of his immediate return to Paris before the
departure of the King for Rheims, whither he was
about to proceed for his coronation; and the Prince
de Conti having with considerable difficulty been
induced to comply with his request, the princely relatives
entered the capital with so numerous a retinue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
of nobles and gentlemen that it excited general
remark.</p>

<p>On the following day the two Princes, similarly
attended, and accompanied by the Duc de Guise
and M. de Joinville, proceeded to the Parliament,
where they took their accustomed seats; but neither
M. de Soissons nor the Duc d'Epernon were present,
the first pretexting indisposition and the second declining
to adduce any reason for his absence.<a id="footnotetag087" name="footnotetag087"></a><a href="#footnote087">[87]</a></p>

<p>On the 27th the Marquis d'Ancre was admitted
into the Council of State, and took the customary
oaths at the Louvre; but he received few congratulations
on this new honour, the arrogance in which
he indulged tending to disgust the higher nobles,
and to alarm those who had reason to deprecate his
daily-increasing influence.</p>

<p>Both M. de Bouillon and the Duc de Sully, professing
the reformed religion, were ineligible to
officiate at the coronation of the sovereign, and they
accordingly received the royal permission to absent
themselves, by which both hastened to profit, but
from very different motives. Sully, who was well
aware that he must either voluntarily resign his
governmental dignities or submit to see them
wrenched from him, proceeded to his estate at
Montrond with the firm intention of never returning
to the capital; a resolve which he was, however,
subsequently induced to forego by the entreaty of
the Queen that he would continue to afford to her
son the same good service as he had done to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>
late King his father, coupled with assurances of her
firm confidence in his zeal and fidelity; while
Bouillon prepared to resume his attempts to reconcile
the Princes, by which means he hoped to
overthrow the Regency and to secure to himself a
prominent position in the government of the kingdom.
This effort was, however, destined to fail, too
many interests adverse to any such coalition being
involved in the question to enable him to carry out
his project; and he accordingly departed for Sedan,
where he forthwith began to excite the Huguenots
to discontent, representing that they would never
have a more favourable opportunity for enforcing
their rights than at a moment when the nation was
shaken to its centre by the assassination of the King,
and during the minority of his successor. This
argument produced, as he had anticipated, a powerful
effect upon the minds of his co-religionists, to
whom he also expatiated on the repugnance with
which the Regent conferred place or power upon a
Protestant, whatever might be his personal merit.
In conclusion he urged them to demand a general
assembly, a proposition to which they readily acceded,
and with the greater willingness that the time
allowed to them for this purpose by the edict of
1597 would expire at the close of the year.<a id="footnotetag088" name="footnotetag088"></a><a href="#footnote088">[88]</a></p>

<p>Thus the weight of government pressed heavily
upon Marie both from within and without; and meanwhile
the young King began to betray symptoms
of that suspicious and saturnine temper by which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
was afterwards so unhappily distinguished. On one
occasion when all the efforts of Pre Cotton, his confessor,
had failed to overcome his gloom and reserve,
the priest inquired in a tone of interest the nature of
the annoyance by which he was thus oppressed. "I
shall not tell you," was the resolute reply; "for you
will immediately write to Spain to inform them."</p>

<p>The confessor, whose intimate connection with
the ministers of Philip had rendered him obnoxious
to the French people, was startled by this unexpected
answer, and immediately complained to the Queen
of the affront that had been offered to him; upon
which Marie summoned the offender, and insisted
upon his immediately informing her who had dared
to suggest such an idea, when with considerable
reluctance the boy-King stated that his nurse had
warned him to be cautious because the reverend
father was in correspondence with that country.</p>

<p>"Since she permits herself to play the politician,"
said the Queen, "she shall be dismissed."</p>

<p>"Be it so," retorted the young Prince; "but,"
turning towards the Jesuit, "I shall remember that
it was his work, and I shall not always be a child."</p>

<p>A short time subsequently, while playing with a
favourite fawn, he hid himself among the shrubs in
the gardens of the Tuileries, and remained so long in
his concealment that his attendants became alarmed
and were compelled to inform the Queen that although
they had sought the King everywhere, to entreat
him to return, they could not ascertain where he had
gone. Marie in great alarm caused all around her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
to join in the search, while she remained at one of
the windows in a state of agonizing anxiety. At
length the retreat of the fugitive was found, and M.
de Souvr threatened him with the rod.</p>

<p>"As you please," he said sullenly; "but if, in
order to satisfy the Queen, you lay a hand upon me
to-day, I will keep up appearances with you, but I
will never forget it." <a id="footnotetag089" name="footnotetag089"></a><a href="#footnote089">[89]</a></p>

<p>Only a few days subsequently (2nd of October)
Louis XIII, attended by his Court, proceeded to
Rheims for his coronation, the royal ornaments used
upon such occasions having been removed from St.
Denis to that city. The Cardinal de Joyeuse performed
the ceremony, the archiepiscopal chair being
vacant at the time; and the Princes de Cond and de
Conti, the Comte de Soissons, the Ducs de Nevers,
d'Elboeuf,<a id="footnotetag090" name="footnotetag090"></a><a href="#footnote090">[90]</a> and d'Epernon represented the ancient
Dukes of Burgundy, Normandy, and Aquitaine, and
the Counts of Toulouse, Flanders, and Champagne.</p>

<p>On the morrow the young sovereign was invested
with the Order of the Holy Ghost, which he immediately
afterwards conferred upon the Prince de
Cond, and on Tuesday the 19th he stood sponsor</p>

<p>for the child of the Baron de Tour; after which he
proceeded to St. Marcou, where he touched a number
of persons suffering under the loathsome disease
which it was the superstition of the age to believe
could be removed by contact with the royal hand.</p>

<p>On the 30th of the month the Court returned to
Paris, and was met at the Porte St. Antoine by the
civic authorities, at the head of two hundred mounted
citizens, amid a cannonade from the Bastille, and
ceaseless flourishes of trumpets and hautboys. The
Regent had, however, preceded her son to the city,
and stood in a balcony at the house of Zamet to
see him pass, where he no sooner perceived her
than he withdrew his plumed cap, which he did not
resume until having halted beneath the window he
had saluted her with a profound bow. He then proceeded
by torchlight to the Louvre, accompanied
throughout his progress by the same acclamations
of loyalty and enthusiasm as had greeted the ears of
his dead father only a few months previously.</p>

<p>It had been a great relief to Marie de Medicis
that before the departure of the Court for Rheims
a reconciliation had been effected between the Prince
de Cond and the Comte de Soissons; but her
tranquillity was not destined to last, the attendants
of the Cardinal de Joyeuse and those of the Marquis
d'Ancre having had a violent altercation during the
journey on the subject of the accommodation provided
for their respective employers; and this quarrel
was no sooner appeased than the new-made Marquis
originated another with the Duc de Bellegarde,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>
alleging that as First Lord of the Bedchamber he
had a right to take precedence of the Duke, who was
Grand Equerry of France. M. de Bellegarde, irritated
by this presumption, complained loudly of the
affront, and was supported in his indignation by the
Duc d'Epernon and by the Comte de Soissons, who
was becoming weary of the Italian adventurer.</p>

<p>Even the Queen herself could neither support nor
justify such undue pretensions; and M. d'Ancre,
reluctantly convinced that he had on this occasion
swooped at too high a quarry, swallowed his mortification
as best he might, and endeavoured to redeem
his error; an attempt in which he was seconded by
the Queen, in obedience to whose wishes M. le
Grand somewhat contemptuously consented to forego
any further demonstration of his resentment; while
the Duc d'Epernon agreed, with even more facility,
to follow his example. The Comte de Soissons was
not, however, so easily to be appeased; and he
accordingly, with the ever-wakeful policy for which
he was proverbial, made his reconciliation with the
mortified Marquis conditional upon his promise of
assistance in his two darling projects of obtaining
the hand of the heiress of Montpensier for his son
the Comte d'Enghien, and of accomplishing the ruin
of the Duc de Sully.</p>

<p>At this crisis the finance minister could ill afford
to see a new antagonist enter the lists against him,
surrounded as he already was by enemies eager for
his overthrow. The Prince de Cond had neither
forgotten nor forgiven his advice to Henri IV to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
order his arrest when he fled to Flanders to protect
the honour of his wife; the Duc de Bouillon was
jealous of his interest with the Huguenot party;
while the Chancellor, Villeroy, and Jeannin were
leagued against him, in order to support their own
authority. To Concini, moreover, his very name
was odious, and consequently the new adversary
who had thus been evoked against him was the
most dangerous of all, inasmuch as he was the most
subtle and vindictive, and also because he possessed
the ear of the Queen, who had so long accustomed
herself to support him against what he saw fit to
entitle the oppression of the French nobles, that she
had ceased to question the validity of his accusations.
The religion of Sully also tended to indispose the
Queen towards him. Herself a firm adherent of
the Church of Rome, she looked with an eye of
suspicion upon a minister whose faith differed from
her own; and this circumstance operated powerfully
in adding weight to the accusations of his enemies.
The Prince de Cond alone for a time refused to
sanction the efforts which were made to ensure his
political ruin, but he was in his turn eventually
enlisted in the cause by the prospect which was held
out to him of sharing in the profits resulting from
the confiscation of the minister's public property; his
retirement from office necessarily involving his resignation
of all the lucrative appointments which he
held under the Government.<a id="footnotetag091" name="footnotetag091"></a><a href="#footnote091">[91]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
It was at this precise moment that the Huguenots
petitioned the Regent for the general assembly, as
advised by the Due de Bouillon; a circumstance
which could not have failed to prove fatal to the
interests of Sully had he still desired to retain office,
as the comments of the anti-Protestant party by
which she was surrounded, seconded by her own
personal feelings, tended to exasperate Marie against
all who professed the reformed faith. She consequently
received the appeal with considerable
asperity, declaring that it was impossible to calculate
the demands which would be made upon the indulgence
of the Crown, although there was no doubt
that they would prove both unjust and extravagant;
but being unable to refuse to confirm the provisions
of the edict, she finally instructed the ministers to
suggest delay as the best means of delivering herself
for a time from the consequences of compliance.</p>

<p>In this attempt she, however, failed; the Duc de
Bouillon being well aware that should the prescribed
period be suffered to elapse without some pledge
upon the part of the Government, the demand would
be evaded by a declaration that the allotted time was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>
past; and accordingly the Protestants persisted in
their claim with so much pertinacity that the Regent
found herself compelled to authorize their meeting
at Saumur in the course of the ensuing year.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is scarcely matter of
surprise that despite the opposition of the finance
minister, M. de Villeroy succeeded in effecting the
establishment of a garrison at Lyons; and the
misunderstanding was shortly afterwards renewed
between the two functionaries by a demand on the
part of the State Secretary that the maintenance of
the troops should be defrayed from the general
receipts of the city. The Orientals have a proverb
which says, "it is the last fig that breaks the camel's
back," and thus it was with Sully. Exasperated by
this new invasion of his authority, he lost his temper;
and after declaring that the citizens of Lyons were
at that moment as competent to protect themselves as
they had ever been, and that it was consequently
unreasonable to inflict so useless an outlay upon the
King, he accused the Chancellor, who had favoured
the pretensions of Villeroy, of leaguing with him to
ruin the Crown; a denunciation which, as it equally
affected all the other ministers who had espoused
the same cause, sealed his own overthrow.<a id="footnotetag092" name="footnotetag092"></a><a href="#footnote092">[92]</a></p>

<p>Satisfied of a fact so self-evident, Sully resolved
no longer to breast the torrent of jealousy and
hatred against which he found himself called upon
to contend, but without further delay to resign at
once the cares and dignities of office; a design
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>
which was vehemently opposed not only by his
own family, but also by his co-religionists, the
whole of whom, save only such of their leaders as
had private reasons for seeking his dismissal, were
keenly sensible of the loss which their cause must
necessarily sustain from the want of his support.
The Duke, however, firmly withstood all their
expostulations; wearied and disgusted by the inefficiency
of his endeavours to protect the interests
of the sovereign against the encroachments of
extortionate nobles, and the machinations of interested
ministers, he felt no inclination to afford a
new triumph to his enemies by awaiting a formal
dismissal; and he accordingly took the necessary
measures for disposing of his superintendence of the
finances, and his government of the Bastille (the
most coveted because the most profitable of his
public offices), in order that he might be permitted
in his retirement to retain the other dignities which
he had purchased by a long life of labour and
loyalty.<a id="footnotetag093" name="footnotetag093"></a><a href="#footnote093">[93]</a></p>

<p>While this important affair was in progress, the
Duke paid a visit to M. de Rambure, during which
he said with evident uneasiness: "The Bishop of
Fenouillet was with me yesterday, and assured me
that in the morning a secret council had been held
at the residence of the Papal Nuncio, at which
were present the Chancellor, the Marquis d'Ancre,
Villeroy, the Bishop of Bziers, and the Duc
d'Epernon; and that after a great deal of unseemly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span>
discourse, in which the memory of the late King
was treated with disrespect and derision, it was
decided that everything should be changed, that
new alliances should be formed, new friendships
encouraged, and new opinions promulgated. It was,
moreover, arranged that a letter should be forthwith
sent to the Pope, informing him that it was the
intention of France to be guided in all things by his
advice, while every guarantee should be given to
the Duke of Savoy until the conclusion of a
proposed alliance with Spain; and finally, that all
persons adverse to this line of policy should be
compelled to resign their places, especially those who
professed the Protestant faith. Thus then, my
good De Rambure," he added bitterly, "if I am wise
I shall quietly dispose of my places under Government,
making as much money of them as I can,
purchase a fine estate, and retain the surplus, in
order to meet such exigencies as may arise; for I
foresee that all the faithful servants of the late King
who may refuse to defer to the authority of the
Marquis d'Ancre, will have enough upon their
hands. As for me," he pursued vehemently, "I
would rather die than degrade myself by the
slightest concession to this wretched, low-born
Italian, who is the greatest rascal of all those
concerned in the murder of the King." "Which,"
adds Rambure for himself, "he truly is." <a id="footnotetag094" name="footnotetag094"></a><a href="#footnote094">[94]</a></p>

<p>Every circumstance, moreover, conspired to
strengthen the Duc de Sully in his resolution. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
had, as we have shown, returned to the capital at the
express invitation of the Regent; but he had no
sooner arrived there than he discovered how little
his tenure of office was really desired. As, however,
both his public and private interests required his
presence in Paris for a time, he considered it
expedient to suppress his indignation, and to hasten
his arrangements, in order to be at liberty to withdraw
whenever he should be prepared to do so; and
he had accordingly no sooner recovered from the
fatigue of his journey than he proceeded to pay his
respects to the King and his august mother.</p>

<p>On reaching the Louvre he was informed that
Louis was at the Tuileries, where he would spend
the morning, and that the Regent dined at the
Htel de Zamet; upon which the Duke determined
to proceed thither, where he found her attended
by the Duc de Villeroy, Bassompierre, M. and
Madame d'Ancre, and the principal members of
her household. As Sully was announced Marie
uttered a gracious welcome, and ungloving her
hand, presented it to him to kiss; which he had
no sooner done than she assured him of her
continued regard and requested that he would talk
no more of retiring from the service of the King,
whose youth and helplessness rendered the good
offices of those who had enjoyed the confidence of
his royal father doubly necessary to himself; and
finally, despite all that had previously occurred,
the Duke took his leave almost shaken in his belief
that Marie had been induced to sanction his dismissal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>
This illusion was, moreover, encouraged by the
conduct of the courtiers, who had no sooner
ascertained the nature of his reception by the
Queen, than they flocked to the Arsenal to compliment
him upon his return to Court; and Zamet
took an opportunity of impressing upon him that he
was indebted for the undisguised favour of Marie to
the influence of the Marquis d'Ancre; who subsequently
visited him in his turn, but so visibly with
the intention of inducing him to uphold the extravagant
pretensions which he was about to
advance, that Sully did not disguise his disgust, and
they separated mutually dissatisfied.</p>

<p>On the morrow the Duke proceeded, according
to appointment, to the Louvre, where he was immediately
admitted to the private closet of Marie;
but he had scarcely crossed the threshold ere he
became aware that his contention with Concini had
induced a coldness on the part of the Regent, which
she strove in vain to conceal. She, however, made
no allusion to their interview, confining her complaints
to the extortionate importunities of the great
nobles, which she declared her resolution to resist;
and, by referring them to the Council, cause them
to be subjected to so rigorous an examination as
must tend to their diminution. She then placed in
the hands of the finance minister a list of the
demands which had been made upon her, entreating
him to assist her in opposing claims that would end,
if satisfied, by ruining the interests alike of the King
and of the nation; and she concluded by pledging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>
her royal word that she would uphold the Duke in
his opposition, as resolutely as ever he had been
supported in his former measures by the deceased
monarch. More and more bewildered by this
apparent inconsistency, Sully respectfully took
possession of the document, declaring his perfect
willingness to serve both her Majesty and the state
by every means in his power; and he then awaited
her pleasure upon other matters of more public
importance; but on all else Marie was silent, and
the disappointed minister at length withdrew
to examine the paper which had been delivered to
him, and of which we will transcribe the principal
contents as singularly illustrative of the venal state
of the Court at that period.</p>

<p>The Prince de Cond demanded the captaincy of
the fortress of Chteau-Trompette, the government
of Blaye, and the principality of Orange as far as the
bank of the Rhne; the Comte de Soissons solicited
the captaincy of the old palace of Rouen, and the
fortress of Caen, with the tax upon cloth, flax, and
hemp, which he had previously endeavoured, as
elsewhere stated, to obtain from Henri IV; the
Duc de Lorraine requested payment in full of the
whole sum specified in his treaty, although he had
previously consented to accept two-thirds of the
amount; the Duc de Guise demanded the royal
assent to his marriage with Madame de Montpensier,
the revocation of all the patent taxes in
Provence and the port of Marseilles, and the
liquidation of his debts; the Duc de Mayenne, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>
had warned the Regent to resist the extravagant
pretensions of the Princes, also came forward with a
demand for large sums independently of those
insured to him by his treaty; the Duc d'Aiguillon<a id="footnotetag095" name="footnotetag095"></a><a href="#footnote095">[95]</a>
sought to obtain a donation of thirty thousand
crowns, the governments of Bresse and the city of
Bourg, together with the embassy to Spain, and
enormous emoluments; the Prince de Joinville,
so lately an exile from the Court, requested the
government of Auvergne, or failing this, that of the
first province which should become vacant; the
Duc de Nevers asked for the entire proceeds of the
tax upon salt produced in the Rthelois, with the
governments of Mzires and Sainte-Menehould;
the Duc d'Epernon demanded the command of a
corps of infantry, to be constantly kept in an
efficient state, the survivorship of his governments
for his son, and that fortifications should be formed
at Angoulme and Saintes, with three or four other
equally important concessions; the Duc de Bouillon
sought the liquidation of some alleged debts, the
proceeds of the excise, and salt duties, and all other
imposts levied in the viscounty of Turenne, the
arrears of pay due to his garrisons, the liquidation
of all pensions which had been discontinued during
his exile, with the royal assent to a general assembly
of the Protestants; the Chancellor followed with a
demand of all the fees appertaining to the lesser seals,
that the salary of his office should be doubled, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>
that he should have letters of nobility in Normandy.
All the officers of the Crown sought an increase of
twenty-four thousand livres to their several pensions;
members of the Council, augmented emoluments;
governors of provinces, the revenues of these provinces
which had hitherto reverted to the Crown;
municipal companies, exemptions and privileges
previously unthought of; and finally, Concini, who
had arrived in the French capital only a few years
previously comparatively destitute, set forth his
requirements to be these&mdash;the <i>bton</i> of Marshal of
France, the governments of Bourg, Dieppe, and
Pont-de-l'Arche, the proceeds of the salt duties of
Languedoc, and those of the reduction accorded at
Moissets and Feydant.</p>

<p>Such, and much more of the same description,
were the contents of the documents upon which the
wrath of Sully scarcely permitted him to dwell with
patience. It was a chaos whence he dreaded even
to attempt to draw the elements of order, feeling as
he did that every concession made to one of the
parties must necessarily evoke the jealousy and
indignation of another, while it was utterly impossible,
and would, moreover, be dangerously
impolitic in any case, to satisfy the pretensions of
all. The enormous sums produced by the imposts,
whose transfer from the Crown to individuals was
thus unblushingly demanded, would have rendered
the Princes to whom they might be granted more
wealthy than many of the petty sovereigns of
Europe; while the governments and provinces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>
sought to be obtained by others must inevitably make
them independent of the King, and thus place the
subjects who should have been the support of the
throne in direct rivalry with their sovereign. The
finance minister was aghast; and the more earnestly
he considered the subject, the more he became convinced
that there was no alternative save to negative
all these egregious claims <i>en masse</i>; a conviction
which satisfied him that by fearlessly adopting this
course, his tenure of office would, had he still desired
to contend with the cabal which had already been
formed against him, become utterly impossible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Sully did not shrink from what he
considered an imperative duty; and accordingly he
resolved no longer to trust the lip-deep assurances
by which he had been beguiled since his return to
Court, but immediately to declare his resignation of
office, and to follow it up by the most resolute and
determined opposition.<a id="footnotetag096" name="footnotetag096"></a><a href="#footnote096">[96]</a></p>

<p>He had no sooner, therefore, irrevocably arrived
at this decision, than he addressed a letter to the
Regent, in which he requested her permission to
retire from the Government; and, satisfied that his
suit must prove successful, he calmly awaited her
reply. Meanwhile, resolved that no reproach should
be cast upon him after his departure, he demanded
an audience of the King, in order to explain to him
the exact state of the royal treasury, and the manner
in which its contents had been diminished since the
demise of his royal father; but as a private interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>
with a mere child would not have satisfactorily
sufficed to accomplish this object, Sully
produced his papers before all the members of
the royal household; and while engaged in the
necessary explanation, he remarked that the antiquated
fashion of his costume, which he had not
changed for years, had excited the hilarity of the
younger courtiers. He suddenly paused, and after
glancing coldly round the giddy circle, looked
fixedly at the young monarch, and said with a
dignity which chased in an instant every inclination
to mirth in the bystanders: "Sire, I am too old to
change my habits with every passing wind. When
the late King, your father of glorious memory, did
me the honour of conferring with me upon state
affairs, he was in the habit of previously clearing
the apartment of all buffoons and mountebanks." <a id="footnotetag097" name="footnotetag097"></a><a href="#footnote097">[97]</a></p>

<p>To the Princes of the Blood, the ministers of
state, and the nobles of the Court, Sully that day
added to the list of his enemies the boy-courtiers of
the royal circle.</p>

<p>Thus in heart-burning and uncertainty closed the
year which had commenced with the assassination of
the King. An arrogant and unruly aristocracy, a
divided and jealous ministry, and a harassed and
discontented population were its bitter fruits.</p>

<p>The first political event worthy of record which
occurred in France at the commencement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
year 1611 was the retirement of the Duc de Sully;
who, on the 24th of January, received the reply of
the Regent to the letter in which he had solicited
her permission to withdraw from the Government.
It contained a faintly-expressed regret at the
resolution he had taken; "but that," as he himself
says, "was merely for form's sake;" <a id="footnotetag098" name="footnotetag098"></a><a href="#footnote098">[98]</a> and the
accuracy of his judgment is evidenced by the fact
that only two days after he had again written to
declare that his determination was unalterable, the
Duc de Bouillon delivered to him the official
warrants by which he was discharged from his
duties of Superintendent of Finance, and Captain of
the Bastille. These were worded in the most
flattering terms; and he was guaranteed against all
inquiry or annoyance upon either subject from the
day in which he resigned his tenure of office. A
third warrant was, moreover, added, by which, in
consideration of his past services, the Queen
bestowed upon him the sum of three hundred thousand
livres; and a few days subsequently he
received letters from the King and the Regent
authorizing him to transfer the command of the
Bastille to M. de Chteauvieux;<a id="footnotetag099" name="footnotetag099"></a><a href="#footnote099">[99]</a> which he had no
sooner done than he turned all his attention to the
final arrangement of his public accounts, in order
that he might, with as little delay as possible, be
enabled to quit the capital.<a id="footnotetag100" name="footnotetag100"></a><a href="#footnote100">[100]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>

<p>The transfer of the Bastille was shortly afterwards
followed by that of the ministry of finance,
which was placed under the joint direction of M. de
Chteauneuf<a id="footnotetag101" name="footnotetag101"></a><a href="#footnote101">[101]</a> and the Presidents de Thou and de
Jeannin; the latter of whom was, however, invested
with the rank of Comptroller-General, which gave
him the entire management of the public funds, to
the exclusion of his colleagues, who were in consequence
only eligible to assist in the official
distribution of the public monies. The charge of
Grand Master of the Artillery, which was resigned
with the command of the Bastille by Sully, the
Regent retained in her own hands.<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a><a href="#footnote102">[102]</a></p>

<p>From that time the Marquis d'Ancre became
pre-eminent at Court; and not only the ministers,
but even the Princes of the Blood themselves, looked
with distrust upon his power over the Queen.
Between the Italian favourite and the Duc
d'Epernon especially, a feeling of hatred had grown
up, which, although as yet veiled by the policy for
which each was so distinguished, only awaited a
fitting opportunity to reveal itself on both sides;
and the struggle for power was not the less resolute
because it was carried on amid smiles and courtesies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>
Meanwhile, also, the Princes de Guise and de Lorraine
evinced symptoms of disunion, which threatened
the most serious consequences; and amid all this
chaos of conflicting interests and passions the royal
authority was treated with contempt, and Marie
began to tremble for the stability of her regency.<a id="footnotetag103" name="footnotetag103"></a><a href="#footnote103">[103]</a></p>

<p>Early in the month Concini entered upon his
duties as First Lord of the Bedchamber, and had a
serious misunderstanding with the Duc de Bellegarde,
who refused to allow him to take possession
of the apartments in the Louvre set aside for the
person holding that rank during the year in which
he was on duty, on the pretext that the Marquise
his wife being already lodged in the palace, he had
no right to claim any further accommodation.
Concini insisted on the privilege of his office, upon
which M. le Grand, to whom he had become hateful
from his arrogance and pretension, retorted in a
manner which excited his temper; and high and
bitter words were exchanged that threatened the
most serious results, when the Italian, suddenly
recollecting that he was exasperating by his violence
an enemy too powerful for him to contend against
without support, declared that he would pursue the
quarrel no further in person, but would place his
honour in the hands of the Comte de Soissons, and
abide by his decision. Against such a determination
M. de Bellegarde had, of course, nothing to urge;
and the Italian forthwith requested the Marquis de
Coeuvres, in whom M. de Soissons had great confidence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span>
to represent the affair to that Prince, and to
assure him that he would be entirely governed by
his advice.</p>

<p>The Duc d'Epernon, delighted to find that
Concini had made a new enemy, strenuously exerted
himself to induce M. le Grand to maintain his
ground, a counsel which the latter was well disposed
to follow; but the Comte de Soissons, who was
anxious to secure the influence of the Italian
Marquis that he might the more readily effect the
marriage of his son, eagerly embraced so favourable
an opportunity of purchasing his good offices; and
consequently represented in stringent terms to his
opponent the utter impracticability of refusing to
concede to M. d'Ancre the same consideration and
indulgence which had been enjoyed by his predecessors
in office, together with the danger that he
personally incurred by so gratuitously offending an
individual protected by the Regent. Whatever
additional arguments he may have advanced, it is
impossible to decide; suffice it that the Duke
yielded, the quarrel was terminated, and Concini
established in the coveted apartments; at which
his gratification was so unmeasured that he pledged
himself to M. de Soissons to induce the ministers to
consent to the union of the Comte d'Enghien with
the heiress of Montpensier, as well as to exert
himself in preventing the marriage of the Duc de
Guise and the Duchess her mother.<a id="footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a><a href="#footnote104">[104]</a></p>

<p>On the 5th of January the marriage of the Duc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
de Guise and the Duchesse de Montpensier was,
however, celebrated by the Cardinal de Joyeuse at
the early hour of four in the morning, in the chapel
attached to the htel of the lady; an arrangement
which was in all probability caused by the opposition
made to this alliance by the Comte de Soissons,
who, still anticipating a union between his son and
the daughter of the Duchess, was apprehensive that
Madame de Montpensier might be induced to enrich
the family of which she thus became a member
with no inconsiderable portion of the wealth which
must otherwise form part of the property of the
young heiress.</p>

<p>Only three days subsequently, while the Court
were still occupied with the festivities which took
place on the occasion, the Prince de Conti and his
brother M. de Soissons, who was on his way to the
Louvre, unfortunately met in a narrow street leading
to the Cross of Trahoir, when it had become so
dark that it was impossible to distinguish the
appointments or liveries of either equipage; and the
carriages were no sooner entangled than the coachman
of the Comte, ignorant of the rank of his
opponent, compelled the servants of the Prince to
make way, an insult which he resented with a
bitterness that induced him to refuse the apology
subsequently proffered by his brother.<a id="footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a><a href="#footnote105">[105]</a></p>

<p>Alarmed by this new feud, the Queen requested
the Duc de Guise to see the Prince de Conti, and
to beseech him to effect a reconciliation with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>
turbulent brother, a mission which the young Duke
cheerfully undertook; but it unfortunately happened
that in order to reach the Abbey of St. Germain,
where M. de Conti was then residing, it was
necessary for him to pass beside the Htel de
Soissons, which he accordingly did, followed by a
retinue of thirty horsemen. This circumstance was
construed into a premeditated insult by the Count,
who immediately assembled his friends, and informed
them that he had been braved in his own house by
the Duc de Guise; whose adherents had no sooner
ascertained that there was an assemblage hostile to
his interests forming at the Htel de Soissons, than
they in their turn flocked in such numbers to afford
him their support that in a short time more than a
thousand nobles were collected under his roof.</p>

<p>When this fact was communicated to M. de
Soissons he sent to request that the Prince de
Cond would accompany him to the Louvre, to
demand from the Regent that she should afford
them satisfaction for the insolence of the Duc de
Guise; who, when summoned to explain his motives
for inflicting an affront upon the Count, simply and
calmly replied that he had never sought to insult M.
de Soissons; but had, in obedience to the command
of her Majesty, been compelled to pass an angle
of his htel, which he had moreover done without a
demonstration of any description, and accompanied
only by the escort suitable to his rank. That his
sincere anxiety had been to second the wishes of
her Majesty; and that so far from seeking to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>
envenom an unfortunate misunderstanding which
could only tend to involve the Court in new disorder,
he had from the first moment resolved not to offer
an opinion upon the merits of the feud; a determination
to which he still meant to adhere.</p>

<p>This manly declaration in no degree softened the
ire of the Count; who, enchanted at having discovered
an opportunity of annoying and harassing
M. de Guise during the first week of his marriage,
retorted in a manner which impelled the Queen to
request that each would retire to his htel; and to
express at the same time her earnest hope that a
little calm reflection would induce the disputants to
become reconciled.</p>

<p>The quarrel was nevertheless sustained throughout
the whole of that and the following day; and so
great was the commotion which it excited in the
capital that the Regent, apprehending its result,
considered it necessary to order that chains should
be in readiness to be stretched across the streets,
and that the citizens should be prepared to take up
arms at a moment's notice. On the morrow new
efforts were made to pacify the irritated parties, but
all having alike failed, a detachment of the royal
guard was stationed near the person of each of the
Princes in order to ensure his safety.<a id="footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a><a href="#footnote106">[106]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Queen requested of M. de Guise,
by a confidential messenger, that he would wait
upon the Comte de Soissons, and apologize for
having inadvertently given him offence; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
proposition to which he readily consented; feeling that
such was in reality the case, and that the rank of
the Count as a Prince of the Blood demanded this
concession. Previously, however, to putting his
design into execution, he informed the Duc de
Mayenne of the promise which he had made to
comply with the desire of the Regent, when he was
instantly and vehemently dissuaded from his purpose;
M. de Mayenne representing that being himself
the party aggrieved by the groundless accusation
brought against him, he could not, without
impairing the dignity due to his position, personally
declare his regret for an act which he had
never committed. He then counselled the Duke
to place the affair in his hands, alleging with
a sophistry which it is difficult to reconcile with
reason that an apology made for him, instead of by
him, would at once answer every purpose, and spare
his own pride.</p>

<p>M. de Guise, who throughout the whole transaction
would appear to have been impatient to rid
himself of all trouble and annoyance, and consequently
careless by what means it was terminated,
readily accepted the offer; and the Duc de Mayenne
accordingly repaired to the palace, where he
informed the Queen that he was authorized by his
nephew to offer his excuses for the displeasure
which he had unconsciously given to his Highness
the Comte de Soissons; to which he begged to add
the assurance that the House of Guise, individually
and collectively, were desirous to live upon terms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>
friendship and courtesy with the Count, if he would
accept their advances in the same spirit.<a id="footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a><a href="#footnote107">[107]</a></p>

<p>Delighted by the prospect of restored peace,
Marie made no comment upon the fact that the Duc
de Guise had failed to fulfil the promise which he
had made of offering his own apology to the Prince.
She was terrified by the anarchy that had grown up
about her, and by the facility with which those who
should have been the most earnest supporters of the
dignity and safety of the Crown found means to
involve the Court in confusion and cabals; a fact
which moreover tended to place her more completely
in the power of Concini and his wife than would
probably ever have been the case under other circumstances.</p>

<p>On the 14th of January in the present year the
Regent, through the active agency of Concini, gave
her solemn consent to the marriage of the Comte
d'Enghien with Mademoiselle de Montpensier,
despite the opposition of the Cardinal de Joyeuse,
the Duc d'Epernon, and a number of the Court
nobles, who were alarmed at the prospect of so
close an alliance between M. de Soissons and the
Duc de Guise.</p>

<p>The next event of interest was the final departure
of M. de Sully from the capital, who, previously to
quitting Paris, returned to the Regent the warrant
for three hundred thousand livres with which she
had, as she declared, sought to repay his past
services. The letter by which the deed was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>
accompanied was, although perfectly respectful,
haughty, cold, and resolute: nor did the Duke make
an effort to disguise from her that the onerous
duties which he had performed to the late monarch,
to the nation, and to herself, could not be repaid by
an order upon the royal treasury; while his retirement
was voluntary, and not intended to be
contingent on any such arrangement. The Court
gossips made merry over an altercation which they
declared to have taken place between the Duke and
Duchess on the occasion of this transaction; Madame
de Sully, whose vanity was wounded by the loss of
dignity and influence consequent on the retirement
of her husband, considering this additional pecuniary
sacrifice alike idle and uncalled-for, and reproaching
him with undue haughtiness in thus refusing the
last favour which the Regent had desired to confer
upon him; and the ex-minister retorting by reminding
her that she, at least, had no cause for
complaint, since from the obscure condition of the
daughter of a petty lawyer he had elevated her to
the rank of a Duchess, and made her the companion
of Princes.<a id="footnotetag108" name="footnotetag108"></a><a href="#footnote108">[108]</a></p>

<p>When the dismissal of Sully had been decided, it
will be remembered that De Thou was one of those
appointed to succeed him in his office as a director
of finance. The appointment was not, however,
accepted; M. de Harlay, fatigued and disgusted by
the intrigues which daily grew up about him, being
anxious to resign his office of First President of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>
Parliament, which had previously been held by
Christophe de Thou, to a son so worthy of inheriting
his honours. The younger De Thou was, moreover,
his brother-in-law, and he anticipated no difficulty
in transferring his charge to that minister. Even
to the last he was, however, fated to disappointment;
for not only was this nomination opposed by the
Pope, but Villeroy, who desired to see the place
bestowed upon one of his own adherents, had
sufficient influence with the Regent to induce her
to confer it upon M. de Verdun, over whom he
possessed an unlimited control.<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a><a href="#footnote109">[109]</a></p>

<p>This affront so deeply wounded M. de Thou that
he resigned the office which he had previously held,
and even refused to obey the summons of the
Regent, conveyed to him through the Marquis
d'Ancre; alleging that she had treated him with so
much disrespect, and had subjected him to mortification
so severe, that he must decline an interview. In
vain did Concini impress upon him that the Queen
was willing to allow him to name his own successor,
and to indemnify himself as he considered just; he
would listen to no conditions. To every argument
he coldly replied: "She has treated me ill, and I
will not go."</p>

<p>"You are a philosopher," said the Italian sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I had need be one," was the calm retort;
"when I consider how I have been used."</p>

<p>Concini reported the ill-success of his mission,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>
but Marie, unfortunately blinded by those about her
to her real interests, was indifferent to the just
resentment of an able and faithful servant. "<i>Non
lo far mai</i>," was her only remark; and one of the
most efficient and zealous of her ministers was
carelessly cast off.<a id="footnotetag110" name="footnotetag110"></a><a href="#footnote110">[110]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the jealous dissensions of the nobles
continued to increase, and constant quarrels took
place between the Cardinal de Joyeuse, the Comte
de Soissons, and the Duc d'Epernon. The latter
was, at this period, detested by all other aspirants
to royal favour; his rapid success at Court had
made him insolent; and he advanced such preposterous
claims, and arrogated to himself such an
indefeasible right to the gratitude and indulgence
of the Regent, that the Princes of the Blood took
the alarm, and the Prince de Cond and the Comte
de Soissons resolved to effect his disgrace. Concini,
as we have already shown, had long nourished the
most bitter resentment against one whom he considered
as a formidable rival in the good graces of
the Queen, and he was consequently induced
without difficulty to join in the conspiracy; his
vanity suffering bitterly from the contempt with
which he was ostentatiously treated by the Duke,
who was, as the Italian asserted, a mere gentleman
of fortune like himself, until raised to his present
rank by the favour of Henri III, a favour as ill-gained
as it was unbecomingly exhibited. M.
d'Epernon, with an absence of tact as astonishing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>
it was lamentable in a man whose ambition was
unbounded, and who had no party to support his
pretensions against the Princes of the Blood, lent
himself meanwhile by his puerile and headstrong
folly to their enmity, by affecting to brave it; and
after a sharp altercation with M. de Soissons, who did
not conceal his intention of insulting him whenever
and wherever they might meet, the infatuated Duke,
on the pretext that he considered his personal safety
endangered by the menaces of the Prince, paraded
the streets of Paris with a retinue of seven or eight
hundred mounted followers; and occasionally proceeded
on foot to the Louvre, with his guards
ranged in order of battle, and in such force that the
van had frequently reached the gates of the palace
before the rear had quitted those of the Htel
d'Epernon, a distance of two thousand paces.<a id="footnotetag111" name="footnotetag111"></a><a href="#footnote111">[111]</a></p>

<p>This external affectation of almost regal state did
not, however, prevent him from experiencing the
most bitter mortification at his exclusion from all
public affairs. He still considered that as he had
been the first to swear fealty, and to place his
services at the command of the Regent, he had a
right to retain the supremacy which he had then
assumed; and this arrogant pretension enabled him
for a time to support the daily affronts to which he
was subjected; but it soon became apparent that his
position must ere long prove untenable.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Joyeuse, whose favour depended
upon that of the Duc d'Epernon, having perceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span>
that his credit with the Regent was on the decline,
determined to proceed to Rome. He accordingly
took leave of the King and his mother, and left
France; while M. d'Epernon endeavoured to effect
a reconciliation with the Comte de Soissons, an
attempt which was repulsed with resolute coldness
on the part of the Prince, who was daily attaching
himself more and more to the interests of Concini.</p>

<p>Early in the spring the Court left Paris for
Fontainebleau, accompanied by all the Princes of the
Blood; and during their sojourn in that palace
Marie de Medicis constantly caused M. de Soissons
and the Ducs de Guise and d'Epernon to form her
party at <i>prime</i>, trusting that constant companionship,
and the equal favour which she was cautious to
show to all, might tend to a general reconciliation.<a id="footnotetag112" name="footnotetag112"></a><a href="#footnote112">[112]</a></p>

<p>These efforts on the part of the Regent, however,
were of little avail; individual jealousies and
individual interests absorbed all the great nobles of
the Court; and every concession to which they were
induced was purchased at a price, and even then
ungraciously yielded. Marie de Medicis at times
lost alike courage and temper under the difficulties
by which she was beset; and on one occasion, when
she had retired to her closet, after having occupied
herself for a time with the transaction of public
business, she gave way to a train of thought so
agitating and so painful that she suddenly rose and
summoned the ladies of her suite to her presence.
Mesdames de Conti, du Fargis, and de Fervaques
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>
hastened to obey her commands; and as the
tapestry fell behind them, the Queen-mother silently,
but with an imperious gesture, motioned them to
be seated. A deep spot of crimson burned on the
cheek of Marie, and there was a harsh glitter in her
eye which betrayed the coming storm; nor was it
long ere it burst forth.</p>

<p>"I have asked your presence, Mesdames," she
said, fixing a stern look upon the Princesse de
Conti, "when you were each, in all probability,
more pleasantly engaged than in sharing the disquiet
and <i>ennui</i> of your harassed mistress; but, <i>per Dio!</i>
the present position of affairs leaves me no alternative,
my own thoughts having become&mdash;thanks to
those who should lend their assistance in bearing
the grievous burthen which has been thrust upon
me&mdash;but sorry companions. The Princes are still
conspiring against my authority, and questioning
my acts, as though I were responsible to each and
all of them for the measures which I consider it
expedient to adopt. According to the creed of
these gentlemen, the Regent of France should be
but a mere puppet, of which they, at their good
pleasure, may pull the strings. Scarcely have I
recalled them to Court, scarcely have I restored
them to favour, than they organize new cabals
excite the nobles to discontent, and breed discord,
alike in the Parliament and among the people.
What more can they require at my hands than what
I have already bestowed? The national treasury is
well-nigh exhausted in meeting their demands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>
Look back an instant: M. de Cond has, within the
last two years, received more than nine hundred
thousand crowns&mdash;the Comte de Soissons six
hundred thousand&mdash;and MM. de Longueville,
d'Epernon, and de Vendme, two millions among
them! Nor is this all: in contenting them I have
been compelled to lavish enormous sums upon
others, who would have considered themselves
aggrieved had they not also shared in my munificence.
But let these proud spirits&mdash;who, despite
their noble blood and their princely quality, do not
disdain to barter their loyalty for gold&mdash;let them
beware lest they urge me beyond my patience.
Your brothers and brothers-in-law, Madame la
Princesse, will do well to be warned in time. They
are playing a hazardous game. If they believe that
by exhausting the royal treasury they will succeed
in rendering themselves masters of the kingdom,
they are deceived; the Queen-mother watches alike
over the life and the crown of her son. Once more
I say, let them be warned in time; not a plot, not a
cabal shall escape my knowledge; and should they
disregard the caution which I now condescend to
give them through yourself, they will learn too late
what it is to incur the vengeance of Marie de
Medicis."</p>

<p>The silence of a moment succeeded to this outbreak
of impassioned eloquence; for Madame de
Conti, fearful of augmenting the anger of her royal
mistress, ventured no reply; and after a brief struggle
with herself the Queen-mother smoothed her ruffled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span>
brow, and forcing a smile to her still quivering lips,
she resumed in an altered tone: "Enough of this,
however; tell me now somewhat of your ballet of
last night, Princesse: you have as yet made no mention
of its success."</p>

<p>"I awaited the commands of your Majesty ere I
intruded the subject," replied Madame de Conti
coldly; "its success was all that I could desire."</p>

<p>"Did the Duc de Guise honour your festival with
his presence? He seldom, as I am aware, encourages
our Court frivolities."</p>

<p>"MM. de Cond and de Guise were both among
my guests, Madame; and I could have ill brooked
the absence of either."</p>

<p>"Ay, ever together, in feast and feud," murmured
Marie bitterly to herself. "And Bassompierre?"
she pursued aloud&mdash;"the gallant courtier who has as
many mistresses as I have halberdiers in my bodyguard,
and who creates an atmosphere of gladness
about him, be he where he may; was he as gay and
gorgeous as his wont?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty is probably not aware," replied
Madame de Conti with increased formality, "that
M. de Bassompierre has quarrelled with one of my
relatives; a circumstance which deprived me of the
honour of his presence."</p>

<p>"And the Marquis d'Ancre?" demanded the
Queen-mother abruptly; "did he at least partake of
your splendid hospitality?"</p>

<p>The cheek of the Princess blanched, and her voice
slightly trembled as she said hurriedly: "M. d'Ancre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>
was on duty, Madame, about the person of your
Majesty, and I did not presume to ask for his
absence from the palace."</p>

<p>"<i>Veramente, principessa</i>" exclaimed Marie de
Medicis with sudden vehemence, "you excel yourself
to-day! But have a care! My faithful servants
were no meet guests, as it would seem, at a festival
in honour of the House of Guise. Truly your
energetic kinsmen are goodly diplomatists. Not
content with conspiring in the Louvre&mdash;under the
very roof which shelters their sovereign&mdash;they conspire
also in their own palaces, by the glare of tapers
as busily as in the shade. Even to the measure of
soft music they can adapt their treasonable practices;
and amid the murmurs of flattery can breathe the
whispers of disaffection as glibly as when closeted
together secure from all intrusion. So be it then;
exclude from your glittering <i>salons</i> all those who
are the known adherents of the sovereign and his
mother; they will be careful for the future to repay
the courtesy in kind. I have as great a dread of
spies as yourself, Madame de Conti, and henceforward
I will profit by the lesson which you have
taught me."</p>

<p>"I can assure your Majesty&mdash;" faltered the lady
of honour.</p>

<p>"Nay, Princesse," interposed the Queen-mother
bitterly, "do not wrong yourself. Have at least
the courage necessary for the personage which you
have seen fit to enact, and believe me that you will
need it when you venture to cope with a Medicis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>
Florence can also boast of her diplomatists, and they
may chance to prove even more subtle than those
of our good city of Paris. There is a stern and a
profitable lesson in the past should you read it
aright."</p>

<p>So saying Marie de Medicis rose from her seat,
and with a stately step walked to a window overlooking
the river, where she remained for a considerable
time apparently absorbed by the busy scene
beneath her; but at length she turned slowly towards
the three ladies, who had also risen, and said calmly:
"His Majesty is about to visit me. Mesdames du
Fargis and de Fervaques will assist me to receive
him. I excuse Madame de Conti; after the manifold
exertions of the past night she must need
repose."</p>

<p>The Princess made the three low curtsies customary
on such occasions, and disappeared behind the
tapestried hangings which were held back by the
usher on duty; while the Queen-mother threw herself
once more upon her seat, and burying her face
in her hand, again fell into a deep and bitter reverie.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Protestants were preparing for the
General Assembly, and the Marchal de Bouillon
proceeded to Sedan, in order to assist at their
deliberations. He had no sooner done this than the
Prince de Cond requested permission to go and
take possession of his government of Guienne, a
project which at that particular moment created
universal suspicion, and excited the alarm of Marie,
who was apprehensive that he was about to solicit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>
the support of the reformed party. Under this
impression she exerted all her ingenuity to invent
pretexts for delaying his purpose without awakening
his distrust; but they ultimately proved unavailing,
and she found herself compelled to allow him to
depart.</p>

<p>At this particular juncture the Duc d'Epernon,
irritated by the persevering avoidance of M. de
Soissons, and the covert sarcasms of Concini, resolved
in his turn to absent himself, and to proceed
to his estate at Angoulme, flattering himself that
the Regent would be but too happy to recall him
when she discovered how great a blank his departure
must cause at Court. It is moreover probable that
he anticipated the same gratifying impediments which
had delayed the journey of the Prince de Cond;
and consequently his disappointment was extreme
as he perceived the pleasure which Marie could not
conceal when he mentioned his wish to retire for a
brief interval from the capital. The wound thus
inflicted upon his vanity was, however, soon healed,
when, with a renewal of all her former confidence
and condescension, she confessed to him that no
proposition could have been more agreeable to her
at that moment, from her anxiety to secure the
services of a friend upon whom she could rely to
keep a zealous watch over the movements of the
Prince de Cond, whose departure had awakened
her fears. She then explained the suspicions she
had formed, and gave M. d'Epernon full and ample
instructions for his future guidance, accompanying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>
them with assurances of her firm reliance upon his
attachment and fidelity; thus enabling the crestfallen
courtier, who must otherwise have withdrawn
in partial disgrace, to leave the palace with every
mark of favour and distinction.<a id="footnotetag113" name="footnotetag113"></a><a href="#footnote113">[113]</a></p>

<p>The precaution thus taken with regard to M. de
Cond proved, however, supererogatory, the Prince
having no further object in view in absenting himself
from the capital than the gratification of that love of
personal splendour and amusement in which he had
always indulged whenever an opportunity presented
itself; and thus while the Duc d'Epernon was
watching all his movements with eager and anxious
suspicion, M. de Cond was simply enacting the
quasi-sovereign at Bordeaux and the adjacent cities
where he was received with great ceremony, harangued
by the municipal bodies, and surrounded
by a petty court composed of all the nobles of the
province.<a id="footnotetag114" name="footnotetag114"></a><a href="#footnote114">[114]</a></p>

<p>Concini had watched the departure of the exulting
Duc d'Epernon with a delight as great as his own;
the only rival who threatened to counterbalance his
influence was now removed from the immediate
sphere in which he could prove obnoxious to his
fortunes, and he soon felt the effect of his absence
in the increased dependence of the Regent upon
himself and his wife. Nor was the result less
obvious to all the members of the Court, who, as
their several interests prompted, were either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
overjoyed or dismayed at the unconcealed supremacy of
the vainglorious Marquis, whose bearing became
more arrogant than ever, and who appeared at each
moment ready to dispute precedency even with the
Princes of the Blood themselves. All bowed before
him. He was the only certain channel of favour
and preferment; and whenever, as frequently occurred,
some act of presumption more glaring than
usual aroused against him the ire of the great nobles,
the tears and entreaties of his wife always sufficed to
induce the Regent to make new sacrifices for the
purpose of ensuring his impunity.</p>

<p>This imprudence on the part of Marie, although
originating, as it obviously did, in an inclination to
maintain that peace at Court of which she had now
learned by bitter experience to appreciate all the
value, increased the evil which it was intended to
obviate, the Italian only seeing in her indulgence a
new motive for continuing his moral aggressions;
and thus the evil increased slowly but surely, and
the hatred engendered by the preposterous pretensions
of the Marquis acquired new force, even when
all around him appeared to admit his supremacy,
and to bend before his will.</p>

<p>One of the most striking proofs of the power to
which he had at this period attained is afforded by
the fact that a nobleman known as a firm adherent
of M. de Soissons, while conversing with the Marquis
de Coeuvres on the subject of the increasing
feud between the Princes of the Blood, suggested
that he could perceive no more certain method for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>
the Count to maintain himself in favour at Court than
that he should effect the marriage of one of his
daughters with the son of the Italian favourite.
This project startled the Marquis, who never for
an instant suspected that the proposition could have
originated with M. de Soissons himself; and whose
proud ancestral blood boiled within him at the idea
of so close an alliance between one of the first
subjects of France and an adventurer of obscure
birth, whose very claim to respectability was even
yet disputed. He was, however, fated to feel even
greater surprise when, a short time subsequently, as
both parties were conversing with the Marquis in
the Queen's gallery at Fontainebleau, he heard a
third person openly, and without the slightest hesitation,
enter upon the subject with Concini himself;
who, with evident gratification but affected humility,
immediately replied that such an alliance was an
honour to which he could not pretend, but that were
it ever to be seriously proposed to him, he could
only reply in the words of Cardinal Farnese to
an individual who suggested to him an arrangement
which at once flattered his self-love and appeared
impossible of completion, "<i>Tu m'aduli, ma tu mi
piaci</i>." The subject was not pursued, but it was
one not readily to be forgotten by those who were
aware that it had been mooted; and there can be
little doubt that the self-esteem of the Marquis
d'Ancre gained fresh force, even from a passing
allusion to the possibility of such an event.</p>

<p>Encouraged, as it would appear, by the brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>
prospect thus opened up for his son, Concini soon
began to think no aggrandizement beyond the reach
of his ambition; and readily overlooking both personal
hatred and political good-faith in the pursuance
of his darling passion, it was not long ere he argued
that since a Prince of the Blood had seen fit to solicit
an alliance with himself, he might readily infer that
a noble of inferior rank could not but esteem it as
an honour; and accordingly he commenced a negotiation
with the Duc d'Epernon, between whose
second son, the Marquis de la Valette, and his own
daughter he desired to effect a marriage. This
proposal was, however, resented as an insult by the
Duke, who was not sparing in his comments upon
the insolence of the Italian adventurer; and so
unmeasured were his expressions that his ruin must
have been ensured from that moment, had not a
circumstance shortly afterwards occurred which rendered
his services necessary to the Regent.</p>

<p>Before the end of April the Duc de Bouillon
returned from Sedan, and manifested an earnest
inclination to devote himself, in so far as his honour
and religious principles would permit him to do so,
to the interests of the Regent during the approaching
assembly at Saumur; adding, moreover, that should
the Queen deem his absence from the meeting
desirable, he would remain at Court until it had
terminated. So unexpected a concession highly
gratified Marie, who, with many acknowledgments
for his devotion to her cause, referred him to M.
de Villeroy, by whom, his proposal having been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>
demurely considered, it was declined; the minister
being aware that the influence of M. de Bouillon
would be alone able to counteract that of Sully, who,
having left the Court disappointed and dissatisfied,
would not fail to profit by so favourable an opportunity
of asserting his power over his co-religionists.
He, moreover, while thanking the Prince for a proof
of loyalty so welcome to the Government, and so
important to the sovereign, hinted that should he
succeed in weakening the power of Sully, and in
inducing the Assembly to consent to such terms as
could prudently be conceded, he would confer upon
him the government of Poitou, of which it had been
decided to deprive the ex-finance-minister.<a id="footnotetag115" name="footnotetag115"></a><a href="#footnote115">[115]</a></p>

<p>This new impulse added fresh energy to the
sudden loyalty of M. de Bouillon, who at once
proceeded to Saumur in order to secure his election
as President of the Assembly, a distinction which he
declared to be due to his long services. The Protestant
deputies were, however, by no means inclined
to admit his claim, and more than suspicious of his
intentions; and they consequently, despite his undisguised
annoyance, selected for that dignity M.
du Plessis-Mornay, the governor of the city; a circumstance
which did not fail to increase the hatred
felt by the Marchal towards Sully, to whom he
immediately attributed the mortification. Soon
made conscious, by the coldness with which his
invectives and threats were received by the principal
Huguenot nobles, that he was only injuring by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>
unseemly violence the cause he sought to serve,
M. de Bouillon nevertheless resolved to restrain
himself, and to endeavour to effect a good understanding
with Sully, whose personal importance on
this occasion was powerfully increased by the influence
of his son-in-law the Duc de Rohan. The
Assembly met for the first time in May, and continued
their sittings until September, at which period their
demands and grievances were despatched to the
Court, the dismissal of Sully being indicated as one
of the latter.</p>

<p>This fact alarmed the Council, who moreover
could not contemplate without great apprehension
the union and perfect understanding which had,
throughout the whole proceedings, characterized the
Protestant leaders, who had taken their usual oath
to uphold each other and the faith which they
professed; and who were, as the ministers well
knew, able to redeem their pledge so effectively
should they see fit to exert their power, that any
demonstration on their part could not fail to convulse
the nation from one extremity to the other. After
considerable deliberation it was agreed that the only
method by which the impending evil could be averted
was to dissolve the Assembly before it could proceed
from words to acts; and accordingly a pretext for
this breach of faith was at once found in the declaration
that the King had permitted the assembling of
the reformed party to enable them to select six
individuals, from among whom he might himself
nominate two as general deputies; while at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span>
same time the documents forwarded to the Court
were returned, with an emphatic refusal to make
any reply to their contents until such time as the
required nomination had been made. All opposition,
save what must have assumed a decidedly hostile
character, was of course impossible on the part of
the Protestants, whose indignation, loud as it naturally
became for a time, was finally silenced, even if
not extinguished, by the calm and dignified eloquence
of the Comte du Plessis-Mornay, who reminded the
Assembly that their first duty as Christians was
obedience to the ruling powers.</p>

<p>"Let us separate," said this prudent and right-minded
man, as exclamations of anger and violence
resounded on all sides. "Let each, on leaving this
spot, leave also all animosity behind him. We
should only heighten the evil by spreading it through
the provinces. Each has failed, yet each has done
well. Let us now endeavour to obtain by respectful
silence and Christian patience what has been refused
to our remonstrances and requests." <a id="footnotetag116" name="footnotetag116"></a><a href="#footnote116">[116]</a></p>

<p>A short time subsequently, the death of M. de
Crquy, governor of the town and citadel of Amiens,
having taken place, a great number of the nobles
were ambitious to succeed to the vacant dignity,
among whom was the Marquis d'Ancre, whose
insatiable ambition grasped at every opportunity of
acquiring honour and advancement. Having confided
his wish upon this subject to M. de Soissons,
he was encouraged in his pretensions by that Prince;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>
and having obtained the royal permission to absent
himself for a time from the Court, he hastened to
Picardy, attended by a hundred horsemen, in order
to negotiate the affair with the entire sanction of the
Queen; where, although opposed by the ministers
who were anxious to curb his daily increasing power,
he ultimately succeeded in his attempt.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the objections raised by the Council,
not only to his acquirement of the government, but
also to the marriage of his son with the daughter of
M. de Soissons, which had been communicated to
them by the Marquis de Rambouillet,<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a><a href="#footnote117">[117]</a> embittered
his temper, and determined him to discover some
means of revenging what he considered as an undue
interference with his personal affairs. The extraordinary
imprudence of which he was soon afterwards
guilty rendered him, however, for a time unable to
indulge his vindictiveness, and even threatened to
involve him in the disgrace which he was so anxious
to see visited upon his adversaries. In the first
place, intoxicated by his newly acquired dignities,
he affected the utmost attachment for M. de Soissons,
who had exerted all his influence in his behalf; and
remarked that the proposition lately made to him by
the Prince for an alliance between their families
was no longer so unequal as it had then appeared,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>
although he was still aware that it would be a great
honour conferred upon himself; but that as the Duc
de Longueville was about to marry another daughter
of the Prince, and that their governments were
contiguous, the union of his own son with the sister
of the bride might prove a mutual advantage, and
of considerable service to M. de Soissons himself.
This unseemly boast he followed up by a still more
flagrant proof of presumption; for, being anxious to
assert his entire authority over the citadel of Amiens,
he entered into a financial treaty with M. de Rouillac
the lieutenant, and M. de Fleury the ensign of the
fortress, and replaced them by adherents of his own,
without the sanction of the Regent; after which he
borrowed, on his own responsibility, twelve thousand
livres from the receiver-general of the province for
the payment of his garrison.</p>

<p>Such an unprecedented disregard of the royal
prerogative had never before occurred in France;
and it no sooner became known to the ministers
than they hastened to represent it in its most heinous
aspect to the Queen, impressing upon her in no
measured terms the danger of such a precedent,
which could not fail to bring contempt upon her
authority, and to introduce disorder into the finances
of the nation; and entreating her to remember that
should she sanction an alliance between the imprudent
favourite and a Prince of the Blood, she
could no longer hope to restrain his extravagances.
Marie de Medicis was jealous of her dignity, and
moreover fully conscious of the fault which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>
committed by Concini, and her anger was consequently
unbounded. In the first burst of her indignation
she refused to see Madame d'Ancre, whom she
accused of having incited her husband to these
demonstrations of disrespect towards herself; and
her wrath was skilfully increased by the Princesse
de Conti, who looked upon the favour of the low-born
Leonora with impatience and disgust, and
could not desire a more ready means of ensuring
her discredit than that of following up the arguments
of the ministers, of dwelling upon the little respect
which had been shown to the person and privileges
of her royal mistress, and of expatiating on the ruinous
effect of so pernicious an example upon the
discontented nobility.</p>

<p>The effect of these frequent and confidential conversations
may be imagined; the mind of the Queen
became more and more excited against her former
favourites, while she clung with the tenacity of
helplessness to Madame de Conti, through whose
medium the Princes began to hope that they should
at length triumph over the detested Italian. But the
sun of Concini was not destined to set so soon; and
although he had fierce enemies, he still possessed
zealous friends; the more zealous, perhaps, because
they had accurately read the character of the Tuscan
Princess, and were well aware that she had so long
leant upon others that she had at last become incapable
of perfect self-reliance. Through the medium
of those friends, but undoubtedly still more from the
daily and hourly <i>ennui</i> experienced by Marie herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span>
while thus deprived of the society of her foster-sister,
the pardon of Concini was finally obtained. He was
declared to have erred through ignorance; and a
perfect reconciliation took place which overthrew
all the half-fledged projects of the disappointed
courtiers.</p>

<p>Two circumstances alone tended to mitigate the
satisfaction of the Marquis d'Ancre. The representations
of the ministers had succeeded in so
thoroughly awakening the apprehensions of the
Regent, that she had, at their first interview, strictly
forbidden him thenceforward to attempt the accomplishment
of his anticipated alliance with the House
of Bourbon; while he had found himself compelled
to apologize to the Comte de Soissons for the
excesses in which he had indulged in Picardy, and
which had drawn down upon the Prince the resentment,
not only of the Queen herself, but of the
whole Council, by whom he was accused of having
upheld the pretensions of the Italian in order to
aggrandize his own daughter.</p>

<p>In the month of July Marie de Medicis bestowed
great happiness upon the whole nation by remitting
the arrears of taxes which had remained unpaid
from the year 1597, until that of 1603; while she
also, at the same period, decreed the abolition of
the gaming academies to which allusion was made
in the preceding volume; and, finally, ascertaining
that the edict against duelling issued by the late
King had been evaded by certain sophistical observances,
she published a declaration setting forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>
that all hostile meetings, however arranged, would
not only entail the penalties already denounced
against them, but henceforward be regarded as acts
of assassination. This wholesome and well-timed
declaration was verified by the Parliament on the
11th of July, and great hopes were entertained that
so stringent a measure would effectually terminate
an abuse which, during the reign of the late King,
had deprived France of several thousand of her best
chivalry.<a id="footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a><a href="#footnote118">[118]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the autumn, notwithstanding the
gravity of the affairs then pending, the Court at
Fontainebleau was one ceaseless scene of dissipation.
High play still formed a prominent feature in the
amusements of the palace, and the extent to which
it was carried may be estimated by the fact that
Concini, before his return to the capital, had lost at
cards and dice the enormous sum of twenty-six
thousand pistoles;<a id="footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a><a href="#footnote119">[119]</a> and while the <i>branle</i> and the
gaming-table occupied the night, the day was
devoted to hunting, a diversion in which the Queen
constantly participated, accompanied by the Princesses
and ladies of the Court, and attended by a
suite of between four and five hundred of the
principal nobles. The arrival of the Duchesse de
Lorraine and the Cardinal de Gonzaga<a id="footnotetag120" name="footnotetag120"></a><a href="#footnote120">[120]</a> gave a new
impetus to the gaiety of the royal circle, while their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>
sumptuous reception at the palace induced new outlay
and new rivalry among the courtiers.<a id="footnotetag121" name="footnotetag121"></a><a href="#footnote121">[121]</a></p>

<p>It was in the midst of this splendid dissipation
that the Regent received tidings of the death of the
Duc de Mayenne, a loss which, from the good
understanding recently established between herself
and that Prince, was of serious importance to her
authority; while the event produced a still more
painful impression from the fact that his wife, Henrietta
of Savoy, had died of grief a few days subsequently,
and that they had been carried to the
grave together.</p>

<p>The next news which reached the Court was that
of the demise of Marguerite of Austria, Queen of
Spain; an event which, from the recent treaty concluded
between the two countries, had become
doubly interesting to France. This Princess, who
was the daughter of Charles, Archduke of Gratz,
Duke of Styria and Carinthia, and of Marie of
Bavaria, had become the wife of Philip III in
November 1599; and had left four sons, viz.
Philip, Charles, Ferdinand, and Alfonso; and two
daughters, Anne and Marguerite, the former of
whom was promised to Louis XIII.</p>

<p>Other and more personal interests sufficed, nevertheless,
to dry the tears of the Queen-mother, as at
this period the Duchesse de Lorraine explained the
purport of her visit; which, it is asserted, was to
induce her royal niece to redeem the pledge given
by her deceased husband that the Dauphin should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
espouse the Princesse de Lorraine, who would bring
as her dowry to the young King the duchies of
Lorraine and Bar. Marie was, however, too deeply
compromised with Spain as well as with the Pope
and the Grand Duke of Tuscany, both of whom
were earnest to effect the completion of that alliance,
to follow up a policy which could not but have
proved much more beneficial to the French nation;
while the Cond de Fuentes, who immediately suspected
the purpose of Madame de Lorraine, loudly
and arrogantly asserted that the French King could
not have two wives; that his marriage with the
Infanta was concluded; and that his sovereign was
not to be cheated with impunity.<a id="footnotetag122" name="footnotetag122"></a><a href="#footnote122">[122]</a></p>

<p>Oppressed by this double weight of regret and
anxiety, Marie and her Court returned to the
Louvre; but her grief was still fated to be fearfully
increased, for she had scarcely established herself in
the palace when her maternal terrors were suddenly
awakened by intelligence of the dangerous illness of
her second son, the Duc d'Orlans, upon which she
hastened to St. Germain. The fiat had, however,
gone forth, and two days subsequently the little
Prince, upon whose precocious intellect and sweetness
of disposition so many hopes had been built
up, was a corpse in his mother's arms; and within
a few hours Madame de Lorraine and her brother
had taken leave of their illustrious relative, while
the Court of the Louvre, so lately giddy with gaiety,
was once more draped in sables.<a id="footnotetag123" name="footnotetag123"></a><a href="#footnote123">[123]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>

<p>Devotedly attached to her children, the Queen
was for a time inconsolable; her greatness was
embittered by private suffering, and her authority
was endangered by intestine broils; she looked
around her, and scarcely knew upon whom to
depend, or upon what to lean. The constant exactions
of the Princes convinced her of the utter
hopelessness of satisfying their venality, and securing
their allegiance, save by sacrifices which gradually
tended to diminish her own power, and to compromise
the interests of the Crown, while the people
murmured at the burthens inflicted upon them in
order to gratify the greed of the nobility.</p>

<p>To increase her anxiety, the death of her second
son was destined to add to the number of malcontents
by whom the Queen was surrounded, all the
principal officers of his household advancing their
claim to be transferred to that of the infant Duc
d'Anjou, who, on the demise of the Duc d'Orlans,
assumed the title of Monsieur, as only brother of
the King. It was, however, impossible to place all
these candidates about the person of the young
Prince, and it was ultimately decided that M. de
Brves,<a id="footnotetag124" name="footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124">[124]</a> a relative of M. de Villeroy, to whom the
appointment had already been promised by Henri
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span>
IV, should be selected as the preceptor of Monsieur,
to the exclusion of M. de Bthune, who had held
the same post about the Duc d'Orlans, and who
consequently demanded to be transferred to the
service of his brother. But the relative of Sully
was little likely to prove a successful candidate; he
had owed his previous appointment to the influence
of the powerful kinsman whose counsels swayed the
actions of a great monarch; that monarch was now
in his grave, and that kinsman in honourable exile;
and his claim was no longer admitted. The Marquis
de Coeuvres, who had been master of the
wardrobe to the deceased Prince, was fated to be
equally disappointed. The ministers had not forgotten
that he had been an active agent in the
proposed alliance between the Comte de Soissons
and Concini, and they did not fail to impress upon
the Queen the extreme danger of placing an individual
of so resolute and enterprising a character
about the person of the heir presumptive. As he
could obtain no decided reply to his application, M.
de Coeuvres solicited the assistance of the Marquis
d'Ancre, who met his request with civil professions
of regard, but declined to oppose the will of the
ministers; an exhibition of ingratitude which so
enraged the applicant that he forthwith declined all
further interference in the affairs or claim upon the
friendship of the fickle Italian, and attached himself
exclusively to the interests of M. de Soissons.<a id="footnotetag125" name="footnotetag125"></a><a href="#footnote125">[125]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>

<p>This Prince was also destined, at this particular
period, to augment the difficulties of the Regent.
The duchy of Alenon had been mortgaged by the
French Crown to the Duke of Wrtemberg; and
hopes had, some months previously, been held out
to the Prince that, should he ever be in a position
to redeem the debt, he might avail himself of the
opportunity, and become its possessor. This time
had now come; the Princess his wife had recovered
from the Duke of Savoy a large amount for her
estates in Piedmont, which he resolved to devote
to the acquisition of the coveted duchy, and he
accordingly applied for the sanction of the King,
without whose consent the transfer could not be
legally executed.</p>

<p>It is probable that, having already received a
partial consent to his wishes, M. de Soissons was
far from apprehending any serious impediment to
their realization; but the jealousy of Marie had been
aroused, and she did not fail to perceive that such
a concession must be dangerous to the interests of
the younger Children of France. The Prince had
therefore no sooner made his request than she
assumed an attitude of offended dignity and cold
rebuke; and while he awaited her reply with a smile
of anticipatory success, she said drily, "Do you
wish, Monsieur, to acquire a duchy which has constantly
been set apart as the appanage of one of the
sons of the sovereign? I begin to perceive that
your designs are somewhat lofty."</p>

<p>Thus repulsed, M. de Soissons withdrew, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>
with a demeanour which convinced the Regent that
she had made a new enemy, whom she must consequently
prepare herself to resist; a conclusion
at which she had no sooner arrived than she summoned
the Prince de Cond and the Duc d'Epernon
to her assistance.<a id="footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a><a href="#footnote126">[126]</a></p>

<p>This measure was not, however, destined to prove
entirely successful. The Marquis de Coeuvres, who
at once felt that M. de Soissons was in no position
to maintain single-handed any effectual opposition
to the host of adversaries about to be marshalled
against him, lost not a moment in seeking to convince
him that he had but one prospect of avoiding
the disgrace by which he was threatened. The
impetuous Count poured forth all his wrath in invectives,
and declared his readiness to endure any
mortification rather than not enforce what he persisted
in designating as his legitimate claims as a
Prince of the Blood, but his zealous adviser was not
to be thus silenced.</p>

<p>"Remember, Sir," was the rejoinder of the Marquis,
"that you are now embroiled with both the
Regent and her ministers; that the momentary truce
between yourself and Concini is merely lip-deep,
and may be broken by a breath; that you are the
open and declared enemy of the Guises and the
Duc d'Epernon; and that each and all of these are
interested in your ruin. I do not attempt to deny
that your quality as a Prince of the Blood must, as a
natural consequence, avail you much; and it is this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
very conviction that encourages me to persist in
counselling you to place no reliance upon minor
friendships, but at once to ally yourself closely
with your nephew the Prince de Cond, and thus
strengthen the very rights upon which you presume.
During a minority the Princes of the Blood have an
influence in France, which once earnestly and truthfully
united and exerted, must eventually prove
irresistible."</p>

<p>After some further difficulty M. de Soissons
suffered himself to be convinced by the arguments
of the Marquis, and it was ultimately resolved that
overtures should be made to this effect on the part
of the Count through the medium of M. de Beaumont,
the son of the President de Harlay, who was
at that period expected in the capital, and who was
in the confidence of the Prince de Cond. Beaumont
had accordingly no sooner arrived than the
Marquis de Coeuvres made him acquainted with the
desire of the Count, and it was finally agreed that,
upon the pretext of a hunt, the two Princes should
meet at the residence of the former. As, however,
it was immediately ascertained that the Regent had
expressed some suspicions of this interview, and
declared the reconciliation which had taken place
to be too sudden not to involve some occult
purpose, M. de Soissons deemed it expedient to
silence her fears by inviting Concini to join the
party.</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted; the hunt took
place, and was succeeded by high play, after which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span>
the different personages apparently separated for
the night; but within half an hour the two royal
kinsmen and their confidential friends were closeted
together, and before dawn an alliance offensive and
defensive was concluded between the Princes, who
each pledged himself to receive no favour or benefit
from the Government to the exclusion or loss of the
other; and that, moreover, in the event of the disgrace
or disgust of either, the other should withdraw
from the Court at the same time, whither neither
was to be at liberty to return alone; and this compact,
which, as will immediately be seen, could not
fail to prove dangerous to the interests of Marie,
was religiously observed until the death of M. de
Soissons.<a id="footnotetag127" name="footnotetag127"></a><a href="#footnote127">[127]</a></p>

<p>The credit of the ministers was greatly increased
by this new cabal, as the Regent instantly perceived
the necessity of opposing their authority to the probable
pretensions of the Princes, neither of whom
attempted to disguise their discontent at the insignificant
position to which they had been reduced at
Court. To Jeannin, in particular, the Queen expressed
in unmeasured terms the confidence which
she placed in his zeal and loyalty; she called him
her <i>friend</i>, her <i>arm</i>, and her <i>head</i>, and assured
him that she would be guided entirely by his
counsels.</p>

<p>Anxious to respond to these flattering demonstrations,
and to justify the trust reposed in them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span>
the ministers resolved, in order still further to protect
the Crown against any aggression on the part of
the Princes, to recall to Court the Marchal de Lesdiguires,
who was easily induced to resign his command
of the army in Champagne by the prospect
which they held out to him, of verifying and confirming
the ducal patent which he had obtained from
Henri IV. They, however, subsequently failed to
keep this promise, and the disappointment so irritated
the Marchal that he resolved to revenge himself
by joining the party of the Princes, and otherwise
harassing the Council; a determination which was
unfortunately too easily realized at a period of such
internal convulsion.<a id="footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a><a href="#footnote128">[128]</a></p>

<p>The last event worthy of record which took place
in the present year was the purchase towards the
close of September of the Htel de Luxembourg by
the Queen-Regent, for the sum of thirty thousand
crowns, in order to erect upon its site the celebrated
Palais d'Orlans, now once more known by its
original name of the Luxembourg. The construction
of this splendid edifice was entrusted to Jacques
de Brosse,<a id="footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a><a href="#footnote129">[129]</a> who immediately commenced removing
the ruins of the dilapidated htel which encumbered
the space destined for the new elevation; and four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span>
years subsequently the first stone was laid of the
regal pile which transmitted his own name to posterity,
linked with those of Marie de Medicis and
Peter Paul Rubens.<a id="footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a><a href="#footnote130">[130]</a></p>

<p>The Prince de Cond and the Comte de Soissons
having withdrawn from the capital, MM. de Guise
and d'Epernon found themselves once more the
principal personages of the Court, but their triumph
was nevertheless greatly moderated by the jealousy
of Concini, who began to apprehend that their
ceaseless efforts to gratify the wishes of the Queen,
and to flatter her love of splendour and dissipation,
might ultimately tend to weaken his own influence;
while the ministers, on their side, aware that the
negotiations then pending with Spain for the marriage
of the King could not be readily concluded
without their aid and concurrence, however they
might deprecate their return from other causes, also
felt the necessity of securing their co-operation, for
which purpose it was essential that such measures
should be adopted as might render this concession
acceptable to the royal malcontents.<a id="footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a><a href="#footnote131">[131]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span>
While this subject was under consideration, and
Lent rapidly approaching, the Queen, who, being
still in slight mourning, could not, according to the
established etiquette, hold any assemblies in her
own apartments, but who was unwilling to forego
the customary amusements of the Carnival, desired
the Duc de Guise, the Prince de Joinville, and M.
de Bassompierre to perform a ballet every Sunday,
which they accordingly did, "dividing," says the
latter, "the expense between us."</p>

<p>The first of these allegorical dances was executed
in the apartments of the Princesse de Conti, where
a supper was prepared for her Majesty with an
exclusiveness uncommon at the time, and which
created considerable disappointment in the Court
circle. None but the Princes then resident in the
capital, namely MM. de Guise, de Nevers, and de
Reims, with a few chosen courtiers, were permitted
to attend, while the number of ladies was equally
limited.</p>

<p>The second took place in the apartments of the
Duchesse de Vendme, upon which occasion the
banquet was offered to the Queen by Madame de
Mercoeur; the third at the Htel de Guise, where
the Regent was entertained in the private <i>salon</i> of
the Duchess; and the fourth and last in the suite of
rooms appropriated to Madame de Guercheville in
the Louvre.<a id="footnotetag132" name="footnotetag132"></a><a href="#footnote132">[132]</a></p>

<p>"I took the liberty," says Rambure, with his
usual quaintness, "of representing to the Regent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
that the people would murmur on witnessing balls
at Court while she was still in mourning, but
she only laughed at me, and bade me dismiss such
an idea from my thoughts; at which I was not at all
pleased, from the respect that I entertained for the
memory of his late Majesty." <a id="footnotetag133" name="footnotetag133"></a><a href="#footnote133">[133]</a></p>

<p>These gaieties did not, however, serve to divert
the thoughts of the ministers from their desire to
recall the absent Princes of the Blood; and it was
finally arranged that as M. de Soissons had been
the original cause of their absence, owing to his
indignation at the ill-success of his attempt to purchase
the duchy of Alenon, it would be expedient
to hold out to him a prospect of obtaining the
government of Quilleboeuf. It was accordingly
decided that the Marquis d'Ancre, on the part of
their Majesties, and M. de Villeroy on that of the
ministers, should proceed to Nogent, where the
Princes were then residing, and invite them to
return to Court, with a full assurance from all parties
that they would there occupy the station befitting
their exalted rank, and be received with the dignities
and honours which were due to them as Princes of
the Blood.</p>

<p>The mission of the two envoys proved successful;
and on their arrival at Fontainebleau the uncle and
nephew were welcomed with a warmth and magnificence
which alike flattered their self-love and tended
to inspire them with confidence. Nevertheless,
M. de Soissons had no sooner discovered that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>
the Marquis d'Ancre, who, when he had himself
retired from the Court, had lost the favour of the
Queen, was now the firm ally of the ministers,
through whose good offices he had regained his
former position, than he exhibited towards the
Italian a haughtiness and avoidance which ere long
terminated in an open rupture.</p>

<p>Fearful of incurring through the means of the
Count the additional enmity of M. de Cond,
Concini endeavoured to win over the Marquis de
Coeuvres, and to effect through his interposition a
reconciliation with the indignant Prince. To this
solicitation M. de Coeuvres replied that in order to
establish a good understanding between two persons
whom he had already so strenuously sought to
serve, he was willing and ready to forget his private
wrongs; but when it was suggested to him that he
should exert his influence to renew the proposed
marriage without reference to the Queen-Regent,
he declined to make any effort to induce M. de
Soissons to adopt so onerous a course, alleging that
he had already suffered sufficiently by his interference
in a matter which had been productive of great
annoyance and injury to the Prince, and that he
would not again lend his assistance to the project
until the Marquis d'Ancre and his wife pledged
themselves to reconcile M. de Soissons with the
ministers, to restore him to the favour of the Regent,
and to obtain her sanction to the proposed alliance.</p>

<p>The firmness of this refusal staggered Concini,
who, only recently reinstated in the good graces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>
the Queen, was for once apprehensive of the failure
of his influence. He consequently confined his reply
to a simple acknowledgment of the courtesy with
which his proposal had been met by the Marquis,
and then endeavoured personally to regain the confidence
of the Prince by assurances of the sincere
inclination of the Queen to meet his wishes upon
every point within her power. As a natural consequence
M. de Soissons listened willingly to these
flattering declarations, uttered as they were by an
individual well known to be in the entire confidence
of his royal mistress; but they soon became blended
with the regrets of the Marquis that his listener
should have formed so close an alliance with his
nephew as to have drawn down upon him the
suspicion of the Court; and plausibly as these
regrets were expressed, M. de Soissons was soon
enabled to discover that the wily Italian had been
instructed to detach him from Cond.</p>

<p>A similar endeavour was made with the Prince
de Cond, but both were ineffectual. The two royal
kinsmen had become fully aware that mutual support
was their only safeguard against the party opposed
to them; and they had no sooner detected the
symptoms of coldness which supervened upon the
ill-success of their advisers, than they resolved once
more to leave the Court; and accordingly having
taken leave of their Majesties, and resisted the
pressing solicitations poured forth on all sides, they
again retired; the Prince to St. Valery, and the Count
to Dreux.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>
This renewed opposition to her wishes roused
the spirit of the Regent. She saw, as she asserted,
that there no longer remained a hope of restraining
the haughtiness, or of satisfying the pretensions, of
the great vassals of the Crown; and she accordingly
declared that in order to maintain her authority, and
to secure the throne of her son, she would not
allow the absence of the two Princes of the Blood
to delay the publication of the King's marriage.
Immediate measures were consequently taken for
concluding the necessary arrangements; and this was
done with the less hesitation that the Marchal de
Lesdiguires (who for some time after his arrival
at Court had continued to anticipate that the pledge
given to him by the ministers would shortly be
redeemed) had induced both the one and the other
to state that they would offer no opposition to the
alliance which had been determined.<a id="footnotetag134" name="footnotetag134"></a><a href="#footnote134">[134]</a></p>

<p>But this concession, which they were destined
subsequently to deplore, was all that could be extorted
from the Princes, who considered themselves
aggrieved by the fact that so important a negotiation
should have been carried on without their participation,
when special couriers had been despatched to
acquaint both the Cardinal de Joyeuse and the Due
d'Epernon with the pending treaty. The Comte de
Soissons, moreover, complained loudly and bitterly
of the undue power of the ministers, and especially
inveighed against the Chancellor Sillery, whom he
unhesitatingly accused of extortion and avarice, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span>
publicly making a trade of justice to the dishonour
of the nation, and of ruining those who were compelled
to solicit his protection. On this point alone
he was in accord with Concini; and it was to this
mutual hatred of the ministers that their partial good
understanding must be attributed. The reasons
which induced the Marchal de Lesdiguires to
approve the alliance we have already stated: the
ducal crown which he was so anxious to secure must
have been irretrievably lost by any opposition on his
part to the proposed alliance, and this vision was
for ever before his eyes. The approbation of the
Conntable de Montmorency, who had originally
declared his objection to so close a union between
the two countries, was purchased by a promise that
the hand of one of the Princesses of Mantua, niece
to the Regent, should be conferred upon his son;
and the brilliant promise of the one marriage caused
him to overlook the probable perils of the other;
while the Duc de Bouillon, although he occasionally
declared in the Council that he seriously apprehended
the result of so intimate a connection with Spain,
never remonstrated with any energy against the
measure, and was believed by those who knew him
best to have already made his conditions with Philip.
On the departure of the two Princes, Marie urged
the Duc de Guise to afford her his support, together
with that of his house, which he did with a frankness
worthy of record, concluding, however, with
these emphatic words: "I have but one favour to
request of you, Madame; and that is, that after this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span>
important service your Majesty will not abandon
us, as you have already once done, to the resentment
of the Princes of the Blood." <a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a><a href="#footnote135">[135]</a></p>

<p>The Duc d'Epernon, who had left the Court, as
elsewhere stated, if not in actual disgrace, at least
mortified and disappointed, was now recalled; and
as his failing was well known, he was received on
his arrival at Fontainebleau with such extraordinary
distinction that all his past grievances were at
once forgotten. Sillery, Villeroy, and Concini overwhelmed
him with respect and adulation, and his
adherence to the party of the Regent was consequently
purchased before the question had been
mooted in his presence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the English Ambassador declaimed
loudly against the contemplated alliance, which he
declared to be unequivocally antagonistic to the
interests of his sovereign; and his undisguised indignation
so alarmed the Council that it was immediately
resolved to despatch the Duc de Bouillon on an
extraordinary embassy to the Court of London in
order to appease the displeasure of James. The
minister of the United Provinces was equally violent
in his opposition, and exerted all his energies to
prevent the conclusion of a treaty which he regarded
as fatal to the interests of the republic that he represented,
but his expostulations were disregarded.
An envoy was sent to the Hague with assurances of
amity to Prince Maurice and the States-General;
and finally, the Marchal de Schomberg was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span>
instructed to visit the several Protestant Princes of
Germany in order to dispel any distrust which they
might feel at the probable results of an alliance so
threatening to their interests.<a id="footnotetag136" name="footnotetag136"></a><a href="#footnote136">[136]</a></p>

<p>These important measures concluded, the double
marriage was proposed to the Council, where the
Prince de Cond and the Comte de Soissons, who
had recently returned to the capital, occupied their
appointed seats; and at the commencement of the
proceedings, when the question of the projected
alliance had been submitted to the Assembly, M.
de Cond demanded that each should deliver his
opinion according to his rank. The Chancellor then
opened the subject by a warm panegyric on the
prudent administration of the Queen-Regent, dwelling
at great length upon the extraordinary benefit
which must accrue to the French nation from the
contemplated alliance with Spain; and he was
followed by the Duc de Guise, who, with more
brevity but equal force, maintained the same argument.
"No deliberation," concluded the Duke,
"can be required upon so advantageous a proposal.
We have only to thank God that her Majesty has
so happily accomplished the noble purpose with
which heaven had inspired her." As he resumed
his seat the Conntable de Montmorency and the
Ducs de Nevers and d'Epernon warmly applauded
his words; after which the Marchaux de Bouillon and
de Lesdiguires declared their approval of the alliance,
simply expressing a hope that proper precautions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>
would be taken to prevent the treaty with Spain
from proving prejudicial to the interests of France
in her more ancient alliances with other foreign
powers; and finally it became the turn of M. de
Cond to declare his sentiments. The young Prince
had, however, been so astonished by the fearless
address of the Duc de Guise that he had entirely
lost his self-possession, and merely said with great
coldness: "Since the affair is decided, it was
unnecessary to ask our advice."</p>

<p>The surprise was universal, as the general
impression throughout the Council had been that
the two Princes had determined to attend the meeting
in order to oppose the projected marriages; a
supposition which the words immediately afterwards
addressed to M. de Cond by his uncle served to
confirm. "You see, sir," said the Count, turning
towards him with an impatient gesture, "that we
are treated here like valets."</p>

<p>The Regent, irritated by this remark, which was
uttered so audibly as to be generally overheard, was
about to make some bitter rejoinder, when Sillery,
perceiving her intention, again possessed himself of
the ear of the Assembly; and it was ultimately concluded
that the double marriage should be proclaimed
on the 25th of March, and that the young Duc de
Mayenne<a id="footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a><a href="#footnote137">[137]</a> should proceed to Spain as Ambassador-Extraordinary
to demand the hand of the Infanta.</p>

<p>At the close of the Council the general topic of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>
discourse was the extraordinary part played by the
two Princes. It is well known that they were both
strongly opposed to the measure which had just
been carried, and their conduct was severally judged
according to the particular feeling of those by whom
it was discussed; some asserting that it was from a
fear of the consequences of resistance, and others
declaring that they indulged a hope of profiting
largely by so unexpected a neutrality. The Duc de
Montmorency was meanwhile furious at the contempt
incurred by the unmanly bearing of his son-in-law,
M. de Cond. "Sir," he said, as the Prince shortly
afterwards approached him, "you neither know how
to resist with courage, or to yield with prudence." <a id="footnotetag138" name="footnotetag138"></a><a href="#footnote138">[138]</a></p>

<p>An unforeseen difficulty, however, now presented
itself. The Spanish Cabinet no longer entertained
the same apprehensions of the power of France that
it had felt during the preceding year. The supremacy
which it had so reluctantly recognized had
ceased to exist, and the arrogance of Philip grew
with this conviction; thus, where he had only a few
months previously condescended to solicit, he now
prepared to impose conditions, and the renewed
negotiations were haughtily met by fresh proposals.
Upon the pretext that the Princesses of France
brought with them no right of succession to the
crown, he declared his disinclination to give the
hand of the elder Infanta to the young King, upon
which Marie de Medicis replied that she was willing
to accept his younger daughter as the bride of Louis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span>
XIII, provided that he, in his turn, were prepared to
receive the Princesse Christine instead of Madame,
as by this arrangement she should be enabled to
fulfil the pledge given by the late King to the Duke
of Savoy, that the eldest Daughter of France should
be united to the Prince of Piedmont.</p>

<p>This explicit declaration at once silenced Philip,
who was by no means desirous that Charles
Emmanuel, whom he was anxious to crush, should
by so close a connexion with France secure an ally
through whose support he could not fail to protect
himself against all aggression; and he accordingly
signified with somewhat less arrogance than before
that he was ready to ratify the original treaty, provided
that Anne of Austria were permitted to
renounce, both for herself and her children, all claim
to the sovereignty of Spain.</p>

<p>This point having been conceded, immediate
preparations were made for the proclamation of the
royal marriages; but the ceremony was unavoidably
delayed by the death of the Duke of Mantua, the
brother-in-law of the Regent, and did not take place
until the 5th of the following month,<a id="footnotetag139" name="footnotetag139"></a><a href="#footnote139">[139]</a> on which day
it was solemnly announced by the Chancellor, in the
presence of the Prince de Conti, the peers and
officers of the Crown, and the Spanish Ambassador,
who gave his assent to the duplicate alliance in the
name of the King his master, and from that period
treated the little Princess with all the honours due
to a Queen of Spain; never addressing her save on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>
his bended knee, and observing many still more
exaggerated ceremonies which excited at once surprise
and amusement at the French Court.</p>

<p>It will have been remarked that neither M. de
Cond nor the Comte de Soissons were present at
the formal announcement, both having once more
withdrawn from the capital with the determination of
continuing absent until the majority of the King,
in order to avoid signing the marriage contract.</p>

<p>"The Queen," said M. de Soissons, when one of
his friends would have dissuaded him from so extreme
a course, "is quite able to conclude without
our assistance the negotiation into which she has
entered. God grant that we at least may be
spared all participation in the slight offered to
the memory of the late King, by refusing to
falsify the pledge which he gave to the Duke of
Savoy, whose house has so long been the firm ally
of France."</p>

<p>Pity it is that this generous burst of high-mindedness
and loyalty will not bear analysis. Both
the Princes had discovered that the professions to
which they had so complacently listened, and which
had induced their recent return to Court, had merely
been intended to lure them thither at a period when
their presence was more than ever essential to the
interests of the Regency; and while M. de Cond
found his position in the Government as undefined
and unsatisfactory as ever, and that his vanity had
been flattered at the expense of his interests, the
Count on his side saw the possession of Quilleboeuf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span>
more remote than ever, and openly declared that
they had both been duped.</p>

<p>This undisguised admission at once revealed the
selfishness of the views with which the malcontent
Princes had lent themselves to the wishes of Marie
and her ministers; and assuredly no worse policy
could have been adopted than that by which they
were again induced to exile themselves from their
proper sphere of action. Too many interests were,
however, served by their absence for either counsellor
or courtier to point out to the Queen the extreme
danger of driving them to extremities, save in
the instance of the Conntable, who, more and more
chagrined by the pitiful and even precarious position
occupied by his son-in-law, remonstrated earnestly
with the Regent upon the peril of the course which
she had been induced to pursue.</p>

<p>"Remember, Madame," he said, "that the civil
wars and wretchedness of which this nation has been
the prey during the last few reigns all owed their
origin to the fatal advice given to Catherine de
Medicis to disregard the legitimate claims of the
Princes of the Blood; and those who would induce
your Majesty to follow her example are more bent
upon the furtherance of their own fortunes, and the increase
of their own power, than anxious for the welfare
of the state. Should your Majesty, therefore, suffer
yourself to be influenced by their counsels, I foresee
nothing in the future but anarchy and confusion."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the close alliance of the
veteran Duke with one of those very Princes whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span>
cause he thus warmly advocated, and his enmity
towards the Guises, deprived his remonstrances of
the force which they might otherwise have possessed,
and Marie de Medicis consequently disregarded the
warning until after-events caused her to feel and
acknowledge its value. Supported by the House of
Guise and the Duc d'Epernon, assured of the good
faith of the Conntable and the Marchaux de Bouillon
and de Lesdiguires, as well as deeply incensed by
the bearing of the two Princes in the Council; and,
moreover, urged by her more immediate favourites
to assert her dignity, and to display towards the
malcontents a coldness and indifference as marked
as that which they exhibited towards herself, she
dismissed the subject from her thoughts as one of
slight importance, and turned all her attention to
the brilliant festivities by which the declaration of
the royal marriages was to be celebrated.<a id="footnotetag140" name="footnotetag140"></a><a href="#footnote140">[140]</a></p>

<p>The besetting sin of Marie de Medicis was a love
of magnificence and display, and one of her greatest
errors a wilful disregard of the financial exigencies
which her profuse liberality had induced. Thus the
splendour of the preparations which were exciting
the wonder and curiosity of all Paris engrossed her
so wholly that she had little time for dwelling on
contingent evils. The departure of the Princes
had, moreover, relieved her from the annoyance of
encountering discontented countenances and repellent
frowns; and as she saw herself surrounded only
by beaming looks and complacent smiles, her spirits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span>
rose, and she began to believe that her long-indulged
vision of undisputed supremacy was about to be
realized.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant dream, and one in which the
self-deceived Regent was eagerly encouraged by
those around her. The halls and galleries of the
Louvre were crowded with animated and obsequious
courtiers, and the apartments of Marie herself
thronged by the greatest and proudest in the land;
all of whom appeared, upon so joyous an occasion,
to have laid aside their personal animosities and to
live only to obey her behests. Madame had also
formed her separate Court, in the midst of which she
received, with the grace of a girl and the premature
dignity of a Queen, the elaborate homage of her
future subjects; and meanwhile the young Louis,
delighted by a partial emancipation from ceremony
and etiquette for which he was indebted to the
unusual movement about him, pursued his favourite
sport of bird-hunting in the gardens of the Tuileries,
and attached more importance to the feats of a well-trained
sparrow-hawk than to the probable qualities
of the bride provided for him by the policy of his
royal mother.</p>

<p>And amid all this splendid excitement, gliding
from one glittering group to another with a quiet
self-possession and a calm composure strangely at
variance with the scene around her, moved a lady
whose remarkable appearance must have challenged
attention, even had her singular career not already
tended to make her an object of universal curiosity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span>
and speculation. Short of stature and slender of
form, with a step as light and noiseless as that of an
aerial being; her exquisitely-moulded although diminutive
figure draped in a robe of black velvet, made
after a fashion of which the severe propriety contrasted
forcibly with the somewhat too liberal
exposure of the period; with a countenance pale
almost to sallowness; delicately chiselled features;
and large eyes, encircled by a dark ring, only a few
shades less black than the long lashes by which they
were occasionally concealed; a mass of rich and
glossy hair, tightly banded upon her forehead, and
gathered together in a heavy knot, supported by
long bodkins tipped with jewels, low in her neck
behind; and above all, with that peculiar expression
spread over her whole person which is occasionally
to be remarked in individuals of that exceptional
organization which appears to be the lot of such as
are predestined to misery.</p>

<p>Not a Princess of the Blood, not a Duchess of
the realm, but had a smile and a courteous and
eager word to bestow upon this apparently insignificant
personage, at whose signal even the door of
the Queen's private closet, closed against other
intruders, opened upon the instant, as though she
alone of all that brilliant galaxy of rank and wealth
were to know no impediment, and to be subjected
to no delay.</p>

<p>We have been somewhat prolix in our description
of this extraordinary woman, but we shall be
pardoned when we explain that we here give the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span>
portrait of Leonora Galiga, Marquise d'Ancre, the
friend, confidante, and foster-sister of Marie de
Medicis.</p>

<p>It is, however, time to return to the festivities to
which allusion has already been made. Among these
the most remarkable was a splendid carousal which
took place in the Place Royale, and which is
elaborately described by Bassompierre. The French
Kings had originally held their tourneys, tilts, and
passages-at-arms in the Rue St. Antoine, opposite
the palace of the Tournelles; but the unfortunate
death of Henri II, who was killed there by the
lance of the Duc de Montgomery, caused the spot
to be abandoned, and they were subsequently transferred
to the Place Royale, which had been built in
the ancient park of the same palace.</p>

<p>The lists on the present occasion were two
hundred and forty feet in length, and were surrounded
by barriers and platforms arranged in
tiers, and reaching to the first stories of the
houses. Facing the lists was erected the magnificent
pavilion destined for their Majesties, which was
richly draped with blue and gold, and surmounted
by the great national standard, upon which the
eagles of Austria and the arms of the Medici were
proudly quartered with the <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> of France.</p>

<p>By command of the Queen the lists were held by
the Ducs de Guise and de Nevers and the Marquis
de Bassompierre, an honour which cost each of the
individuals thus favoured the enormous sum of fifty
thousand crowns; a fact which is easily understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>
when it is considered that their retinue consisted of
five hundred persons and two hundred horses, the
whole of whom, men and animals, were clad and
caparisoned in scarlet velvet and cloth of silver.
The number of spectators, exclusive of the Court
and the armed guards, was estimated at ten thousand;
and from nine in the morning until six in the
evening the lists were constantly occupied. Salvos
of artillery, fireworks, and allegorical processions
succeeded; and the populace, delighted by "the
glorious three days" of revel and relaxation thus
provided for them, forgot for the time to murmur at
an outlay which threatened them with increased
exactions.</p>

<p>At the termination of this carousal, which was
followed by balls, banquets, and tiltings at the ring,
the Court removed to Fontainebleau; where their
Majesties shortly afterwards received the Marquis
de Spinola, the Comte de Buquoy,<a id="footnotetag141" name="footnotetag141"></a><a href="#footnote141">[141]</a> and Don Rodrigo
Calderon,<a id="footnotetag142" name="footnotetag142"></a><a href="#footnote142">[142]</a> who were entertained with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span>
magnificence, and lodged in the house of Bassompierre.<a id="footnotetag143" name="footnotetag143"></a><a href="#footnote143">[143]</a>
At this period, indeed, everything sufficed
as a pretext for splendour and display; as
Marie de Medicis especially delighted to exhibit
the brilliancy of her Court to the subjects of the
nation with which she was about to become so intimately
allied. In this endeavour she was ably
seconded by the Guises and the Duc d'Epernon,
who, since the departure of the two Princes, had
shared her intimacy with the Marquis d'Ancre and
his wife; while a new candidate for her favour had
moreover presented himself in the person of the
young and handsome Chevalier de Guise, the
brother of the Duke,<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a><a href="#footnote144">[144]</a> who at this time first appeared
at Court, where he had the honour of waiting upon
her Majesty at table whenever she was the guest of
the Duchess his mother, or the Princesse de Conti
his sister. His youth, high spirit, inexhaustible
gaiety, and extraordinary personal beauty rendered
him peculiarly agreeable to Marie, who displayed
towards him a condescending kindness which was
soon construed by the Court gossips into a warmer
feeling.</p>

<p>Concini immediately took the alarm, and hastened
to confide his apprehensions to the ministers, whom
he knew to be as anxious as himself to undermine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span>
the influence of the Duc d'Epernon and the formidable
family to which he had allied his interests. In
ridding themselves, by neglect and disrespect, of
the Princes of the Blood, the discomfited confederates
had anticipated undivided sway over the mind
and measures of the Regent; and their mortification
was consequently intense when they discovered that
she had unreservedly flung herself into the party of
their enemies.</p>

<p>The annoyance of the ministers was, however,
based rather on public grounds than on personal
feeling; but the case was far different with the
Marquis, who had been reluctantly compelled to
acknowledge to himself that he was indebted for his
extraordinary fortune entirely to the influence of his
wife, and that he was individually of small importance
in the eyes of her royal mistress. This conviction
had soured his temper; and instead of
responding to the ardent affection of Leonora, he
had recently revenged his outraged vanity upon the
woman to whom he owed all the distinction he had
acquired. The high spirit of the Marquise revolted
at this ingratitude, and scenes of violence had consequently
occurred between them which tended to
increase the schism, and to render his position still
more precarious. The tears of Leonora were universally
all-powerful with the Queen, who did not
hesitate to express her indignation at the unbecoming
deportment of the aggrandized parvenu; upon
which, unaccustomed to rebuke, he threatened to
withdraw entirely from the Court and to reside at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span>
Amiens, a design which he, however, abandoned
when he discovered that it met with no opposition.</p>

<p>The Duc de Guise and the other members of his
family, rejoicing in these domestic discords, which
they trusted would ultimately tend to the disgrace
of the arrogant Italian whose undue elevation had
inspired them with jealousy and disgust, warmly
espoused the cause of Leonora, and exerted all their
power to irritate the mind of the Queen against the
offending Marquis. Nor was it long ere the ministers
adopted the same line of policy; and finally, Concini
found himself so harassed and contemned that he
resolved to attach himself to the party of the Princes,
and to aid them in their attempt to overturn the
Government.<a id="footnotetag145" name="footnotetag145"></a><a href="#footnote145">[145]</a></p>

<p>The Marchal de Bouillon had, as already stated,
been despatched to England, in order to render
James I. favourable to the alliance with Spain; and
at the same time with strict instructions to induce
him, should it be possible, to declare his displeasure
at the recent conduct of the Protestants at Saumur,
and especially at that of the Duc de Rohan. This
was a mission which Bouillon joyfully undertook,
his personal hatred and jealousy of the young Duke
warmly seconding the instructions of the ministers.
Rohan had, however, been warned in time of the
intention of his enemies; and being in constant
correspondence with Prince Henry, he hastened to
entreat his interest with his royal father to avert the
impending danger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span>
Unaware of this fact, the Marchal commenced
his harangue by assuring the English monarch of
the respect and attachment felt for his person by his
own sovereign and his august mother, and their
decided resolution that the alliance with Spain
should in no way interfere with the good understanding
which they were anxious to maintain with
the Protestant Princes. To this assurance James
listened complacently; and encouraged by his
evident satisfaction, the envoy proceeded to inform
him that he was moreover authorized to state that
the Pope had no intention of exercising any severity
against the reformed party in France, but would
confine himself to attempting their conversion by
means of the pulpit eloquence and good example of
the Roman priesthood. The satisfaction of James
increased as he listened, and when he had warmly
expressed his gratification at the intelligence,
Bouillon ventured to insinuate that the Regent had
been deeply wounded by the fact of his having
entered into the Protestant League of Germany;
and besought him, in her name, to be favourable to
his Catholic subjects.</p>

<p>At this point of the discourse James cautiously
replied that the League involved no question of
religion, but was purely a measure adopted for the
reciprocal security of the confederated states; and
that, as regarded the English Catholics, he would
willingly permit the peaceable exercise of their
faith in his dominions, so soon as they should have
given pledges of their fidelity and obedience. Still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span>
undismayed, Bouillon then exposed what was to
himself personally the most important feature of his
mission, and urged his Britannic Majesty to express
his disapproval of the proceedings of the Assembly
at Saumur, and especially of the attitude assumed
by the Duc de Rohan. Here, however, he was
fated to discover that James had not for a moment
been the dupe of his sophistical eloquence, ably as
it had been exerted. A cloud gathered upon the
brow of the English monarch, and as the Marchal
paused for a reply, he was startled by the coldness
and decision with which it was delivered.</p>

<p>"If the Queen your mistress," said James with
marked emphasis, "sees fit to infringe the edicts
accorded to the Protestants of her kingdom, I shall
not consider that the alliance into which I have
entered with France ought to prevent me from
assisting and protecting them. When my neighbours
are endangered from a cause in which I am
personally involved, I am naturally called upon to
avert an evil that may extend to myself. Believe
me, moreover, Marshal, when I say that you will be
wise to effect a reconciliation with the Due de
Rohan; and I shall cause him to understand that
such is my wish."</p>

<p>The ill-success of his mission was a bitter mortification
to M. de Bouillon, who, dispirited and crestfallen,
returned to Paris to report his failure. He,
however, met with no sympathy, the ministers declaring
that he had failed through his neglect of
their instructions, and of the express orders of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span>
Regent; while the Marchal complained on his side
that he had been selected for this delicate embassy
from the express intention, on the part of those who
inveighed against him, of accomplishing his disgrace.</p>

<p>M. de Lesdiguires also, at this period, discovered
that he had been the dupe of his own ambition, and
the tool of that of others. The ducal brevet of
which he had considered himself secure was refused
to him upon the plea that MM. de Brissac and de
Fervaques were both senior marshals to himself,
and that such a favour could not be conferred upon
him without exciting their indignation. Vainly did
he urge the promise made to him by Henri IV;
neither the Regent nor her ministers would yield;
when, irritated by the part which he had been made
to play while his co-operation was necessary to the
accomplishment of their measures, and the after-affront
to which he was thus subjected, he retired
from the Court in disgust, and transferred his
services to the Princes of the Blood.</p>

<p>As we have already stated, Concini had, although
less openly, followed the same course; but, in the
first instance, he had skilfully effected a reconciliation
with his wife, and induced her to assist him in
his endeavour to weaken the extraordinary influence
which the Duc d'Epernon and the Guises were
rapidly acquiring over the Regent, who willingly
forgot, amid the constant amusement and adulation
with which they surrounded her, the cares and
anxieties of government. The Duc de Vendme
had also attached himself to the Court party, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span>
this domestic league had consequently become
more formidable than ever in the eyes of those who
saw their interests compromised by its continuance.</p>

<p>Marie could not, however, conceal from herself
the absolute necessity of conciliating the disaffected
Princes before the arrival of the ambassador of
Philip, who was shortly expected to claim the hand
of Madame for the Prince of Spain; and she accordingly
determined to pave the way towards a reconciliation
by thwarting the ambition of the great nobles
who were obnoxious to the Princes. The first
opportunity that presented itself of adopting this
somewhat ungenerous policy was afforded by the Duc
de Vendme, who demanded the royal sanction to
preside over the States of Brittany, of which province
he was governor; but his intention having been discovered
by the Comte de Soissons and M. de
Cond, they lost no time in warning their friends at
Court against such a concession, and in reminding
them that he had allied himself with the enemies of
his royal father and the House of Bourbon; and that
his influence might prove fatal to the tranquillity of
the nation should he be permitted to exert it in a
distant province, where his personal consideration
and the enormous wealth of his wife must conduce
to render him all-powerful. These arguments were
impressed upon the Regent alike by the ministers
and by the Marquis d'Ancre, who no sooner saw
himself once more in favour than he exerted all his
influence to undermine the power of the rival
faction; and as her private views warmly seconded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span>
their representations, Marie instantly resolved to
refuse the coveted favour.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Duc de Vendme proffered
his request, the Queen met it with a cold denial,
and instructed M. de Brissac to proceed at once to
Brittany as his substitute; an affront which so stung
the Duke that he immediately challenged De Brissac;
but before the meeting could take place it was betrayed
to the Queen, who, irritated by this disregard
of her authority, would not be induced to wait until
a reconciliation could be effected between them, but
issued a peremptory order that M. de Vendme
should leave the Court on the instant, and retire to
his estate of Anet, and that the Marchal de Brissac
should forthwith proceed to Brittany. In vain did
the fiery young Prince explain and expostulate;
Marie was inexorable; and although the Ducs de
Guise and d'Epernon interceded in his behalf, they
were equally unsuccessful; nor did they discontinue
their entreaties until the Queen bade them rather
look to the stability of their own favour than hasten
its termination by upholding the cause of those who
rebelled against her pleasure.</p>

<p>This incident afforded unmitigated satisfaction to
the absent Princes; but to the Comte de Soissons
it was nevertheless only the herald of more important
concessions on the part of the Regent. In his
temporary retirement he had dwelt at leisure on his
imaginary wrongs; his hatred of the ministers had
increased; and, above all, he had vowed the ruin of
the Chancellor. In his nephew the Prince de Cond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span>
he found a willing listener and an earnest coadjutor;
but from a very different impulse. M. de Soissons
panted for power, and loathed every impediment to
the gratification of his ambition; while the young
Prince, less firm of purpose, and more greedy of
pleasure and ostentation, was wearied by the obscurity
of his existence, and the tedium of his self-imposed
exile.</p>

<p>Concini, with admirable tact, played upon the
weaknesses of both Princes, and augmented their
discontent; while he was at the same time careful
to exonerate the Regent from all blame. Conscious
that without her support he could not sustain for an
hour the factitious power to which he had attained,
he laboured incessantly to throw the whole odium of
the disunion upon the ministers, who were fully as
obnoxious to himself as to the Princes.</p>

<p>"They it is," he continually repeated, "who are
the true cause of your estrangement. The Queen
is, as I know, well disposed towards all the Princes
of the Blood; but Sillery, Villeroy, and Jeannin are
constantly representing to her the danger of allowing
you to become too powerful. Your real enemies
are the ministers who are fearful of affording you
the opportunity of overbalancing their influence."</p>

<p>This assurance was too flattering to the self-love
of the Princes to be repulsed; they forgot that
Concini himself had been as eager as those whom
he now inculpated to destroy their importance, and
to limit their power; they saw the great nobles,
whose ambition was disappointed, or whose vanity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span>
was wounded, successively espouse their cause, and
they were easily induced to believe that the time
was not far distant when they should triumph over
their opponents, and be repaid for all their mortifications.
This was precisely the frame of mind into
which Concini had endeavoured to bring them; and
so ably did he avail himself of his advantage that at
length, when on one occasion he found himself in
company with the Prince de Cond, the Comte de
Soissons, and the Marchaux de Bouillon and de
Lesdiguires, he induced them to unite with him in
attempting the ruin of the ministers.</p>

<p>He was, moreover, powerfully abetted in his intrigue
by the Duke of Savoy; who, outraged at the
insult which had been offered to him by the Regent
in bestowing the hand of Madame Elisabeth, which
had been solemnly promised to the Prince of
Piedmont, upon the Infant of Spain; and who,
moreover, hoped to profit by the internal dissensions
of France, and to recover through the medium of
the disaffected Princes the provinces which Henri
IV had compelled him to relinquish in exchange for
the marquisate of Saluzzo, omitted no opportunity
of endeavouring to foment a civil war; from which,
while he had nothing to apprehend, he had the
prospect of reaping great personal advantage.</p>

<p>Thus supported, Concini, who was aware of the
intimate relations subsisting between Charles Emmanuel
and the Comte de Soissons, did not hesitate
to urge the Princes to a resolute resistance; nor was
this seed of rebellion scattered upon sterile soil. M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span>
de Soissons pledged himself that on his return from
Normandy, where he was about to sojourn for a
short time, he would publicly insult the Chancellor;
while M. de Lesdiguires, who was still furious at
the disappointment to which he had been subjected,
and who was about to return to Dauphiny,
volunteered, should the Princes decide upon
enforcing their claims, to march ten thousand
infantry and fifteen hundred horse to the gates
of Paris.</p>

<p>Nor did the vindictive Italian confine his efforts
to thus tampering with the disaffected Princes; he
was equally indefatigable with the Regent, who,
even had she been disinclined to regard his own
representations, never neglected those of her beloved
Leonora; and who was, moreover, the better
disposed to yield to his arguments because she saw
her foster-sister once more happy, and believed that
the affection of the Marquis had been restored to
his wife through her own influence.</p>

<p>Success rendered Concini bold. He was aware
that he had secured a strong hold upon the confidence
and regard of the malcontents; but when he
found the Queen inclined to make concessions in
their favour which threatened to invest them with a
power as dangerous to his own interests as that now
wielded by the ministers, he did not hesitate to dissuade
her from her purpose. Anxious to conciliate
the Comte de Soissons, Marie declared her determination
to effect this desirable result by bestowing
upon him the government of Ouilleboeuf, the refusal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span>
of which had been the original cause of his estrangement;
a resolve from which she was, however,
diverted by the representations of the Italian that
such a concession, thus tardily and reluctantly made,
must be fatal to her dignity, and would only lead to
fresh demands on the part of the Prince, whose insatiable
ambition was no secret; while, fearful lest
his own representations should fail to change her
purpose, he employed his confidential friend and
ally the Baron de Luz to entreat of the Due de
Guise to second his endeavour. In this attempt,
however, the Marquis failed through an excess of
subtlety, as the Duke, outraged by this double
treason, not only refused to lend himself to so dishonourable
an act of treachery, but immediately
informed M. de Soissons of the deceit which was
practised towards him; and feeling deeply aggrieved
moreover by the affront that had been offered to
Csar de Vendme, he declared himself prepared to
espouse the cause of the Princes against the
machinations of the Marquis d'Ancre. His example
was followed by the whole of his family, as well as
by the Cardinal de Joyeuse and the Due de Bellegarde;
and thus the unfortunate Regent was suddenly
deprived of all her friends with the sole
exception of the Duc d'Epernon, who, either from
an excess of pride which would not permit him to
humble himself so far as to induce him to pay his
court to the Princes from whom he had received so
many and such bitter mortifications, or from the
state of indisposition under which he was at that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span>
period labouring, refused to take any share in the
intrigues of the Court.</p>

<p>Concini became alarmed; he had so long been
the spoilt child of fortune that every reverse overthrew
his self-possession; and in the first paroxysm
of his terror he considered himself lost. Chance
and his own ready cunning still, however, stood his
friends. The Grand Equerry (Bellegarde) was, with
the insane superstition of the time, accused of having
suborned witnesses to prove that the Marquis had
endeavoured by means of a magic mirror to inspire
some of the highest ladies of the Court with a
passion for his person; and as Concini demanded
reparation for this injury, an investigation was instituted,
to effect which it was necessary that summonses
should be issued to the witnesses. Sillery,
to whom the Italian was peculiarly obnoxious, and
who was the friend of the Duc de Bellegarde, made
some difficulty when called upon to affix the official
seal to these documents; upon which Concini
hastened to complain to the Regent that the Chancellor
was endeavouring to sacrifice him to his
enemies; and Marie, indignant no less at the apparent
injustice shown to her favourite than at the
delay evinced in obeying her commands, made no
attempt to disguise her displeasure.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Comte de Soissons, who
still hoped to obtain from the courtesy, or to wring
from the fears, of the Regent the promised government
of Quilleboeuf, made a voyage into Normandy,
which so alarmed the Marchal de Fervaques, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span>
held the city, and who apprehended that the Prince
was about to possess himself of it by force, that he
privately reinforced the garrison; a fact which M.
de Soissons no sooner ascertained than he bitterly
upbraided the Marchal, and a quarrel ensued
between them that produced new difficulties.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Marie de Medicis was at this
moment surrounded by evil and interested advisers,
by whom she was induced to embroil herself, not
only with the Princes of the Blood and great nobles,
but also with the Parliament, and eventually with
the Protestants. The misunderstanding which had
arisen between the Duc de Rohan and the Marchal
de Bouillon unhappily produced a disunion among
the Huguenot party which laid them open to the
machinations of their enemies; and Marie, whose zeal
for the Romish communion always made her eager
to harass and oppress the Protestants, was readily
persuaded to undertake the annullation of the edicts
by which their allegiance had hitherto been secured.
Bouillon had never forgiven the Duc de Rohan for
the energetic part which he had played at the
Assembly of Saumur; and secure of his influence
over the mind of the Regent, who felt grateful for
the offer of his services upon that occasion, and the
efforts which he had made to carry out her wishes,
he resolved to undermine the interests of the young
Duke, and to attempt to deprive him of his government
of St. Jean-d'Angly which had been bestowed
upon him by Henri IV.</p>

<p>Apprised of his intention, M. de Rohan hastened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>
to Court in order to justify himself, but the mind of
Marie had been poisoned against him, and she treated
his remonstrances with chilling indifference. Aware
that the mayor of the town had been bought by his
enemies, and that should that official be continued
in his authority he must himself inevitably lose his
government, and thereby forfeit all his influence, the
Duke no sooner saw the period of the municipal
election approach than, pretexting the dangerous illness
of his brother, he took his leave of the Court
and hastened back to St. Jean-d'Angly in order to
compel the retirement of the obnoxious functionary.
As he had anticipated, on the day of the canvass a
letter was received from the ministers, ordaining the
re-election of the mayor without modification or
explanation of any kind; an affront which so exasperated
M. de Rohan that he at once resisted its
enforcement; declaring that the Regent had been
misinformed with regard to the state of the town,
which, according to the terms of the letter, was inferred
to be divided into parties; and that, as he
would undertake to convince her Majesty of the
error under which she laboured, they had only to
proceed at once to a new election.</p>

<p>Bouillon had been prepared for this opposition;
and found it easy to induce Marie, whose jealousy
of power always rendered her on such occasions as
the present a mere tool in the hands of her <i>soi-disant</i>
friends, to forward a second and more stringent order
for the continuance in office of the existing mayor.
The Duke, however, persisted in disregarding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>
mandate; and after having despatched his secretary
to the Louvre to explain the reasons of his resistance,
he proceeded to authorize the nomination of three
persons, all eligible for the office, in order that the
Regent might make her own selection; and, while
awaiting her reply, the keys of the city were confided
to the senior sheriff; and he found himself complete
master of the place.<a id="footnotetag146" name="footnotetag146"></a><a href="#footnote146">[146]</a></p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the indignation of Marie
de Medicis on learning this contempt of her authority.
The messengers of M. de Rohan were forthwith
committed to the Bastille; orders were issued to the
Duchess his mother, to his wife, and to his sisters,
not to leave the capital; and preparations were even
made to besiege the Duke in St. Jean-d'Angly as
a rebel. Manifestoes to the Protestants were next
put forth by both parties; that of the Queen-mother
protesting that the aggressive measures
which she was about to adopt involved no question
of faith, but were destined to be directed simply
against M. de Rohan as an individual; and that
consequently they would in no degree affect the
edicts of pacification, which would be rigidly
observed; and calling upon all faithful subjects
of the King, whatever might be their religious
persuasion, to aid and abet the effort by which she
trusted to subdue the nascent rebellion threatened
by so gross a disregard of the constituted authorities
of the realm. The Duke, on his side, threw himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span>
upon the justice and generosity of his co-religionists,
reminding them that it was through zeal for their
common faith that he had incurred the resentment
of the Court; and having so done, he hastened to
place the city in such a state of defence as should
enable him to resist the attack of the royal troops.</p>

<p>The resolute position thus assumed by M. de
Rohan alarmed the ministers; who apprehensive
that the neighbouring provinces, already disaffected
by the negative result of the Assembly of Saumur,
would support the cause of so bold a recusant, and
thus renew the civil war by which the nation had
formerly been convulsed, became anxious to
temporize. Negotiations were accordingly commenced
between the adverse factions; and it was
ultimately agreed that the keys of the city should
be restored to the mayor from whom they had been
taken, and some subaltern officers displaced by the
Duke reinstated in their functions, and that so soon
as this arrangement had been completed a new
election should take place, by which M. de Rohan
was to be at liberty to substitute others more
agreeable to himself. This absurd ceremony was
accordingly performed; the royal authority was
supposed to have enforced its recognition; and the
Duke, by a merely visionary concession, preserved
his government.<a id="footnotetag147" name="footnotetag147"></a><a href="#footnote147">[147]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the young Duc de Mayenne had taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span>
leave of the Court, and departed with a brilliant suite
for Madrid, to demand the hand of the Infanta for the
King of France; and on the same day the Duque de
Pastrano left the Spanish capital on his way to Paris
to solicit that of Madame Elisabeth for the Prince of
Spain.</p>

<p>The ducal envoy reached the French capital early
in the month of July, accompanied by his brothers
Don Francisco and Don Diego de Silva and a
number of Spanish grandees, having been received
with extraordinary honours in every town which
he had traversed after passing the frontier. The
Ducs de Luxembourg<a id="footnotetag148" name="footnotetag148"></a><a href="#footnote148">[148]</a> and de Nevers met him
beyond the gate of the city, accompanied by five
hundred nobles on horseback, sumptuously attired
in velvet and cloth of gold and silver, with their
horses splendidly caparisoned. The retinue of the
Iberian grandee was not, however, as the French
courtiers had fondly flattered themselves that it
would have been, eclipsed by the lavish magnificence
of their own appearance, his personal costume
being of the most splendid description, his horses
and equipages costly and gorgeous, and his numerous
train of attendants habited in a livery of extreme
richness.</p>

<p>On the 16th of the month the Spanish Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span>
had his first audience of the young King, at which
were assembled the Princes of the Blood, all the
high nobility of France, and the Cardinals de
Sourdis and de Gondy.<a id="footnotetag149" name="footnotetag149"></a><a href="#footnote149">[149]</a> The two latter dignitaries
endeavoured to excuse themselves, on the pretext
that their rank as Princes of the Church would not
permit them to seat themselves below the Princes
of the Blood; but this pretension on their part was
considered so monstrous, even by the Regent
herself, that, anxious as she was to secure their
attendance in order to render the ceremony more
imposing to the Spanish envoy, she did not venture
to support them in their arrogant assumption of
equality with the first subjects of the Crown; and
she accordingly informed them in reply that upon
the present occasion there would be no regard paid
to precedence, but that each individual who was
entitled to attend the audience would be at liberty
to seat himself as he saw fit.</p>

<p>Thus assured, the two prelates, attired in their
rich robes of violet-coloured velvet, entered the hall;
and were about to take their places near the royal
das, when the Princes of the Blood, led by M. de
Cond, hastily passed them, and ranged themselves
in a line on the right hand of the King. The
Cardinals then proceeded to adopt a similar position
beside the Queen-Regent, but they were immediately
displaced by the Dowager Princess of Cond, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>
daughter-in-law, and Madame de Conti; and upon
finding themselves thus excluded from the immediate
neighbourhood of the sovereign, they withdrew in
great displeasure, no effort being made to detain them.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only altercation which took place
before the commencement of the ceremony; and
the one which we are about to relate is so characteristic
of the manners of that age among the great,
that it must not be omitted. The Duc de Nevers
had taken his place upon the bench appropriated to
the Princes of the Blood, immediately below M.
de Soissons, who, being engaged in conversation
with his brother, the Prince de Conti, did not
remark the intrusion. M. de Cond, however, who
was seated above his two uncles, at once discovered
the enormity of which the Duke had been guilty,
and he forthwith commenced pushing the Prince de
Conti so violently that he excited his attention; and
his purpose was no sooner understood than his
example was imitated with an energy which was
instantly communicated to the Comte de Soissons,
who in his turn so pressed upon M. de Nevers that
he became extremely irritated, and demanded why
he was subjected to such ungracious treatment.</p>

<p>"Because this is not a place for you," haughtily
retorted the Prince de Cond.</p>

<p>The Duc de Nevers made a bitter rejoinder, and
high words ensued, which were at length terminated
by the Prince, who said significantly: "We can
explain ourselves better elsewhere, M. le Duc;
follow me."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span>

<p>The conversation had, however, been overheard
by the Marchal de Bouillon, who hastened to
inform the King that the two Princes had retired for
a hostile purpose; upon which Louis ordered them
to be instantly recalled, and after having rebuked
M. de Nevers for assuming a place to which he was
not entitled, insisted upon their immediate reconciliation.<a id="footnotetag150" name="footnotetag150"></a><a href="#footnote150">[150]</a></p>

<p>The Duque de Pastrano was then introduced by
M. de Guise and his two brothers; and after the usual
ceremony of welcome on the one side and obeisance
on the other, he presented to the King and his
royal mother the letters with which he had been
entrusted by his sovereign. Thence he proceeded
to the apartments of Madame Elisabeth, where he
delivered the missives of the Prince of Spain; after
which he was conducted to the presence of the other
Children of France; and finally, having paid his
respects to every member of the royal family, he
was attended by a brilliant retinue of nobles to the
residence which had been appropriated to his use
during his sojourn in the capital.</p>

<p>So unparalleled was the splendour displayed upon
this occasion, that the year 1612 was long known in
Europe as "the year of magnificence," the festivities
having been alike gorgeous throughout France,
Spain, and Naples; and considerable mortification
was experienced in the former kingdom when it
was ascertained, on the return of the Duc de
Mayenne, that the display made in Paris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span>
extraordinary as it was, could not equal that exhibited at
Lerma and Madrid. In the former city the favourite
of Philip had received the French envoy in his own
palace, and had lodged him in an apartment hung
with tapestry of silk and gold, intermingled with
emeralds and rubies. In Madrid it is true that
the mourning still worn for the late Queen somewhat
modified the brilliancy of the spectacle; but as
every effort had been made to counteract the effect
of this drawback, it became rather a singular feature
than an actual blot upon the gorgeousness of the
spectacle presented by the Spanish capital.<a id="footnotetag151" name="footnotetag151"></a><a href="#footnote151">[151]</a></p>

<p>On the 25th of August the marriage articles were
signed between Madame Elisabeth and the Prince
of Spain, the dowry of the girl-bride being five
hundred thousand golden crowns; after which the
Duque de Pastrano, laden with magnificent presents,
and satiated with pleasure and festivity, took his
leave of the French Court, and left Paris on his
return to Madrid.</p>

<p>The contract between Louis XIII and the
Infanta was meanwhile completed on the 22d of
the month in the Spanish capital; and at the close
of the ceremony the Duc de Mayenne was conducted
to an audience-chamber in which Philip was seated
with the betrothed Prince and Princess on his right
and left, awaiting his arrival. After having profoundly
saluted the King in perfect silence, the
Duke approached the Infanta, to whom he addressed
himself as to the Queen of France. His compliment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg 212]</span>
was courteously received; and before the termination
of this private audience, when on taking leave
he would have bent his knee and kissed the hand
of the sovereign and his son, each in succession
saluted him upon the cheek; an honour as great as
it was unexpected, particularly in a Court where
the observances of strict etiquette were more rigidly
enforced than elsewhere in Europe.</p>

<p>The festivities consequent upon the double betrothal
occupied several days, and they no sooner
came to a close than the French envoy demanded a
parting audience of his future sovereign, at which he
entreated of her to entrust him with some letter or
message for the King his master.</p>

<p>"Tell him," said the Princess eagerly, "that I
am very impatient to see him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Madame!" exclaimed the Condesa d'Altamira,
her <i>gouvernante</i>, "what will his Majesty of
France think of your Royal Highness when my
Lord Duke informs him that you are in such haste
to become a wife?"</p>

<p>"You have always taught me to tell the truth,"
was the ready retort; and charged with this sincere
and singular communication, M. de Mayenne returned
to Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>The Duke of Savoy had no sooner ascertained
that the hand of Madame Elisabeth was definitely
pledged to the Spanish Prince than he declared to
the Queen-Regent his readiness to receive that of
the Princesse Christine for his own son; and for
awhile Marie had affected to favour the alliance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span>
but her great ambition was to see each of her
daughters upon a throne, and she had accordingly
entered into a negotiation with the English monarch
for effecting a marriage between the younger Princess
and Henry, Prince of Wales, who was about to be
betrothed to the Princess of Savoy. She was the
more encouraged to hope for the success of this
proposal as James had already been a candidate
for the hand of her elder daughter; nor was
she deterred by the knowledge that the Grand
Duke of Tuscany<a id="footnotetag152" name="footnotetag152"></a><a href="#footnote152">[152]</a> had offered one of his
sisters, with an enormous dowry, to the British
Prince.<a id="footnotetag153" name="footnotetag153"></a><a href="#footnote153">[153]</a></p>

<p>So eager, indeed, was Marie de Medicis to effect
this alliance for the Princesse Christine, that the
English Ambassador did not hesitate to declare to
his Government that from the manner in which the
affair had been urged upon him by M. de Villeroy,
he felt a conviction that his royal master might
conclude the treaty of marriage whenever he considered
it expedient to do so, and might moreover
make whatever conditions he thought proper.</p>

<p>While the negotiations were still pending, however,
the lamentable death of the high-spirited and
promising young Prince terminated at once the
struggle for his hand; and Marie de Medicis, to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span>
undisguised regret, found herself unable to realize
one of her most cherished hopes.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November the Comte de Soissons,
who was suddenly attacked by scarlet fever while
still engaged in projects of ambition and revenge,
also breathed his last; an event which was destined
to effect a complete change in the aspect of the
Court. By his decease the governments of Dauphiny
and Normandy, as well as the appointment of Grand
Master of the King's Household, became vacant;
and four-and-twenty hours had not elapsed before
as many claimants presented themselves, eager to
secure these coveted honours. The Prince had,
however, left an infant son, to whom the Queen-Regent
immediately transferred both the government
of Dauphiny and the place at Court recently
held by his father. As regarded Normandy, she
resolved to retain it in her own hands, and to
appoint a lieutenant-governor to whom she could
confide the command of the province; but she had
no sooner declared her intention than she was met
by the expostulations of M. de Conti, who reminded
her that having formerly ceded the government of
Dauphiny to the Comte de Soissons at her request,
he considered himself entitled to succeed to that
which had now become available by his death.</p>

<p>Determined to retain her possession of the province,
and yet fearful of exciting once more the
resentment of the Princes of the Blood, the
Regent was compelled to propose a compromise,
which, after some hesitation, was accepted by M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span>
de Conti. It will be remembered that the Comte
d'Auvergne, Charles de Valois, recently become
Duc d'Angoulme, had been committed to the
Bastille by Henri IV for conspiring with his father
and sister against the person of the King and the
tranquillity of the realm; nor is it probable that
Marie de Medicis would have felt the slightest
inclination to show any indulgence to the step-brother
of Madame de Verneuil, had it not on the
present occasion been a matter of policy to do so.
The Marquis de Coeuvres was accordingly instructed
to visit him in his prison, and to offer him
his liberty provided he would resign to the Prince
de Conti his government of Auvergne; and although
the Duke at first evinced extreme reluctance to
comply with this condition, he was ultimately induced
to yield to the solicitations of the royal envoy, who
convinced him that the freedom for which he yearned
so eagerly could be purchased at no other price.<a id="footnotetag154" name="footnotetag154"></a><a href="#footnote154">[154]</a></p>

<p>The body of the Comte de Soissons was conveyed
to the Chartreuse at Gaillon, and there deposited in
the tomb of his ancestors;<a id="footnotetag155" name="footnotetag155"></a><a href="#footnote155">[155]</a> and before the close of
the month the Queen-Regent assisted, at the Htel
de Soissons in Paris, at the baptism of his son, which
was celebrated in the presence of all the most distinguished
personages of the Court.<a id="footnotetag156" name="footnotetag156"></a><a href="#footnote156">[156]</a></p>

<p>At this period a new cabal was organized which
effectually neutralized all attempt at opposition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span>
The chief of this formidable faction was the Prince
de Cond; and it was moreover composed of the
Ducs de Nevers, de Mayenne, and de Longueville,
the Marchal de Bouillon, and the Marquis d'Ancre.
By this combination of rank, influence, and favour,
the Guises, the Duc d'Epernon, and their adherents
saw themselves thrown into the background, and
threatened with utter annihilation as a political
party. The Conntable de Montmorency, who
believed the power of the Guises to be firmly
established, and who had consequently allied himself
to their interests, was absent in Languedoc, of
which province he was governor; while the Grand
Equerry, M. de Bellegarde, who was also their friend,
was sojourning in Burgundy; and thus they found
themselves exposed, almost without support, to the
evil offices of the rival faction. The Queen openly
espoused the cause of M. de Cond and his party,
while the ministers soon saw themselves utterly
deprived of both influence and credit; and at length,
seriously alarmed by the posture of affairs, the Duc
de Guise wrote to entreat M. de Bellegarde to
return with all speed to Paris, in order to assist him
in his endeavour to overthrow the rapidly-growing
power of their mutual adversaries. M. le Grand
was preparing to comply with this request, when an
order to the same effect reached him from the
Regent, which tended to hasten his departure; but
on arriving at Sens he was met by one of his friends,
who warned him not to trust himself in the capital,
as he had only been recalled in order that he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg 217]</span>
either be bribed or frightened into the resignation of
his government, of which the Marquis d'Ancre had
undertaken to effect the transfer to the Duc de
Mayenne.</p>

<p>In consequence of this intimation M. le Grand,
instead of appearing at Court in compliance with the
royal mandate, returned in all haste to Languedoc,
and the Duc de Guise found himself deprived of his
anticipated assistance.<a id="footnotetag157" name="footnotetag157"></a><a href="#footnote157">[157]</a> Bellegarde himself, who
attributed this attempt to deprive him of his government
to the Baron de Luz&mdash;who through the
influence of Bassompierre had been reinstated in
the favour of the Queen, and had consequently
abandoned the faction of the Guises, of whose
projects and designs he was cognizant, in order to
espouse the interests and to serve the ambition of
the Marquis d'Ancre&mdash;vowed vengeance against
the recreant baron, and complained bitterly to his
friends of the insult to which he had been subjected
through this unworthy agency.</p>

<p>The Guises, already apprehensive of the consequences
which might accrue to themselves from the
defection of M. de Luz, were only too ready to
sympathize with the indignant Duke, and unfortunately
for all parties they did not confine their
sympathy to mere words. Ever prompt and reckless,
they at once resolved to revenge themselves upon
their common enemy; nor was it long ere they
carried their fatal determination into effect.</p>

 Don Rodrigo Calderon was a statesman rendered famous by his
extraordinary elevation and his equally remarkable reverses. Born
at Antwerp, the son of a Spanish trooper and a Flemish woman of
low extraction, his talents ultimately raised him to the rank of confidant
and favourite of the Duque de Lerma, prime minister of Philip
III, through whose influence he subsequently became Cond d'Oliva,
Marques de Siete-Iglesias, and secretary of state. In 1618 the disgrace
of his patron involved his own ruin. Accused of having
poisoned the Queen Marguerite, he was (in 1619) committed to a
dungeon, and two years afterwards was sacrificed by the Conde-Duque
d'Olivars to the public hatred against the Duque de Lerma. He
perished upon the scaffold in 1621.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span>
The state of France at the commencement of the
year 1613 was precarious in the extreme. As yet
no intestine war had broken out, but there existed a
sullen undercurrent of discontent and disaffection
which threatened, like the sound of distant thunder,
to herald an approaching storm. The Court was,
as we have shown, the focus of anarchy and confusion;
the power and resources of the great nobles
had steadily increased since the death of Henri IV,
and had they only been united among themselves,
the authority of Marie de Medicis must have been
set at nought, and the throne of the boy-King have
tottered to its base. The provinces were, in many
instances, in open opposition to the Government;
the ministers indignant at the disrespect shown alike
to their persons and to their functions; the Parliament
jealous of the encroachments on its privileges;
the citizens outraged by the lavish magnificence,
and indignant at the insolent assumption of the
nobility; and the people irritated and impoverished
by the constant exactions to which they were
subjected in order to supply the exigencies of the
state.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of a kingdom dependent
for its prosperity upon the rule of a favourite-ridden
woman, and a helpless child.</p>

<p>We have already stated the anxiety of the Guises
to revenge themselves upon M. de Luz; and we
have now to relate the tragedy which supervened
upon this resolution. It appears to be the common
fate of all favourites to accelerate their own ruin by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>
personal imprudence; nor was M. de Luz destined
to prove an exception. His life had been a varied
one; but the spirit of intrigue and enterprise with
which he was endowed had enabled him to bid
defiance to adverse fortune, and to struggle successfully
against every reverse. Patient under disappointment
because strong in his confidence of
future compensation, he was less cautious in his
more prosperous moments; and in one of these he
was unhappy enough to afford a pretext for the
violence of the enemies who had vowed his ruin.</p>

<p>Disregarding the presence of the Chevalier de
Guise, or perhaps unconscious of his propinquity,
De Luz, shortly after the return of the Duc de Bellegarde
to Languedoc, was relating to a group of
nobles, who were lounging away the time in the
great gallery of the Louvre while awaiting the
appearance of the King, the circumstances which
preceded the assassination of the Duc de Guise at
Blois; boasting that he was present with the
Marchal de Brissac when Henri III decided upon
the murder, and had even prevented the former
from intimating his danger to the intended victim.
The Chevalier, who was young, impetuous, and, like
all the members of his house, utterly careless of the
consequences of his actions, would have felt himself
justified in demanding satisfaction of M. de Luz
simply for the insult offered to his brothers and himself
by his abrupt and unscrupulous abandonment
of their interests, and the affront given to their
friend and ally the Duc de Bellegarde; but when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>
to these real or imagined injuries was superadded
the fact that he had publicly boasted of the share
which he had gratuitously and wantonly taken in
the murder of his father, no wonder that the fiery
young man, disregarding alike the royal edicts
against duelling and the dictates of humanity, at
once resolved to silence the vauntings of the quasi-assassin,
or to perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>At the moment in which he volunteered the fatal
communication De Luz was protected by the roof
that covered him. It was certain death to any
individual, whatever might be his rank, who drew a
hostile weapon within the precincts of the royal
palace; and De Guise was aware that by such an act
of imprudence he might forfeit all hope of vengeance.
He affected, consequently, not to have overheard
the imprudent admission of the baron, and controlled
the impulse which would have led him to fell him as
he stood; but his thirst of vengeance only became
the more unquenchable by delay, and he watched the
movements of his destined victim with an assiduity
which soon enabled him to slake it.</p>

<p>On the 5th of January, at mid-day, his carriage
encountered that of M. de Luz in the Rue St.
Honor, when he immediately summoned him to
alight and defend himself; and at the second pass
stretched him lifeless at his feet.<a id="footnotetag158" name="footnotetag158"></a><a href="#footnote158">[158]</a></p>

<p>The Regent, who since she had pardoned M. de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg 222]</span>
Luz had found him a most zealous and efficient
adherent, was angered beyond measure, not only at
the wilful disregard of the royal authority exhibited
by the Chevalier, but also at the loss of an active
and useful agent; and the intelligence had no
sooner reached her than, rising from her dinner,
which she had just commenced when the news was
brought, she burst into tears, and retired to her
closet. When she had become somewhat more
calm she assembled the Council, by which she was
advised to refer the matter to the Parliament; but
while the subject was under deliberation tidings
reached the Louvre that a numerous body of nobles
had assembled at the htel of the Duc de Guise,
who was himself about to set forth for the palace
attended by a strong party of his friends. Alarmed
at the prospect of such a demonstration, which bore
the semblance of an enforcement of impunity rather
than of a deprecation of justice, the Queen was
entreated by those around her to despatch M. de
Chteauvieux to the residence of the Duc de
Guise, to forbid his approach to the royal presence
until formally summoned to appear; and to command
in her name that all the persons who had
assembled under his roof should immediately retire.</p>

<p>The Regent followed this advice, and on his
return to the palace M. de Chteauvieux reported
that he had rigidly performed his duty; that the
Duke had abandoned his intention of demanding
an audience of her Majesty; and that although
many of those by whom he was surrounded had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>
originally refused to obey her commands, they had
ultimately been induced to do so by the persuasions
of M. de Guise himself, who represented the
propriety of their compliance with her will; with
the sole exception of M. de la Rochefoucauld<a id="footnotetag159" name="footnotetag159"></a><a href="#footnote159">[159]</a> who
had declined to quit the htel.</p>

<p>The Queen immediately issued an order for his
exile from the Court, which was communicated to
him upon the instant; nor was her indignation
towards the Duc de Guise appeased, even upon
learning that he had evinced the greatest respect
for her authority, and the most perfect submission
to her will; or that when, after his encounter with
M. de Luz, the Chevalier had presented himself at
his htel and claimed his protection, he had refused
to receive him, or in any way to countenance the
crime of which he had been guilty.</p>

<p>The displeasure of the Regent was, moreover,
greatly excited by the Chancellor, who had evinced
no disposition to proceed against M. de Guise; and
she accordingly declared her determination to
deprive him of the seals, and to bestow them upon
some individual who would perform his duty more
efficiently. For this purpose she secretly summoned
the Prince de Cond, the Duc de Bouillon, and
the Marquis d'Ancre to the Louvre, the whole of
whom approved her intention; and it was arranged
that M. de Cond should demand the seals, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>
the same time command the Chancellor in the name
of their Majesties to retire to one of his estates. It
was, moreover, resolved that Marie should name a
day when she would dine at the htel of Zamet, and
that on her way she should enter the Bastille and
cause the arrest of the Duc d'Epernon, who had
only a week previously returned to Court, after a
serious illness. The accomplishment of these hasty
measures was, however, frustrated by the ambition
of the Marquis d'Ancre, who was desirous of replacing
the Chancellor by some creature of his own,
while his wife was equally anxious that the vacant
dignity should be conferred upon a person who was
obnoxious to the Duc de Bouillon; and as it was
necessary that in order to effect their purpose they
should each propose the same individual, so much
time was lost that Marie had leisure to reconsider
her intention, and to abandon it.<a id="footnotetag160" name="footnotetag160"></a><a href="#footnote160">[160]</a></p>

<p>The Marquis d'Ancre had, however, aggravated
her displeasure against M. de Guise by introducing
to her presence the son of the murdered man, who
threw himself at her feet, weeping bitterly, and
demanding justice.</p>

<p>The woman-heart of Marie de Medicis was
deeply moved; and while her anger increased
against the Guises, her sympathy for the sufferer
before her melted her to tears. Bidding him take
comfort, she promised all he asked; and before he
withdrew conferred upon him the offices and</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg 226]</span>
<p>pensions of his father, assuring him that he might
thenceforward rely upon her protection.</p>

<p>At the close of a few days Bassompierre, who
was First Gentleman of the Chamber to the Regent,
and greatly in her confidence; and who was anxious
to reinstate the Duc de Guise in her favour, on
account of his attachment to the Princesse de
Conti,<a id="footnotetag161" name="footnotetag161"></a><a href="#footnote161">[161]</a> ventured to impress upon his royal mistress,
not only the inexpediency of utterly estranging from
her interests so powerful a family, but also the
policy of recognizing with indulgence and pardon
the ready obedience and loyalty of the Duke, who
had not scrupled to sacrifice the safety of a brother
to whom he was tenderly attached to his sense of
duty towards herself. Marie suffered him to
proceed for some time in silence; but at length his
zeal was rewarded by her consent to receive M. de
Guise, and to listen to his offered justification,
provided he came to the Louvre at nightfall, and
alone.</p>

<p>After expressing his deep sense of this concession
Bassompierre hastened to communicate his
success to the Duke, who lost no time in presenting
himself before his offended mistress; and so ably
did he plead his cause, replacing his accustomed
haughtiness and impetuosity by a demeanour at
once respectful and submissive, that Marie de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span>
Medicis, whose attachment to his house had long
been notorious, declared herself satisfied, and
assured him that thenceforward she should hold him
exonerated from any participation in the crime of
his brother. Upon one point, however, the Regent
remained firm; and although the Duke earnestly
implored the recall of M. de la Rochefoucauld, he
was met by so decided a refusal that he was
compelled to abandon all immediate hope of success.
He had, nevertheless, save in this respect, every
reason to congratulate himself upon his reception;
and the affair would probably have elicited no
further consequences, had not the Duchess his
mother, whose pride of birth, and natural arrogance,
led her to believe herself inferior to no crowned
head in Europe, and who ill-brooked the authority
of one whom she was accustomed to consider as a
mere petty Princess, indebted to circumstances for
her temporary position of command, resolved to
demand an interview upon the same subject; which
having been accorded by the Regent, renewed with
greater violence than ever the anger of Marie, who,
justly irritated at finding herself defied and braved
by one of her own subjects, dismissed the imprudent
Duchess with so much harshness that the
position of the offending parties became more
onerous than before, and the interference of Bassompierre
was rendered worse than useless.</p>

<p>Disconcerted by this unexpected disappointment,
M. de Guise, aware that no influence less than that
possessed by the Marquis d'Ancre could any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span>
longer avail him, compelled himself to overcome his
pride sufficiently to entreat the good offices of the
astute Italian; who, eager to seize so favourable an
opportunity of strengthening the faction of the
Princes of the Blood, referred him to M. de Cond
as the only individual likely to accomplish his
reconciliation with the indignant Queen, and the
rather as the Duc d'Epernon declared himself ready
to second the appeal.<a id="footnotetag162" name="footnotetag162"></a><a href="#footnote162">[162]</a></p>

<p>This advice was eagerly adopted by M. de
Guise; who found little difficulty in effecting his
object, the Princes having no sooner discovered that
he had lost the favour of the Queen than they
became anxious to attach him to their own
interests; and so rapidly did this new alliance ripen
that, with his usual impetuous recklessness, the
young Duke ere long requested Bassompierre never
again to mention the recall of M. de la Rochefoucauld
to the Regent, as he should shortly
accomplish it through the medium of the Prince de
Cond; adding that thenceforward their mutual
understanding would be so perfect that on the next
occasion of the Queen's displeasure against himself,
she would find no rod with which to chastise him.<a id="footnotetag163" name="footnotetag163"></a><a href="#footnote163">[163]</a></p>

<p>The influence of M. de Cond at this precise
period was indeed so great as almost to justify the
confidence of his new ally; but it was destined to
be rapidly undermined by his own imprudence.
He had long coveted the command of the Chteau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span>
Trompette, of which, although it was situated in the
principal city of his government, he was not in
possession; and believing that the Regent would
not venture, under existing circumstances, to refuse
to him what he had taught himself to consider as a
right, he induced the Ducs de Mayenne and
d'Epernon and the Marquis d'Ancre to make the
demand in his name. His friends zealously obeyed
his bidding, and urged the Queen to this, as they
declared, unimportant concession; reminding her
that as M. de Cond had devoted himself to her
cause, he merited every favour which she could
bestow upon him without danger to the state.</p>

<p>Marie de Medicis was not, however, prepared to
regard this new demand upon her indulgence in so
unimportant a light. She apprehended, and not
without reason, that the Princes were endeavouring
to sap the foundations of her authority, by
possessing themselves of the fortresses of the
Crown; and it was consequently with a heightened
colour that, having heard the arguments addressed
to her, she briefly replied that she would give the
subject her consideration. The three nobles,
anxious for the success of their mission, were not,
however, to be so easily discouraged; and they
consequently proceeded to impress upon her
Majesty the impolicy of a delay which could not
fail to wound the susceptibility of the Prince; but
the patience of Marie was not proof against this
pertinacity, and again declaring that she should take
time to consider the subject, she rose from her seat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span>
and withdrew to her private closet, still closely
followed by the applicants, her eyes flashing with
anger as she discovered that they were even yet
resolved to persecute her with their entreaties.
Soon, however, she recovered her self-possession;
and turning with a smile towards her obnoxious
guests, she said, as playfully as though no cause of
annoyance were coupled with their presence: "I
have just learnt a new gallantry of which Bassompierre
has been the hero; he did not know that it
would reach my ears, nor will he be well pleased
to find that I have heard of it."</p>

<p>"I trust that your Majesty will inform him of
the discovery," said the Duc de Nevers,
instantly adding: "Approach, M. de Bassompierre;
the Queen has something to confide to
you."</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Marie, in the same tone of
banter which she had so suddenly assumed, "I
shall not tell him one word of the matter."</p>

<p>At once surprised and alarmed, the Marquis
immediately approached the Regent, and entreated
her to let him hear the intelligence which she had
to communicate; and he had no sooner done so
than Marie, whose subterfuge had succeeded,
moved to a distant window, and motioned to
him to follow her. When she had reached the
recess, she still continued to stand with her back
towards the two Dukes; and as Bassompierre
gained her side, she said in a hasty whisper: "I
know nothing of your intrigues; but tell me, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span>
M. de Guise ceased to urge you to effect the return
of La Rochefoucauld?"</p>

<p>"Only three days ago, Madame, he bade me
desist from importuning your Majesty upon the
subject, as the Prince de Cond had promised him
that it should be shortly accomplished through his
own means; adding, moreover, that he could
scarcely be blamed for adopting the interests of the
Princes, since your own creature, M. d'Ancre, had
done the same."</p>

<p>As Bassompierre spoke warm tears gushed from
the eyes of the Queen. "Yes," she exclaimed
bitterly; "the very men who induced me to oppose
the Princes and to offend the ministers are now
endeavouring to profit by my unsupported position,
to undermine my authority, and to ruin my credit with
the people. You heard how insolently they demanded
a royal fortress for their leader; and I am well aware
that should I grant their request it would only expose
me to the necessity of making new concessions."</p>

<p>"Do not distress yourself, Madame," replied the
skilful courtier, eager to avail himself of so favourable
an opportunity of serving his friends; "you
can always command the means of recalling them to
their allegiance; and, did I dare to proffer a counsel
to your Majesty, I would suggest that you should
employ them."</p>

<p>"We will talk no more at present," said Marie;
"return here when I have risen from table, and by
that time I shall have had leisure to reflect upon
your advice."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span>

<p>She then advanced once more to the centre of
the apartment, and commenced a trivial conversation,
which she maintained until the departure of the two
Dukes, thus effectually preventing all recurrence to
the obnoxious subject; but she was not destined to
escape so readily as she had hoped from this new
persecution. Concini and his wife had alike
pledged themselves to M. de Cond that they
would support his pretensions with all their influence,
and their vanity was consequently enlisted
in the cause as much as their interests. The
Queen-mother, therefore, no sooner found herself
alone with Leonora than the subject was renewed;
and that with so much pertinacious resolution that
the dignity of the Regent took alarm, and she
expressed herself with considerable bitterness to the
presumptuous favourite. At this crisis Concini
entered the apartment; and with as little caution as
his wife had previously exhibited, persisted in
urging upon his harassed mistress the same unpalatable
advice; until, utterly wearied, and deeply
indignant at an interference which exceeded all the
bounds of courtesy and respect, Marie commanded
them both to quit her presence, and gave instant
orders that they should not again be admitted until
she had signified her pleasure to that effect.</p>

<p>As the officers of the household were about to
marshal the Regent to the mid-day meal, Bassompierre
encountered the Duc de Guise, of whom
he immediately inquired if he had abandoned the
cause of the unfortunate La Rochefoucauld, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span>
would inevitably die of <i>ennui</i>, should he be long
exiled from the gaieties of the Court.</p>

<p>"No, no," vehemently replied the Duke, "he
shall return to share them; nor will I be under an
obligation to the Queen for his reappearance. I
have served her with zeal, and have been repaid by
coldness and neglect. I have therefore made new
interests, and now recognize no leader but M. de
Cond, no coadjutors but his cabal; nor will I
abandon them although I adopted their policy with
reluctance; a determination, Monsieur," he added
pointedly, "which you at least will not condemn, as
you are a member of the same party."</p>

<p>"Your Lordship is partially in error," said Bassompierre
gaily. "I am, it is true, the very humble
servant of all such individuals as are favoured by the
Prince, but I do not recognize them as a political
body. I am the devoted adherent of their Majesties,
and I know no other masters. Pardon me, moreover,
if I venture to say that you have yourself, M.
le Duc, been very ill-advised. You were formerly
the leader of your own faction, since it would appear
that we are to talk of factions; you were dependent
upon no one, and responsible only to yourself for
your actions and opinions; and now you have allied
your fortunes to those of persons by whom you will
be subjected to a thousand indignities and annoyances
when they no longer require your support.
How, then, do you imagine that you will be able to
brook such treatment, when you suffer yourself to be
angered and alienated by a cold word from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg 234]</span>
Regent? You should remember that your brother
killed M. de Luz almost under her eyes, and in
defiance of a stringent edict; and that you could
scarcely anticipate the immediate recall of one of the
officers of the King's household who had peremptorily
refused to obey the royal command by which
he was enjoined to leave your htel."</p>

<p>"Well, well," exclaimed the Duke impatiently,
"the Queen will one day discover her error in having
ventured to offer me a slight in order to gratify
those by whom she suffers herself to be governed.
She will ere long seek my friendship, but I shall
either refuse to listen or compel her to purchase it
at a high price."</p>

<p>The Regent had no sooner returned to her closet
than, in obedience to her orders, Bassompierre again
presented himself; and as soon as she had dismissed
her attendants she at once entered upon the subject
that occupied her thoughts. "Bestein," she said,
addressing the Marquis by the name which she
usually applied to him during their confidential interviews,
"this wretched affair has totally unnerved me.
I was unable to swallow any food, and unless my
mind is relieved at once I shall go mad. You must
reconcile me to the Duc de Guise at any price.
Offer him a hundred thousand crowns for himself,
the commission of Lieutenant-General of Provence
for his brother, and the reversion of the Abbey
of St. Germain for the Princesse de Conti.
In one word, promise him what you please,
and I will consent, provided you annihilate this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span>
cabal and detach him from the interests of the
Princes."</p>

<p>"Madame," replied Bassompierre with a gay smile,
"you have filled my hands so amply that I am sure
of making a successful bargain. But have I no
similar commission with regard to M. d'Epernon?"</p>

<p>"Ah, would that I could hope so much," said
Marie gloomily; "but I have wounded his vanity,
and he never forgives."</p>

<p>"Seldom, perhaps, Madame," was the ready rejoinder
of the shrewd courtier, "his enemies, but
readily his rulers."</p>

<p>"Endeavour then," exclaimed the Queen eagerly,
"to effect this also, Bestein; remind him of all that
I have already done, both for himself and his children,
and assure him that I have never lost the inclination
to serve him. If any one can accomplish so desirable
an object, you are the person."</p>

<p>Bassompierre lost no time in opening the important
negotiation with which he was entrusted;
and the wiliness with which he first enlisted the
ambition and cupidity of the females of the family
presents a curious picture of the manners of the
time. His success could not long remain doubtful
at a period when the allegiance of the highest nobles
of the land was bought and sold like the most common
merchandise; and accordingly, although, as he
informs us, the Duc de Guise for a time indulged
in his ordinary extravagance of speech, he gradually
yielded, and&mdash;as a natural consequence&mdash;received
the price of his venal concession!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span>

<p>On this occasion, however, M. d'Epernon, whose
birth was far inferior to that of his friend, displayed
a higher sense of what was due to himself and to his
rank. "In matters of this importance," he said
proudly, as Bassompierre urged him once more to
espouse the interests of the Regent, and hinted at
the benefit likely to accrue to himself from his compliance
with her wishes, "I never condescend to
bargain. Decisions of real weight should be formed
frankly and disinterestedly. I have no wish to
capitulate with my sovereign. Offer me no bribe,
for I should consider it only as an insult. Any
service which I can render to the Queen has been
already amply recompensed, and I should be unworthy
alike of the name I bear and of the offices I
hold did I place my loyalty at a price. I have only
one favour to request of her Majesty before I again
devote myself to her interests, and that is that she
will henceforward exhibit more firmness, and attach
a greater value to those who have served her with
fidelity and zeal. This conceded, I am ready to
attend her pleasure whenever she may see fit to
summon me to her presence."</p>

<p>The exultation of Marie de Medicis at the happy
termination of his mission rendered her profuse in
her expressions of gratitude to Bassompierre, which
she terminated by the assurance that he should be
appointed First Lord of the Bedchamber to the young
King, even should she, as she declared, be compelled
to purchase the post from her own private funds;
and these preliminaries arranged, on the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span>
morning, at nine o'clock, the two Dukes proceeded to
pay their respects to her Majesty, by whom they
were most graciously received, and who commanded
that a seat should be placed for M. d'Epernon, whose
recovery from a severe illness was, as we have already
stated, only recent. The interview was a long one,
and no allusion was made on either side to the late
defection of the distinguished guests, who, on rising
to retire, were invited by the Queen to attend her to
the theatre that evening; and they had no sooner
expressed their acknowledgments than she gave
orders to the captain of her guard to have benches
prepared for both the Duc d'Epernon and M. Zamet,
by whom he was to be accompanied.</p>

<p>This extraordinary favour excited universal comment
when the assembled courtiers perceived that it
was not even extended to the Duc de Mayenne, who
was also present at the performance; and Concini,
in particular, was so struck by the sudden change of
affairs that he exclaimed energetically to Bassompierre,
beside whom he stood: "<i>Per Dio!</i> Monsieur,
I can but laugh over the mutations of this strange
world; the Queen has found a seat for Zamet, and
there is none for the Duc de Mayenne. Place your
faith in princes after this!"</p>

<p>Great was the exultation of the courtiers when
the disgrace of Concini became known; but that of
the ministers, as they learnt its cause, was even more
profound. One web of the complicated mesh which
had been woven about the spirit of the Queen had
at length given way, while her refusal to accede to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span>
the request of the Prince de Cond convinced them
that he was no longer likely to prove so formidable
an enemy to themselves as he had recently been.
Acting upon this impression they hastened to solicit
a private audience of the Regent, declaring that they
had matters of great importance to treat with her,
which they would only communicate to herself; and
their satisfaction was complete when an answer was
returned appointing an hour for their appearance at
the Louvre, and naming as the place of their reception
the private closet of the Queen.</p>

<p>"Messieurs," said Marie graciously, as they
paused upon the threshold of the apartment to make
the accustomed obeisance, "your request shall be
strictly complied with." And then turning to the
captain of her guard she added: "M. de Senneterre,
you will suffer no one to enter here, be he whom he
may."</p>

<p>Delighted by the manner of their reception, the
ministers at once entered upon the subject which
had induced them to solicit the interview, and respectfully
represented to the Regent the alarm which
they had felt at the dangerous demand advanced by
the Prince de Cond, and the exertions which they
had ascertained were to be made by the Marquis
d'Ancre to induce her Majesty's compliance; assuring
her that the surrender of a royal fortress of such
importance as the Chteau Trompette to the control
of the first Prince of the Blood could not fail to
prove prejudicial to the interests of the King and the
tranquillity of the nation.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span>

<p>"I am fully aware of the importance of such a
concession, Messieurs," replied Marie with dignity;
"and my resolution is already formed. I have not
yet forgotten that my late lord your sovereign more
than once assured me that had he, while at war with
Henri III, gained possession of the Chteau Trompette,
he could have made himself Duc de Guienne.
A fact like this is well calculated to rivet itself upon
the memory."</p>

<p>At this moment the usher scratched upon the
door, and entered to announce that the Marquis
d'Ancre desired admission to the presence of the
Queen; but the ministers had scarcely had time to
exchange one glance of alarm and annoyance before
Marie, with considerable vehemence, repeated her
former order, and the mortified Marquis was compelled
to retire.</p>

<p>Cautiously as the audience had been accorded,
the Italian had not failed to ascertain through his
spies the presence of the ministers in the palace;
and aware of his own danger should they regain
their legitimate influence over the mind of the
Queen, he unhesitatingly resolved to brave her interdict
in order to counteract the effect of their
representations. He had, however, as we have
shown, signally failed; and with the most gloomy
forebodings of impending evil he returned to the
apartments of his wife to report the ill-success of his
attempt.</p>

<p>Nor was Concini the only visitor who sought
admission to the Queen during her conference with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span>
the ministers. M. de Cond, who was still unaware
of the moral revolution which had been effected,
had, as was his custom, proceeded to the Louvre in
order to consult with her on state affairs; and had
been panic-struck when denied admission to her
presence, and informed that she was then closeted
with his mortal enemies. In his consternation he
sought a solution of the mystery from Bassompierre,
who, after expressing his utter ignorance of its meaning,
cunningly insinuated that it was, in all probability,
an intrigue of the Marchal de Bouillon, who had
effected a reconciliation with the Regent and her
ministers at his expense; a suggestion which appeared
so probable to the Prince that he immediately hurried
to the apartments of Concini to discuss with him the
necessary measures for averting this new danger.</p>

<p>Madame d'Ancre, who was well aware of the
extent of her own power over the spirit of her
foster-sister, would not permit herself to regard her
present disgrace as more than a passing shadow, and
urged her less confident husband to persevere in his
attempt to regain the good graces of Marie, assuring
him that the Queen would ere long be as anxious for
a reconciliation as himself. Somewhat encouraged
by this declaration, Concini, whose vanity was only
rivalled by his ambition, and who, despite daily
experience, believed his own society to be as indispensable
to the Regent as that of his wife, took
measures to ascertain the precise moment at which
the ministerial audience terminated, when, profiting
by the opportunity, he threw himself upon his knees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span>
before the justly-offended Queen, and entreated her
forgiveness of his involuntary offence. Marie was,
however, in no mood for trifling, and she sternly
bade him leave her; a command which he obeyed
only to wreak upon his wife the consequences of his
own mortification.<a id="footnotetag164" name="footnotetag164"></a><a href="#footnote164">[164]</a></p>

<p>The son of the Baron de Luz finding that, despite
her promise, the Regent had taken no measures to
avenge the death of his father, but that, on the contrary,
she had stopped the proceedings which previously
to her reconciliation with the Duc de Guise
had been commenced against his brother, determined
to demand satisfaction in his own person;
and he accordingly despatched a challenge to the
Chevalier, which was immediately accepted by the
hot-headed young noble. Seconds were appointed,
and in compliance with the barbarous custom of the
time the four combatants fought on horseback at the
Porte St. Antoine. At the first pass Franois de
Guise was wounded, but at the third his sword
pierced the body of his antagonist, who fell from his
saddle and expired a few minutes afterwards. Notwithstanding
this tragical result, however, the murderer
alike of the father and the son boldly returned
to Paris, where he was visited and congratulated by
numbers of the nobles, who, instead of shrinking
from all contact with a man who had desolated the
hearth and home of a sorrowing and now childless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>
widow, were loud in their encomiums on his bravery
and skill. Nor was this the most revolting feature
of the case; for it is on record that Marie de Medicis
herself, in her eagerness to retain the alliance of his
family, no sooner learnt that the Chevalier had received
a wound in the encounter than she despatched
an officer of her household to convey to him her
regret and to inquire into the extent of his hurt,
overlooking, with extraordinary inconsistency, or
still more reprehensible recklessness, the fact that
only a few weeks previously she had instructed the
Parliament to put him upon his trial for the murder
of his first victim.</p>

<p>The unslumbering eye of Heaven, however, and
the unerring fiat of divine justice, proved less
oblivious of this monstrous crime. In the course
of the following year, while at the fortress of Baux
near Arles, Franois de Guise was in the act of
firing off a cannon, which burst and wounded him in
so frightful a manner that he expired two hours subsequently
in extreme torture, thus partially expiating
by a death of agony a youth of misrule and bloodshed.<a id="footnotetag165" name="footnotetag165"></a><a href="#footnote165">[165]</a></p>

<p>The murder of the younger De Luz had no sooner
reached the ears of M. de Luynes than he resolved
to avail himself of the circumstance to awaken the
ambition of Louis, and to induce him to fling off the
shackles of maternal authority. Eager as he had
long been for an opportunity of effecting this object,
his attempts had hitherto been negatived by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span>
ceaseless energy with which Marie de Medicis had
smothered in their germ all attempts at sedition, thus
rendering herself essential to the well-being and
security of the kingdom; and he accordingly felt all
the importance of the present crisis.</p>

<p>Under this impression, after listening attentively
to the narrative of his informant, he hastened to the
apartment of the King, who was still engaged in
the cares of his morning toilet; and no contrast
could have been more striking than the simple
costume of the young sovereign and the elaborate
dress of his favourite. The pourpoint of Louis
was of deep crimson velvet, slashed with satin of
the same colour, and totally without ornament, a
simplicity which marked his own observance of the
sumptuary edict that he had lately issued; whereas
De Luynes, with an arrogant disregard of the
royal proclamation, was attired in a vest of pale
blue, richly embroidered with gold and relieved by
a short mantle of amaranth, clasped by a rich jewel
similar to that which attached the snowy plume to
his black velvet cap.</p>

<p>As the cap was doffed, however, and the long
feather swept the tapestried floor, Louis forgot to
chide this ostentatious defiance of his will, and
with a smile motioned his splendid courtier to a seat.</p>

<p>"You come like a bridegroom from the wedding
feast, Albert," he said cheerfully; "and you surely
bring me a message of good import, or your garb
belies you. Has De Brants announced the speedy
arrival of my sparrow-hawks?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg 244]</span>

<p>"Of one only, Sire; the smaller of the two died
under his training."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the King, with great petulance;
"it is always so. Whatever is destined to give me
pleasure fails when I am the most eager to possess
it."</p>

<p>"And yet," interposed De Luynes gaily, "never,
in so far as I can judge, did fortune show herself
more favourable to your Majesty."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" asked Louis, roused for an
instant from his usual apathy.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is a long tale, and a strange one," said
the favourite. "You may remember, Sire, the quarrel
that arose between the old Baron de Luz and the
Chevalier de Guise, and which grew out of the cabal
against Concini. You cannot have forgotten, moreover,
that the Baron was killed. Well, his son
Antoine de Luz, impatient for a vengeance which
was too tardy according to the principle of his filial
chivalry, took, as it seems, the affair into his own
hands, and flattered himself that where his father
had failed he should come forth victorious. Poor
boy! he has paid dearly for his mistake. His sword
has proved duller than his hopes. He has encountered
the Chevalier in his turn, and in his turn has
bit the dust. Franois de Guise pierced him through
and through one day last week near the Porte St.
Antoine."</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin!" exclaimed Louis in an agitated
voice; "do you mean that he is dead?"</p>

<p>"Dead, like his father," was the unmoved reply.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span>

<p>"And her Majesty the Queen-Regent was no
sooner informed of the fact than she commanded
M. de Bassompierre to arrest the Chevalier."</p>

<p>"I will not permit it!" cried the young King
vehemently. "I love Franois de Guise; he is one
of my firmest friends; he shall not be imprisoned."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Sire," said De Luynes with a
significant smile; "Madame la Rgente was soon
appeased, and so little does she resent the crime of
M. de Guise that she has this morning condescended
to cause inquiries to be made after his
health."</p>

<p>"Right, right," murmured Louis; "and yet it is
a bad precedent, and a dangerous example to the
lesser nobles. I hate this spilling of blood. The
Princes are too bold. Upon what will they next
venture?"</p>

<p>"Nay, it requires no sphynx to solve that problem,
my gracious master," said the favourite, toying with
his plumed cap; "they will endeavour to effect the
exile of Concini and his dark-browed wife: your
good subjects have no love for foreigners, and believe
that you, their sovereign, would find no want
of faithful and devoted servitors among themselves.
Then Jeannin, Sire, and Sillery are obnoxious to
them; and they trust, with your good help, to be
ere long freed from all these incubi."</p>

<p>"Luynes," said Louis in a tone of weariness, "I
hate to hear you talk upon such subjects. I have
more than enough of them from others. Is De
Guise recovering from his wound? for he must also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span>
have suffered in the fray, or the Queen-mother would
not have sought tidings of him."</p>

<p>"Fear not for him, Sire," said the favourite; "he
will be quite able to keep the saddle when M. de
Cond heads an army to snatch the crown of our fair
France from your own brow."</p>

<p>"Stay, sir!" exclaimed the young King with
sudden dignity. "Have <i>you</i> also forgotten that I
am the son of Henri IV?"</p>

<p>"May your Majesty never forget it more than I
do," said De Luynes, with an audacity before which
the eye of Louis sank; "but believe me that the
fact will avail you little until you have purged the
nation of the foreign fungus which is corroding the
root of your authority."</p>

<p>"Albert," murmured the weak young monarch,
"in the name of Heaven, what would you ask?"</p>

<p>"To see you in reality the King of France,
Sire."</p>

<p>"And for this purpose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must appease the Princes. They are
weary of the despotic rule of the Queen-mother
and of the influence of these Florentines."</p>

<p>"I dare not urge the Queen to banish them."</p>

<p>"Nor should you, Sire. It is for subjects to
solicit, and for sovereigns to command. There is,
moreover, a safer cure than exile for such an evil."</p>

<p>"Nay, now, De Luynes, you jest," said Louis,
striving to force a sickly smile; "you surely would
not counsel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty mistakes me," interposed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span>
favourite; "I would dare anything to secure your
safety. Justice holds her sword as firmly as her
balance, and wields the one as freely as she weighs
the other."</p>

<p>"Enough, enough," gasped out Louis; "we will
talk of this again&mdash;but blood, blood, always blood!
It is sickening. You will attend me to Fontainebleau,
Albert; I must have some sport to-day, and
endeavour to forget for a time all your moody
arguments."</p>

<p>De Luynes bowed low as he glanced significantly
towards Roger, the favourite valet of the King, who
replied to the meaning look by an almost imperceptible
shrug of the shoulders as he adjusted the mantle
of his royal master.</p>

<p>"Go, Monsieur le Grand Fauconnier," pursued the
King, "and see that all is prepared. I will follow
on the instant."</p>

<p>Ten minutes subsequently the Court of the
Louvre was thronged with courtiers, equipages, and
led horses; and within a quarter of an hour the
voice of the usher was heard at the foot of the great
staircase announcing "The King." Then Louis himself
appeared, and taking his place in the coach which
was awaiting him, he motioned De Luynes to his
side, gave the signal of departure, and left the
palace at a rapid pace. The royal suite mounted in
haste; and ere long nobles, pages, and equerries had
disappeared, and all was once more silent beneath
the deep shadows of the regal pile.</p>

<p>It is evident that, crafty as Bassompierre had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span>
shown himself when conversing with M. de Cond
on the subject of the extraordinary changes which
had taken place at Court, he was nevertheless suspected
by the Prince of having contributed to effect
them, as a short time subsequently a banquet was
given at the Htel de Cond, to which every nobleman
in office was invited save the handsome and
popular Gentleman of the Bedchamber, who was
generally one of the most coveted guests at entertainments
of that description; but the exclusion,
marked as it was, failed to cause any mortification to
Bassompierre, who had no sooner communicated the
circumstance to the Regent than she commanded his
attendance in her private <i>salon</i>, where he passed
the afternoon at cards with herself and her ladies.</p>

<p>Concini, finding that the Queen did not relax in
her coldness towards himself and his wife, withdrew
in great displeasure to Amiens; and at the same
period Marie discovered that, despite his promise to
the contrary, the Duc de Vendme had joined the
faction of Cond, and that they were conjointly
endeavouring to win back M. de Guise. Alarmed
by this new cabal, and made aware that the latter
had betrayed symptoms of irresolution which augured
ill for his adhesion to her cause, she lost no time in
reminding him of the pledges which he had given,
and in entreating him not to abandon her interests. The
Duke, flattered by the importance that the
Queen-mother attached to his allegiance, readily
promised all she wished; and she had reason to
congratulate herself upon her promptitude, as only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg 249]</span>
a few days subsequently M. de Vendme and Concini
arrived at Fontainebleau, where the Court had recently
established its residence, when the former
hastened to take leave of their Majesties previously
to his departure for Brittany, where he was about to
preside over the Assembly of the States, and the
latter on the pretext of bearing him company; but in
reality to induce Zamet, who possessed considerable
authority in the palace, to assign rooms to them in
that portion of the building occupied by the Duc
de Guise.</p>

<p>Such an arrangement could not, however, be
effected without reaching the ears of the Regent,
whose suspicions of their motive were immediately
excited; and she desired Bassompierre not to lose
sight of M. de Guise until he had retired to rest,
and to prevent his holding any communication with
the Duc de Vendme. Resolved, moreover, to
ascertain the correctness of those suspicions, she
directed M. de Senneterre to watch throughout the
night upon the staircase of the Duc de Guise; a
vigilance which was rewarded by his discovery of
the two nobles, who, shortly after Bassompierre had
withdrawn, paid a visit to the Duke which lasted
upwards of two hours. The astonishment of the
Regent was consequently by no means great when
M. de Guise in his turn waited upon her Majesty
to take leave, upon the pretext that he had been
chosen by Madame d'Elboeuf, conjointly with the
Duc de Mayenne, as her arbitrator in a reconciliation
which was about to be attempted between herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg 250]</span>
and Madame de la Trmouille, who had on her side
selected the Prince de Cond and the Marchal de
Bouillon. Marie, however, refused to consent to his
departure, and informed him that she would despatch
Bassompierre as his substitute; an arrangement with
which he was compelled to comply, but which greatly
embarrassed his friends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the anger of the Queen against
Concini had been seriously increased by this new
instance of ingratitude; and even the pleadings of
his wife, who had been restored to favour, failed to
appease her displeasure. In imparting her commands
to Bassompierre, Marie had inveighed bitterly
against the attitude assumed by a man who owed
everything to her indulgence; and as her listener
endeavoured to excuse him, she said vehemently:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Urge nothing in his behalf. He has thought
proper to judge for himself, and to join a cabal which
he knows to be opposed to my authority. Tell him
from me that if he does not return here by Thursday
evening, I will teach him in future to obey me; and
that had it not been from consideration for his wife,
I should already have provided him with a lodging
which he would have found it difficult to quit.
Leonora is indignant at his conduct; while he continues
to act more disgracefully from day to day.
Inform him that he will do well not to neglect my
orders."</p>

<p>The arrogant Italian was, however, by no means
inclined to obedience; nor was it without considerable
difficulty that Bassompierre succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span>
impressing upon him the extent of the danger to which
he exposed himself by the line of conduct he had so
recklessly adopted, and in ultimately effecting his
reconciliation with his justly offended mistress.<a id="footnotetag166" name="footnotetag166"></a><a href="#footnote166">[166]</a></p>

<p>This was no sooner accomplished than the
ministers, who thenceforward despaired of ever
permanently counterbalancing the influence of Concini
and his wife, determined, if possible, to unite
their interests to his; and for this purpose the
President Jeannin, who had maintained a better
understanding with the Marquis than any of his
colleagues, proposed to the Queen that an effort
should be made to reconcile the Chancellor and
Villeroy with her favourite, a suggestion which she
eagerly adopted, being anxious to strengthen her
own party by weakening that of the Princes. She
had been apprised that the Marchal de Bouillon,
who was indignant that he could not attain to the
degree of power which he had anticipated under a
regency, was perseveringly employed in endeavouring
to detach the Duc de Guise from her interests, and
to fortify the cabal of the Prince de Cond, in order
to render his own allegiance indispensable to the
Crown; and she consequently welcomed any method
of circumventing a conspiracy which was becoming
formidable. It was therefore determined that a
marriage should be proposed between the daughter
of Concini and the Marquis de Villeroy, the grandson
of the Secretary of State; and this overture was
accompanied by the most lavish promises on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>
part of the ministers that they would serve him by
every means in their power, and exert all their
energies to advance his fortunes.</p>

<p>This negotiation, which was undertaken without
the knowledge of Bassompierre, had nearly proved
fatal to his prospects; as both parties, dreading his
influence with the Regent, determined to undermine
him in her regard; and for this purpose they so
wilfully misrepresented his actions, and contrived to
invest them with so suspicious an appearance, that
Marie, who had begun to misdoubt every one about
her, treated him with a harshness which his proud
spirit could not brook; and he accordingly made
preparations for quitting the Court of France, with
the intention of entering the service of some foreign
Prince.</p>

<p>His design was no sooner ascertained, however,
than his friends, particularly the Duc de Guise and
the Princesse de Conti, hastened to represent to the
Queen the impolicy of forfeiting the friendship and
assistance of one who had so faithfully espoused her
cause; and their representations prevailed. Bassompierre
was permitted to justify himself, and Marie
frankly admitted her conviction that she had been
misled by his enemies.</p>

<p>In addition to these intestine intrigues, the
Regent was occupied with the troubles generated by
the disputed succession of the duchy of Mantua,
regarding which she was reluctant to come to any
resolution without securing the advice of the Princes
and great nobles; upon which she was, moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg 253]</span>
the more anxious to insist, as it would afford an
opportunity of summoning to the capital not only
M. de  Cond himself, but all the other leaders of
the adverse faction; who had, as we have shown,
withdrawn from the Court, and were exasperated by
the reconciliation of the Regent with the Ducs de
Guise and d'Epernon, and the recall of the ministers.
The Council accordingly met; and as the Cardinal-Duke
of Mantua was a near relative of the Queen,
it was decided that France should support him in
his pretensions against the Duke of Savoy. An
army was consequently organized, which was to
march on Monferrat from three several points:
one division under the Marchal de Lesdiguires,
a second under the Duc de Guise, and the third
under the Grand Equerry M. de Bellegarde. The
troops were not, however, destined on this occasion
to cross the frontier, the friends of the Duke of
Savoy having soon succeeded in convincing Marie
de Medicis of the danger of investing three great
nobles with the command of an armed force of such
importance during the minority of the sovereign;
while Ubaldini, the Papal Nuncio, jealous of the
presence of the French soldiery in Italy, and apprehensive
that Lesdiguires would be accompanied by
a large number of Huguenots, was equally strenuous
in dissuading her from her purpose; assuring her
that the King of Spain had resolved to oppose the
Duke of Savoy, and to compel him to restore to the
House of Mantua the territories which had been
wrested from it in Monferrat. The Duke of Savoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span>
himself, moreover, alarmed at the demonstration
about to be made by France, and conscious that he
was unable to compete with such an adversary,
resolved to open a negotiation; upon which the
Marquis de Coeuvres was despatched to Italy to
arrange the terms of the treaty.<a id="footnotetag167" name="footnotetag167"></a><a href="#footnote167">[167]</a></p>

<p>While the whole of the other European Princes
were occupied with the succession in Mantua, James
of England was engrossed by his anxiety to divert
the minds of his subjects from the grief which was
universally felt at the untimely death of his eldest
son; and so little did he himself feel the bereavement
that he entered with apparent enjoyment into
every kind of entertainment which presented
itself. The unfortunate Prince had expired on the
6th of November; and as his demise threatened to
prevent that close alliance with France which he
had so eagerly anticipated, James caused its
announcement to the Regent to be accompanied
by an offer of the hand of his other son, Charles,
who had thus become Prince of Wales, to the
Princesse Christine; a proposal which reached the
French Court only three days subsequently to the
decease of Henry, and which consequently created
considerable surprise.<a id="footnotetag168" name="footnotetag168"></a><a href="#footnote168">[168]</a> Marie de Medicis, however,
felt no inclination to quarrel with this indecent haste,
as she trusted that by giving her daughter to the
son of a Protestant sovereign, she should conciliate
the Huguenots, whom she had greatly alienated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg 255]</span>
concluding the double alliance with Spain; but the
Sovereign-Pontiff was no sooner apprised of the offer
of James, and of the gracious reception afforded to
it by the Regent, than he expressed his extreme
displeasure, and refused to listen to any arguments,
declaring that no question of state policy
should sanction a contract the observance of which
must prove detrimental to the interests of the
Church. Ubaldini, the Papal Nuncio at the French
Court, seconded these remonstrances with more zeal
than judgment; and at length proceeded so far as
to reproach the Queen with the ill return which she
was about to make to God for the blessings He had
vouchsafed to her. The haughty spirit of Marie de
Medicis could brook no more; and her reply is
worthy of record. "Monseigneur," she said with
dignity, "I do nothing more upon this occasion than
several Princes of Italy have done before me, and
that too under the very eyes of the Pope. The
Grand Duchess of Tuscany, with all her devotion,
did not refuse her consent when she was formerly
asked to give the hand of her daughter to the Prince
of Wales." <a id="footnotetag169" name="footnotetag169"></a><a href="#footnote169">[169]</a></p>

<p>Thus the proposal was accepted, and the heir to
the British throne was thenceforward considered as
the future husband of the young Princess.</p>

<p>At this period the death of M. de Fervaques left
a marshal's <i>bton</i> disposable, which, to the extreme
disgust of the nobility, was bestowed by the Regent
upon Concini, who had never throughout his life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span>
been present at the firing of a hostile shot. The
ill-judged manner in which this dignity was conferred
is so characteristic that it merits mention.
Her temporary estrangement from Madame d'Ancre
had been a source of great discomfort as well as
sorrow to the Queen; and her ladies, hoping still
further to disgust her with the favourite, had unwittingly
compelled her to feel her dependence upon
the disgraced mistress of the robes. To every
petty requirement she was answered that it was not
within their province, and that reference must be
made to the Marquise.</p>

<p>"I desire to have the entrance to my closet
draperied by a screen of crimson velvet edged with
gold," said the Regent on one occasion to Madame
de Guercheville; "be good enough to have it done
immediately."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty has probably overlooked the fact
that such orders must be issued by the Marquise
d'Ancre," was the formal reply of the stately lady of
honour.</p>

<p>"Madame du Fargis," resumed the Queen, a
short time afterwards, "I have mislaid a letter&mdash;a
petition&mdash;bearing the name of the Comtesse de
Touraine; I wish it to be found and answered."</p>

<p>"Madame," responded the beautiful Countess
meekly, "the Marquise d'Ancre has charge of all
the petitions addressed to your Majesty."</p>

<p>Marie de Medicis turned away in silence. She
had striven to believe that she could dispense with
the services of Leonora; but every day, and almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span>
every hour, she became more convinced of her utter
helplessness without her. Madame d'Ancre had
been the playmate of her infancy, the friend of her
girlhood; she was the confidante of her most hidden
thoughts, her counsellor in difficulty, and her consoler
in her moments of trial. The ill-advised bearing
of those about her sufficed to remind her of
these facts, and her resolution was forthwith formed.
Concini might still be made to feel and to suffer for
his fault, but she could not dispense with the society
and support of Leonora.</p>

<p>The Queen retired to her private closet, and the
mistress of the robes was summoned to her presence
by a page. As she entered, Marie was startled by
the change which had taken place in her appearance;
her eyes were swollen with weeping, and her
cheek was even more sallow than its wont. Whatever
might be her faults, there can be no doubt that
Leonora was deeply and tenderly attached to her
royal foster-sister; and that the disgrace into which
she had fallen had consequently affected her to an
intense degree. She was no longer the proud and
imperious favourite who through the Regent sought
to govern France, but a weak and sorrowing woman,
mourning over the ruin of all her hopes.</p>

<p>The apartment to which the Queen-mother had
so unexpectedly summoned her foster-sister was, as
we have said, her private closet, in which she passed
several hours each day while residing at the Louvre.
The walls were covered to the height of ten feet
from the floor by magnificent hangings of crimson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg 258]</span>
damask, surmounted by a dome of pale blue silk,
upon which were elaborately embroidered the arms
of the Medici. From the centre of this dome hung
a silver lamp, chiselled by the hand of Benvenuto
Cellini, and suspended by a chain of the same metal;
a table of carved oak stood in the centre of the
room, upon which were placed a pair of globes,
sundry astronomical instruments, an illuminated
missal, and a flask of Hungary water; while a low
divan, heaped with cushions of black velvet sprinkled
with <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> in gold, occupied two entire sides
of the apartment, and completed its furniture.</p>

<p>"Approach, Leonora," said the Queen. "Here,
place yourself on this cushion at my feet, and wipe
the tears from your eyes. Even if we part, we may
do so without bitterness."</p>

<p>"Ha, Madame!" exclaimed the Florentine,
"should such a feeling indeed exist it can be only
in the bosom of your Majesty, for no true subject
can do otherwise than love and venerate her
sovereign."</p>

<p>"Would that it were so," said Marie; "but that
is a delusion under which I have long ceased to
labour; for too often where I have sought to excite
affection I have only engendered hatred."</p>

<p>"I know not if your Majesty would address that
reproach to me," said Madame d'Ancre, raising her
drooping head with the sudden energy of honest
pride; "but should it really be so, I can summon
the past to vindicate my good faith. I can call
upon the Queen-Regent of France herself to do me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg 259]</span>
justice; I can invoke the two years of that regency,
so full of trial, of struggle, and of calamity, during
which I have at times perilled my head to ensure
alike the tranquillity and the triumph of my august
mistress; I can quote the several cabals which I
have helped to crush; and, above all, I can prove
the fidelity and submission with which I have constantly
obeyed the behests of my sovereign lady.
All this is, however, worse than idle; the servant
only sins the more in every attempt at self-justification.
Monarchs are accustomed from their cradles
to punish upon suspicion, however strong may be
the evidences of the past. Gratitude, as the term
is understood between man and man, never drapes
itself in purple; perfect confidence cannot steady
its foot upon the steps of a throne, for the royal
canopy is a heaven of impunity for those whom it
overshadows. Yet think not, Madame," she continued,
in a more subdued voice, as she clasped her
thin fingers together so forcibly that they became
ashy white beneath the pressure&mdash;"think not, I
beseech you, that I say this of myself. I have no
such presumption. I have not forgotten what I
was, in feeling what I am. I yet remember, deeply,
thankfully, that I was poor, obscure, and insignificant,
and that it was your royal hand which raised
me to rank and honour; and thus it is with the
most fervent gratitude that I now thank you for
your past bounties; and with the utmost humility
that I prepare to take my leave of you for ever."</p>

<p>Marie did not reply; the outburst of outraged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span>
feeling in which the Marquise had indulged was so
unexpected and so bold that she remained speechless,
and the tears which had risen to her eyes on
the entrance of her foster-sister congealed upon
their lids. Leonora awaited for an instant some
token of relenting in her royal mistress, but as the
threatening silence continued, she became alarmed,
and casting herself upon her knees, she gasped out
falteringly, "I am at your feet, Madame; I kneel
before you, wretched and repentant; I am here to
bid you farewell&mdash;a life-long farewell. Pardon, and
forget me."</p>

<p>The heart of Marie was moved; and as her
favourite knelt before her she pressed her to her
bosom, and bade her be of good cheer, for that all
was forgiven. Leonora, unprepared for such an
admission, wept abundantly; and it was long ere
she could recover her composure, while the Queen
on her side was scarcely less distressed.</p>

<p>"I cannot part from you, <i>mia cara, mia dolce</i>"
pursued Marie passionately; "you are my good
angel, the friend and sister of my happy years&mdash;for
we were happy then, <i>Leonora mia</i>, before a crown
and a court came between us. You have said truly
that you have been my guardian spirit, and we do
not part with our best security in the hour of peril.
No, Leonora, no; I will listen no more to the evil
accusations of those who would fain separate us.
You shall not quit the Louvre."</p>

<p>Madame d'Ancre pressed her hand forcibly upon
her heart as if to control its tumultuous throbbings;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span>
and then, fixing her large dark eyes earnestly upon
those of her royal mistress, she said in a low deep
accent of earnest emotion, "And thus you love me
still&mdash;you, the proud daughter of the Medici, the
wife and the mother of kings&mdash;you love me still,
and I have not lived in vain! Did you hear those
words, Countess?" she asked, suddenly springing
to her feet, and addressing Madame du Fargis, who
was standing in the recess of one of the tall windows,
with the tears falling fast over her fair cheeks;
"the Regent will not suffer me to leave France&mdash;the
Regent will not allow me to wither away my life
an alien from her presence. Now I am once more
calm and strong&mdash;calm in the security of my happiness,
strong in the consciousness of my honesty.
Let them accuse me now, I defy their malice,
for my royal mistress believes in me, and loves
me."</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, Leonora," said the Queen-mother
affectionately; "your feeble frame is unequal
to these bursts of passion. Come hither, child, and
pillow your aching head upon my knees, as you
were wont to do long, long ago, when we sang
together the beloved songs of our fair Florence, or
indulged in day-dreams which were never destined
to be realized. Let Madame de Conti beware in
her turn: higher heads than hers have been brought
low; and from this day I will teach a bitter lesson
to her and to her kinsmen. I have borne much,
but I am still a Medicis; I can be as firm as
Catherine, although I shall endeavour to act with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span>
greater justice, and to be in all things worthy of the
name I bear."</p>

<p>"Ha, Madame!" exclaimed the favourite, "you
have already proved that however others may
endeavour to forget that you are the widow of
Henry the Great the fact is ever present to yourself."
And as she spoke, Leonora buried her face
in the lap of her royal foster-sister, while her long
black hair, which had become unfastened by the
energy of her movements, fell to the floor and
covered her like a pall.</p>

<p>Little did either the Queen or the Marquise at
that moment anticipate how soon a deeper and a
denser pall would replace those luxuriant and
gleaming tresses! Happy was it for both that no
prophetic glance into the future darkened the joy
of that bright hour of reconciliation!</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Princesse de Conti, who dreaded
the effect of this same reconciliation upon herself
and her family, privately despatched a messenger to
the Prince de Cond to inform him that Madame
d'Ancre was at that very time closeted with the
Regent, and that he must forthwith devise some
method of terminating so dangerous a conference.
M. de Cond was for a moment aghast; and on
reflection could adopt no better expedient than that
of prevailing upon M. de Brves, the governor of
the Duc d'Orlans, to suggest to the young Prince
that he should proceed to the apartments of his
royal mother, in order to pay his respects to her
Majesty. Monsieur obeyed; and Leonora was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span>
seated on a cushion at the feet of her foster-sister,
with her pale face pillowed upon her knees, when
Madame de Conti threw open the door of the royal
closet, and announced the Prince.</p>

<p>"Let Monseigneur await my pleasure without,"
exclaimed Marie angrily. "I understand the motive
of this breach of etiquette, and shall reward it as it
deserves. <i>Leonora cara</i>" she added, as the drapery
again closed over the portal, "dry your tears;
I owe you some recompense for all that you
have suffered, and I will not be tardy in my
requital."</p>

<p>At this instant some one scratched upon the door
of the royal closet.</p>

<p>"Again!" cried the Queen indignantly. "See
who waits, Madame du Fargis."</p>

<p>The Countess proceeded to draw aside the
tapestry. "Madame," she said, as she retired a
pace or two with a profound curtsey, "his Majesty
the King."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the Regent, starting from her
seat, and advancing towards the young sovereign,
whom she tenderly embraced, "your visit could not
have been more welcome or better-timed, my son.
The death of M. de Fervaques has created a
vacancy which must be at once filled, and I have a
marshal's commission for you to sign."</p>

<p>The wife of Concini gazed eagerly into the face
of her royal mistress. Marie smiled. "Go,
Madame," she said affectionately, "and bid the
Marquis d'Ancre hasten here upon the instant to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg 264]</span>
kiss the gracious hand from which he is about to
receive a marshal's <i>bton</i>."</p>

<p>Leonora knelt before the startled King, who
suffered her in silence to perform the same ceremony;
and then radiant with happiness she pressed
the jewelled fingers of the Queen to her quivering
lips. "And hark you, Leonora," pursued Marie,
"cause Concini to be announced by his new title
when he seeks admission here. This will at once
put an end to a host of rivalries which are now
unavailing."</p>

<p>Madame d'Ancre hastily withdrew; but as she
passed through the apartments of the Queen she
remarked that the antechamber was already thronged
with a crowd of courtiers, who had been attracted
thither by curiosity; while they, in their turn, did
not fail to detect in the flushed cheek and flashing
eye of the Marquise the indications of some new
triumph. Little, however, were they prepared for
its extent; and when Concini, some minutes afterwards,
appeared, with a sarcastic smile upon his
lips, and glanced a look of defiance around him,
even while he bowed right and left alike to his
friends and to his enemies, every pulse quickened
with anxiety. The suspense was but momentary.
The Italian was preceded by one of the royal pages,
who, as the captain of the guard flung back the door
of the cabinet in which Louis XIII was still closeted
with his mother, announced in a voice so audible
that it was heard throughout the apartment, "Monseigneur
le Marchal d'Ancre."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg 265]</span>

<p>"Concini a Marshal of France!" exclaimed
simultaneously the Ducs de Guise, d'Epernon, and
de Bellegarde, who were standing together; and
then there was a dead silence as the draperied door
closed upon the exulting favourite.</p>

<p>The commencement of the year 1614 was productive
of new anxieties to the Queen-Regent. The
Marchal de Bouillon, whose restless ambition was
ever prompting him to some new enterprise, had
warily, but not the less surely, possessed himself of
the confidence of the Princes and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg 267]</span>
disaffected nobles, and had succeeded in aggravating
their feelings against the Court party to such an
extent that he experienced little difficulty in inducing
them to abandon the capital and to retire to
their several governments. M. de Cond had never
forgiven the refusal of Marie to bestow upon him
the command of the citadel of Chteau Trompette,
or the recall of the ministers; and he also deeply
resented the desertion of the Marchal d'Ancre from
his interests, as well as the wealth and honours to
which he had attained; while the Ducs de Nevers, de
Mayenne, de Vendme, de Longueville, and de Piney-Luxembourg,
together with a host of others, considered
themselves aggrieved by their exclusion from
power, and were consequently ready to espouse his
cause. Thus Bouillon found it easy to induce them
to retire simultaneously from the Court; and it was
agreed that they should assemble in Champagne, and
collectively demand a reform in the Government.</p>

<p>Accordingly the Prince de Cond took his leave
of their Majesties on the 6th of January, and retired
for a time to Chteauroux, whence he afterwards
proceeded to Mzires. This example was shortly
followed by the other chiefs of his faction. The
Duc de Nevers retired at once to Champagne, the
Duc de Mayenne to the Isle of France, and M. de
Longueville to Picardy. In February the Duc de
Vendme prepared in his turn to join his friends;
but as their purpose had by this time become apparent
to the Regent, she caused him to be confined
in an apartment of the Louvre; whence, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg 268]</span>
he succeeded a short time afterwards in escaping by
a door that had long been unused, and which being
covered by the tapestried hanging of the chamber
had been at length forgotten.</p>

<p>The Marchal de Bouillon, however, upon whom
the cabal mainly relied, as his sovereignty of Sedan
gave them the assurance of a secure retreat should
they be menaced with reprisals, made no haste to
imitate his dupes. He had been far too crafty to
compromise himself beyond redemption with a party
which might ultimately fail; and he had consequently
calculated with great care the probable
chances of furthering his own fortunes. After the
departure of the Princes he formed his decision;
and his first act was to wait upon the ministers,
and to reveal to them the intentions of M. de Cond
and his adherents; a communication which excited
more annoyance than surprise in those to whom it
was addressed. He then proceeded to the Louvre,
where he repeated to the Regent what he had
previously declared to her ministers; and although
he tempered his information with assurances of the
respect and attachment of the self-exiled Princes
towards her person, Marie considered the mere fact
of such a coalition so dangerous, that even when
Bouillon volunteered to exert all his influence to
induce them to abandon their design, and to return
to the capital, although she accepted his offer, and
permitted him to follow them ostensibly for that
purpose, she was far from feeling reassured; and
she soon had reason to discover that her fears were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg 269]</span>
only too well&mdash;grounded; as the Duke, after an
elaborate leave-taking at the palace, publicly declared
that he was about to proceed to Sedan in
order to avoid arrest.</p>

<p>This fact, coupled with the escape of M. de
Vendme, who lost no time in reaching Brittany,
where he was joined by the Duc de Retz<a id="footnotetag170" name="footnotetag170"></a><a href="#footnote170">[170]</a> with an
armed force, and took the town of Lamballe, sufficed
to convince Marie that no faith must be placed in
the professions of Bouillon; and she accordingly
forwarded orders to all the governors of the royal
fortresses to forbid the entrance of the Duc de
Vendme within their walls, and commanded the
Parliament to issue an edict for the suppression of
levies of troops throughout Provence. This done,
she next despatched the Duc de Ventadour to
Chteauroux with letters of recall to M. de Cond;
but before his arrival the Prince had left that city
for Mzires; and as the letters, which were forwarded
to him, remained unanswered, the royal
envoy was compelled to return to the capital without
accomplishing his mission.</p>

<p>The next intelligence which reached the capital
was the seizure of the citadel of Mzires by the
Duc de Nevers; and as matters daily assumed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg 270]</span>
more serious aspect, the Queen resolved to recall
M. d'Epernon from Metz, whither he had withdrawn
a few months previously, and to conciliate him
by reviving in the person of his son M. de
Candale the nominal office of First Lord of the
Bedchamber, which he had himself held under
Henri III; while, at the same time, she held
out to the Duc de Guise the prospect of commanding
the armies of the King, should it be
found expedient to march against the Prince de
Cond.</p>

<p>These precautions were, however, far from sufficient
to tranquillize the mind of Marie de Medicis,
who began to apprehend a renewal of the intestine
calamities which had overwhelmed the nation during
the preceding reigns; and satisfied that despite all
her efforts at conciliation she was personally obnoxious
to the Princes, she expressed her determination
to resign the regency. Nor did either
Concini or his wife, although their own fortunes
were involved in her retirement, venture to dissuade
her from her purpose, the threats of the
disaffected nobles against themselves having convinced
them that they had little mercy to expect at
their hands should they still further urge the Queen
to aggressive measures. From this hasty resolution
Marie was, however, with some difficulty, dissuaded
by her Council, who represented to her the dangerous
position in which she could not fail to place the
young King; who, utterly unaccustomed to public
business, must prove incompetent to maintain his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg 271]</span>
interests at so perilous a crisis as that which now
excited her own fears.</p>

<p>The Regent readily admitted the validity of this
argument; but in support of her purpose she informed
them that she had just been apprised of a
rumour which had spread in Brittany since the
Duc de Vendme had retired from the Court, by
which she was accused of having attempted to
poison the King in order to lengthen her own
period of power; and with pardonable indignation
she declared that she possessed no other means of
refuting so horrible a calumny than that which she
had adopted, and that she consequently owed this
justice to herself. As she was, however, still entreated
to sacrifice her own feelings to the safety of
the sovereign and the welfare of the kingdom, she
at length yielded; but that she made the concession
with reluctance was sufficiently evident.</p>

<p>"As regards the horrible crime imputed to me,
Messieurs," she said, "I can only swear that I would
rather suffer death than continue to live on under
such an accusation. I am well aware, moreover,
that this is not the only calumny which has been
circulated against my person and reputation; nor
is it the first time that the Marchal d'Ancre has
been designated as the instigator of my unpopular
measures; every new cabal inventing some fallacy
to undermine my authority and to throw discredit
upon my government. Since, however, you give
it as your opinion that I shall better serve the King
by retaining the regency until he shall be of fitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg 272]</span>
age to act upon his own responsibility, I will continue
to exercise the power delegated to me by my late
lord and husband; and to maintain that good understanding
with my son which has ever hitherto existed
between us."</p>

<p>The question was then discussed of whether it
were more desirable to levy such troops as still
remained faithful to the Crown, and at once endeavour
to reduce the faction of the Princes by
force, or to attempt a reconciliation by pacific means.
The Cardinal de Joyeuse, Villeroy, and Jeannin
were urgent that the former measure should be
adopted; assigning as their reason that after the
tergiversation and deceit of which the cabal had
been convicted, they would profit by any delay on
the part of the Government to strengthen their
army, and to effect other means of defence, thus
augmenting the difficulty of their suppression; the
Chancellor was, however, of a different opinion, and
counselled the Queen to avert, so long as it might
be possible to do so, the horrors of a civil war. He
represented to her the fact that all the principal
nobles, with scarcely one exception, had leagued
themselves with M. de Cond, while she had on her
side only the Ducs de Guise and d'Epernon, who
were, moreover, at variance; each coveting the
dignity of Conntable, and scarcely seeking to disguise
his jealousy of the other; and finally, he
pointed out to her the dangerous attitude assumed
by the Huguenots, who would not fail to take
advantage of any civil dissension to advance their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span>
pretensions, which could only be done successfully
during the minority of the sovereign.</p>

<p>Between these conflicting opinions Marie at
length resolved to steer a middle course; and she
consequently declared her intention of attempting
by negotiation to reconcile the Princes, while at the
same time she made a levy of six thousand Swiss
troops.<a id="footnotetag171" name="footnotetag171"></a><a href="#footnote171">[171]</a> She, moreover, by the advice of her
Council, addressed a circular-letter to all the Parliaments
of the kingdom, governors of provinces and
fortresses, and mayors of towns, exhorting them to
remain faithful to the Crown, and not to suffer themselves
to be seduced by the Prince de Cond and
his partisans; and terminating by the declaration
that her Majesty had determined to convoke the
States, in order to consult upon the measures necessary
for ensuring the welfare and prosperity of the
nation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile M. de Cond had assembled the
leaders of his party at Mzires, whence he forwarded
a species of manifesto to the Queen-Regent,
in which he complained in the name of his faction
of "the waste of the public money; of the unworthiness
of the individuals in power; of the undue
authority assumed by the ministers; of the want of
respect displayed towards the Princes of the Blood,
the peers, and the officers of the Crown; of the
obstacles endured by the Parliaments in the exercise
of their jurisdiction; of the ruin of the great nobles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span>
the excessive charges of the law courts; the oppression
suffered by the people; the neglect exhibited
in assembling the States-General; and the precipitation
shown in concluding the marriage of the
sovereign before he had attained his majority."
Other objections followed, and then succeeded the
conditions upon which the cabal declared themselves
willing to return to their allegiance. The States-General
were to be convened within three months;
the royal marriages were to be deferred until the
close of the Assembly; and the then-existing household
of his Majesty was to be replaced by individuals
of acknowledged probity.</p>

<p>The Prince at the same time wrote to the two
Parliaments, to the Prince de Conti, to the dukes
and peers, and to the great officers of the Crown,
soliciting their assistance in the work of reform
which he was about to undertake. Neither of the
Parliaments, however, replied to his letter; and that
addressed to Paris was placed unopened in the
hands of the Regent, who forthwith forwarded it to
the Chancellor.</p>

<p>The answer of Marie de Medicis to the manifesto
addressed to herself was calm and dignified.
She declared her willingness to assemble the States-General;
but accompanied this concession by expressing
her regret that the Prince should not,
during the last four years, have personally made the
representation, and assisted her in averting the evils
of which he now complained, instead of absenting
himself from the Court on the pretext of disapproving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg 275]</span>
the proposed alliance with Spain, to which he
had previously affixed his consent and signature.
To each of his other objections he received an
equally categorical reply; and the document terminated
by an expression of her conviction that his
offer to effect a reform in the state by pacific means
rather than have recourse to force was desirable
indeed, but little to be anticipated, since the formation
of a cabal like that of which he had constituted
himself the leader, and which was opposed to the
legitimate authority of the sovereign, could only
terminate in intestine broils, and compel the King
to adopt the most violent measures in order to
suppress it.</p>

<p>Precisely at this period intelligence reached the
Court of the death of the veteran Conntable de
Montmorency, one of the most gallant soldiers of
his day, whose judgment and strong sense had
long been proverbial, although he was utterly without
education, and could scarcely sign his own
name.</p>

<p>While the negotiation with Cond was still pending,
a new anxiety added to the embarrassment of
the Regent. The Swiss levies were about to be
raised; but suspicions of the loyalty of the Duc de
Rohan, who was colonel-general of this force, rendered
her unwilling to confide so important a body
of troops to his control; and she ultimately resolved
to offer him a sum of money, and to induce him to
resign his appointment. M. de Rohan readily
acceded to the proposal, his position at that moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span>
rendering him indifferent to its possession; and the
Queen next sought to find an individual whose
popularity with the Switzers, and devotion to her
own interests, might render him an eligible successor
to the displaced Duke. After considerable
reflection she selected Bassompierre; but the suggestion
was at once negatived by M. de Villeroy,
who reminded her Majesty that the office was one
which had never been filled by any person under
the rank of a prince. So brilliant a prospect, however,
gave the favoured courtier courage to plead
his cause so successfully with his royal mistress, that
she was at length induced to consent that, if he
were enabled to persuade the Swiss themselves to
solicit his appointment, the difficulty should be overcome.
Fortunately for the aspirant the officer to
whom the levies were entrusted was his personal
friend, and so zealously did he advocate his cause
that the Thirteen Cantons united in consenting to
receive him as their leader; and Bassompierre,
although only a petty noble of Lorraine, found himself
invested with a command which was coveted by
all the proudest subjects of France.</p>

<p>Two days subsequently the Court were informed
that the Prince de Cond and the Duc de Nevers
had taken Mzires and Sainte-Menehould, upon
which the newly-raised troops received orders to
join M. de Praslin, who, with the remainder of
the army, was concentrating his forces at Vitry.
Their arrival so alarmed the insurgent party that
they resolved to evacuate the latter city, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span>
demanded that even should the troops remain in their
vicinity, Bassompierre himself, who, from the share
that he had taken in the affair throughout, was
peculiarly obnoxious to them, should be recalled.
The Duc de Ventadour and the President Jeannin,
through whom M. de Cond and his party carried
on their negotiation with the King, accordingly wrote
to the young commander to apprise him that the
Regent required his services in the capital, for
reasons which she would explain on his arrival; and,
greatly to his mortification, Bassompierre found himself
compelled to retrace his steps.<a id="footnotetag172" name="footnotetag172"></a><a href="#footnote172">[172]</a></p>

<p>Once more Marie de Medicis resolved to afford
to the adverse faction the opportunity of terminating
their ill-advised struggle without bloodshed; and
she accordingly despatched a trustworthy messenger
to M. de Cond, volunteering to send deputies who
should be authorized to effect a reconciliation. The
offer was accepted, the malcontents having become
paralyzed by the unexpected energy of their opponents;
and after sundry meetings between the agents
of the Government and the chiefs of the cabal, in
which each made particular conditions for himself
which were veiled by three demands of a more
public nature, a treaty of peace was drawn up and
signed by both parties, and amity was once more
restored. Situated as they were, the Princes had
been careful not to insist on more than they were
aware would be readily conceded; and thus they
asked only that the States-General should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span>
convoked with as little delay as possible, that the
double alliance with Spain should be delayed until
the termination of the King's minority, and that
the royal troops should be immediately disarmed.</p>

<p>To this last requisition the reply of the commissioners
of the Crown was positive; the rebel faction
were in the first place to lay down their own arms
after which they pledged themselves that their
example should be followed by the troops of the
sovereign; and to this arrangement M. de Cond,
after some hesitation, agreed.</p>

<p>Thus far all had progressed favourably; but the
subsequent exactions of the disaffected party caused
considerable anxiety in the Council of the Regent.
The exorbitant pretensions of its leaders alarmed
the ministers, but the crisis was sufficiently critical
to induce them ultimately to satisfy the demands of
their dearly-purchased allies. The Prince de Cond
was invested with the government of Amboise, and
received four hundred and fifty thousand livres in
ready money. The Duc de Mayenne three hundred
thousand, and the survivorship of the government
of Paris; and all the other chiefs of the cabal the
sums or governments that they had seen fit to exact;
after which they ceased to insist upon the public
grievances, and the Ducs de Longueville and de
Mayenne returned to Court; an example which was
followed by the Prince de Cond as soon as he had
taken possession of his new government. The
coldness with which he was received, however, and
the little desire evinced to pay him that deference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>
which he was ever anxious to exact, soon disgusted
him with the capital, and he once more withdrew,
little less disaffected than before.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June the Duc d'Anjou and the
younger Princess were baptized at the Louvre with
great ceremony, by the Cardinal de Bonzy, the
almoner of the Queen. The sponsors of the Prince,
who received the names of Gaston Jean Baptiste,
were the ex-Queen Marguerite and the Cardinal de
Joyeuse; while those given to his sister, who was
held at the font by Madame and the Cardinal de la
Rochefoucauld, were Henriette Marie; this being
the Princess who subsequently became the wife of
the unhappy Charles I. of England.</p>

<p>The completion of the treaty with the Princes
had restored the nation to apparent tranquillity, and
the government of the Regent bore a semblance of
stability to which it had not previously attained,
when new troubles broke out through the restlessness
and jealousy of Csar de Vendme; who, having
merely been reinstated in his government and other
dignities, considered himself to have been ill-treated
by the Prince de Cond, to whose care he had confided
his interests, and who consequently resolved to
enforce more ample justice for himself. With a
view of effecting his purpose, he induced the Duc
de Retz, who was equally dissatisfied, to follow his
example, and Brittany soon became ripe for revolt.
As, however, Vendme did not fail to perceive that
without extending his faction he could not hope to
make head successfully against the Court, he next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span>
endeavoured to engage M. de Rohan and the Protestants
in his interest, believing the Duke to be
much more powerful with the reformed party than
he really was; and Rohan so far yielded as to
attempt a convocation of the General Assembly in
Gascony; but the prudence of Du Plessis-Mornay,
who represented to the Huguenots the impolicy of
embroiling themselves with the Government in order
to gratify the ambition of an individual, decided
them to refuse all participation in a political movement
of that nature.</p>

<p>Repulsed but not discouraged, Vendme still persevered,
and as his intrigues tended to unsettle the
minds of the people, and to harass the Regent, she
resolved to despatch the Marquis de Coeuvres, then
recently returned from his embassy in Italy, to
expostulate with him, and endeavour to recall him
to reason. This mission was peculiarly distasteful to
the Marquis, who, being nearly connected with M.
de Vendme through his mother (Gabrielle d'Estres),
was fearful, should he fail to effect his
purpose, that he must offend one or the other party;
but as the commands of the Queen-mother were
stringent, he was compelled to obey. His task
proved an arduous one, the two Dukes warmly
asserting their right to share in the benefits which
M. de Cond had secured for himself and his immediate
friends, and declaring their intention to
obtain by force what they had been denied by the
ingratitude of the Crown: nor was it until the envoy
had been a second time instructed to assure them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>
that should they persist in their disloyalty the King
was prepared to march an army against them, that
they were at length induced to sign a treaty which
had been drawn up for that purpose, and to lay down
their arms.</p>

<p>This desirable result had scarcely been accomplished
when the Prince de Cond, disappointed by
his government of Amboise (which he soon discovered
to be of much less importance than he had
imagined when he insisted upon its possession),
resolved to make himself master of the city of
Poitiers, where he had secured many and active
allies, among whom the most considerable was the
Due de Roannois, the governor; while in addition
to this advantage he had also received from the
Marquis de Bonnivet a promise that he would
furnish a body of troops to assist him in his enterprise.
The city was about to elect a mayor, and
the friends of Cond had exerted themselves to the
utmost to cause the choice of the citizens to fall
upon an individual of their own party, but their
design was penetrated by the Bishop,<a id="footnotetag173" name="footnotetag173"></a><a href="#footnote173">[173]</a> who hastened
to apprise the Regent of the cabal which had once
more been commenced against her authority.</p>

<p>The communication of the prelate renewed all the
apprehensions of Marie, who, after expressing her
acknowledgments for his zeal, commanded him to
adopt every means in his power to contravene the
endeavours of the Prince and his adherents; and so
ably did he fulfil her directions that he succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span>
winning over to the royal cause the greater number
of the inhabitants; which he had no sooner accomplished
than he caused the guards to be doubled,
and thus rendered himself more powerful in the city
than M. de Roannois himself. This fact soon
became apparent to Cond, but he still trusted to
the support of his friends, and accordingly presented
himself at the gates with a small retinue, believing
that the citizens would obey their governor, and
refuse to oppose his entrance. The Bishop had,
however, by the promptitude of his measures,
effectually defeated the hopes of the Prince. He
had loudly proclaimed in the streets that there was
a conspiracy on foot for delivering up the city to the
enemies of the King; and this announcement had
at once sufficed to arouse all the energy of the
inhabitants. In a short time the gates were closed,
chains were stretched across the thoroughfares, and
numerous barricades were erected. The prelate,
gratified by these fearless evidences of his influence,
became to the full as excited as his adherents, and
arming himself with a pike, he placed himself at the
head of the people, urging them to resist to the
utmost the dishonour by which they were threatened;
while the Governor, who was then inhabiting a
suburban residence, no sooner became apprised of
the belligerent demonstrations of the Bishop, and
the effects which they had produced, than he
galloped to the gates with the intention of opposing
his authority to that of his clerical antagonist. At
his command the gates were opened, and directing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span>
the immediate demolition of the barricades, he proceeded
to the episcopal palace; not, however,
without being subjected to the abuse of the irritated
populace. The Bishop, whose policy was not inferior
to his courage, offered him an asylum until the
fury of the crowd should be appeased; and M. de
Roannois, alarmed by the rough reception he had
already encountered, at once accepted the offer, and
thus became the prisoner of the prelate; who, producing
the letter of the Regent, issued the orders
necessary to ensure the safety of the city. Nor was
this all; for with a sword by his side, the Bishop
personally posted the sentinels at nightfall, and distributed
money from his own private purse to the
non-military combatants who had formed themselves
into a militia.</p>

<p>Enraged by his disappointment, M. de Cond,
after vainly attempting to obtain a hearing from the
excited citizens, found himself compelled to retire
with his companions, having on his way burnt down
the country palace of the bishops of Poitiers; and
he had no sooner reached that city than he wrote to
the Regent to complain of the insult to which he
had been subjected by the inhabitants of Poitiers,
and to demand justice. The sympathies of the
Court were, however, with the adverse party; but
Marie de Medicis was so well aware of the consequences
to be apprehended from Cond's irritation
that she resolved to proceed to Poitou and Brittany
in person, on the pretext of the weak health of the
King, by whom she was to be accompanied. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span>
accordingly caused a rumour to be spread that Louis
had displayed symptoms of disease which rendered
it probable that he could not long survive; and
having done this, the troops were warned to hold
themselves in readiness to leave the capital with his
Majesty. Meanwhile the Due de Mayenne was
despatched to M. de Cond to assure him on the
part of the Regent that every respect should be paid
to his representations, and at the same time letters of
abolition were sent to all his adherents; although
he was requested to retire from Poitou during the
sojourn of their Majesties. To this demand Cond
at first demurred; but finding that he could not
succeed in securing the assistance of the reformed
party, he at length consented to withdraw; and
not venturing to return to Amboise, he took
up his temporary residence at Chteauroux in
Berry.</p>

<p>The retreat of the Prince was a great triumph for
the warlike Bishop, who lost no time in proceeding
to Tours (where the Court had already arrived), at
the head of two hundred of his supporters, to entreat
of their Majesties to proceed at once to Poitiers, in
order to restore public confidence. His reception
by the Regent was gracious in the extreme, nor did
the young sovereign fail to express to the exulting
prelate his own sense of obligation. At Poitiers the
Court was met by the most enthusiastic acclamations:
their Majesties honoured the election of the
new mayor with their presence; and the lieutenant-generalship
of the province was bestowed upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span>
Comte de la Rochefoucauld, an adherent of the Due
de Guise.</p>

<p>From Poitiers the Court proceeded to Angers,
on its way to Brittany; where, however, the Due de
Vendme did not wait its arrival to make his submission.
The inertness of the Government upon
previous occasions not having prepared him for the
energy now exhibited by the sovereign, his alarm
was correspondingly increased; and he hastened to
meet their Majesties accompanied by all the nobility
of the province. On approaching the King he laid
his sword at his feet; and, as he knelt beside it,
entreated his forgiveness of his past errors, and expressed
his determination thenceforward to give him
no further subject of complaint; upon which Louis
commanded him to rise, and granted him a free
pardon, which was ratified by the Regent. Letters
patent were despatched by which he was reinstated
in his government, and made irresponsible for all
the excesses committed by his troops; and once more
the son of Gabrielle d'Estres was restored to the
favour, if not to the confidence, of his sovereigns.</p>

<p>The assembly of the States then took place at
Nantes, presided over by the Duc de Rohan; and
during its meetings the King was apprised by its
members of the enormities of which the followers of
Vendme had been guilty throughout the province,
and respectfully solicited to exclude from the letters
of abolition the authors of the frightful crimes of
which the people had been made the victims. Among
those of which they complained were the ransom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span>
wives by their husbands, of daughters and young
children by their parents, and of fields of grain by
their owners. They, moreover, demanded justice
for still greater enormities; and revealed to the
Council the appalling fact that wealthy individuals
had been subjected to torture, and in many instances
even put to death, in order to obtain possession of
their money; while others had been compelled to
pay a heavy sum to save their dwellings and their
property from the brand of the incendiary.</p>

<p>These frightful revelations excited the horror and
indignation of Marie and her Council; and, in reply
to their requisition, the complainants were assured
that, although the King and his Government had
preferred to pardon the injuries which they had
personally sustained from the faction of M. de
Vendme, rather than visit them with the vengeance
that they had legally merited, neither the sovereign
nor those who held office under him could permit
crimes like those detailed in their remonstrance to
be exercised with impunity upon the people, and
those crimes would consequently be punished with
the most extreme rigour.</p>

<p>The first independent act of the Duc de Vendme
had thus greatly injured him in the estimation of the
young monarch and his mother; nor did his afterlife
tend to give them cause to alter the opinion
which they then formed either as regarded his
stability or his capacity. Even the marriage which
his father, Henri IV, had with so much difficulty
contracted for him with the heiress of the House of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span>
Mercoeur,<a id="footnotetag174" name="footnotetag174"></a><a href="#footnote174">[174]</a> failed to produce the result that had been
anticipated, as he squandered her wealth, without
increasing his own political importance.<a id="footnotetag175" name="footnotetag175"></a><a href="#footnote175">[175]</a></p>

<p>On her triumphant return to the capital Marie
de Medicis was apprised of the death of the Prince
de Conti, which had taken place on the 13th of
August; but the void was little felt, the infirmities
under which he laboured, and the weakness of his
intellect, having, despite his exalted rank, rendered
him a mere cipher at the Court. By the nation his
loss was totally unfelt; while this indifference was
shared by his wife, whose violent passion for Bassompierre
had long been notorious, and who shortly
afterwards privately gave him her hand. Mademoiselle
d'Entragues, the sister of the Marquise de
Verneuil, to whom he had previously been betrothed,
and who had made him the father of a son,<a id="footnotetag176" name="footnotetag176"></a><a href="#footnote176">[176]</a> had in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span>
vain endeavoured in the law courts to compel him
to fulfil his contract, and persisted in bearing his
name; a fact which was so well known as to induce
many persons to believe that she was in reality his
wife. On one occasion, when he was in attendance
upon the Queen, the royal carriage was detained for
a moment by the crowd near that of Mademoiselle
d'Entragues, whom Marie immediately recognized.
"See," she said with a malicious smile, as she
pointed towards the lady with her fan, "there is
Madame de Bassompierre."</p>

<p>"That is merely a <i>nom de guerre</i>, Madame," was
the ready reply, uttered in a tone sufficiently loud
to reach the ears of the person named, who angrily
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You are a fool, Bassompierre!"</p>

<p>"If I be not," was the quiet rejoinder of the ungallant
Lothario, "it has at least, Madame, not been
your fault." <a id="footnotetag177" name="footnotetag177"></a><a href="#footnote177">[177]</a></p>

<p>Thus, after his union with the Princesse de Conti,
Bassompierre, although claimed as a husband by
two celebrated women, the one of a family notorious
for the profligacy of its members, and the other a
daughter of the proud house of Guise and, moreover,
the widow of a Prince of the Blood, still continued
to assume the privileges of a bachelor; resolutely
disowning the one, while the other did not dare
publicly to declare her marriage.<a id="footnotetag178" name="footnotetag178"></a><a href="#footnote178">[178]</a></p>

<p>A fortnight after the return of the Court to Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span>
it was followed by the Prince de Cond, who had
been summoned to attend the sovereign to Parliament
on the termination of his minority, which
ended when he entered his thirteenth year. On
the 1st of October, the day preceding that on which
the ceremony of his recognition as actual monarch
of France was to take place, Louis XIII issued a
declaration confirmatory of the edict of pacification
previously published, and renewing his prohibition
against duelling and blasphemy. On the following
morning the King ascended his Bed of Justice; and
both the procession and the meeting were conducted
with the greatest pomp. He was attended
by the Queen-mother, Monsieur, and the Princes de
Cond and de Soissons, the Ducs de Guise, d'Elboeuf,
d'Epernon, de Ventadour, and de Montbazon, and upwards
of eight hundred mounted nobles, all attired in
the most sumptuous manner. On his arrival at the
palace the King was received by two presidents and
four councillors, by whom he was conducted to the
great hall; and after all the persons present had
taken their places, his Majesty briefly declared the
purpose for which he had convened the meeting.
Marie de Medicis then in her turn addressed the
Assembly, declaring that she had resigned the administration
of public affairs into the hands of the
sovereign, who had some days previously attained
his majority; and when she had ceased speaking
Louis expressed his acknowledgments for the
valuable services which she had rendered to the
kingdom, his resolution still to be guided by her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span>
advice, and entreated her not to withhold from him
her important assistance in the Government. The
Chancellor, the First President,<a id="footnotetag179" name="footnotetag179"></a><a href="#footnote179">[179]</a> and the Advocate-General<a id="footnotetag180" name="footnotetag180"></a><a href="#footnote180">[180]</a>
each delivered a harangue; after which
the Chancellor pronounced the decree which declared
the majority of the sovereign; and the declaration
that he had forwarded to the Council on the previous
day was duly registered. This act terminated the
ceremony, and Louis XIII returned to the Louvre
accompanied and attended as he had reached the
Parliament, amid the acclamations of the populace.</p>

<p>The assembly of the States-General at Sens had
been fixed for the 10th of September, and would
consequently have been held before the King had
attained his majority, had not this arrangement been
traversed by the Regent, who apprehended that
they would seize so favourable an opportunity of
thwarting all her views; and would not only demand
the dismissal of the ministers and the Marchal
d'Ancre, but also, which was still more important,
dissuade the sovereign, whose minority would
terminate during their sitting, from permitting her
to retain any share in the Government. The
Prince de Cond and his partisans, whose interests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg 291]</span>
undoubtedly demanded such a result, had, however,
themselves been instrumental in the delay so
earnestly desired by Marie; the hostile demonstrations
of Vendme in Brittany, and the ill-judged
movements of Cond himself in Poitou, having
furnished her with a plausible pretext for deferring
the opening of the States until the King could preside
over them in person; when the public declaration
made before the Parliament by the young
sovereign of his intention still to be guided by the
counsels of his mother at once freed her from all her
apprehensions; and she accordingly lost no time in
transferring the Assembly from Sens to Paris, and
proroguing it till the 10th of October.</p>

<p>Nevertheless much was to be feared should the
clergy, the nobility, and the people act unanimously;
and in order to prevent such a coalition, neither
Marie de Medicis nor her ministers spared any
exertion. As much depended upon the presidents
whom they might select, the first care of the Queen-mother
was to ensure the election of persons
favourable to her own interests; but as great caution
was necessary with regard to the agent to whom she
could entrust so delicate a mission as that of causing
such individuals to be chosen, she hesitated for a
time before she came to a decision. Ultimately,
however, she fixed upon the young Comte de
Brienne;<a id="footnotetag181" name="footnotetag181"></a><a href="#footnote181">[181]</a> and so thoroughly did he justify her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span>
preference, that he eventually succeeded, without any
appearance of undue interposition, in securing the
election of three presidents, all of whom were
favourable to the Court party.<a id="footnotetag182" name="footnotetag182"></a><a href="#footnote182">[182]</a></p>

<p>This important point gained, the Government
recovered its confidence; and its next care was to
awaken the jealousy of each order against its coadjutors,
and thus to paralyze the influence of the
Assembly. In this attempt it was perfectly successful;
and the general welfare of the country was
overlooked in the anxiety of the several parties to
carry out their own individual views. The clergy
demanded the publication of the decrees of the
Council of Trent, and their unrestricted admission
throughout the kingdom; the nobility asked that
the privilege of the <i>paulette</i> should be abolished;<a id="footnotetag183" name="footnotetag183"></a><a href="#footnote183">[183]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span>
and the <i>tiers-tat</i><a id="footnotetag184" name="footnotetag184"></a><a href="#footnote184">[184]</a> solicited either the suppression or
diminution of the pensions by which the public
treasury was involved in debt.</p>

<p>The speaker elected by the clergy was the Archbishop
of Lyons; the nobility chose as their spokesman
the Baron du Pont Saint-Pierre,<a id="footnotetag185" name="footnotetag185"></a><a href="#footnote185">[185]</a> while the
<i>tiers-tat</i> was presided over by M. Miron.<a id="footnotetag186" name="footnotetag186"></a><a href="#footnote186">[186]</a> The two
first-named orators addressed the King standing and
bareheaded; but this privilege was considered too
great for a body which could boast of neither
hereditary nor ecclesiastical nobility; and the able
diplomatist and rhetorician who upon that occasion
pleaded before his sovereign the rights and immunities
of the class which he had been called upon
to represent, was compelled to address that sovereign
upon his knees. Miron had, previous to
the meeting of the States, excited the indignation
of the more patrician orders by declaring that he
regarded the three bodies of which it was composed
as one family, of which the nobility and clergy
represented the elder, and the <i>tiers-tat</i> the junior
branches; while the Queen herself, even while she
felt the importance of his support, did not hesitate
to treat the deputies of his order with the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span>
arrogance and discourtesy, although they distinguished
themselves by a loyalty and devotion to the
interests of the Crown which met with no response
from the haughtier members of the Assembly.
Ably, indeed, through the agency of Miron, did
they persist in defending the royal prerogative, and
demand that a principle should be established forbidding
the deposition of their sovereigns on
accusations of heresy; expressing their desire that
the Crown should be recognized by law as completely
independent of spiritual power; and although the
clergy, through Cardinal Duperron, formally and
strenuously opposed these propositions, so little was
Miron affected by the adverse circumstances under
which he appeared, that he replied with a logic and
energy which compelled the States to defer their
decision until the following year.<a id="footnotetag187" name="footnotetag187"></a><a href="#footnote187">[187]</a></p>

<p>Louis XIII, at this period, was in so delicate a
state of health as to require constant care and
attention, while his sullen and self-centred disposition
demanded no less watchfulness. His first preceptor
was M. Vauquelin des Ivetaux, a man of great
talent, and quite equal to the task of forming the
mind and intellect of a Prince, but of dissolute
principles and sensual habits.<a id="footnotetag188" name="footnotetag188"></a><a href="#footnote188">[188]</a> He, however, did
not long remain about the person of the boy-King,
having been replaced a year after the death of
Henri IV by Nicolas Le Fvre,<a id="footnotetag189" name="footnotetag189"></a><a href="#footnote189">[189]</a> who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span>
distinguished alike for his learning and his piety.
Unfortunately for the young Louis, this excellent
man only lived a year after his appointment, and
was, in his turn, replaced by M. de Rivault,<a id="footnotetag190" name="footnotetag190"></a><a href="#footnote190">[190]</a> a
celebrated mathematician, who had been educated
with Guy, Comte de Laval.<a id="footnotetag191" name="footnotetag191"></a><a href="#footnote191">[191]</a> Thus, however competent
these several individuals might have been
to conduct his education, it will be at once evident
that the perpetual changes of method and purpose
to which he was subjected greatly tended to impede
the progress of the illustrious pupil; and it consequently
ceases to be matter of surprise that at his
majority he had by no means attained to the degree
of knowledge common to his age. Louis XIII
knew little Latin; cared nothing for literature; but
although either irritable or inert when compelled to
study, could develop great energy when he was
engaged in gunnery, horsemanship, or falconry.
The latter pursuit was his principal amusement,
His purity of heart and propriety of language were
extreme, and deserve the greater mention from the
contrast which they afforded to the morals and
manners by which he was surrounded. He would
neither permit an oath nor an obscene expression to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span>
be uttered in his presence, and never failed to
rebuke any violation of his pleasure in this respect.
He was passionately attached to dogs, and conversed
with them, according to a contemporaneous
historian, in a peculiar language;<a id="footnotetag192" name="footnotetag192"></a><a href="#footnote192">[192]</a> but as regarded
his kingly duties he was utterly incompetent. With
good intentions, a love of justice, and a deep sense
of religion, he was vacillating and indolent; and
cared little either to assert his privileges, or to take
upon himself the cares and fatigues of government
while he could transfer them to others, and thus
secure time to abandon himself to more congenial
pursuits.</p>

<p>In this circumstance were comprised all the errors
of his reign; as even while deeply imbued with a
sense of his dignity as the sovereign of a great
nation, he exhibited the feeling only in acts of petty
and obstinate opposition which tended to no result,
and were productive only of a want of attachment
to his person, and of respect for his opinions, which
increased the arrogance of the great nobles, and
fostered the ambition of his ministers.</p>

<p>It is now time that we should introduce an
individual whose subsequent importance in the
kingdom, humble as were his antecedents, was one
source of the bitter trials to which the unfortunate
Marie de Medicis was subjected during a long
period of her life. The Comte de Lude had in his
service a page, who was subsequently transferred to
that of the young King; and it is the history of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg 297]</span>
apparently insignificant person which we are now
called upon to detail to the reader. Albert de
Luynes, his father, was the son of Guillaume Sgur,
a canon of the cathedral of Marseilles, and of the
housekeeper of the said ecclesiastic; and derived
the name of Luynes from a small tenement upon
the bank of that river, between Aix and Marseilles,
which was the property of the canon, who preferred
that his son should adopt the appellation of his farm
rather than his own. There was, however, an elder
brother, on whom the little property belonging to
the priest was exclusively bestowed, and Luynes
accordingly discovered that he must become the
architect of his own fortunes. With all the fearless
confidence of youth he made his way, as he best
could, to the capital, where he enlisted as an archer
of the bodyguard, displayed great aptitude and
courage, and finally obtained the governorship of
Pont-St.-Esprit. While thus prospering in the
world he married, became the father of seven
children, of whom three were sons; and died
without suspecting that his name would be handed
down to posterity through the medium of one of
these almost portionless boys, whose sole inheritance
was a small dairy-farm of the annual value of twelve
hundred livres.</p>

<p>Charles de Luynes, the elder of this numerous
family, became, as already stated, the page of the
Comte de Lude; and, as his brothers were totally
without resources, he induced his patron to receive
them gratuitously into his suite, in order that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span>
might be enabled to share with them the four
hundred crowns a year which, together with his
slender patrimony, formed his own income. This
favour had no sooner been conceded than the three
young men discarded the modest names of Charles,
Honor, and Lon d'Albert, by which they had
previously been known, and assumed those of
Luynes, Cadenet, and Brants, from the field, the
vineyard, and a small sandy island beside them, which
composed their joint estate.<a id="footnotetag193" name="footnotetag193"></a><a href="#footnote193">[193]</a> "Possessions," as
Bassompierre facetiously observes, "over which a
hare leapt every day." On the miserable pittance
of the elder brother the three young adventurers,
nevertheless, contrived with considerable difficulty
to exist, although it was notorious that they had but
one cloak, at that period an indispensable article of
costume, among them; a circumstance by which
two were compelled to avoid observation while
the third fulfilled his duties; and so little, moreover,
were their services valued by M. de Lude that he
was in the habit of declaring that they were fit for
nothing but "to catch green jays," a reproach which
they owed to their skill in training sparrow-hawks
to catch small birds; and to which he was far from
supposing when he gave it utterance that they
would ultimately be indebted for a prosperity almost
fabulous.</p>

<p>Such, however, was fated to be the case. Charles
de Luynes had not been long at Court before he
ascertained the passion of the young King for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span>
falconry, and having carefully trained two of his
miniature hawks, he caused them to be offered in
his name to his royal master. Louis was delighted
with their docility and skill, and desired that the
donor should be presented to him; when he found
that the page was deeply versed in all the mysteries
of that sport to which he was himself so much
attached; and thenceforward he constantly commanded
his attendance whenever he pursued his
favourite pastime in the gardens of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>At this period M. de Luynes had already attained
his thirtieth year; and, with admirable self-government,
he had so thoroughly controlled himself as to
disguise the salient features of his character. No
one consequently suspected either his latent
ambition, or the violent passions which he had craft
enough to conceal; and thus the very individuals
who were the objects of his hatred regarded him
merely as a shallow and superficial young man,
whose whole soul was in the puerile sports to which
he had addicted himself.</p>

<p>It was not, however, solely to take small birds
that De Luynes aspired when he thus found himself
the chosen companion of the Dauphin; he had
other talents which he exerted so zealously that he
ere long made himself indispensable. Gifted with a
magnificent person, insinuating manners, and that
ready tact by which an indolent nature is unconsciously
roused to excitement, he soon obtained
an extraordinary influence over his royal playmate
by the power which he possessed of overcoming his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span>
habitual apathy, and causing him to enter with zest
and enjoyment into the pleasures of his age. Henri
IV, who perceived with gratification the beneficial
effect produced upon the saturnine nature of his son,
and who was, moreover, touched by the fraternal
devotion of the page, transferred him to the household
of the Dauphin, and augmented his income to
twelve hundred crowns; and thenceforward he
became at once the companion, counsellor, and
friend of the young Louis; and at the desire of
the Prince he was created Master of the Aviary.</p>

<p>Time passed on. The Dauphin succeeded to
the throne of his murdered father; the Regency
tottered under the machinations of the great nobles;
faction grew out of faction; cabals and conspiracies
kept the nation in one perpetual state of anxiety
and unrest; but the influence of De Luynes
continued undiminished; and neither Marie de
Medicis nor her ministers apprehended any danger
from an association that was fated to produce the
most serious consequences; while the Princes were
equally disinclined to disturb the amusements in
which the young monarch was so entirely absorbed
as to pay little attention to the important events
which succeeded each other around him.</p>

<p>As he grew older Louis became still more
attached to his favourite. His discontented spirit
made him irritable under every disappointment, and
vindictive towards those by whom his wishes were
opposed: he detested alike explanation and remonstrance,
and from De Luynes he never encountered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span>
either the one or the other. Under the remonstrances
of his mother he became sullen; to the
arrogant assumption of the Princes and the
Marchal d'Ancre he opposed an apathetic silence
which caused them to believe that it was unfelt;
and it was only to De Luynes that he poured forth
all his indignation, that he complained with bitterness
of the iron rule of Marie, the insolence of his
nobles, and the ostentatious profusion of the Italian:
contrasting the first with his own helplessness, the
second with the insignificance to which he was
condemned, and the last with the almost penury to
which he was compelled to submit.</p>

<p>No Prince had ever a more attentive or a more
interested auditor. The enemies of the young
Louis were also those of his favourite; for, as before
remarked, the grandson of the reverend canon of
Marseilles was alike vain and ambitious, and consequently
inimical to all who occupied the high
places to which he himself aspired. Moreover, the
powerlessness and poverty of the young monarch
necessarily involved those of his follower; and thus
both by inclination and by interest De Luynes was
bound to share the antipathies of his master.</p>

<p>Like all favourites, moreover, he soon made a
host of personal adversaries; while, as these were
far from suspecting the height to which he was
ultimately destined to attain, they took little pains
to dissemble their dislike and contempt of the new
minion; and thus, ere long, De Luynes had
amassed a weighty load of hatred in his heart. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span>
him it appeared that all the great dignitaries of the
kingdom, although born to the rank they held, were
engrossing honours which, possessed as he was of
the favour of the sovereign, should have been
conferred upon himself; but the especial antipathy
of the arrogant adventurer was directed against the
Queen, the Marchal d'Ancre, and the President
Jeannin. To account for his bitter feeling towards
Marie de Medicis, it is only necessary to state that,
blinded by his ambition, he had dared to display for
the haughty Princess a passion which was coldly
and disdainfully repulsed; and that he had vowed
to revenge the overthrow of his hopes.<a id="footnotetag194" name="footnotetag194"></a><a href="#footnote194">[194]</a></p>

<p>His hatred of Concini is as easily explained; it
being merely the jealousy of a rival favourite. The
Italian was to the mother of the King precisely what
De Luynes was to the King himself; and as Marie
possessed more power than her son, so also was her
follower more richly recompensed. Still, however,
the game was an unequal one, of which the chances
were all in his own favour; for the Marchal was
playing away the present, while his adversary was
staking upon the future. The President Jeannin
was also, as we have stated, especially distasteful to
De Luynes, as he made no secret of his dissatisfaction
at the frivolous existence of the young
sovereign, and his desire that he should exchange
the boyish diversions to which he was addicted for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span>
pursuits more worthy of his high station; while at
the same time he exhibited towards the favourite
an undisguised disdain which excited all the worst
passions of its object.</p>

<p>Thus, insignificant as he appeared to those who
were basking in favour, and who esteemed themselves
too highly to waste one thought upon the
obsequious dependent of a youthful and wayward
sovereign, who suffered himself to be guided by
those about him as though reckless of the result of
their conflicting ambitions, it will be readily understood
that De Luynes was laying up a store of
antipathies which required only time and opportunity
to develop themselves, and to bear the most bitter
fruits; and already did the active favourite begin to
enjoy a foretaste of the coming harvest. Ever
earnest for right, Louis XIII never exhibited any
personal energy to secure it, and consequently could
effect nothing of himself; readily prejudiced, alike
by his own caprices and by the representations of
others, his very anxiety to act as became a monarch
rendered him vulnerable to the intrigues of those
whose interests tended to mislead his judgment;
and as De Luynes, while sharing in his superstitious
acts of overstrained devotion, or amusing his idleness
by the futilities of falconry and other even less
dignified sports, did not fail occasionally and
cautiously to allude to more serious subjects, the
boy-King listened eagerly to the recitals and
opinions of his chosen friend, and finished by
adopting all his views.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg 304]</span>
This fact soon became so obvious to Concini,
that the wily Italian, who dreaded lest the day
might not be far distant when the son of Marie de
Medicis would shake off the yoke of her quasi-regency
and assert his own prerogative, resolved to
secure the good offices of De Luynes, and for this
purpose he induced M. de Cond to restore to the
King the government of Amboise; representing to
the Prince the slight importance of such a possession
to a person of his rank, and the conviction which its
voluntary surrender must impress upon the ministers
of his desire to strengthen the royal cause. Let it
not be supposed, however, that, at the period of
which we write, such a surrender could for a
moment be effected gratuitously; and thus, when
the first Prince of the Blood was at length induced
to yield to the representations of his insidious
adviser, the terms of the bargain were fully understood
on both sides; but even when he had
succeeded in obtaining the consent of M. de Cond
himself to the arrangement, Concini had still to
overcome the scruples of the Queen-mother, to
whom he hastened to suggest that the vacant
government should be bestowed upon Charles de
Luynes.</p>

<p>As he had anticipated, Marie de Medicis was
startled by so extraordinary a proposition. De
Luynes was a mere hanger-on of the Court; the
companion of the boyish pleasures of her son; and
without one claim to honour or advancement. But
these very arguments strengthened the position of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span>
the Marchal. The poverty of the King's favourite
secured, as he averred, his fidelity to those who
might lay the foundations of his fortune; and if, as
the astute Italian moreover cleverly remarked, De
Luynes were in truth merely the playmate of the
monarch, he possessed at least the merit of engrossing
his thoughts, and of thus rendering him
less desirous to control or to criticize the measures
of others. Marie yielded to this argument; she had
begun to love power for its own sake; and she
could not disguise from herself that her future
tenure of authority must depend solely upon the will
of the young sovereign. In order, therefore, to
secure to herself the good offices of one so influential
with his royal master as De Luynes, she consented
to follow the advice of Concini, who forthwith, in
her name, remunerated M. de Cond for his
secession by upwards of a hundred thousand
crowns, and the grandson of Guillaume Sgur
became governor of the city and fortress of
Amboise.<a id="footnotetag195" name="footnotetag195"></a><a href="#footnote195">[195]</a></p>

 In 1598 Henri IV had marched against the Duc de Mercoeur,
who still held part of Brittany; and as the Duke found himself, immediately
on the appearance of the King, deserted by the nobility of
the duchy, he gave himself up for lost. Opposition was of course
useless; and he was about to surrender to the royal troops upon the
best terms which he could obtain, when he saved himself by a lucky
expedient. He was aware of the violent passion still felt by Henry
for Gabrielle d'Estres, and in order to escape the penalty of his
rebellion he offered the hand of his only daughter, with the duchies
of Estampes, Penthivre, and Mercoeur as her dowry, to the King's
natural son Csar de Vendme; a proposal which was at once
accepted, as the monarch was aware that it would gratify the ambition
of his mistress. Subsequently, however, after the death of
her father, the family of Mademoiselle de Mercoeur had objected to
the alliance, and it had required all the authority of Henry to compel
its accomplishment.&mdash;Davila, <i>Hist. of Modern Europe</i>, London,

 Louis Servin, Councillor of State, Advocate-General of the
Parliament of Paris, and one of the most able magistrates of his
time, served with zeal and fidelity under Henri III, Henri IV, and
Louis XIII. He died suddenly, at the feet of the latter monarch,
on the 19th of March 1626, while remonstrating with him in the
name of the Parliament, where he was holding his Bed of Justice,
against certain financial edicts. He was the author of several legal
writings, orations, and sundry other works.

 Henri Auguste de Lomnie, Comte de Brienne, was the son of
Antoine de Lomnie and of Anne d'Aubourg, and was born in 1594.
In 1609 he attracted the attention of Henri IV, who occasionally
admitted him to his councils, in order to familiarize him with public
affairs; and Marie de Medicis continued, after the death of that
monarch, to honour him with her regard. In 1617 he became
Master of the Ceremonies and Provost of the King's Orders. In
1621 he followed Louis XIII to Languedoc, where he distinguished
himself at the siege of Clrac; and in the following campaign he
served under the Prince de Cond with equal credit. After
struggling successfully throughout the long and stormy administration
of Richelieu, he incurred the displeasure of Louis XIII a short
time after the death of that minister, and disposed of his office as
secretary of state; but during the regency of Anne of Austria he
was recalled; and until Louis XIV undertook to govern the nation
in his own person, he retained great influence in the Council. Age
was, however, creeping upon him; and a short time subsequent
to the marriage of that monarch, having attained his sixty-seventh
year, he retired from the Government. He died in 1666.

<p>The assembly of the States-General occupied the
commencement of the year 1615; and was closed
on the 22nd of February, by their Majesties in
person, with extreme pomp. When the King and
his august mother had taken their seats, and
the heralds had proclaimed silence, Armand Jean
du Plessis, Bishop of Luon,<a id="footnotetag196" name="footnotetag196"></a><a href="#footnote196">[196]</a> presented to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span>
sovereign the requisition of the clergy; and after a
long harangue, in which he detailed their several
demands, he entered into an animated eulogium of
the administration of the Queen, exhorting his
Majesty to continue to her the power of which she
had so ably availed herself during his minority. He
spoke fluently, but in a broken and uncertain voice,
and with an apparent apathy, which, according to
contemporaneous authors, gave no indication of the
extraordinary talents that he subsequently displayed.</p>

<p>The States-General had no sooner closed than
Marie de Medicis resolved to terminate the double
alliance which had been concluded with Spain, and
in honour of this event she determined that Madame,
the promised bride of Philip, should appear in a
ballet, which by the sumptuousness of its decorations,
the beauty of its machinery, and the magnificence of
its entire arrangements, should eclipse every entertainment
of the kind hitherto exhibited at the
French Court.</p>

<p>"It is necessary," she said, "that my daughter
should give a public festival before her departure for
Spain, and that the Parisians should remember a
Princess who is about to be lost to France."</p>

<p>That the worthy citizens were on their part most
anxious so to do, is evident from the testimony of
Bassompierre, who states that the Court officials,
being unprepared for so great a crowd as that which</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span>
<p>presented itself upon the occasion, had not taken
proper precautions, and it was subsequently found
necessary to postpone the amusement for some days,
and to arrange that no one should enter the Salle de
Bourbon without a ticket; which the Duc d'Epernon
and himself were entrusted to receive.<a id="footnotetag197" name="footnotetag197"></a><a href="#footnote197">[197]</a></p>

<p>This entertainment was followed by another of
a similar description at the Htel de Cond; but
although they affected to be equally engrossed by
the festivities in which they shared, neither the
Queen nor the Prince were so indifferent to their
personal interests as they endeavoured to appear.
Marie de Medicis was striving to discover some
means of frustrating the cabals which were perpetually
thwarting her designs, and threatening her
authority, while M. de Cond was as eager as ever
to undermine her power. The Marchal d'Ancre
was intriguing to effect the disgrace of the ministers,
particularly that of Villeroy, whose alliance he
no longer coveted; and the great nobles were
busied in searching for some pretext sufficiently
plausible to cause the ruin of the domineering
favourite who presumed to treat them rather as
inferiors than as equals. Thus the gilded surface
of the Court concealed a mass of hatred, jealousy,
and unrest, which threatened every instant to reveal
itself, and to dispel an illusion as false as it was
flattering: and while the foreign guests of the young
monarch danced and feasted, and the native nobility
struggled to surpass them in magnificence and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span>
frivolity, the more thoughtful spectators of the
glittering scene trembled at its instability, and every
instant anticipated an outbreak.</p>

<p>The attempt of Concini proved successful, and
the deportment of Marie towards M. de Villeroy
became so chilling that he withdrew from the
Court, without seeking to ascertain the cause of
his disgrace.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March the ex-Queen Marguerite
breathed her last, but for some time previously she
had appeared so seldom at Court that her death did
not tend to disturb the gaieties of the royal circle,
who had almost ceased to remember her existence.
She had outlived even the reputation of her
vices.</p>

<p>When the Prince de Cond and his faction
demanded a meeting of the States they were far
from anticipating its results; the unanimous loyalty
of the deputies having greatly subserved the interests
of the Queen, and thus weakened their own
position. Aware too late of the error which they
had committed, they were consequently compelled
to seek elsewhere for support, and it was at length
decided that they should excite the disaffection of
the Parliament, by representing that all the services
which its members had rendered to Marie on her
assumption of the regency had been repaid by
ingratitude and neglect; and that they no longer
commanded that authority in the Government to
which they were justly entitled. Coupled with these
insidious arguments were profuse offers of assistance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg 311]</span>
to enable them to enforce their rights, and the object
of the faction was at once gained; the ambition and
the vanity of the Parliament being alike engaged in
a question which involved their own influence and
importance. Strong in the support of the Princes,
they, however, overacted the part assigned to them,
and proceeded so arrogantly to remonstrate with
the sovereign upon what they termed the abuses of
the Government, that the King issued a decree in
Council, by which he abrogated both their own
decree and their remonstrances, declaring that they
had exceeded the power accorded to them by the
law; and commanding that those documents should
be cancelled, torn from the registers, and delivered
to his Majesty on the receipt of the royal decree.
The Parliament, however, expostulated, and although
they were again commanded to deliver up the obnoxious
records, they failed to obey; and thus, by
their determination, overruled the will of the
sovereign.</p>

<p>During this struggle for power the Prince de
Cond had absented himself from Paris, in order to
avert any suspicion of connivance; but previous
experience had rendered the Queen distrustful of
his movements, and she was consequently prepared
to counteract his subsequent intrigues. The Council
had, accordingly, no sooner annulled the decree of
the Parliament, than she sent to forbid him, in the
name of the King, from assisting in their deliberations;
upon which the Prince availed himself of so
specious a pretext for abandoning the Court, alleging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span>
that he no longer considered it safe to remain in the
capital.<a id="footnotetag198" name="footnotetag198"></a><a href="#footnote198">[198]</a></p>

<p>In accordance with this declaration he left Paris
by the Porte St. Antoine, followed by the acclamations
of the populace, who, weary of the rule of the
Queen, and exasperated by the arrogance of her
favourites, regarded M. de Cond as a victim, and
thus rendered his retreat a new subject of anxiety
to the Court party. Nor was their annoyance
decreased when they ascertained that throughout
his journey to Creil, where he possessed an estate
on the banks of the Oise, he was met by numerous
bodies of armed citizens from Senlis, Mantes,
Beaumont, and other towns, and was accompanied
by the Duc de Longueville and the nobles attached
to his cause. Within a league of Creil the harquebusiers
were drawn up to receive him, with drums
beating and colours flying, and thus escorted he
finally entered the city.</p>

<p>On learning these circumstances Marie de Medicis
became apprehensive that he might avail himself of
so favourable an opportunity to raise an army, and
enter into open rebellion against the Crown; and in
order to avert this contingency, she lost no time in
despatching a messenger who was instructed to
invite him to return to Paris, and to accompany the
Court in their approaching journey to Guienne. M.
de Cond was, however, aware of the advantage
which he had gained, and resolutely refused to
retrace his steps until the King reformed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg 313]</span>
Council, replied to the remonstrances of the Parliament,
and redressed the alleged wrongs of himself
and his friends; demanding in his own name the
presidency of the Council, and the ministry of finance
which had been promised to him; while the Marchal
de Bouillon, in his turn, asked as the price of
his obedience the office of Conntable de France
vacant by the death of the Duc de Montmorency.<a id="footnotetag199" name="footnotetag199"></a><a href="#footnote199">[199]</a></p>

<p>These demands not being conceded, the Prince
de Cond refused to accompany the King to
Guienne, an example which was followed by many
of the high nobility; and the faction became ere long
so formidable that a civil war appeared inevitable.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Marchal d'Ancre and his adherents
affected to treat the warlike demonstrations
of the adverse party with contempt, and assured
Marie de Medicis that all the efforts of the Prince
must prove abortive while the King possessed a
strong army and able generals to oppose the forces
of the malcontents; and, in support of his assertion,
the Ducs de Guise and d'Epernon alike offered
their services to her Majesty. In the former, however,
Marie dared not confide; his near relative, the
Duc de Mayenne, being the ally of Cond, while De
Guise himself was the avowed enemy of Concini. Of
M. d'Epernon's sincerity she felt more assured; but
she was aware that she could not bestow upon him
the command of the royal army without exciting the
jealousy of Guise, and thus opening up a newsource
of difficulty. Desirous of proceeding to Guienne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span>
without further delay, the Queen consequently urged
her advisers to suggest some other individual to
whom so serious a responsibility might be entrusted;
and after considerable deliberation the
Duc d'Epernon, the Chancellor, and his son the
Chevalier de Sillery proposed to the Marchal
d'Ancre that he should become a candidate for
the command, offering at the same time to exert all
their influence with the Queen to ensure his success.<a id="footnotetag200" name="footnotetag200"></a><a href="#footnote200">[200]</a></p>

<p>Blinded by vanity, Concini, who was a soldier
only in name, did not fail to listen with greedy
ears to this unexpected proposition; and while his
seeming friends were speculating upon his ruin, and
calculating that during his absence they should have
time to impress upon Marie de Medicis that, by the
sacrifice of her favourite, she might reconcile the
disaffected Princes. Concini himself foresaw that
the increase of influence which so important a
command could not fail to secure to him must tend
to diminish that of the Duc d'Epernon, whose overthrow
had been for some time his greatest wish.
Moreover, by quartering his troops in the neighbourhood
of M. de Cond, an opportunity would
present itself of effecting his reconciliation with that
Prince, which he ardently desired; and this end
accomplished, he flattered himself with the hope
that his vision of becoming first minister of France
could not fail to be realized.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, for the ambitious Italian,
it was not long ere D'Epernon and Sillery recognized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span>
the error into which they had been led by
their eagerness to injure him. They suddenly
remembered that Concini had already once joined
the faction of the Princes, and they were aware that
the Duc de Bouillon had made more than one subsequent
effort to induce him to abandon the royal
cause; and they were no sooner convinced of the
fault which they had committed, than they hastened
to represent to the Queen that the appointment of
the Marchal d'Ancre to the command of the King's
armies had caused great dissatisfaction throughout
the capital; the citizens affirming that the troops of
a sovereign of France ought not to be led against
the enemy by a man who was ignorant of the art of
war, and who was, moreover, a foreigner, detested
by the people to an extent which rendered it probable
that, should Concini be invested with the
command, they would open the gates of Paris to M.
de Cond, in the event of his marching upon the
city. Marie de Medicis yielded to these reasons,
and simply replied by reminding Sillery that if she
had committed an error in accepting the proposal of
the Marchal d'Ancre, she had done so at his own
instigation; but that as he considered it desirable to
appoint some other individual to the command, she
would offer no opposition. Concini was accordingly
superseded, and the veteran Marchal de Bois-Dauphin
was selected as his successor, with the title
of lieutenant-general.<a id="footnotetag201" name="footnotetag201"></a><a href="#footnote201">[201]</a> Indignant at the disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg 316]</span>
to which he had been subjected, Concini left
Paris, and proceeded to his government at Amiens,
vowing vengeance against the Duc d'Epernon and
Sillery.</p>

<p>The impatience of the Queen to conclude the
double alliance with Spain was so great that she
disregarded the advice of Jeannin and Villeroy;
who, in conjunction with Concini and his wife, had
endeavoured to induce her to delay her departure
for Guienne, and to proceed either to Laon or St.
Quentin, in order to secure the Isle of France and
Picardy, and to prevent the Prince de Cond and
his adherents from concentrating their forces in the
vicinity of the capital; while, on the contrary, she
was urged by the Chancellor and his brother, the
Commandeur de Sillery, who was her first-equerry
and gentleman-usher, to carry out her original
design. The 17th of August had been already
fixed for the commencement of the royal journey;
and Marie eagerly availed herself of their advice to
persist in her purpose; contenting herself with giving
orders to the Marchal de Bois-Dauphin to cover
Paris, to impede the approach of the disaffected
forces, and, at all risks, to avoid coming to an
engagement. She then withdrew from the Bastille
eight hundred thousand crowns for the purpose
of defraying the expenses of the Court during its
progress.</p>

<p>Despite the absence of the Princes, the royal
retinue was magnificent and numerous. The troops
by whom the august travellers were attended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg 317]</span>
consisted of a thousand horsemen, and the royal bodyguard
amounted to three thousand men, who were
placed under the command of the Duc de Guise,
who was also to accompany Madame Elisabeth to
the frontier of the kingdom, and to receive the
Infanta, whom he was to conduct to the capital of
Guienne, where their Majesties were to await her.
The King left Paris soon after dawn; the Queen
followed some hours subsequently, having previously
caused the arrest of M. Le Jay,<a id="footnotetag202" name="footnotetag202"></a><a href="#footnote202">[202]</a> in order to intimidate
the Parliament; and finally, in the course of the
afternoon, Madame took leave of the municipal
authorities, and departed in her turn. The Marquise
d'Ancre having in vain endeavoured to dissuade
her royal foster-sister from this journey,
became so thoroughly dispirited by the disappointment
of her husband, and the evident decline of her
own influence, that she resolved to excuse herself
from accompanying the Court, and to remain in the
capital; a project from which she was, however,
dissuaded by MM. de Villeroy and Jeannin, who
represented to her the impolicy of incurring the
displeasure of her Majesty, and thus insuring her
own ruin. She was consequently induced to join
the royal suite, but she did so with a heavy heart,
and without one hope of resuming her original empire
over the mind of Marie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span>
The Court reached Orleans on the 20th of August,
and Tours on the 30th, whence their Majesties proceeded
to Poitiers, at which city they arrived on the
9th of September; but the anxieties of Marie de
Medicis were not yet to terminate. Madame was
attacked a day or two subsequently with small-pox,
while the Queen herself was confined to her bed by
a severe illness, which compelled the constant
attendance of Madame d'Ancre in her sick-room,
where, by her affectionate assiduity, she soon succeeded
in recovering the good graces of her royal
mistress. She had secured to her interests a Jewish
physician, in whose astrological talent Marie de
Medicis placed the most implicit confidence; and
eager to revenge her husband upon Sillery, who, as
she was well aware, had been the cause of his losing
the coveted command, she instructed this man,
whom the Queen had hastened to consult, to persuade
the credulous invalid that she had been
bewitched by the Chevalier de Sillery. Strange
as it may appear, Leonora was perfectly successful;
and believing herself to have been the victim of the
Chancellor and his party, Marie entered earnestly
into the views of her favourite, consenting to withdraw
her confidence from Sillery, and to follow
thenceforward the counsels of Villeroy and Jeannin.<a id="footnotetag203" name="footnotetag203"></a><a href="#footnote203">[203]</a></p>

<p>The delay consequent upon the recovery of the
Queen and her daughter enabled the Prince de
Cond to strengthen his party, and to advance
towards Paris, with an army of five thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg 319]</span>
infantry and two thousand horse. His troops were,
however, badly armed, and might at once have been
beaten or dispersed by the Marchal de Bois-Dauphin,
had that general marched against them;
but, fettered by the stringent orders which he had
received not to give battle to the enemy, he remained
inactive; and the Duc de Bouillon profited
by his inertness to seize Chteau Thierry, whence
he marched to Mr-sur-Seine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile M. de Cond ascertained that the
King had issued on the 10th of September a
proclamation of <i>lse-majest</i> against himself and his
adherents; to which he replied by another, wherein
he affirmed that he had taken up arms for the sole
purpose of preventing a foreign invasion. He then
crossed the Seine, with the intention of possessing
himself of the town of Sens; a project in which he,
however, failed, Bois-Dauphin and his adjutant-general,
the Marquis de Praslin, having already
garrisoned the place.<a id="footnotetag204" name="footnotetag204"></a><a href="#footnote204">[204]</a></p>

<p>The two armies were at this period in such close
juxtaposition that an engagement appeared inevitable;
but whether it were that Bois-Dauphin was
deficient in ability, or that he had resolved, whatever
might be the result of his inaction, to obey implicitly
the instructions of the Queen, he vacated Sens after
a few slight skirmishes. Be the real cause of his
supineness what it might, it excited the indignation
of Bassompierre, Praslin, the Marquis de Coeuvres,
and the other leaders of the royal army, who did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg 320]</span>
scruple to accuse him of incapacity; declaring, moreover,
that he had harassed the troops far more than
if he had led them into action.<a id="footnotetag205" name="footnotetag205"></a><a href="#footnote205">[205]</a></p>

<p>On the arrival of the Court at Angoulme the
Queen was agreeably surprised by the appearance
of the Comte de Saint-Pol,<a id="footnotetag206" name="footnotetag206"></a><a href="#footnote206">[206]</a> who, she had been led
to believe, had joined the faction of Cond with his
nephew the Duc de Longueville; and her exultation
was increased when, with assurances of his fidelity
to the Crown, he placed under her orders the two
fortresses of Fronsac and Caumont.<a id="footnotetag207" name="footnotetag207"></a><a href="#footnote207">[207]</a></p>

<p>Profiting by the retreat of the Marchal de Bois-Dauphin,
the Duc de Bouillon had made all haste
to pass the Loire, and to reach the confines of Touraine
and Poitou; nor would it have been possible
for their Majesties to have reached Bordeaux in
safety, had it not been for the secession of the
Comte de Saint-Pol from the faction of the Princes,
together with the impossibility of marching the
rebel troops upon Poitou in so short a space of time.
Thanks to this combination of circumstances, however,
the Court arrived without accident in the
capital of Guienne on the 7th of October; where
the King and his august mother were received with
great magnificence, and enthusiastically welcomed
by all classes of the citizens, whom the Marchal de
Roquelaure, lieutenant-general for the King in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg 321]</span>
Guienne, and Mayor of Bordeaux, had adroitly
gained, by his representations of the honour conferred
upon them by the sovereign in selecting
their city as the scene of his own marriage and that
of his sister, the future Queen of Spain.<a id="footnotetag208" name="footnotetag208"></a><a href="#footnote208">[208]</a></p>

<p>It had been arranged that the royal marriages
should be celebrated on the same day (the 18th of
October), at Bordeaux and Burgos; and accordingly
the Duc de Guise, as proxy for the Prince of Spain,
espoused Madame Elisabeth, with whom, accompanied
by the Duchesse de Nevers and the ladies
of her household, he immediately departed for the
frontier, after a painful leave-taking between the
young Princess and her family; while the Duque
d'Usseda<a id="footnotetag209" name="footnotetag209"></a><a href="#footnote209">[209]</a> performed the same ceremony for Louis
XIII, with the Infanta Anna Maria of Austria.
The exchange of the two Princesses took place on
the 9th of November, in the middle of the Bidassoa,
with a host of petty and futile observances which
excite mirth rather than admiration; but at the same
time with a magnificence surpassing all that had
ever previously been exhibited on such an occasion;
the two Courts of France and Spain vying with
each other in splendour and profusion. De Luynes,
to whom such a mission appeared peculiarly
adapted, presented to the Infanta the letters
of welcome with which he had been entrusted
by Louis XIII and his mother, and which were
received by the Princess with an undisguised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg 322]</span>
delight that the favourite did not fail to report to
his royal master.</p>

<p>The guard with which the Duc de Guise had
conducted Madame Elisabeth to the frontier consisted
of fifteen hundred horse, four thousand
infantry, and four pieces of ordnance; and it was
with the same troops that he escorted the newly
made Queen of France to Bordeaux, who, previously
to her departure from Burgos, had signed a formal
renunciation, written entirely by her own hand, of
all her claims to the Spanish succession.<a id="footnotetag210" name="footnotetag210"></a><a href="#footnote210">[210]</a> On her
arrival at Bordeaux on the 21st of November, the
young Queen was received with all the splendour of
which the circumstances were susceptible, and the
marriage ceremony was immediately repeated by the
Bishop of Saintes; after which, on the 17th of
December, the Court, under the escort of a strong
body of troops, left the capital of Guienne for Tours,
which latter city they did not, however, reach for
five weeks, owing to the long halts that they were
compelled to make in the several towns through
which they passed, where every species of entertainment
had been prepared for the reception of the
august travellers. Meanwhile the army suffered
fearfully from exposure to the cold, from sickness,
and from want of provisions and forage; numbers of
the men died, and the progress of the royal party
consequently resembled a disastrous retreat rather
than a triumphant procession.</p>

<p>In addition to this misfortune the Queen-mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg 323]</span>
had other and still more serious motives for anxiety.
Although her personal ambition had been gratified
by the accomplishment of that close alliance with
Spain which she had so long and so earnestly desired,
she could not conceal from herself that as regarded
the nation over which she had been called to govern,
the irretrievable step thus taken was one of extreme
impolicy. On every side she was surrounded by
difficulties. The first Prince of the Blood, and nearly
the whole of the high nobility, were not only disaffected,
but actually in arms against the Crown.
The Protestants, to whom she had repeatedly
promised that she would observe the Edict of
Nantes, incensed by her breach of faith, had revolted
against her authority; her troops had failed to offer
any effective resistance; and meanwhile foreign
soldiers had traversed Champagne, and advanced
into Berry to join Cond, without any impediment
from the royal army. The intelligence that she
received from Paris was equally alarming; scarcely
a day passed in which pamphlets and pasquinades
of the grossest description were not published and
circulated among the population, assigning the
most foul and degrading motives for her journey
to Guienne under the protection of the Ducs
d'Epernon and de Guise; while her anxiety for the
Spanish alliance was represented as arising from her
desire to conciliate those who were accused of being
the assassins of her husband.</p>

<p>Angered as she was by these insults, Marie de
Medicis still pined to return to the capital. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg 324]</span>
was wearied alike by the exacting and arrogant
temper of M. d'Epernon, and by the monotony of
the provincial cities, where she saw herself surrounded
only by aldermen and citizens with whom
she had no feeling or habit in common; and as the
several individuals of her circle were equally ill at
ease in so novel a position, far from allaying her
impatience, they aggravated the <i>ennui</i> which she
did not attempt to disguise, until she eventually
brought herself to attach all the blame of her own
disappointment and mortification upon those who had
advised her to leave the capital; and to evince the
greatest eagerness to follow the counsels of their
adversaries.<a id="footnotetag211" name="footnotetag211"></a><a href="#footnote211">[211]</a></p>

<p>The Court left Bordeaux at the close of the year
1615; and in the month of January following proceeded
to take up its abode at Tours, there to await
the close of a negotiation into which the Queen-mother
had entered with the Princes; while at the
same time her agents secretly exerted all their efforts
to induce the allies of M. de Cond to abandon his
cause. The command of the troops was taken from
the Marchal de Bois-Dauphin and conferred upon
the Duc de Guise, with the title of lieutenant-general
of the King's army; and an immediate
attempt was made to gain over the Duc de Mayenne
and the Marchal de Bouillon, as being the most
influential of the revolted nobles. James I offered
to Marie de Medicis his services as a mediator on
the occasion; they were gratefully accepted, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg 325]</span>
the English Ambassador was forthwith despatched
to the Prince de Cond at St. Jean-d'Angly, with
instructions to avert, by every argument in his
power, the horrors of a civil war. Convinced that
no better opportunity could possibly occur for
securing to himself and his party the advantageous
conditions which he coveted, Cond received the
royal envoy with great courtesy, declaring that he
had acted throughout the whole affair solely in the
interests of his country, and that he was ready to
write respectfully to his Britannic Majesty, to offer
to him the same assurance.</p>

<p>His proposal was accepted; the letter was forthwith
prepared; and the Baron de Thianges was
entrusted with its delivery into the hands of the
English monarch. A reply was returned by the
same messenger; and finally a conference was
decided on, which was to take place at Loudun on
the 10th of February.<a id="footnotetag212" name="footnotetag212"></a><a href="#footnote212">[212]</a></p>

<p>While preparations were making for this important
event, the Queen-mother, on the 29th of
January, summoned the nobles of her Court to her
apartment, in order to discuss the necessary
measures to be adopted for securing the allegiance
of the disaffected Princes; and on this occasion
she nearly lost her life by a singular accident. The
young Comte de Soissons, the Ducs de Guise and
d'Epernon, Bassompierre, Jeannin, and many others
who held office about the Court or in the Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg 326]</span>
were scarcely assembled when the flooring of
the room gave way, and twenty-eight persons were
precipitated into the hall beneath. The arm-chair
of Marie herself had fortunately been placed above
a beam which held firm, and to which the President
Jeannin resolutely clung, thus breaking his fall; but
MM. de Soissons, d'Epernon, de Bassompierre, de
Villeroy, and several others were less fortunate, and
all were more or less gravely injured. With great
presence of mind the Queen retained her seat; and
with the help of the Duc de Guise ultimately contrived
to reach her bed, over which she passed, and
thus escaped into an adjoining apartment; and
meanwhile the unfortunate victims of the accident
were conveyed to their respective residences, where
her Majesty caused them to be immediately visited
by one of the officers of her household, who was
commissioned to inquire into their condition, and to
express her regret at the event.</p>

<p>There was one exception, however, to this royal
act of sympathy and consideration, and that one was
the Duc d'Epernon; who, although the greatest
sufferer on the occasion, was entirely overlooked; a
marked and threatening want of courtesy on the
part of the Queen-mother, which convinced the
arrogant courtier that his period of favour was past,
and that his enemies had triumphed. This conviction
at once determined him to retire voluntarily
from the Court before he should be compelled to do
so by an order which he felt satisfied would not be
long delayed; and he was accordingly no sooner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg 327]</span>
sufficiently recovered to leave his bed than he waited
upon their Majesties to take leave, alleging that his
shattered health having received so violent a
shock, he felt it necessary to withdraw for a time
from all participation in public affairs, and to endeavour
by perfect repose to overcome the effects of
his accident.</p>

<p>His reasons were graciously accepted both by
the King and Queen, who assured him of their
deep sorrow at his sufferings, and expressed the
most flattering wishes for his recovery; but the
Queen-mother uttered no word either of regret or
sympathy. With the most chilling indifference she
returned his parting salutation; and M. d'Epernon
quitted her apartment with a demeanour almost as
haughty as her own.<a id="footnotetag213" name="footnotetag213"></a><a href="#footnote213">[213]</a></p>

<p>Marie de Medicis, who possessed the most implicit
confidence in the so-called science of astrology,
and who was always anxious to penetrate the
mystery of the future, having been informed on her
return to Paris that a certain Giorgio Luminelli, a
native of Ragusa who was celebrated as a soothsayer,
had recently arrived in the capital, and taken
up his abode in the Place Royale, immediately
expressed a wish to consult him; for which purpose
she despatched a messenger to his residence, by
whom he was invited to wait upon a person of high
rank who, attracted by his renown, was desirous
of testing his skill. To this somewhat imperious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg 328]</span>
summons Luminelli, however, simply replied by
declaring that he never quitted his own apartments
for any one, whatever might be the station of the
person who required his services; but that those,
who sought his aid were at liberty to visit him
whenever they saw fit to do so. This answer
only increased the eagerness of the Queen-mother;
nevertheless, previously to seeking him in person,
she requested M. de Crquy, the Duc de la Force,
Bassompierre, and Rambure to go to his house
in disguise, in order to ascertain whether he were
indeed worthy of the reputation by which he had
been preceded.</p>

<p>While they were making the necessary arrangements,
and deciding to exchange dresses with their
confidential valets in the hope of being enabled to
mystify the necromancer, to whom they were
entirely unknown, the Marchal d'Ancre arrived to
pay his respects to his royal mistress; and, upon
being made acquainted with the project, he
determined to join the party in the character of a
Venetian noble, of whom there were at that moment
several residing in Paris. On the completion of
their preparations the merry masquers set forth,
and soon reached the abode of Luminelli; where,
on their arrival, they found a servant stationed at
the door, as if awaiting the advent of expected
guests, who no sooner saw them pause beside him
than, addressing Concini and the disguised serving-men,
he politely requested them to follow him;
coupling the invitation with an assurance that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg 329]</span>
master had desired him to watch for the arrival of
five great nobles who were about to consult his art.
Lavalle, the lackey of M. de Bassompierre,
assuming an air of importance, expressed both for
himself and his companions their sense of this
attention; and then, somewhat startled by the coincidence,
for as such they simply considered it, the
whole party followed their guide upstairs.</p>

<p>On reaching the apartment of the astrologer the
four disguised courtiers remained respectfully upon
the threshold, while their unliveried representatives
advanced to the middle of the room; and
courteously saluting their host, informed him that
they had been induced by his great renown to solicit
a display of his skill, and to claim from him a
knowledge of their future fortunes. Lavalle was
once more their spokesman; and the eyes of
Luminelli remained fixed upon him until the conclusion
of his address, when he turned away
abruptly, without vouchsafing any reply, and drew
back a curtain behind which was placed a large
globe of polished steel. He looked earnestly upon
this for a few moments; and then rising, he put on
a cap of dark velvet which lay beside him, took
Lavalle by the hand, and approaching Bassompierre
placed his valet a few paces behind him,
saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, why should you thus have
assumed a disguise? You are already a great
noble, but your fortunes have not yet reached their
acme. You will one day be Marchal de France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg 330]</span>
and the dignity will be conferred upon you on the
other side of the Rhne. Beauty has great influence
over you; but with those whom you seek to
please your purse has even more charms than your
person. You will ere long have immense success
at the gaming-table, far beyond any which you have
yet achieved. You have been engaged in a lawsuit
against an unmarried woman.<a id="footnotetag214" name="footnotetag214"></a><a href="#footnote214">[214]</a> You hold one of
the highest offices in the kingdom.<a id="footnotetag215" name="footnotetag215"></a><a href="#footnote215">[215]</a> You are not
by birth a Frenchman, but a German. One of the
greatest ladies in the world will cause you considerable
misfortune,<a id="footnotetag216" name="footnotetag216"></a><a href="#footnote216">[216]</a> through the medium of a red
animal.<a id="footnotetag217" name="footnotetag217"></a><a href="#footnote217">[217]</a> You will, however, finally triumph over
your troubles, although the trial will be a long and
a severe one."</p>

<p>Luminelli then consulted his magic globe a
second time; led the lackey of M. de Crquy to
the rear of his master; made a profound salutation
to the latter; and addressing him in his turn,
detailed, as he had previously done in the case of
Bassompierre, all the leading events of his past and
future life. He next went through the same
ceremony with the Duc de la Force and M. de
Rambure; and ultimately he turned towards the
Marchal d'Ancre, exclaiming:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg 331]</span>
"You, Sir, are no Venetian, although you have
sought to appear such; but it would be well for
you if you were so. As it is, if you will follow my
advice, you will leave Paris to-morrow for Venice;
for should you long delay your departure, it will be
too late to effect it. When you arrived in France
you were alike poor and obscure, although you are
now rich both in gold and honours. Leave the
country, nevertheless, or these advantages will avail
you nothing. With few exceptions, you are detested
by all classes; and you will find your native air of
Florence more wholesome than that of the country
which you have adopted. You possess governments,
and wield the <i>bton</i> of a Marchal de France,
but your tenure of these dignities is unstable; and
you will do well to save yourself while you have yet
the opportunity. You place your reliance on the
favour of a crowned head, but that very favour
shadows forth your ruin."</p>

<p>As Concini stood motionless before him, the
astrologer took him by the hand, and leading him
towards the globe, by a slight touch caused it to
revolve. As he gazed upon the polished surface of
the mysterious instrument, the colour of the Italian
came and went so rapidly that his companions
believed him to be attacked by sudden indisposition;
and depositing a heavy purse of gold upon the
table, they urged him to withdraw. Before they
could effect their object, however, Luminelli thrust
the purse from him, having previously withdrawn
from it a single pistole which he flung to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg 332]</span>
attendant. He then cast himself back upon his
chair; the heavy curtain again fell before the globe;
and he appeared totally unconscious of the continued
presence of his visitors, whose departure was retarded
for a few seconds by the utter incapacity of
Concini to leave the room. With a powerful effort
the Italian, however, suddenly suppressed his emotion,
although he still trembled so violently that he was
compelled to lean upon Bassompierre for support;
nor did the attack, as had been anticipated, yield to
the influence of the external air, for the Marchal
continued throughout the entire space of two hours
wholly unable to control its violence; while not all
the eager questioning of his companions could
induce him to reveal the cause of his frightful agitation;
a fact by which they were firmly persuaded
that the astrologer had revealed to him an intimate
acquaintance with past events which justified his
warning, or had foreshadowed a future well calculated
to arouse alarm.<a id="footnotetag218" name="footnotetag218"></a><a href="#footnote218">[218]</a> Be this as it might, it
appears at least certain that the five nobles were
each and all deeply impressed by the scene through
which they had just passed, by whatever agency it
might have been effected; and that the report which
they made on their return to Marie de Medicis
effectually indisposed her from seeking any further
knowledge of Giorgio Luminelli.</p>

<p>The famous Conference of Loudun assembled on
the 13th of February 1616; but as the Prince de
Cond presented no less than thirty-one articles for
consideration, many of which required careful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg 334]</span>
examination, it was mutually agreed that the truce
should be prolonged until the decision of his Majesty
might be formed. The position of the Court was,
moreover, rendered more difficult from the fact that
several great nobles, who had not hitherto openly
espoused the faction of the rebels, hastened to swell
their ranks, not with the intention of caballing
against the Government, but simply of being included
in the concessions to which it was evident that the
Council would be compelled in order to accomplish a
peace. Among others the Duc de Vendme, who
had so recently solicited his pardon, and declared
his intention of adhering to the royal cause, was
conspicuous in the ranks of the enemy; together
with the young Duc de Candale, the son of
D'Epernon, who had embraced the reformed faith,
the Duc de Piney-Luxembourg, and the Dowager
Countess of Soissons, who withdrew from the Court
at Tours, and joined her son at Loudun. This
example, contemptible as it was, proved contagious,
and was followed by two of the greatest Princesses
of the Blood, the Dowager Princesses of Cond
and Longueville,<a id="footnotetag219" name="footnotetag219"></a><a href="#footnote219">[219]</a> to the extreme annoyance of the
Queen-mother, who was aware of the extent of
their influence, and quite alive to its probable
consequences.</p>

<p>Meanwhile both armies were suffering so severely
from extreme cold and scarcity of provisions, that
more than ten thousand men fell victims to exposure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg 335]</span>
and famine; and the bodyguard of the King
became at length so much weakened that he found
himself compelled to summon the Swiss under
Bassompierre for the protection of his person.</p>

<p>The demands with which Cond and his partisans
opened the Conference were such as required little
deliberation; but as the proceedings advanced they
became more and more onerous; until, finally, as
the Council had foreseen, they all resolved themselves
into questions of individual interest. The
Duc de Longueville claimed full authority over all the
fortresses in his government of Picardy which were
held by the Marchal d'Ancre, and refused to accede
to any terms with the Crown until they were given
up; while the other Princes and nobles asked either
gratuities for themselves, or vengeance upon their
enemies; and all agreed in claiming the payment of
their troops by the royal treasury before they would
consent to lay down their arms.<a id="footnotetag220" name="footnotetag220"></a><a href="#footnote220">[220]</a></p>

<p>Finally, on the 5th of May, the Conference was
closed; several of the articles presented by M. de
Cond having been conceded, others deferred, and
the remainder conditionally agreed to. In the meantime,
however, the Prince had been taken seriously
ill, and the fear that he might not survive so
threatening an attack determined the leaders of
his faction to accept whatever terms the Court
should decide to offer. While the disease was at
its height, the Princes and royal commissioners
assembled about his bed, where the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg 336]</span>
Ambassador also presented himself; but, although he
had taken so active a part in the reconciliation
about to be effected between the Crown and the
rebel nobles, M. de Villeroy vehemently refused to
permit him to remain, declaring that upon such an
occasion it was impossible to allow a foreigner to
interfere between a sovereign and his subjects.
This dispute was followed by a second, the deputies
of La Rochelle having demanded a continuance of
their assembly; a demand which was opposed with
such warmth and violence that M. de Cond, unable
to support the disturbance, weakened as he was
by the fever which preyed upon him, commanded
instant silence; and desiring that a pen might be
brought to him, together with the edict of pacification
which had been drawn up, he forthwith affixed
his signature to the document, declaring that those
who loved him would do the same, while such as
refused to follow his example should be compelled
to do so. He then pronounced a short prayer, in
which he thanked God for the cessation of hostilities,
after which he desired to be left alone; and on the
morrow preparations were commenced for disbanding
the rebel troops.<a id="footnotetag221" name="footnotetag221"></a><a href="#footnote221">[221]</a></p>

<p>This apparent precipitation did not, however,
involve any sacrifice either on the part of the Prince
himself or on that of his principal adherents, since
Richelieu has recorded that the peace for which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg 337]</span>
M. de Cond so piously uttered his thanksgiving
cost Louis XIII upwards of six millions of livres;<a id="footnotetag222" name="footnotetag222"></a><a href="#footnote222">[222]</a>
every individual of mark having cause to feel satisfied
with the result of the Conference save the
Protestants, who, as a body, derived no benefit
whatever from the treaty.<a id="footnotetag223" name="footnotetag223"></a><a href="#footnote223">[223]</a></p>

<p>Concini, who had remained in Paris during the
absence of the Court, had meanwhile been subjected
to a mortification which, to his haughty spirit, far
exceeded a more important evil. The citizens who
had continued to keep watch and ward, despite the
cessation of hostilities that had taken place, persevered
in requiring that all who entered or quitted
the capital should be provided with passports; a
formality with which the arrogant Italian considered
it unnecessary to comply; and, accordingly,
when on one occasion he was about to proceed to
his house in the faubourg attended by some of the
gentlemen of his suite, he had no sooner reached
the Porte de Bussy, where a shoemaker named
Picard was on guard, than this man compelled his
carriage to stop, and demanded his passport. Enraged
by such a mark of disrespect, the Marchal
imperiously ordered his coachman to proceed, but
this was rendered impossible by the threatening
attitude of the well-armed guardian of the gate.</p>

<p>"Rascal!" shouted Concini, showing himself at
the door of the carriage; "do you know who I
am?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg 338]</span>

<p>"Right well, Sir," was the unmoved reply; "and
nevertheless you shall not stir a step beyond the
walls without a passport."</p>

<p>The Italian was pale with indignation, but he
dared not resent the insult, as a crowd was rapidly
collecting from whom he was aware that he could
expect no mercy; and he accordingly restrained
himself sufficiently to despatch a messenger for an
order of egress, which promptly arrived. His
southern blood, however, beat and burnt in his
veins, and he awaited only an opportunity of revenge.
A few days subsequently, unable any
longer to control his rage, he desired his equerry
to proceed to the residence of Picard with two
valets, and to repay his insolence by a sound
cudgelling; an order which was so implicitly obeyed
that the unfortunate shoemaker narrowly escaped
with his life; while a mob, attracted by the uproar,
seized the two serving-men&mdash;who, confiding in the
power of their master, treated their menaces with
contempt&mdash;and hanged them before the door of the
house in which they had committed the outrage.
The equerry, who had also fallen into the hands of
the populace, was put upon his trial, and it was only
by means of a heavy bribe that the discomfited
Marchal, alarmed by what had taken place, was
enabled to induce Picard to withdraw his accusation
against him.<a id="footnotetag224" name="footnotetag224"></a><a href="#footnote224">[224]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the Conference of Loudun the
Court returned to Paris, where the reception of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg 339]</span>
Majesties was enthusiastic, while that of Marie de
Medicis was cold and constrained, although it was
well known that M. de Cond had all but obtained
the presidency of the Council, and that the Queen-mother
had made other concessions which she had
previously repelled with considerable haughtiness at
Tours; such as granting to the Duc de Longueville
the exclusive authority in Picardy, which deprived
the Marchal d'Ancre of his cherished fortresses;
while on the other hand, despite the advantages
which they had reaped from the weakness of the
Government, the discontented nobles had separated
in no better spirit. The Ducs de Rohan and de
Sully loudly complained that they had been deceived
by the Prince; M. de Longueville, who had vainly
sought to obtain the government of Normandy, and
who was afraid to return to Picardy until convinced
that he had nothing to fear from the resentment
of the Marchal d'Ancre, considered himself aggrieved;
and such, in short, was the general jealousy
and distrust exhibited by the lately coalesced nobles
that, with the exception of the Duc de Mayenne
and the Marchal de Bouillon, who found themselves
involved in one common interest&mdash;that of destroying
the influence of the Ducs d'Epernon and de
Bellegarde&mdash;the whole of the late cabal appeared
by mutual consent to have become inimical to each
other.<a id="footnotetag225" name="footnotetag225"></a><a href="#footnote225">[225]</a></p>

<p>On the arrival of the Court in Paris the seals
were taken from the Chancellor, and delivered into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg 340]</span>
the keeping of Guillaume du Vair, who was at that
period in his sixtieth year, on the pretext that so
important a charge must be oppressive to M. de
Sillery at his advanced age; a subterfuge which
could not have failed to excite the discontent of the
people had they not distrusted his cupidity as much
as Marie was wearied of his services. Certain it is,
however, that his dismissal occasioned no regret,
and was speedily forgotten.<a id="footnotetag226" name="footnotetag226"></a><a href="#footnote226">[226]</a> Villeroy and Jeannin
were the immediate agents of his dismissal from
office, as they ascribed to him their own previous
discredit at Court, and had long been secretly labouring
to repay him in kind; but their triumph was
destined to be short-lived. Concini had effected
the disgrace of his old and hated rival the Duc
d'Epernon; and that feat accomplished, he next
resolved to rid himself of the two veteran ministers
who were the most formidable stumbling-blocks
upon his path of ambition. Aware of the distrustful
nature of the Queen-mother, whose experience had
made her suspicious of all by whom she was surrounded,
he at once decided upon his plan of action;
and it was not long ere he induced her to believe
that they had acted in the interests of the Prince de
Cond, rather than her own, during the Conference
of Loudun; while such plausible proofs did he
adduce of this assertion, that once more Marie de
Medicis consented to exclude them from the Council.</p>

<p>This was the moment for which the Italian
favourite had so long sighed. From the death of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg 341]</span>
Henri IV he had exerted all his energies to overthrow
the Princes of the Blood, and to replace the
old ministers by creatures of his own; but so hopeless
did the attempt appear that more than once he
had despaired of ultimate success. Now, however,
he found himself pre-eminent; the Queen-mother,
harassed and worn-out by the cabals which were
incessantly warring against her authority, and
threatening her tenure of power, threw herself
with eagerness into the hands of the adventurer
who owed all to her favour, and implicitly followed
his advice, in the hope that she might thus escape
the machinations of her enemies. Mangot,<a id="footnotetag227" name="footnotetag227"></a><a href="#footnote227">[227]</a> whose
devotion to the Marchal d'Ancre was notorious,
was appointed Secretary of State, in which dignity
he replaced M. de Puisieux;<a id="footnotetag228" name="footnotetag228"></a><a href="#footnote228">[228]</a> while the administration
of finance was conferred upon M. Barbin,<a id="footnotetag229" name="footnotetag229"></a><a href="#footnote229">[229]</a>
although Jeannin nominally retained office.<a id="footnotetag230" name="footnotetag230"></a><a href="#footnote230">[230]</a></p>

<p>While these changes were convulsing the Cabinet,
irritating the great nobles, and exciting the apprehensions
of all those who desired the welfare of the
nation, the young sovereigns, whom they more
immediately concerned, were either ignorant or careless
of their consequences. The girl-Queen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg 342]</span>
surrounded by her Spanish attendants, spent her time
in the enjoyment of the pleasures congenial to her
age. According to Madame de Motteville,<a id="footnotetag231" name="footnotetag231"></a><a href="#footnote231">[231]</a> she
was strikingly handsome, but rather Austrian than
Spanish in her style of beauty, with an abundance
of fair hair which she wore in ringlets about her
face. On her arrival in France she retained the
national costume; and discarding the tapestried
chests common at the period, made use of a pile
of cushions as her seat. The Marquise de Morny
(quoted by Madame de Motteville) described her on
the occasion of her own presentation as reclining
upon this Moorish sofa in the midst of her attendants,
habited in a dress of green satin embroidered
with gold and silver, with large hanging sleeves
looped together at intervals by diamond buttons; a
close ruff, and a small cap of green velvet with a
black heron-feather.<a id="footnotetag232" name="footnotetag232"></a><a href="#footnote232">[232]</a>

<b>ANNE OF AUSTRIA.</b>
</P><br>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg 344]</span>
<p>At once regal and elegant as such a costume
must have been, it is deplorable to contrast it with
those which she adopted in after-years, when the
most monstrous caprices were permitted at her
Court; and when it was by no means uncommon to
see women of the highest rank, about to ride on
horseback, present themselves in the royal circle in
dresses reaching only to the knee, with their legs
encased in tight pantaloons of velvet, or even in
complete <i>haut-de-chausses;</i> while the habitual attire
of the sex was equally <i>bizarre</i> and exaggerated.
There were the <i>vasquines</i> or rollers which encircled
the waist and extended the folds of the petticoats,
thus giving additional smallness to the waist; the
<i>brassards--chevrons</i> or metallic braces for expanding
the sleeves; and the <i>affiquet</i> of pearls or
diamonds coquettishly attached to the left breast,
and entitled the <i>assassin</i>. Added to these absurdities
there were, moreover, bows of ribbon, each of which
had its appropriate name and position; the <i>galant</i>
was placed on the summit of the head; the <i>mignon</i>
on the heart; the <i>favori</i> under and near the <i>assassin</i>;
and the <i>badin</i> on the handle of the fan. Short
curls upon the temples were designated <i>cavaliers</i>;
ringlets were <i>garons</i>; while a hundred other inanities
of the same description compelled the great
ladies of the period to adopt a slang which was
perfectly unintelligible to all save the initiated; and
when we add to these details the well-authenticated
fact that the royal apartments were fumigated with
powdered tobacco (then a recent and costly importation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg 345]</span>
into France), in lieu of the perfumes which had
previously been in use for the same purpose, it will
scarcely be denied that caprice rather than taste
dictated the habits of the Court under Louis XIII.</p>

<p>To revert, however, to the earlier years of Anne
of Austria, it would appear that the troubles of the
royal bride did not await her womanhood. Like
Marie de Medicis, she clung to all which appeared
to link her to her distant home, and caused her to
forget for a time that it was hers no longer; and
under this impulse it was by no means surprising
that she attached herself with girlish affection to the
individuals by whom she had been followed in her
splendid exile; but even as her predecessor had been
compelled to forego the society of her native attendants,
so was Anne of Austria in her turn deprived
of the solace of their presence. With the exception
of Doa Estefania, her first waiting-woman, to whom
she was tenderly attached, and who had been about
her person from her infancy, all were dismissed by
Marie de Medicis, who, anxious to retain her
authority over the wife of her son, dreaded the
influence of Anne's Spanish followers.</p>

<p>Nor was this her only disappointment. We
have already shown with what eagerness she looked
forward to her first meeting with her intended
bridegroom, whose grave but manly beauty so fully
realized all her hopes that, as she ingeniously confessed,
she could have loved him tenderly had he
possessed a heart to bestow upon her in return.
But she soon discovered that such was not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg 346]</span>
case; and that Louis XIII saw in her nothing
more interesting than a Princess who was worthy
by her rank and quality to share with him the
throne of France.</p>

<p>This was a sad discovery for a lovely girl of
fifteen years of age, who had anticipated nothing
less than devotion on the part of a young husband
by whom she had been so eagerly met on her
arrival; nor did she fail to contrast his coldness
with the ill-disguised admiration of many of his
great nobles, and to weep over the wreck of her
fondest and fairest visions. But, young and high-spirited,
she struggled against the isolation of soul
to which she was condemned; and probably resented
with more bitterness the coercion to which she was
subjected by the iron rule of her royal mother-in-law
than even the coldness of the husband to whom
she had been prepared to give up her whole heart.<a id="footnotetag233" name="footnotetag233"></a><a href="#footnote233">[233]</a></p>

<p>Louis, on his side, although the sovereign of a
great nation, was also exposed to privations; merely
physical, it is true, but still sufficiently irritating to
increase his natural moroseness and discontent.
While the Marchal d'Ancre displayed at Court a
profusion and splendour which amounted to insolence,
the young King was frequently without the means
of indulging the mere caprices common to his age;
but although he murmured, and even at times appeared
to resent the neglect with which he was
treated, he easily consoled himself amid the puerile
sports in which he frittered away his existence; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg 347]</span>
attended by De Luynes and his brothers, found
constant occupation in waging war against small
birds, and in training their captors. In such pursuits
he was moreover encouraged by the Queen-mother
and her favourites; who, anxious to retain
their power, did not make any effort to awaken him
to a sense of what he owed to himself and to the
kingdom over which he had been called upon to
rule. The only occasions upon which he appeared
to feel the slightest pleasure in the society of his
beautiful young wife was when he engaged her to
share in his rides and hawking-parties, in order to
excite her admiration of his skill, an admiration of
which Anne was lavish, as she trusted by flattering
his vanity to awaken his affection; while she moreover
enjoyed, with all the zest of girlhood, so
agreeable an escape from the etiquette and formalities
of a Court life.</p>

<p>The treaty of Loudun was no sooner concluded
than the revolted nobles separated, each dissatisfied
with the other, and all murmuring at the insufficiency
of the recompense by which their several concessions
had been met. The Prince de Cond, on his convalescence,
withdrew to Berry, which government
had been given to him in exchange for that of
Guienne; Sully retired to Poitou, and the Duc de
Rohan returned to La Rochelle; while of all the
lately disaffected leaders the Marchal de Bouillon
and the Duc de Mayenne alone proceeded to Court,
in order to claim the immunities promised in requital
of their secession from the interests of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg 348]</span>
Prince de Cond. The King and the two Queens
were residing at the Louvre on their arrival, where
they had every reason to be satisfied with their
reception; and the Marchal d'Ancre, who, terrified
by the undisguised hostility of the Parisians, had
not ventured to accompany his royal mistress, no
sooner ascertained the return of the two nobles to
the capital than he hastened to make them the most
brilliant offers in the event of their consenting to
espouse his interests. Neither the Marchal nor
the Duke were, however, disposed to second his
views, and only profited by his advances to swell
the ranks of his enemies. This was a task of
comparatively slight difficulty, as all classes in the
kingdom considered themselves aggrieved by his
unparalleled prosperity; and thus, ere long, the
Duc de Guise was prevailed upon to join the new
cabal, into which it was only further deemed
necessary to enlist M. de Cond. Bouillon, who
possessed great influence over the Prince, exerted
himself strenuously to prevent his return to Court,
in order to increase his own consequence in the
estimation of the Queen-mother; but his efforts
proved ineffectual, as M. de Cond believed it to
be more compatible with his own interests to effect
a reconciliation with the Crown; and, acting upon
this impression, he pledged himself to support
Concini, on condition that he should be appointed
chief of the Council of Finance, and take a share in
the government. His proposal was accepted, and
to the great annoyance of M. de Bouillon, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg 349]</span>
Prince once more appeared at Court. His reception
by the citizens was, however, so enthusiastic that
Marie de Medicis became alarmed, until she was
assured by Richelieu, then the open and zealous ally
of the Marchal d'Ancre, that the King had nothing
to fear from a popularity which would only tend to
render M. de Cond a more efficient ally; an assurance
which afforded so much gratification to the
Queen-mother, that she repaid it by appointing the
Bishop of Luon Almoner to the young Queen, and
shortly afterwards Councillor of State.<a id="footnotetag234" name="footnotetag234"></a><a href="#footnote234">[234]</a></p>

<p>Ten days subsequently to the return of M. de
Cond to Paris a new embassy arrived from James
I., to renew the negotiation of marriage between
the Prince of Wales and Madame Christine de
France, upon which occasion the Court of Louis
XIII displayed all its magnificence, without, however,
eclipsing that of the English nobles to whom
the embassy had been entrusted. The htel of the
late Queen Marguerite was prepared for their reception,
where they were visited by all the great
nobles and foreign ministers; and finally, on the
following Sunday, they were received in state at the
Louvre. Lord Hay (afterwards Earl of Carlisle)
was the accredited ambassador; while Mr. Rich
(subsequently Lord Holland), Goring, and other
individuals of mark contributed to increase the
splendour and importance of his mission.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more sumptuous than the
spectacle which was presented by the Louvre upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg 350]</span>
this occasion. The halls and galleries were alike
thronged by all that was noble and beautiful at the
Court of France. Princes of the Blood, nobles,
marshals, and prelates were mingled with the great
ladies of the household in their state dresses, rustling
in silks, velvets, and cloth of gold and silver, and
glittering with diamonds. Amid this galaxy of
magnificence the Queen-mother shone conspicuous.
Still remarkable for her stately beauty and dignified
deportment, she had left no means untried to enhance
their effect, and she had been eminently
successful. She was attired in a long robe of
amaranth velvet, of which the wide and open
sleeves were slashed with white satin, and looped
together by large pearls, save at the wrists and
elbows, where they were fastened by immense
brilliants. Her ruff of rich Alenon lace rose half
a foot in height at the back of her neck, whence
it decreased in breadth until it reached her bosom,
which was considerably exposed, according to the
fashion of the period. A coronet of diamonds surmounted
her elaborately curled hair, which was
drawn back, so as to exhibit in its full dimensions
her broad and lofty brow; and the most costly
jewels were scattered over her whole attire, which
gave back their many-coloured lights at every
movement of her person.</p>

<p>The Prince de Joinville, the Ducs de Guise and
d'Elboeuf, the Marquises de Rosny and de Crquy,
and M. de Bassompierre, accompanied by a numerous
train of nobles, escorted the English envoys to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg 351]</span>
the palace; while more than fifty thousand persons
crowded the streets through which the glittering
train was compelled to pass.</p>

<p>During the following week Paris was the scene
of perpetual gaiety and splendour. All the Princes
and great nobles vied with each other in the
magnificence of the balls, banquets, and other
entertainments which were given in honour of
their distinguished guests.<a id="footnotetag235" name="footnotetag235"></a><a href="#footnote235">[235]</a> Presents of considerable
value were exchanged; and the British
Ambassador had every reason to anticipate the
favourable termination of his mission; but subsequent
circumstances compelled him to abstain
from seeking a definite reply.<a id="footnotetag236" name="footnotetag236"></a><a href="#footnote236">[236]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of M. de Cond in Paris, and the
pledge given by that Prince to support him with
his influence, determined Concini once more to
hazard his own return to the capital under the
escort of Bassompierre; but he found the popular
irritation still so great against him, that when he
visited the Prince he was accompanied by a suite
of a hundred horse. His reception by his new
ally was, moreover, less cordial than he had hoped;
for Cond had already begun to regret his promise,
and to feel apprehensive that by upholding the
interests of the Italian favourite he should lose his
own popularity. He also believed that the amount
of power which he had at length succeeded in
securing must render him independent of such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg 352]</span>
coalition; and he resolved to seize the earliest
opportunity of impressing upon Concini the unpalatable
fact.</p>

<p>This opportunity soon presented itself. On the
14th of August the Prince gave a banquet to the
English envoy, which was attended by all the
principal nobility of the Court, but from which
the Marchal d'Ancre had been excluded. While
the guests were still at table, however, Concini, on
the pretext of paying his respects to Lord Hay,
entered the banqueting-hall, attended by thirty of
those gentlemen of his household whom he arrogantly
called his <i>conios di mille franchi</i>.<a id="footnotetag237" name="footnotetag237"></a><a href="#footnote237">[237]</a></p>

<p>He had no sooner seated himself than Mayenne,
Bouillon, and others of the cabal which had been
formed against him proposed that so favourable an
opportunity should not be lost of taking his life, and
thus ridding the country of the incubus by which it
had so long been oppressed in the person of an
insolent foreigner; but the project was no sooner
communicated to M. de Cond than he imperatively
forbade all violence beneath his own roof. Meanwhile
Concini, although he did not fail to perceive
by what was taking place about him that he had
placed himself in jeopardy by thus braving his
enemies, nevertheless maintained the most perfect
self-possession, and was suffered to depart in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg 353]</span>
safety. On the following morning, however, he
received a communication from the Prince, who,
after assuring him that he had experienced great
difficulty in restraining the Princes and nobles into
whose presence he had forced himself on the preceding
day from executing summary justice upon him
in order to avenge their several wrongs; and that
they had, moreover, threatened to abandon his own
cause should he persist in according his protection
to an individual whom they were resolved to pursue
even to the death, concluded by declaring that it
would thenceforward be impossible for him to maintain
the pledge which he had given, and advising
him to lose no time in retiring to Normandy, of
which province he was lieutenant-general.<a id="footnotetag238" name="footnotetag238"></a><a href="#footnote238">[238]</a></p>

<p>Although exasperated by the bad faith of M. de
Cond, Concini was nevertheless compelled to
follow this interested suggestion; but, before he left
the field open to his enemies, he resolved to strike
a parting blow; and he had accordingly no sooner
dismissed the messenger of the Prince than he proceeded
to the Louvre, where, while taking leave of
the Queen-mother, he eagerly impressed upon her
that she was alike deceived by Cond and trifled
with by Bouillon, and that all the members of their
faction were agreed to divest her of her authority;
an attempt of which the result could only be averted
by the seizure of their persons.<a id="footnotetag239" name="footnotetag239"></a><a href="#footnote239">[239]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg 354]</span>

<p>It is probable, however, that, even despite the
avowed abandonment of the Prince de Cond, Concini
might have hesitated to quit his post had not
the affair of Picard convinced him that his prosperity
had reached its climax. Even the Queen-mother,
indignant as she expressed herself at the insult to
which he had been subjected, betrayed no inclination
to resent it; and so entire was his conviction that
his overthrow was at hand, that there can be no
doubt but that thenceforward he began seriously to
meditate a return to his own country.<a id="footnotetag240" name="footnotetag240"></a><a href="#footnote240">[240]</a></p>

<p>Nearly at the moment in which the Marchal
d'Ancre was thus unexpectedly compelled to leave
Paris, his untiring enemy the Duc de Longueville
made himself master of the three towns of Pronne,
Roye, and Montdidier in Picardy, which, by the
Treaty of Loudun, had been secured to Concini.
Publicly the Princes blamed this violation of the
treaty, and exhorted the Duke to relinquish his
conquests; but being in reality delighted that places
of this importance, and, moreover, so immediately in
the neighbourhood of the capital, should be in the
possession of one of their own allies, they privately
sent him both men and money to enable him to
retain them.<a id="footnotetag241" name="footnotetag241"></a><a href="#footnote241">[241]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Marie de Medicis made no effort to
compel the restitution of the captured towns; the
insult to which Concini had been subjected by Picard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg 355]</span>
remained unavenged, and the Italian could no longer
conceal from himself that he had outlived his fortunes.
It is scarcely doubtful, moreover, that, with
the superstition common to the period, the prediction
of Luminelli had pressed heavily upon his mind;
as from that period he became anxious to abandon
the French Court, and to retire with his enormous
wealth to his native city. It was in vain, however,
that he sought to inspire Leonora with the same
desire; in vain that he represented the prudence of
taking the initiative while there was yet time; the
foster-sister of Marie de Medicis peremptorily refused
to leave Paris, alleging that it would be cowardly to
abandon her royal mistress at a period when she was
threatened alike by the ambition of the Prince de
Cond and the enmity of De Luynes, whose power
over the mind of the young sovereign was rapidly
making itself felt.</p>

<p>At this precise moment a new and grave misfortune
tended to augment the eagerness of the Marchal
d'Ancre to carry out his project. His daughter,
through whose medium he had looked to form an
alliance with some powerful family, and thus to
fortify his own position, was taken dangerously ill,
and in a few days breathed her last. His anguish
was ungovernable; and while his wife wept in
silence beside the body of her dead child, he, on the
contrary, abandoned himself to the most vehement
exclamations, strangely mingling his expressions of
fear for his future fate with regret for the loss which
he had thus sustained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg 356]</span>
"Signore," he replied vehemently to Bassompierre,
who vainly attempted to console him,
"I am lost; Signore, I am ruined; Signore,
I am miserable. I regret my daughter, and
shall do so while I live; but I could support
this affliction did I not see before me the
utter ruin of myself, my wife, my son, and my
whole house, in the obstinacy of Leonora. Were
you not aware of my whole history I should
perhaps be less frank, but you know that when I
arrived in France, far from owning a single sou,
my debts amounted to eight hundred crowns; now
we possess more than a million in money, with
landed property and houses in France, three hundred
thousand crowns at Florence, and a similar sum in
Rome. I do not speak of the fortune accumulated
by my wife; but surely we may be satisfied to exist
for the remainder of our lives upon the proceeds of
our past favour. Had you not been well informed
as to my previous life I might seek to disguise it
from you, but you cannot have forgotten that you
saw me at Florence steeped in debauchery, frequently
in prison, more than once in exile, generally without
resources, and continually lost in disorder and excess.
Here, on the contrary, I have acquired alike honour,
wealth, and favour, and I would fain disappoint my
enemies by leaving the country without disgrace;
but the Marchale is impracticable; and were it not
that I should be guilty of ingratitude in separating
my fortunes from those of a woman to whom I
owe all that I possess, I would forthwith leave the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg 357]</span>
country and secure my own safety and that of my
son." <a id="footnotetag242" name="footnotetag242"></a><a href="#footnote242">[242]</a></p>

<p>The allusion made by Concini to the growing
ambition of the Prince de Cond was unfortunately
not destitute of foundation; and suspicions were
rapidly gaining ground that he meditated nothing
less than a transfer of the crown of France to his
own brow, on the pretext that the marriage of Henri
IV with the Tuscan Princess was invalid, his former
wife being still alive, and his hand, moreover, solemnly
pledged to the Marquise de Verneuil. On more
than one occasion, when he had feasted his friends,
their glasses had been emptied amid cries of <i>Barre
 bas</i>; a toast which was interpreted as intended to
signify the suppression of the bar-sinister which the
shield of Cond bore between its three <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>.<a id="footnotetag243" name="footnotetag243"></a><a href="#footnote243">[243]</a>
Neither Sully, who had recently returned to Court,
nor the Duc de Guise could be induced to join in
so criminal a faction; and the former had no sooner
been informed of the dangerous position of the King
than, dissatisfied as he was with the treatment which
he had personally received, he demanded an audience
of the young sovereign and his mother, in order to
warn them of their peril. In vain, however, did
Marie, touched by this proof of loyal devotedness,
urge him to suggest a remedy.</p>

<p>"I am no longer in office, Madame," he replied
proudly; "and you have your chosen counsellors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg 358]</span>
about you. I have done my duty, and leave it to
others to do theirs."</p>

<p>He then made his parting obeisance, and had
already reached the door of the apartment, leaving
the Queen-mother in a state of agitation and alarm
which she made no effort to disguise, when, suddenly
pausing upon the threshold, he once more turned
towards her, saying impressively:</p>

<p>"Sire, and you, Madame, I beg your Majesties to
reflect upon what I have said; my conscience is now
at rest. Would to God that you were in the midst
of twelve hundred horse; I can see no other alternative."
And without awaiting any reply, he then
withdrew.<a id="footnotetag244" name="footnotetag244"></a><a href="#footnote244">[244]</a></p>

<p>The advice of the veteran minister appeared,
however, to the friends of the Queen-mother too
dangerous to be followed. France had so recently
been delivered from the horrors of a civil war that
it was deemed inexpedient to provoke its renewal
by any hostile demonstration on the part of the
Crown; while, moreover, the popularity of Cond
was so notorious that no doubt could be entertained
of his success should the <i>ultima ratio regum</i> be
adopted. His influence was alike powerful with all
classes; the people were unanimous in his cause;
the Princes and great nobles were his zealous adherents;
and since his entrance into the Council as
its president, not content with dividing his authority
with the Queen-mother, he had gradually absorbed
it in his own person. His htel was crowded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg 359]</span>
those who formerly thronged the apartments of the
Louvre; all who had demands to make, or remonstrances
to offer, addressed themselves to him only;
and thus he had become too dangerous an enemy to
be lightly opposed.<a id="footnotetag245" name="footnotetag245"></a><a href="#footnote245">[245]</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances it appeared impossible
to proceed openly against him, while it was equally
essential to deliver the Crown from so formidable an
adversary; his arrest offered the only opportunity
of effecting so desirable a result, but even to accomplish
this with safety was by no means easy. In
his own house he was surrounded by friends and
adherents who would have rendered such an attempt
useless; and after mature deliberation it was accordingly
agreed that he must be made prisoner in the
Louvre.</p>

<p>Under a specious pretext the Swiss Guards were
detained in the great court of the palace; the Marquis
de Thmines<a id="footnotetag246" name="footnotetag246"></a><a href="#footnote246">[246]</a> undertook to demand the sword
of the Prince, and to secure his person, volunteering
at the same time to procure the assistance of his two
sons, and seven or eight nobles upon whose fidelity
he could rely; arms were introduced into one of the
apartments of the Queen-mother in a large chest,
which was understood to contain costly stuffs from
Italy; and a number of the youngest and most distinguished
noblemen of the Court, to whom Marie
appealed for support, took a solemn oath of obedience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg 360]</span>
to her behests, without inquiring into the nature of
the service to which they were thus pledged.</p>

<p>All being in readiness, Bassompierre was awakened
at three o'clock in the morning of the 1st of September
by a gentleman of the Queen-mother's household,
and instructed to proceed immediately to the
Louvre in disguise. On his arrival he found Marie
only half-dressed, seated between Mangot and Barbin,
and evidently in a state of extraordinary agitation
and excitement. As he entered the apartment she
said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"You are welcome, Bassompierre. You do not
know why I have summoned you so early; I will
shortly explain my reason."</p>

<p>Then, rising from her seat, she paced to and fro
across the floor for nearly half an hour, no one
venturing to break in upon her reverie. Suddenly,
however, she paused, and beckoning to her companions
to follow her, she entered her private closet;
and the hangings no sooner fell behind the party
than, turning once more towards him, she continued
with bitter vehemence:</p>

<p>"I am about to arrest the Prince, together with
the Ducs de Vendme, de Mayenne, and de Bouillon.
Let the Swiss Guards be on the spot by eleven o'clock
as I proceed to the Tuileries, for should I be compelled
by the people to leave Paris, I wish them to
accompany me to Nantes. I have secured my jewels
and forty thousand golden crowns, and I shall take
my children with me, if&mdash;which I pray God may not
be the case, and as I do not anticipate&mdash;I find myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg 361]</span>
under the necessity of leaving the capital; for I am
resolved to submit to every sort of peril and inconvenience
rather than lose my own authority or
endanger that of the King." <a id="footnotetag247" name="footnotetag247"></a><a href="#footnote247">[247]</a></p>

<p>The final arrangements were then discussed, and
Marie de Medicis was left to her own thoughts
until the hour of eight, when M. de Thmines was
announced.</p>

<p>"Ha! you are come at length," she exclaimed
joyfully; "I was awaiting you with impatience. The
Council is about to open, and it is time that we were
all prepared. Can you depend on those by whom
you are accompanied?"</p>

<p>"They are my sons, Madame."</p>

<p>"Bravely answered!" said Marie forcing a smile,
as she extended her hand, which the Marquis raised
to his lips. "Go then, and remember that the fate
of France and of her monarch are in your keeping."</p>

<p>Although surrounded by devoted friends, the
Queen-mother was agitated by a thousand conflicting
emotions. She was well aware that her own
future existence as a Queen hung upon the success
or failure of her enterprise, as should the slightest
indiscretion on the part of any of her agents arouse
the suspicions of the Prince and induce him to leave
the capital, he had every prospect of obtaining the
crown. Moreover, MM. de Crquy and de Bassompierre,
who were in command of the French and
Swiss Guards, and who had received orders to draw
up their men in order of battle at the great gate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg 362]</span>
the Louvre immediately that the Prince should have
entered, and to arrest him did he attempt to leave
the palace, became alarmed at the responsibility thus
thrust upon them, and declined to comply with these
instructions until they had received a warranty to
that effect under the great seal; but this demand
having been conceded, they hesitated no longer.<a id="footnotetag248" name="footnotetag248"></a><a href="#footnote248">[248]</a>
All the precautions which had been taken nevertheless
failed in some degree in their effect, as the Duc
de Mayenne and the Marchal de Bouillon were
apprised by their emissaries of the unusual movements
of the Court, and at once adopted measures
of safety. Bouillon feigned an indisposition, and
refused to leave his hotel, where, after a long interview
with the Duke, it was resolved that Cond
should be warned not to trust himself in the power
of the Queen-mother. The Prince, however, who
had been lulled into false security by the specious
representations of Barbin, treated their caution with
contempt, being unable to believe that Marie
would venture to attempt any violence towards
himself.</p>

<p>"If there be indeed any hostile intention on the
part of the Crown," he said disdainfully, "it probably
regards M. de Bouillon, whose restless spirit
excites the alarm of the Queen-mother. Let him
look to himself, if he see fit to do so. Should he
be committed to the Bastille my interests will not
suffer."</p>

<p>Angered by his presumption, the two friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg 363]</span>
made no further protest, but contented themselves
with redoubling their own precautions. Bouillon
retired to Charenton with a strong escort, while the
Duc de Mayenne remained quietly in his htel,
having made the necessary preparations for instant
flight should such a step become essential to his
safety.<a id="footnotetag249" name="footnotetag249"></a><a href="#footnote249">[249]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile at the Louvre nothing remained to
be done but to communicate to the young King the
project which was about to be realized, and to induce
him to sanction it by his countenance; an attempt
which offered little difficulty, the jealousy of Louis
having been excited by the assumed authority of the
Prince, and his dissimulating nature being gratified
by this first participation in a state intrigue.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock a great clamour upon the quay
near the gate of the palace attracted the attention of
the Queen-mother, who commanded silence, and in
another moment distinct cries of "Long live the
Prince!" "Long live M. de Cond!" were heard in
the apartment. Marie de Medicis rose from her
seat and approached an open window, followed by
the Marchale d'Ancre.</p>

<p>"The Prince is about to open the Council," said
Leonora with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>"Rather say the King of France," replied
Marie with a flushed cheek, as she saw Cond
graciously receiving the petitions which were
tendered to him on all sides. "But his royalty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[pg 364]</span>
shall be like that of the bean;<a id="footnotetag250" name="footnotetag250"></a><a href="#footnote250">[250]</a> it shall not last
long." <a id="footnotetag251" name="footnotetag251"></a><a href="#footnote251">[251]</a></p>

<p>When he alighted at the palace Cond proceeded
to the hall of the Council, which was on the ground-floor;
and at the termination of the sitting ascended,
as was his custom, to the apartments of the Queen-mother,
where Louis, who had entered eagerly into
the part that had been assigned to him, and who
had just distributed with his own hands the arms
which had been prepared for the followers of M. de
Thmines, met him in the gallery, entered into a
cheerful conversation, and, finally, invited him to
join a hawking-party which was to take place within
an hour. Cond, however, whose thoughts were
otherwise engaged, declined to participate in the
offered pastime, and the young King, having accomplished
all that had been required of him, accepted his
excuses, and returned to the apartment of his mother.
At the same moment Thmines and his two sons
issued from a small passage, and, approaching the
Prince, announced that they had received an order
to arrest him.</p>

<p>"Arrest me!" exclaimed Cond in astonishment.
"It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"Such are my instructions," said the Marquis, as
he extended his hand to receive the forfeited sword,
while his two sons placed themselves on each side of
the prisoner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg 365]</span>
"You are aware that I am the first Prince of the
Blood."</p>

<p>"I know, Monseigneur, the respect which is your
due," was the reply, "but I must obey the King."</p>

<p>"I must see their Majesties," persisted the Prince.</p>

<p>"It is impossible. Come, sir, suffer me to conduct
you to the apartment to which I have been directed
to escort you."</p>

<p>"How!" vehemently exclaimed Cond, looking
round upon the nobles who were collected in the
hall of which he had just reached the entrance, "is
there no one here who has sufficient courage to
spare me this outrage? You, Monsieur," he continued,
addressing himself to Du Vair, "you at least
I know to be a man of probity. Did you counsel
this violation of all the solemn promises which have
been made to me?"</p>

<p>"I was not consulted upon the subject, Monseigneur,"
replied the Keeper of the Seals; "nor
shall it be my fault if so grievous an error be not
speedily redeemed. The more brief the folly the
better the result."</p>

<p>This imprudent retort was destined to seal the
disgrace of the upright minister without serving the
Prince, who, seeing that he had nothing to anticipate
from any demonstration on the part of the assembled
nobles, haughtily desired his captor to conduct him
to his allotted prison.<a id="footnotetag252" name="footnotetag252"></a><a href="#footnote252">[252]</a> "And when you have done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg 366]</span>
so," he added in a firm voice, as he swept the apartment
with an eye as bright and as steady as though
he had not stood there unarmed and a captive,
"you may tell the Queen-mother that she has anticipated
me only by three days, for had she waited
beyond that time, the King would no longer have
had a crown upon his head." <a id="footnotetag253" name="footnotetag253"></a><a href="#footnote253">[253]</a></p>

<p>The Prince was then conducted by a back staircase
to an upper chamber strongly barred, where he
remained guarded by M. de Thmines until he was
conveyed to the Bastille.</p>

<p>The exultation of Marie de Medicis was at its
height. She embraced her son as fervently as
though by the imprudence of which she had just
been guilty she had ensured the security of his
throne, and received the congratulations of the
courtiers with undisguised delight. "See, Sire,"
she exclaimed, as with one hand resting upon the
shoulder of the young King she advanced to the
centre of the great hall, "here is our brave M. de
Thmines, to whom we are so greatly indebted.
Can you not offer him a royal recompense? He is
not yet a Marshal of France."</p>

<p>"I salute you, M. le Marchal," said Louis with
regal gravity. "In an hour I will sign your brevet."</p>

<p>M. de Thmines bowed low, and kissed the hand
of the King.</p>

<p>"And I," smiled Marie de Medicis, "present you
with a hundred thousand crowns. Your elder son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg 367]</span>
the Marquis de Thmines is henceforth captain of
my bodyguard, and your younger the Baron de
Lauzire equerry of Monsieur."</p>

<p>Again the captor of M. de Cond bent low and
uttered his acknowledgments.</p>

<p>Low murmurs were heard among the nobles.</p>

<p>"Advance, M. de Montigny," continued Marie,
turning graciously towards an individual who had
only just reached the capital, having on his way
provided the Duc de Vendme with a relay of
horses in order to facilitate his escape. "Sire, the
Comte de Montigny was a faithful and devoted
follower of your father. You owe him also some
mark of favour."</p>

<p>"M. de Montigny shall be a marshal," said
Louis XIII, delighted with his new and unchecked
exhibition of power.</p>

<p>"It would appear that to ask a <i>bton</i> is to have
one on this occasion," said M. de Saint-Gran<a id="footnotetag254" name="footnotetag254"></a><a href="#footnote254">[254]</a> in a
low voice to the Marquis de Crquy; "let us therefore
put in our claim."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," replied the Marquis gaily.
"The ladies do not refuse us their smiles, nor the
Queen-mother the festivities in her honour by which
we impoverish our estates; why, therefore, should
the King deprive us of our share of the easily-won
distinctions of the day?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg 368]</span>
So saying, the two courtiers moved a pace nearer
to Marie de Medicis, who did not fail to observe and
to comprehend the action.</p>

<p>"Happy is the monarch who sees himself surrounded
by loyal subjects and by faithful friends,"
pursued the exulting Princess; "your Majesty has
not yet completed the good work so royally commenced?"</p>

<p>"M. de Crquy has already a <i>bton</i>," said Louis,
somewhat bewildered by the new part he was called
upon to enact on so large a scale.</p>

<p>"But you have forgotten, Sire, that he is neither
duke nor peer."</p>

<p>"I salute you, M. le Duc et Pair," said the young
King.</p>

<p>The Marquis acknowledged his new honours, and
made way for his companion.</p>

<p>"Our list of marshals is full, M. de Saint-Gran,"
said Louis coldly.</p>

<p>The disappointed courtier bowed, and was about
to retire, when Marie de Medicis met his eye, and
its expression was far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>"MM. de Praslin and de Saint-Gran have both,
nevertheless, merited high distinction, Sire," she
said anxiously. "Your pledge for the future will
suffice, however, as they are both young enough to
wait."</p>

<p>"Be it so, Madame," rejoined her son, who was
becoming weary of the rapacity of his loyal subjects
and faithful friends. "Gentlemen, your services
shall not be forgotten on the next vacancy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg 369]</span>
And thus, as Bassompierre has recorded, did M.
de Saint-Gran "extort the promise" of a <i>bton</i>.</p>

<p>"And you, M. de Bassompierre," exclaimed the
Queen-mother, as in advancing up the hall their
Majesties found themselves beside him, "unlike the
others, you have put in no claim."</p>

<p>"Madame," was the dignified reply, "it is not at
such a moment as this, when we have merely done
our duty, that we should seek for reward; but I
trust that when by some important service I may
deserve to be remembered, the King will grant me
both wealth and honours without any claim upon
my own part."</p>

<p>Louis hesitated for a moment, and then, with a
slight bow, passed on; and he had no sooner entered
his private closet, still accompanied by his mother,
than a herald announced in a loud voice that a great
public council would be held on the following day at
the meeting of the Parliament.</p>

<p>It might well be imagined that when she retired
Marie de Medicis left grateful hearts behind her,
but such was not the case; lavish as she had proved
upon this occasion, she was far from having satisfied
those who had assisted in the arrest of the Prince,
and who did not fail openly to express their discontent.<a id="footnotetag255" name="footnotetag255"></a><a href="#footnote255">[255]</a></p>

<p>During this time the Dowager-Princess of Cond
had been apprised of the arrest of her son;
and, maddened by the intelligence, she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[pg 370]</span>
immediately rushed out of her house on foot, and hurried
to the Pont Neuf, crying as she went, "To arms!
To arms!"</p>

<p>"It is Madame de Nemours!" shouted the crowd
which gathered about her. "Long live Madame de
Nemours!"</p>

<p>"Long live Madame de Nemours!" echoed a
voice, which was immediately recognized as that of
the shoemaker Picard, who had, since his insult to
the Marchal d'Ancre, been the idol of the mob.
"Concini has assassinated the first Prince of the
Blood in the Louvre!"</p>

<p>Even this announcement, however, failed in the
effect which had been anticipated by the Princess,
whose object was to accomplish the rescue of her
son; for while the respectable citizens hastened to
close their shops and to place their families in safety,
the lower orders rushed towards the htel of the
Marchal d'Ancre in the Faubourg St. Germain.
The doors were driven in, furniture and valuables
to the amount of two hundred thousand crowns were
destroyed, and lighted torches were applied to the
costly hangings of the apartments, which soon
caused the carved and gilded woodwork to ignite;
while a portion of the mob at the same time attacked
the house of Corbinelli his secretary; and soon the
two residences presented only a mass of bare and
blackened walls. M. de Liancourt, the Governor
of Paris, opposed his authority in vain; he was
hooted, driven back, and finally compelled to retire.
Couriers were despatched to the Louvre to inform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[pg 371]</span>
the Queen-mother of the popular tumult, but no
orders were issued in consequence; the counsellors
of Marie de Medicis deeming it desirable that the
populace should be permitted to expend their violence
upon the property of Concini, rather than turn
their attention to the rescue of the Prince, until the
public excitement had abated.</p>

<p>The arrest of M. de Cond had alarmed all the
leaders of the late faction, who hastened to secure
their own safety. Bouillon, as we have stated, had
already reached Charenton; and the Duc de Vendme
had fled in his turn on learning that all egress
from the Louvre was forbidden, and that the outlets
of the palace were strongly guarded. M. de
Mayenne, who had hitherto remained in the capital,
awaiting the progress of events, followed his example
attended by a strong party of his friends. The
Duc de Guise and the Prince de Joinville, alarmed
lest they should be involved in the ruin of Cond
through the machinations of Concini, with whom
they were at open feud, hastened to Soissons, in
order to join M. de Mayenne, whither they were
shortly followed by the young Count and his mother;
and, finally, the Duc de Nevers, who had indulged
in a vain dream of rendering himself master of the
Turkish empire through the medium of the Greeks,
by declaring himself to be a descendant of the
Paleologi, suddenly halted on his way to Germany,
and declared himself determined to join the new
faction of the Princes.<a id="footnotetag256" name="footnotetag256"></a><a href="#footnote256">[256]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg 372]</span>
These defections created a great void at the
Louvre, but the Queen-mother disdained to express
her mortification; and, on the contrary, affected the
most entire confidence in the nobles who still maintained
their adherence to the Crown.</p>

<p>She was well aware that Cond had lost much of
his popularity by abandoning the interests of the
people at the Treaty of Loudun, and that the Protestants
similarly resented the selfishness with which he
had sacrificed their cause to his ambition; while she
had, moreover, ascertained that the flight of the Duc
de Guise and his brother had been simply induced
by misrepresentation, and that through the medium
of the females of their family they might readily be
recalled. These circumstances gave her courage;
and when, on the morning of the 2nd of September,
she came to the council of war, which was held in the
Augustine Monastery and presided over by the
Marchal de Brissac, accompanied by her two sons,
she remarked with undisguised gratification that more
than two thousand nobles were already assembled.
When the King, the Queen-mother, Monsieur, the
great dignitaries, and the ministers had taken their
seats, the doors were thrown open to all who chose
to enter; and in a few moments the vast hall was
densely crowded. Silence was then proclaimed;
M. de Brissac declared that the session was open,
and the President Jeannin forthwith commenced
reading, in the name of the King, the celebrated
declaration explaining the arrest of the Prince de
Cond; proclaiming him a traitor, and, finally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[pg 373]</span>
promising a free pardon to all who had aided and
abetted him in his disloyal practices, on condition of
their appearing within fifteen days to solicit the
mercy of his Majesty, in default of which concession
they would be involved in the same accusation
of <i>lse-majest</i><a id="footnotetag257" name="footnotetag257"></a><a href="#footnote257">[257]</a></p>

<p>More than once, during the delivery of this discourse,
many of the nobles who were attached to the
faction of the Princes gave utterance to a suppressed
murmur; but it was not until its close that they
openly and vociferously expressed their dissatisfaction.
Then, indeed, the hall became a scene of
confusion and uproar which baffles all description;
voice was heard above voice; the clang of weapons
as they were struck against the stone floor sounded
ominously; and the terrified young King, after
glancing anxiously towards De Luynes, who returned
his look by another quite as helpless, fastened his
gaze upon his mother as if from her alone he could
hope for protection. Nor was his mute appeal
made in vain, for although an expression of anxiety
could be traced upon the noble features of Marie de
Medicis, they betrayed no feeling of alarm. She
was pale but calm, and her eyes glanced over the
assembly as steadily as though she herself played no
part in the drama which was enacting before her.
For a few moments she remained motionless, as if
absorbed in this momentous scrutiny; but ultimately
she turned and uttered a few words in a low voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg 374]</span>
to Bassompierre, who was standing immediately
behind her; and she had no sooner done so than,
accompanied by M. de Saint-Gran, the captain of
the King's Guard, he left the hall. In an instant
afterwards both officers re-appeared, followed by a
company of halberdiers, who silently took up their
position in the rear of the sovereign and his mother;
and the Queen no sooner saw the gleam of their
lances than she caused it to be intimated to the
President Jeannin that she desired to address the
meeting.</p>

<p>When her purpose was communicated to the
assembly silence was by degrees restored; and then
the clear, full voice of Marie de Medicis was heard
to the furthest recesses of the vast apartment.</p>

<p>"Nobles and gentlemen," she said with a gesture
of quiet dignity, "as Regent of France I have also
a right to speak on an occasion of this importance;
for since the death of Henry the Great, my lord and
husband, it is I who have constantly borne the
burthen of the Crown. You know, one and all, how
many obstacles I have had to oppose, how many
intrigues to frustrate, how many dangers to overcome.
An intestine war throughout the kingdom;
disaffection alike in Paris and in the provinces; and
amid all these struggles for the national welfare, I
had to combat a still more gnawing anxiety. I had
to watch over the safety of the King my son, and
that of the other Children of France; and never,
gentlemen, for one hour, did my dignity as a Queen
cause me to forget my tenderness as a mother. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[pg 375]</span>
might have been sustained in this daily struggle&mdash;I
might have found strong arms and devoted hearts
to share in my toils, and in my endeavours&mdash;but
that these have too often failed me, I need scarcely
say. Thus, then, if any among you complain of
the past, they accuse me, for the King my son
having delegated his authority to myself can have
incurred no blame, nor do I wish to transfer it to
another. Every enterprise which I have undertaken
has had the glory and prosperity of France
as its sole aim and object. If I have at times been
mistaken in my estimate of the measures calculated
to ensure so desirable a result, I have at least never
persisted in my error; I have surrounded myself with
able and conscientious counsellors; MM. de Villeroy
and de Jeannin were chosen by the most ancient and
noble families in the kingdom&mdash;the Cardinal de la
Valette and the Bishop of Luon-Richelieu are my
advisers&mdash;the estimable Miron, Provost of Paris,
in conjunction with Barbin represent the <i>tiers-tat</i>&mdash;while
as regards the people, I have ever been
careful to mete out justice to them with an equal
hand."</p>

<p>Marie paused for an instant, and she had no
sooner done so than loud shouts echoed through
the cloistral arches, as the crowd vociferously and
almost unanimously responded, "You have&mdash;you
have. Long live the Queen!"</p>

<p>"Nor did I limit the sacred duties of my mission
here," pursued the Regent; "I had work to do
without as well as within the kingdom; and it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg 376]</span>
not been neglected. I undertook and accomplished
a successful negotiation for the marriage of the King
my son with the Infanta of Spain; our ancient rival
England has become our ally; Germany has learnt
to fear us; and the Princes of Italy have bowed
their heads before our triumphant banners. Have
I not then, gentlemen, consulted in all things the
honour of France, and increased her power? Have
I not compelled respect where I have failed to
secure amity? Can you point to one act of my
authority by which the interests of the nation have
been compromised, or her character tarnished in the
eyes of foreign states? I boldly await your answer.
Thus much for our external relations, and now I
appeal to your justice; I ask you with equal confidence
if, when within the kingdom faction after
faction was detected and suppressed, I yielded to
any sentiment of undue vengeance? Has not every
outbreak of unprovoked disaffection rather tended to
exhibit the forbearance of the King my son and
my own? Need I recall the concessions which we
have made to those who had sought to injure us?
Need I ask you to remember that we have bestowed
upon them governments, titles, riches, high offices
of state, and every honour which it was in our power
to confer? What more then could you require or
demand, gentlemen? And yet, when the King my
son has pardoned where he might have punished,
you have responded by seditious shouts, by wilful
disrespect, and even by attempts against his royal
person! It was time for him to exert his prerogative,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[pg 377]</span>
gentlemen,&mdash;you have compelled him to assert
his power, and yet you murmur! Now, with God's
help, we may hope for internal peace. France must
have lost her place among the European nations
had she been longer permitted to prey upon her
own vitals. One individual alone could have condemned
her to this self-slaughter, and we have
delivered her from the peril by committing that
individual to the Bastille."</p>

<p>As the Queen-mother uttered these words her
voice was drowned in the universal burst of fury
and violence which assailed her on all sides; nobles,
citizens, and people alike yelled forth their discontent,
but the unquenchable spirit of Marie de
Medicis did not fail her even at this terrible
moment. Rising with the emergency, she seemed
rather to ride upon the storm than to quail beneath
it; her eyes flashed fire, a red spot burned upon her
cheek, and scorn and indignation might be read
upon every feature of her expressive countenance.
When the tumult was at its height she rose
haughtily from her seat, and striking her clenched
hand violently upon the table before her, she exclaimed
in a tone of menace: "How now, Counts
and Barons! Is it then a perpetual revolt upon
which you have determined? When pardon and
peace are frankly offered to you, and when both
should be as welcome to all good Frenchmen as a
calm after a tempest, you reject it? Do you hold
words less acceptable than blows? Do you prefer
the sword to the hand of friendship? Be it even as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg 378]</span>
you will then. If friendship does not content you
we will try the sword, for clemency exerted beyond
a certain limit degenerates into weakness. You
shall have no reason to deem your rulers either
feeble or cowardly. You have here and now defied
me, and I accept the defiance. Do you desire to
know how I respond? It is thus. In the name of
the King my son and in my own, in the name of
my offended dignity and in the name of France, I,
in my turn, declare the most stringent and unsparing
war against rebellion, be it the work of whom
it may. Neither high blood nor ancient title
shall suffice to screen a traitor; war, war to the
death, shall be henceforward my battle-cry against
the malcontents who are striving to decimate the
nation; and do not delude yourselves with the
belief that I shall be single-handed in the struggle,
for I will call the people to my aid, and the people
will maintain the cause of their sovereigns. We
will try our strength at last, and the strife will be a
memorable one; our sons shall relate it with awe
and terror to their descendants, and it will be a tale
of shame which will cleave to your names for centuries
to come. Ah, gentlemen, the rule of a
woman has rendered you over-bold; and you have
forgotten that there have been women who have
wielded a sceptre of iron. Look to England&mdash;is
there no sterner lesson to be learnt there? Or
think you that Marie de Medicis fears to emulate
Elizabeth? You have mistaken both yourselves and
me. My forbearance has not hitherto grown out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[pg 379]</span>
of fear; but the lion sometimes disdains to struggle
with the tiger, not because he misdoubts his own
strength, but because he cares not to lavish it idly.
I also feel my strength, and when the fitting moment
comes, it shall be put forth. To your war-cry I
will answer with my war-cry; to your leaders I will
oppose my leaders; and when you shout Cond and
Mayenne! I will answer triumphantly Louis de
France and Gaston d'Orlans! Draw the sword
of rebellion if it be too restless to remain in the
scabbard; you will not find me shrink from the
flash of steel; and should you take the field I will be
there to meet you. Rally your chiefs; the array
can have no terrors for me, prepared as I am to
confront you with some of the best and the bravest
in all France. Deny this if you can, you who seek
to undermine the throne, and to sacrifice the nation
to your own ambitious egotism, and I will confound
you with the names of Guise, Montmorency, Brissac,
Sully, Bassompierre, Lesdiguires, Marillac, and
Ornano; these, and many more of the great
captains of the age, will peal out my war-cry, and
rally round the threatened throne of their legitimate
sovereign. My son will be in the midst of them;
and mark me well, gentlemen, the struggle shall no
sooner have commenced than every pampered adventurer
who has poisoned the ear of the monarch,
and steeled his heart against his mother, shall be
crushed under her heel; and should he dare to raise
his head, I will assign to him as his armour-bearer
the executioner of Paris."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg 380]</span>
Never before had the Regent evinced such an
amount of energy; never before had she so laid
bare the secret workings of her soul. The adherents
of the Princes trembled as they discovered with
how formidable an enemy they should be called
thenceforward to contend; while the majority of
the nobles who were faithful to the royal cause, and
above all those whose names she had so proudly
quoted, uttered loud acclamations of delight and
triumph.</p>

<p>Bewildered by the daring of his mother, Louis
once more sought for support from his favourite,
but De Luynes was in no position to afford it. The
allusion to himself with which Marie de Medicis had
concluded her harangue was too palpable to be mistaken,
and he felt that should she maintain her
purpose he was lost. Even Richelieu, as if crushed
beneath the impassioned eloquence of the Regent,
sat with drooping head and downcast eyes; and
meanwhile Marie herself, after having glanced defiantly
over the assembly, calmly resumed her seat,
and desired that the business of the meeting might
proceed.</p>

<p>Before the sitting closed it was determined that
the army should be placed upon the war footing,
and that a levy of six thousand Swiss should immediately
be made; and this arrangement completed,
the Queen-mother proceeded to attempt by every
means in her power a reconciliation with the Guises.</p>

<p>For this purpose she despatched four nobles in
whom she could confide to Soissons, to negotiate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[pg 381]</span>
with the Princes, nor was it long ere they ascertained
that individual jealousy had tended to create considerable
disunion among them; and that each
appeared ready, should any plausible pretext present
itself, to abandon the others. Under these circumstances
it was not difficult to convince the Due de
Guise and his brother that no hostile design had
ever been entertained against them, and to induce
them to admit their regret at the hasty step which
they had taken, together with their anxiety to redeem
it. The Duc de Longueville was equally
ready to effect his reconciliation with the Court;
and having arranged with the royal envoys the
terms upon which they consented to return, they
were severally declared innocent of all connivance
with the rebellious Princes. The Duc de Nevers,
however, refused to listen to any compromise with
the Crown; and, in defiance of the royal command,
continued his endeavours to possess himself of the
fortresses of Champagne, which were not comprised
in his government.<a id="footnotetag258" name="footnotetag258"></a><a href="#footnote258">[258]</a></p>

<p>The persevering disaffection of M. de Nevers
occasioned the disgrace of Du Vair, who betrayed
an indisposition to proceed against him which so
irritated Marie de Medicis that she induced the
King to deprive him of the seals, and to bestow
them upon Mangot, making Richelieu Secretary of
State in his place; that wily prelate having already,
by his great talent and ready expedients, rendered
himself almost indispensable to his royal patroness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[pg 382]</span>
The arrest of the Prince de Cond had restored
the self-confidence of Concini, who shortly afterwards
returned to Court and resumed his position
with an arrogance and pretension more undisguised
than ever. The Marchale, however, had never
recovered from the successive shocks to which she
had been subjected by the death of her child and
the destruction of her house; but had fallen into
a state of discouragement and melancholy which
threatened her reason.<a id="footnotetag259" name="footnotetag259"></a><a href="#footnote259">[259]</a> For days she shut herself
up in her apartments, refusing to receive the most
intimate of her friends, and complaining that she
was bewitched by those who looked at her.<a id="footnotetag260" name="footnotetag260"></a><a href="#footnote260">[260]</a> Her
domestic misery was, moreover, embittered by the
public hatred, of which, in conjunction with her
husband, she had become more than ever the object.
It would appear that the injury already inflicted
upon the Italian favourites had stimulated rather
than satiated the detestation of the people for both
of them. Every grievance under which the lower
orders groaned was attributed to the influence of
Concini and his wife; they were accused of inciting
the Queen-mother to the acts of profusion by which
the nation was impoverished; while every disappointment,
misfortune, or act of oppression was traced
to the same cause. Many affected to believe that
Marie was the victim of sorcery, and that such was
the real source of the influence of Leonora; and
thus the heart-broken mother and unhappy wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>[pg 383]</span>
whose morbid imagination had caused her to consider
her trials as the result of magical arts, was
herself accused of having employed them against her
royal benefactress.<a id="footnotetag261" name="footnotetag261"></a><a href="#footnote261">[261]</a></p>

<p>The nomination of Richelieu as Secretary of State
had been effected through the influence of Concini,
who in vain endeavoured to persuade him to resign
the bishopric of Luon, as incompatible with his
new duties. The astute prelate had more extended
views than those of his patron; nor was it long
ere he succeeded in arousing the jealousy of the
Marchal, and in convincing him, when too late,
that he had, while endeavouring to further his own
fortunes, only raised up a more dangerous and
potent enemy than any to whom he had hitherto
been opposed. Richelieu had no sooner joined the
ministry than he made advances to the ancient allies
of Henri IV, whom he regarded as the true friends
of France; and for the purpose of conciliating those
whose support he deemed most essential to the
welfare of the kingdom, he hastened to despatch
ambassadors to the Courts of England, Holland,
and Germany, who were instructed to explain to
the several monarchs to whom they were accredited
the reasons which had induced Louis XIII to arrest
the Prince de Cond, and to assure them that the
measures adopted by the French Court were not
induced, as had been falsely represented, by any
desire to conciliate either Rome or Spain. To this
assurance he subjoined a rapid synopsis of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[pg 384]</span>
means employed by the Queen-mother to ensure
the peace of the kingdom, and the efforts made by
the Prince to disturb it; and, finally, he recapitulated
the numerous alliances which had taken place between
the royal families of France and Spain during
several centuries as an explanation of the close
friendship which existed between the two countries.<a id="footnotetag262" name="footnotetag262"></a><a href="#footnote262">[262]</a>
Meanwhile considerable difficulty was experienced
in the equipment of the army which had been raised.
The royal treasury was exhausted, and in several
provinces the revolted nobles had possessed themselves
of the public monies; financial edicts were
issued which created fresh murmurs among the
citizens; the Princes assumed an attitude of stern
and steady defiance; and the year 1616 closed amid
apprehension, disaffection, and mistrust.</p>

France. He was born in Paris, on the 5th of September 1585; and
having been educated with great care, became an accomplished
scholar. At the age of twenty-two years he was received as a
member of the Sorbonne; and having obtained a dispensation from
Paul V for the bishopric of Luon, was consecrated at Rome by the
Cardinal de Givry, in 1607. On his return to France he was introduced
to the notice of Marie de Medicis by the Marquise de Guercheville
and the Marchal d'Ancre.

 Franoise Bertaut, Dame de Motteville, was the daughter of
Pierre Bertaut, Gentleman in ordinary of the Bedchamber, and of
Louise Bessin de Mathonville, of the Spanish family of Saldaa.
At the age of fifteen she married Nicolas Langlois, Seigneur de
Motteville, a man already advanced in years, but with whom she
lived happy until 1641, when she was left a widow with a very
slender jointure. Two years subsequently, at the age of twenty-two,
she entered the household of Anne of Austria, rather as a personal
friend than as an official attendant; a post which she retained for
many years with honour, her sweetness of disposition and total
absence of ambition causing her to be respected by all parties. She
was present at the death of her royal mistress, who, by a bequest of
ten thousand crowns, enabled her to quit the Court, and to devote her
whole attention to the revision of her well-known Memoirs. Intimately
acquainted with Mesdames de la Fayette and de Svign, she for
some time maintained a constant intercourse with both; but on the
termination of her self-imposed task she retired to the convent of
Ste. Marie de Chaillot, where she died on the 29th of December
1689.

<p>In the month of January the Comte d'Auvergne,

was despatched at the head of fourteen thousand
men against the insurgent Princes; and his departure
was made a pretext for depriving the young King of
the gentlemen of his household and of his bodyguard,
an insult which he deeply although silently
resented. He had been attacked in the November
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[pg 386]</span>
of the preceding year by an indisposition which for
a time had threatened the most serious consequences,
and from whose latent effects he had not yet
recovered. As time wore on, moreover, he was
becoming more and more weary of the insignificance
to which he was reduced by the delegated authority
of his mother; and had easily suffered himself to be
persuaded by De Luynes that her repeated offers to
resign it had merely been designed to make him
feel the necessity of her assistance. As we have
already shown, Louis XIII derived little pleasure
from the society of his young and lovely wife; he
made no friends; and thus he was flung entirely into
the power of his wily favourite, who, aware that the
King could hate, although he could not love, was
unremitting in his endeavours to excite him against
Marie de Medicis and her favourite. The infatuated
Concini seconded his efforts but too well; for,
unable to bear his fortunes meekly, he paraded his
riches and his power with an insolence which tended
to justify the aversion of his enemies. On one
occasion, shortly after the dismemberment of his
little Court, the monarch of France having refused
to join a hunting-party organized by the Queen-mother,
found himself entirely deserted save by De
Luynes and a single valet; and overcome by
mortification and melancholy, he leant his head upon
his hand and wept bitterly. For some time not a
sound was heard in the Louvre save the soughing of
the wind through the tall trees of the palace-garden,
and the measured tread of the sentinels, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span>
suddenly a tumult arose in the great court; the
trampling of horses, the voices of men, and the
clashing of weapons were blent together; and
dashing away his tears, Louis desired his favourite
to ascertain the cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>"It is the Marchal d'Ancre, Sire, who has just
alighted," said De Luynes as he approached the
window.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the Italian was announced, and
entered the royal apartment followed by a train of
forty gentlemen all magnificently attired. At this
spectacle Louis started from his seat; and with a
bitter smile inquired of the arrogant Marquis his
motive for thus parading before his sovereign a
state which could only be intended as a satire upon
his own privations.</p>

<p>To this question the vainglorious adventurer
replied in a tone of affected sympathy and patronage
which festered in the heart of the young King;
assuring him that his followers were at his own cost,
and not at that of the state; and concluding his
explanation by an offer of pecuniary aid, and a
company of his regiment of Bussy-Zamet, which he
had just brought from Normandy. Justly incensed
by such an insult, Louis commanded him instantly
to quit his presence; and he had no sooner withdrawn,
followed by his glittering retinue, than the
young monarch sank back upon his seat, and uttered
the most bitter complaints of the affront to which he
had been subjected.<a id="footnotetag263" name="footnotetag263"></a><a href="#footnote263">[263]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[pg 388]</span>
"And to this, Sire," said De Luynes, as he
stood beside his royal master&mdash;"to this insult, which
is but the precursor of many others, you have been
subjected by the Queen-mother."</p>

<p>"I will revenge myself!" exclaimed Louis with a
sudden assumption of dignity.</p>

<p>"And how?" demanded the favourite emphatically.
"You are called a King, but where are your
great nobles? where are the officers of your household?
where are your barons? So many princes,
so many powers. France has no longer a King."</p>

<p>"And my people?" shouted the excited youth.</p>

<p>"You have no people. You are a mere puppet
in the hands of an ambitious woman and an unprincipled
adventurer."</p>

<p>"A puppet!" echoed Louis haughtily. "Do I not
wear the crown of France?"</p>

<p>"So did Charles IX," was the unmoved reply;
"yet he died to make way for Henri III. Concini
and his wife, Sire, come from the same country as
Catherine de Medicis. Isabeau de Bavire was
a mother, yet she preferred her lover to her son." <a id="footnotetag264" name="footnotetag264"></a><a href="#footnote264">[264]</a></p>

<p>"Enough, enough, Sir," said Louis, clutching
the hilt of his sword; "I will hear no more, lest it
should make me mad!"</p>

<p>De Luynes bowed in silence; he knew that the
poisonous seed was sown, and he was content to
wait until it should germinate.</p>

<p>The pecuniary difficulties of the kingdom exercised
no influence over the festivities of the Court;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[pg 389]</span>
balls, banquets, and comedies took place in rapid
succession; and the young Queen danced in a ballet
which was the admiration of all the spectators; an
example which was followed by the nobles of the
royal household.<a id="footnotetag265" name="footnotetag265"></a><a href="#footnote265">[265]</a> Still, however, it was necessary
to recruit the national treasury; and, accordingly,
on the 10th of March a declaration was published
by which the King confiscated all the property of
the disaffected Princes, and made it forfeit to the
Crown; while at the same time three separate
bodies of troops attacked the rebels with complete
success, and the royal arms were everywhere
triumphant, when intelligence was forwarded to
their leaders from the capital which induced an
immediate cessation of hostilities.<a id="footnotetag266" name="footnotetag266"></a><a href="#footnote266">[266]</a></p>

<p>We have seen the effect of the insolence of
Concini, and the insidious inferences of De Luynes,
upon the mind of the young King, who had only
six months previously been taught a lesson of
dissimulation on the occasion of the arrest of Cond;
and consequently it can scarcely be subject of
surprise that, wounded to the heart's core, he was
easily persuaded to exert in his own cause the
subtlety which he had evinced at the bidding of
another. He was now between fifteen and sixteen
years of age, and was deeply imbued by the idea
that he possessed an unlimited control alike over the
properties, the liberty, the honour, and the lives of
his subjects; but he was still utterly incapable of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>[pg 390]</span>
fulfilling his duties as a sovereign. His conceptions
of right and wrong were confused and unstable;
and he willingly listened to the advice of those
whose counsels flattered his selfishness and his
resentment. De Luynes had skilfully availed himself
of this weakness; and as he was all-powerful
with his suspicious and saturnine master, who saw in
every one by whom he was approached either an
enemy to be opposed, or a spy to be deceived, he
was careful to introduce to him none save individuals
whose insignificance rendered them incapable of
interfering with his own interests, and who might be
dismissed without comment or danger whenever he
should deem their absence desirable. Against this
arrangement neither the Queen-mother nor her
ministers entered any protest. Louis truly was,
as his favourite had so insolently asserted, a mere
puppet in their hands; and the consequence of this
undignified neglect was fatal to the intellectual
progress of the young sovereign. On the pretext of
requiring assistance in training the royal falcons, De
Luynes had presented to Louis two young nobles,
MM. du Tronon and de Marcillac, men of good
birth, but who had become dishonoured by their own
vices; the former being accused of having betrayed
his master, and the latter his sisters in order to
enrich himself;<a id="footnotetag267" name="footnotetag267"></a><a href="#footnote267">[267]</a> facts of which the favourite was,
however, careful that the King should remain
ignorant.</p>

<p>In addition to these disreputable adventurers, De
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[pg 391]</span>
Luynes also introduced to the intimacy of his royal
patron Dageant,<a id="footnotetag268" name="footnotetag268"></a><a href="#footnote268">[268]</a> the principal clerk of Barbin,
whom he had won over by promises of aggrandizement
should he succeed in effecting the disgrace of
Concini, which, as a natural consequence, must also
involve that of his master; and, finally, a private
soldier, and one of the gardeners of the palace. All
these persons were instructed to excite the suspicions
of the King against his mother and her ministers, a
task in which it was by no means difficult to succeed;
particularly when the treacherous Dageant had
placed in his hands a number of forged letters,
wherein Barbin, at the pretended instigation of Concini,
was supposed to entertain a design against
his life, in order not only to prolong the authority
of the Queen-mother, but also to ensure the
crown to her second and favourite son, Gaston
d'Orlans.<a id="footnotetag269" name="footnotetag269"></a><a href="#footnote269">[269]</a></p>

<p>Skilfully as De Luynes conducted this affair, and
despite the natural dissimulation of Louis XIII, the
reiterated assertions and cautions of his familiar
associates did not fail to produce an involuntary
effect upon his manner and deportment which
aroused the suspicions of the Italian; who, with an
infatuation almost incredible, instead of endeavouring
to conciliate the young King, and to render
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>[pg 392]</span>
himself less obnoxious to the people, resolved to
make all bow before him, and to break the stubborn
spirits that he failed to bend. In this desperate and
insane policy he was, moreover, seconded by the
counsels of Barbin, whose impetuous temper and
anxiety to secure his own safety alike urged him to
support any measure which promised to maintain
the government in the hands of Marie de Medicis
and her favourite, in whose ruin he could not fail to
be involved. So intemperately, indeed, did he
pursue his purpose, that even Marie herself became
alarmed; her most faithful adherents were absent
with the army, while she had daily evidence of the
activity of her enemies; and more than once at this
period she declared her determination to withdraw
from all participation in state affairs, and to resign
her delegated authority, in order that her son might
rule as he saw fit. From this purpose she was, however,
constantly dissuaded by Barbin. "Madame,"
he said on one occasion when the Queen-mother
appeared more than ever resolved to follow out her
determination, "if you once abandon the administration
of government you will cut the throats of
your children. Should you cease to rule they will
be utterly lost." <a id="footnotetag270" name="footnotetag270"></a><a href="#footnote270">[270]</a></p>

<p>No wonder that her tenderness as a mother,
joined to her ambition as a Queen, induced Marie
de Medicis to yield to the representations of one of
her most trusted counsellors, even while the cloud
was deepening around her. As the great nobles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>[pg 393]</span>
murmured at the insolence and tyranny of the
audacious Italian, their murmurs were echoed by the
curses of the people; and in every murmur and in
every curse the name of the Queen-mother was
coupled with that of Concini and his wife. Even the
Marchal himself at length betrayed tokens of alarm;
he never ventured to traverse the streets of Paris
without a numerous retinue, and even so attended
he cowered beneath the menacing looks and gestures
which he encountered on all sides. Again and
again he urged Leonora to leave France; but he
urged in vain; and finally he resolved to take
measures for securing a safe retreat in his government
of Normandy, should he be compelled to
escape from the capital. As a preliminary and
important step towards the accomplishment of
this purpose, he caused the fortifications of Quilleboeuf
to be put into a state of perfect repair, and
endeavoured to purchase the governments of several
other places upon the Loire and the Seine; which,
had he been enabled to carry out his object, could
not have failed to render him independent of the
royal authority. He also lavished large sums on
every side, in order to secure partisans; and so
excited the apprehensions of the citizens that
bitter complaints were made, and threats uttered
against himself, his royal mistress, and the new
ministry.</p>

<p>All these, many of which had been fomented by
themselves, were faithfully reported by De Luynes
and his agents to the young King, to whom they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[pg 394]</span>
pointed out the probability of a general insurrection.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" exclaimed Louis on one
occasion; "the Marchal d'Ancre has, as it would
seem, undertaken the ruin of my kingdom, and yet I
dare not expostulate with my mother, for I cannot
encounter her rage."</p>

<p>This puerile avowal decided the measures of the
confederates; and ere long they succeeded in convincing
the King that it would be quite possible to
accomplish the overthrow of Concini without exposing
himself to the anger which he dreaded.</p>

<p>On the 17th of January a royal declaration was
confirmed by the Parliament against the Duc de
Nevers, who, although not yet in open revolt, was
condemned as guilty of rebellion and <i>lse-majest</i>;
and this premature act of severity caused general
discontent throughout the capital. In vain did his
sister the Dowager Duchess of Longueville and
Bentivoglio the Papal Nuncio endeavour to effect his
reconciliation with the Court. At the instigation of
Richelieu, Concini, and Barbin, Marie de Medicis
imperiously refused to revoke, the sentence.</p>

<p>"The period of forbearance is gone by," she
said coldly in reply to the persevering representations
of the prelate. "Indulgence has proved
ineffectual hitherto; and it has consequently become
imperative upon the King to adopt more rigorous
measures. These gentlemen are enacting the petty
sovereigns in their respective governments, but I
shall take steps to repress their insolence. Things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span>
have now been pushed to extremity; and we
must either crush these rebellious and restless
spirits, or permit the royal authority to be wrested
from the sovereign."</p>

<p>Still, aware of the fatal consequences which must
result from the uncompromising condemnation of
one of the first Princes in the land, Bentivoglio
would not be discouraged; and on retiring from the
presence of the Queen-mother he reiterated his
expostulations to Concini and Richelieu. With
them, however, the zealous Nuncio achieved no
better success.</p>

<p>"His Majesty," said the Italian Marshal haughtily,
"will ere long possess an army of eighty thousand
infantry and four thousand horse; the Comte de
Schomberg<a id="footnotetag271" name="footnotetag271"></a><a href="#footnote271">[271]</a> has received an order to import
experienced troops from Germany; and I have
determined to raise five thousand men at my own
cost; being resolved to teach the French people
how all the faithful servants of the Crown should
feel it their duty to act on such an emergency." <a id="footnotetag272" name="footnotetag272"></a><a href="#footnote272">[272]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[pg 397]</span>
<p>The new Secretary of State followed in the track
of his patron, and with equal explicitness: "The
King, Monseigneur," he replied to the appeal of
the Nuncio, "is resolved to be the ruler of his own
nation; and his Majesty trusts, moreover, that
should the Duc de Nevers and the other Princes
openly take up arms, the Pope will excommunicate
them as rebels to their sovereign." <a id="footnotetag273" name="footnotetag273"></a><a href="#footnote273">[273]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the discontent created among the
people by this ill-judged pertinacity on the part of
Marie and her Government, a new cause of disaffection
was elicited by the harshness with which the
Queen-mother refused to comply with the demand
made by the two Princesses of Cond, that the
Prince should either be released from the Bastille,
or put upon his trial, in order that he might prove
his innocence of the crime of which he was accused.
Compliance with this request would have placed
Marie and her ministers in a position of such
difficulty and danger that it was, moreover, refused
with an abruptness which not only betrayed their
alarm, but which also tended still further to
aggravate the irritation of his friends; and thus at
a moment when the interests of the young King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>[pg 398]</span>
required that none but conciliatory measures should
be adopted, the reckless ambition of a few individuals
threatened to shake the very foundations of
his throne, and to reduce the nation to a state of
anarchy and convulsion.</p>

<p>The time was ripe for the project of De Luynes.
The royal forces were everywhere victorious against
the insurgent nobles; and Concini openly attributed
to his own counsels a success which promised to
make him all-powerful at Court.</p>

<p>"You see, Sire," said the favourite, "that this
arrogant Italian, not content with insulting your
royal person, also claims the merit due to your brave
army, and to your faithful generals. Will you
continue to suffer this presumption to degrade you
in the eyes of your people, and to undermine your
authority over your barons? Take the reins of
government into your own hands, and prove that you
are a worthy descendant of St. Louis. Reform the
Government, and you will soon restore tranquillity
to France; but do not any longer submit to see a
base-born foreigner openly play the sovereign at
your very Court."</p>

<p>"Show me the means of doing this," was the
sullen reply; "I am as anxious as yourself to escape
my present state of slavery. Devise some sure
method of ridding me of the thrall to which I have
been so long condemned, and I will second your
designs as earnestly as you can decide them."</p>

<p>"You have but to assert yourself, Sire, and to
exert your authority."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[pg 399]</span>
"Were I to do so," retorted Louis, "I should
only incur the hatred and ill-offices of my mother,
for I should forthwith visit my vengeance upon her
favourite; but we have had brawls enough in
France, and I am weary of all these conflicting
murmurs. Induce the Marchal and his wife to quit
the country; let them carry away all their wealth,
and even bribe them, by new gifts should it be
necessary. Impoverished as she is, France will still
be able to find a few thousand crowns with which to
purchase their departure."</p>

<p>Although this extraordinary leniency by no means
fulfilled the wishes of De Luynes, he dared not
venture further at the moment; and he accordingly
induced the Bishop of Carcassonne to propose to
the Queen-mother that she should herself suggest
the return of Concini and Leonora to Italy. A
year or two previously Marie de Medicis would
have repelled such a proposition with anger and
impatience, but she had begun to feel that her own
authority had been invaded by the Marchal; and
she consented to act upon the advice of the prelate.</p>

<p>Heart-stricken by misfortune, the Marchale
listened without one expostulation to the order of
her royal foster-sister; her ambition had long been
crushed, and she pined for rest. Aware, moreover,
that by obeying the wishes of the Queen-mother
she should also fulfil those of her husband, she
promised immediate compliance with the will of
Marie, and forthwith commenced the necessary
preparations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span>
This unqualified acquiescence in the pleasure of
the Queen did not, however, satisfy the views of De
Luynes, who could not brook that the immense
wealth of the Marchal d'Ancre should pass into
other hands than his own; and he consequently
laboured to impress upon the King that the apparent
obedience of Concini was a mere subterfuge,
as he publicly boasted that France contained not a
single individual who would dare to attempt anything
to his prejudice.</p>

<p>"Convince him to the contrary, Sire," said one
of his confidential friends to the young monarch.
"Declare to the Queen-mother your determination
to be governed no longer in your own kingdom,
although you are still willing to be guided by her
advice; and then command the instant departure of
her dissimulating favourites. Do this, and you will
not fail to be obeyed."</p>

<p>"Be not misled, Sire," said De Luynes in
his turn, when this officious but well-meaning
counsellor had withdrawn; "your Majesty will not
be obeyed so readily as many would lead you
to anticipate. Concini is too rapacious willingly to
leave the country while there remains one jewel
to be filched from your royal crown; and he is
too ambitious to abandon without a struggle the
factitious power which he has been permitted to
exert." <a id="footnotetag274" name="footnotetag274"></a><a href="#footnote274">[274]</a></p>

<p>"What is to be done then, if the Italian refuses
to quit France? I am in no position to compel his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>[pg 401]</span>
obedience, nor am I inclined to issue an order which
I cannot enforce."</p>

<p>"Sire," said De Luynes approaching the monarch,
the querulousness of whose manner warned him that
unless he caused him to fear for his personal safety
Louis would rather retire from the struggle than brave
the anger of his mother, of whom he even now stood
as much in awe as he had done during his childhood, "I
see that the moment is at length come in which I must
peril my own security in order to ensure that of your
Majesty. You have no longer an alternative if you
desire to escape the machinations of the Marchal
d'Ancre. I have sure information that an attempt
is about to be made to seize your person, and to
take you out of the country."</p>

<p>"You rave, De Luynes!" exclaimed Louis, whose
cheeks blanched at this unexpected announcement.</p>

<p>"Would that I did, Sire," was the reply; "but
should you not adopt immediate measures for circumventing
the traitor whom I have denounced to you at
the hazard of my own life, you will find that I have
only too much foundation for the assertion that I
have made."</p>

<p>"In that case," vehemently retorted the young
King, grasping the hilt of his sword, "it is indeed
time that France should recognize her legitimate
ruler, and that her monarch won his golden spurs.
I will leave Paris, and place myself at the head
of my army."</p>

<p>"Concini will then remain in undisputed possession
of the capital," remarked De Luynes coldly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>[pg 402]</span>
"What is my alternative, Albert?" demanded
Louis, utterly discouraged. "Name it, and I will no
sooner have become in fact as well as name the
sovereign of France than you shall receive the <i>bton</i>
of a marshal,"</p>

<p>"Commit M. d'Ancre to the Bastille, Sire. It is
difficult to conspire within the gates of that fortress."</p>

<p>"Where shall I find an individual hardy enough
to undertake such an enterprise?"</p>

<p>"I will present him to your Majesty within an
hour, Sire."</p>

<p>"So be it, M. le Marchal," said Louis as he
turned away. "My mother had the courage to
provide a lodging for the first Prince of the Blood
in the same prison, and I do not see why I should
shrink from compelling him to share his dungeon
with the husband of Leonora Galiga."</p>

<p>While this plot was forming in the closet of the
young King, Marie de Medicis was warned on her
side that should she not adopt the most stringent
measures to counteract the intrigues of De Luynes,
she would soon lose all her authority over the mind
of her son, who had latterly betrayed increased
impatience of her control; and who was evidently
desirous to emancipate himself from the thraldom
to which he had hitherto so patiently submitted.
Bassompierre among others, with his usual frankness,
replied to his royal mistress, when she urged
him to declare his sentiments upon the subject:
"You have been well advised, Madame; you do not
sufficiently consider your own interests; and one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[pg 403]</span>
these days the King will be taken from beneath your
wing. His adherents have commenced by exciting
him against your friends, and ere long they will
excite him against yourself. Your authority is only
precarious, and must cease whenever such may be
the will of the sovereign. He will be easily persuaded
to annul it, for we know how eagerly youth
pants for power; and should his Majesty see fit one
day to remove to St. Germain, and to command his
principal officers, both Frenchmen and foreigners,
no longer to recognize your rule, what will be your
position? Even I myself, whose devotion to your
Majesty is above suspicion, should be compelled to
take my leave, humbly entreating your permission
to obey the orders of the King. Judge therefore,
Madame, if such must inevitably be the case with
those who are deeply attached to your royal person,
what may be the bearing of the rest. You would find
yourself with your hands empty after a long regency."</p>

<p>Marie, however, refused to be convinced. She
had become so habituated to the passive obedience
of her son that she could not bring herself to believe
that he would ever venture to resist her will; and
thus she rejected the wholesome advice of those who
really desired her own welfare and that of the
country; and increased the exasperation of Louis
and his followers by lavishing upon Concini and his
wife the most costly presents, in order to reconcile
them to their enforced separation from herself.<a id="footnotetag275" name="footnotetag275"></a><a href="#footnote275">[275]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>[pg 404]</span>
The profuse liberality of the Queen-mother to
her favourites sealed their death-warrant, as every
increase of their already almost fabulous wealth only
strengthened the determination of De Luynes to
build up his own fortunes upon the ruin of those
of his detested enemy; but after the first burst
of resolution which we have recorded, Louis
had once more relapsed into vacillation and
inertness. He still wept, but he no longer
threatened; and it became necessary yet further
to excite his indignation and hatred of Concini,
in order to induce him to follow up the design
which he had so eagerly formed against his
liberty.</p>

<p>Means were not wanting. The young King was
reminded by those about him of the niggardly spirit
in which the Italian had supplied his wants during
his boyhood, after having obtained the sanction of
the Regent to regulate the expenses of his little
Court. How often he had been compelled to ask
as a favour that which was his own by right, while
Concini was himself daily risking thousands of
pistoles at the gaming-table, all of which had been
drawn from the royal treasury! How insolently
the Marchal had, upon an occasion when he was
engaged at billiards with his Majesty, requested
the royal permission to resume his plumed cap,
and had replaced it on his head before that
permission was expressed; with a hundred
other trifling but mortifying incidents which
made the blood of Louis boil in his veins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>[pg 405]</span>
and placed him wholly in the power of his insidious
associates.<a id="footnotetag276" name="footnotetag276"></a><a href="#footnote276">[276]</a></p>

<p>In order to hasten the resolution of the King
De Luynes next resolved to impress upon his mind
that his former warning was about to be realized,
and that ere long he would find himself a prisoner
in his own capital; while, with a view to render
this declaration plausible, he took means to have it
reported to Marie de Medicis that Louis was about
to escape from Paris, to cast off her authority, and
to form a coalition with the insurgent Princes. In
consequence of this information the counsellors of
the Queen-mother induced her to double the guard
at the Louvre, and to prevent the King from
passing the city gates, either for the purpose of
hunting, or of visiting, as he was frequently in the
habit of doing, the suburban palaces. This was a
crowning triumph for the cunning favourite, who
thus saw his royal master reduced to seek all his
recreation in the gardens of the Tuileries; and
he soon became convinced that his project had
succeeded. For a few days Louis was too indignant
to make any comment upon the treatment to which
he was subjected, and he even affected to derive
amusement from constructing miniature fortresses,
bird-hunting, and other similar pursuits; but it was
not long ere he became disgusted with these compulsory
pastimes, and wandered moodily through
the avenues of the gardens, communing with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>[pg 406]</span>
own thoughts, and nursing the bitter feelings which
were rapidly sapping his better impulses.</p>

<p>When he had thus convinced himself that the
King's powers of endurance had reached their
extreme limit, De Luynes and his confederates on
one occasion entered his chamber in the evening,
but instead of suggesting to the young monarch,
according to their usual habit, some method of
whiling away the time until he retired to rest, they
approached him with a melancholy and almost
frightened deportment which at once aroused alike
his curiosity and his apprehension. "What is the
meaning of your manner, gentlemen?" asked Louis.
"What has occurred?"</p>

<p>His attendants glanced at each other, as if trusting
that some one of their number would be bold
enough to take the responsibility of a reply upon
himself; but no one spoke.</p>

<p>"I have asked a question, and I demand an
answer," said Louis with a threatening frown.
"Do the very members of my household&mdash;those
who call themselves my friends&mdash;forget that, spite
of all my trials, and all my privations, I am still the
King of France?"</p>

<p>"Sire," murmured the one upon whom his eye
had rested as he spoke, "it is because we are
devoted heart and soul to your Majesty that you
see us in this mortal anxiety. In losing you we
should lose everything; but since it is your command
that we should tell you all, it is our duty to obey.
The citizens of Paris are in a state of consternation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[pg 407]</span>
All your loyal subjects fear for your life. Tears and
sobs are to be heard on every side. You are in the
hands of Italians&mdash;of the countrymen and countrywomen
of Catherine de Medicis; and everything is
to be apprehended from people who know so well
how to work out their ends by poison."</p>

<p>"Is it come to this?" gasped the young King as
he sank back upon his chair. "Am I to die mocked
as I have lived? A sovereign without a will, a king
without a throne, a monarch without a crown? The
tool of needy adventurers and intriguing women?
the victim of treachery and murder?" and the
credulous boy leant his head upon his hands, and
wept.</p>

<p>Before the chamber of Louis was closed that
night upon his confidential friends it was decided
that the weapon of the assassin and the axe of the
executioner should rid him of Concini and his wife;
and that his mother should be banished from the
Court.</p>

<p>When the King awoke on the following morning
De Luynes was already at his bedside, in order to
counteract by his specious arguments and gloomy
prognostics any less violent and criminal decision at
which his royal master might have arrived during
the solitude and silence of the night; and ably did
the tempter perform his task. An increase of
devotion and respect was skilfully blended with an
apparent anxiety and alarm, which flattered the self-esteem
and vanity of Louis, at the same time that
they renewed all the terrors of the previous evening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>[pg 408]</span>
His feeble remonstrances were overruled; his filial
misgivings were stifled; and the favourite at length
quitted his presence satisfied that he would not
seek to retract his orders.</p>

<p>The advice of De Luynes was not needed when
he implored his Majesty to observe the greatest
circumspection until the important design was
carried out, for, naturally timid and suspicious, Louis
was already an adept in dissimulation; and the idea
instantly occurred to him that should Concini or
Leonora once have cause to apprehend that he
meditated their destruction, his own life would pay
the forfeit. De Luynes, however, strange as it may
appear, was less discreet, and admitted so many
persons to his confidence that rumours of their peril
reached the ears of the Queen-mother and her
favourites; but, unhappily for themselves, they
despised both the King and his minion too much to
attach any importance to the idea of danger from
such a quarter. Satisfied that Louis still pursued
his boyish sports, which as a measure of precaution
he had resumed apparently with greater enthusiasm
than ever, and that he could not leave the capital
without the express permission of Marie de Medicis
herself, they considered themselves safe; and thus
lulled into a fatal security, took no measures to
avert the impending catastrophe.<a id="footnotetag277" name="footnotetag277"></a><a href="#footnote277">[277]</a></p>

<p>The mind is a species of moral daguerreotype;
surround it with images of order, virtue, and beauty,
enlighten it by the sun of truth, and every object
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[pg 409]</span>
will trace itself unerringly upon the surface, remaining
engraven there for ever; but, on the other hand, if
the accessories be evil, it will in like manner become
invested with the attributes amid which it exists, and
the luminous spark will be darkened by the pernicious
atoms that have been suffered to collect about it.</p>

<p>Louis XIII of France was at this moment an
illustration of the principle. His boyhood and his
youth had alike been familiar only with intrigue,
deception, jealousy, and falsehood. His habits were
at once saturnine and selfish; his temper gloomy and
distrustful, and his feelings cold and self-centred.
His youth had already shadowed forth his manhood.</p>

<p>De Luynes was aware that he should experience
little difficulty in finding the man he sought, when
he assured his royal master that he knew one bold
enough to attempt the life of Concini; his selection
was indeed already made, and he had no misgiving
of a refusal. The Baron de Vitry, captain of the
bodyguard then on duty at the Louvre, and who was
peculiarly obnoxious to the Italian favourite, returned
his hate so openly that he refused to salute him as
he entered and quitted the palace, and publicly
declared that no command, come from whence it
might, should ever compel him to do so.<a id="footnotetag278" name="footnotetag278"></a><a href="#footnote278">[278]</a> De Luynes
no sooner felt that a man of this determination might
be useful than he sought his friendship; and now
that the conspiracy had become ripe, he sent to
invite him to an interview, during which he assured
him that the King had great confidence not only in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[pg 410]</span>
his affection for his person, but also in his inclination
to serve him when the opportunity should present
itself; that he believed him capable of great deeds,
and that he would confide his life to him.</p>

<p>De Vitry was a soldier of fortune, dependent upon
his sword, and the little sentiment that he possessed
was at once awakened by so unexpected a communication.
As a natural consequence, therefore, he
protested his readiness to risk life and limb at the
pleasure of his Majesty; and declared that, whatever
might be the nature of the service required of him,
he would execute it without hesitation or remonstrance.</p>

<p>On receiving this pledge, De Luynes, after exacting
an oath of secrecy and obedience, beckoned to
his companion to follow him; and throwing open
the door of the royal closet, which was never closed
against him, he introduced De Vitry without further
preamble into the presence of the King.</p>

<p>"M. de Vitry," said Louis, when the favourite
had explained the errand of the captain of the royal
guard, "I thank you for your zeal, and I have faith
in its sincerity. The Marchal d'Ancre has conspired
against my life. He must sleep to-morrow night in
the Bastille."</p>

<p>"He shall be there, Sire, should the fortress still
possess a bolt to draw upon him, if it be your royal
will that I accomplish his arrest."</p>

<p>"M. de Vitry, you will have earned a marshal's
<i>bton</i>."</p>

<p>"Sire!" exclaimed the soldier, dropping on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>[pg 411]</span>
knee before the King, "I will obey you to the
death."</p>

<p>"I must never again be insulted by his presence,"
said Louis, fixing his eyes, which flashed for an
instant with a threatening light, full upon the upturned
countenance of De Vitry. "Rise, Sir," he
added as he turned suddenly away, "I have perfect
confidence in your fidelity."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;should he resist, Sire?" asked the new
conspirator, anxious not to exceed his orders.</p>

<p>"Kill him!" replied De Luynes in a hoarse
whisper. "Do you not yet understand how you are
to earn your <i>bton</i>?"</p>

<p>The two friends exchanged glances; and after a
profound bow, De Vitry withdrew from the royal
closet.</p>

<p>The indiscretion of De Luynes had been so great
that a rumour of the perilous position of Concini did
not fail to reach the ears of Richelieu. We have
already stated that on his arrival at Court the
Bishop of Luon had been warmly patronized by
the Italian favourite, who openly declared that he
had found a man capable of giving a lesson <i> tutti
barboni</i>,<a id="footnotetag279" name="footnotetag279"></a><a href="#footnote279">[279]</a> thereby alluding to the ancient ministers of
Henri IV;<a id="footnotetag280" name="footnotetag280"></a><a href="#footnote280">[280]</a> and that it was moreover through his
agency that Marie de Medicis had appointed the
wily prelate Secretary of State; but Richelieu was
too subtle a diplomatist to allow a feeling of
gratitude to interfere with his advancement; and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[pg 412]</span>
consequently no sooner ascertained beyond all
possibility of mistake that his two patrons, the
Queen-mother and her favourite, were about to
succumb to the insidious attack of De Luynes, than,
anxious to retain office, he hastened to despatch his
brother-in-law, M. de Pontcourlay, to the latter,
with instructions to offer his services, and to assure
him that he had only consented to accept the charge
which he then held in order that he might through
this medium be enabled to devote himself to the
interests of the King.</p>

<p>Anxious to strengthen his party, De Luynes
received the advances of Richelieu with great
courtesy, although he was far from desiring the
co-operation of so dangerous an ally; and a day or
two subsequently the treacherous prelate was introduced
into the private closet of Louis; where, in
addition to his previous professions, he went so far
as to pledge himself to the young monarch that
he would give him timely intimation of the most
hidden designs of the Queen-mother and the
Marchal d'Ancre.</p>

<p>It was at length decided that Concini should die
on Sunday the 23rd of April; but as the day
approached Louis became terrified at his own
audacity, and it required all the influence of De
Luynes and his brothers to prevent his retracting
the fatal order which he had given. He was too
young coldly to contemplate treachery and murder,
and withal so helpless in the event of failure, that
his conscience and his timidity alike urged him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>[pg 413]</span>
revoke the sentence of the unsuspecting victim;
nor was he ultimately induced to persevere, until
reminded by his insidious advisers that too many
persons were now aware of his intentions for them
to remain secret, should their execution be long
delayed.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, although every preparation
had been made, Concini was saved by a
mere accident. He chanced to be delayed as he was
about to leave his house, and did not in consequence
reach the Louvre until the King had quitted the
palace in order to attend mass at the chapel of the
Petit Bourbon. Instead, therefore, of proceeding in
the first place to the apartments of his Majesty, as
had been anticipated, the Marchal no sooner
ascertained that Louis was already gone than he
hastened to pay his respects to the Queen-mother,
for which purpose he took a different direction.
This unexpected impediment greatly embarrassed
the conspirators, who, secure of success, had displayed
an extraordinary want of caution. In addition
to his brother M. du Hallier, Vitry had assembled a
great number of his friends in the court of the palace,
who, although they all wore their cloaks, had nevertheless
allowed it to be perceived that they carried
pistols in their belts, contrary to the edict forbidding
the use of such weapons within the limits of the
royal residence. In compliance with the commands
of Louis himself, moreover, the bodyguard were
under arms; and the unwonted movement in the
immediate vicinity of his apartments was so evident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>[pg 414]</span>
and withal so threatening in its aspect, that a rumour
soon spread through the palace that some serious
enterprise was in contemplation.</p>

<p>And meanwhile the young monarch was on his
knees before the altar of his God, praying, or seeming
to pray; asking that his trespasses might be
forgiven as he forgave those who trespassed against
him; although he anticipated that before his return
to his desecrated palace-home the deed of blood
would be accomplished. Suddenly, however, his
devotions were interrupted by the entrance of De
Vitry into the chapel, who, approaching De Luynes,
whispered to him the tidings of his disappointment.
In another second the lips of the favourite touched
the ear of his royal master, to whom he hurriedly
murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, the man you wot of is now in the apartment
of the Queen-mother. What do you decide?
All is in readiness."</p>

<p>"Touch him not in her presence as you value
your lives," was the agitated reply; "we shall find
him at the Louvre on our return."</p>

<p>A brief interval of suspense succeeded. The
prelate who had officiated then uttered the final
blessing; and as the carriage which contained the
King and his favourite entered the palace by one
gate, that of Concini quitted it by another. Inexperienced
as he was, however, Louis at once perceived
that he was no longer in a position to recede;
and hasty orders were issued to Vitry and his friends
to accomplish their fatal project on the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[pg 415]</span>
day, while the King at the same time secretly commanded
that the light horse of his bodyguard,
and the members of his household, should be in
attendance at an early hour in the morning, as well
as a coach and six, at the entrance of the grand
gallery. The pretext for this arrangement was a
hunting-party; but its actual intention was to ensure
and protect the King's flight, should his purpose
prematurely transpire or prove abortive. And
meanwhile Marie de Medicis slept, wholly unsuspicious
of the change which was about to be
effected in her fortunes!</p>

<p>There is something singularly appalling in all the
circumstances which formed the prelude to this contemplated
tragedy. Hitherto the Queen-mother
had created dangers for herself&mdash;had started at
shadows&mdash;and distrusted even those who sought to
serve her; while her son, silent, saturnine, and inert,
had patiently submitted to the indignities and insults
which had been heaped upon him, as though he were
either unconscious or reckless of their extent; and
the Italian adventurer had braved his enemies, and
appeared to defy fate itself. Now, however, when
the blow was about to be struck, when the ball and
the blade were alike ready to do their deadly office,
all the principal personages in the bloody drama had
suddenly assumed new characters. Marie slept;
the boy-King had become the head of a conspiracy;
and the Marchal d'Ancre, enriched and ennobled
beyond the wildest dreams of his ambition, was
preparing to quit the country of his adoption, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>[pg 416]</span>
to seek rest and peace in his own land. Another
month, perhaps another week, and he would have
left France, probably for ever.</p>

<p>History presents few such anomalies; and it
appears scarcely credible that so ill-organized a plot,
hatched, moreover, under the very eyes of those
who were to become its victims, and revealed to
upwards of a score of persons, many of whom were
incited to join it from merely venal motives, should
ever have attained its accomplishment. The fiat
had, however, gone forth; and the unfortunate
Concini, whose tragical fate compels sympathy
despite all his faults, entered the court of the
Louvre at ten o'clock in the morning of the 24th
of April 1617, there to meet his death.</p>

<p>An hour or two after dawn one of the gentlemen
of the royal bedchamber announced that the King
having been indisposed throughout the night, the
great gates of the Louvre were to remain closed,
and the public excluded, in order that his Majesty
might not be disturbed. This order did not, however,
affect the Marchal d'Ancre, as he was no
sooner seen to approach, followed by a numerous
retinue of gentlemen, and attended by several of
his friends, than the bolts were withdrawn, and he
was permitted to pass the barrier, which was instantly
closed again, to the exclusion of the greater
number of his suite. A man who had been stationed
over the gate then waved his hat three times above
his head, upon which De Vitry, who had until that
moment been seated in one of the windows of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>[pg 417]</span>
guard-room calmly conversing with the officers
on duty, immediately rose, and drawing his cloak
closely about him, hurried down the staircase, at
the foot of which he was joined as if accidentally
by Du Hallier and others of the conspirators,
who, apparently engaged in conversation, slowly
approached their intended victim. Among the persons
who surrounded Concini there chanced to be
several who were acquainted with De Vitry, and
greatly to his annoyance he was compelled to allow
the Marchal to pass on while he returned their greetings;
in a few moments, however, he again found
himself at liberty, when he discovered that amid
the crowd he had lost sight of the Italian.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" he inquired hurriedly of one of
his confederates.</p>

<p>"Yonder," was the reply; "he has stopped at
the foot of the bridge to read a letter."</p>

<p>De Vitry sprang towards his prey; and as Concini,
absorbed in his occupation, still read on, he felt
the grasp of a strong hand upon his arm, and on
looking up he saw the Captain of the Guard standing
at his side. Before he had time to inquire the
meaning of this affront, De Vitry had already uttered
the ominous words, "I arrest you in the King's
name."</p>

<p>"Arrest me!" exclaimed the Marchal, with
astonishment, as he clutched the hilt of his sword.</p>

<p>"Yes, you," replied De Vitry haughtily; and while
he spoke he made a signal, which was instantly
responded to by the simultaneous report of three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>[pg 418]</span>
pistol-shots. As the sounds ceased Concini dropped
upon his knees, and fell against the parapet of the
bridge. Several weapons were then thrust into his
body; and finally De Vitry, with wanton and revolting
cruelty, gave him so violent a kick that he extended
his body at full length upon the pavement, where it
was immediately pilfered of every article of value;
among other things, diamonds of great price and
notes of hand to a large amount were abstracted
from the pockets of his vest.<a id="footnotetag281" name="footnotetag281"></a><a href="#footnote281">[281]</a></p>

<p>A few of his followers endeavoured to interpose;
but in a second or two all was over, and they were
warned by the bystanders instantly to sheathe their
swords, and to beware of opposing the orders of the
King. They had scarcely had time to obey this
bidding when Louis presented himself at the window
of a closet adjoining the guard-room, to which,
from its height, he was obliged to be lifted by M.
d'Ornano;<a id="footnotetag282" name="footnotetag282"></a><a href="#footnote282">[282]</a> there, by the advice of those about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>[pg 419]</span>
him, the young King appeared with a smile upon
his face; and as the members of the cabal raised a
cry of "Vive le Roi!" he shouted to his Captain
of the Guard, "I thank you, Vitry; now I am really
a King." Then showing himself, sword in hand,
successively at each window of the guard-room, he
cried out to the soldiers who were posted beneath,
"To arms, comrades, to arms!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile De Vitry, by the direction of De
Luynes, proceeded to the hall occupied by the bodyguard
of the Queen-mother, and demanded their
weapons, which they refused to deliver up without an
express order to that effect from their own officers;
upon which the latter were commanded in the name
of the King to withdraw their men, and to remain
in the antechamber of their mistress. The royal
guards then took possession of all the approaches to
the Louvre; and horsemen were despatched with
instructions to traverse the streets of the capital,
and to apprise the citizens of the death of Concini.
A dense crowd soon collected in the court of the
Louvre, and cries of "Vive le Roi!" resounded on
all sides.</p>

<p>A murder had been committed, and the ovation
was one which would only have befitted a victory.
Louis XIII had proclaimed himself a King, and the
hand with which he grasped his sceptre was steeped
in blood. Louis "the Just"&mdash;we append to his
baptismal appellation that which was gravely conferred
upon him on this occasion by both clergy and
laity&mdash;stood an undisguised assassin and a moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span>
matricide before the people who were about to be
subjected to his rule.<a id="footnotetag283" name="footnotetag283"></a><a href="#footnote283">[283]</a></p>

<p>Within an hour not only was the Queen-mother
a prisoner in her own apartments, but the seals were
restored to M. du Vair, and Barbin was in the
Bastille <i>in the most rigorous confinement</i>.<a id="footnotetag284" name="footnotetag284"></a><a href="#footnote284">[284]</a> These
precautionary measures taken, Louis proceeded to
the grand gallery leaning upon the arm of De
Luynes; and on perceiving M. de Brienne, who
with many other nobles had hastened to present
his respects and congratulations (!) to the young
monarch, he was so little able to control his delight
that, without awaiting the salutation of the Count,
he exclaimed triumphantly, "I am now a King, and
no one can take precedence of me." <a id="footnotetag285" name="footnotetag285"></a><a href="#footnote285">[285]</a></p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the King encountered the
Bishop of Luon-Richelieu, whose confident deportment
betokened his conviction of a gracious reception,
as he prepared to pay his court in his turn;
but the compliments of the prelate were abruptly
broken in upon by an imperative command to quit
the palace, and the announcement of his discontinuance
in office. No wonder that Richelieu murmured
under his breath at this unlooked-for severity; for
he had in truth that very morning striven to merit
the royal smile&mdash;striven against conscience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>[pg 421]</span>
however, and all the holiest and most sacred feelings
of humanity. One of the friends of Concini, alarmed
by the ominous proceedings at the Louvre, and
instinctively persuaded that the life of the Italian
was threatened, had hurriedly despatched a letter to
Richelieu, in which he stated his reasons for the
apprehensions he expressed; and urged the prelate,
in memory of the many services for which he was
indebted to the intended victim, to interpose his
influence in his behalf, and to endeavour to avert
the blow. The Bishop, who had not yet left his
bed, glanced over the missive, thrust it beneath his
pillow, desired the messenger to withdraw, and
remained quietly in his chamber until he was
apprised by the tumult without that all was over.
Then, and not till then, he hastened to the Louvre;
where we have already stated the nature of his
reception.</p>

<p>As the throng of nobles increased, and crowded
about the King so as considerably to inconvenience
him, he was lifted upon a billiard-table, from which
extraordinary eminence he received their compliments
and congratulations upon the murder to
which he had been accessory only an hour before;
and which the First President of the Parliament of
Paris (whose extreme haste to pay his court to his
new master was such that, being unable immediately
to procure a carriage, he proceeded to the
Louvre on foot) designated <i>his happy deliverance</i>.<a id="footnotetag286" name="footnotetag286"></a><a href="#footnote286">[286]</a>
Nothing, in short, but plumed hats sweeping the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>[pg 422]</span>
marble floor, flexile forms bending to the earth, and
lips wreathed in smiles, was to be seen in the
kingly hall in which Henri IV had loved to discuss
grave topics with his sturdy minister, the Duc de
Sully, and which Marie de Medicis, in her day of
pride and power, had enriched with the glorious
productions of her immortal <i>protg</i>, Rubens the
painter-prince, as she was wont to call him. None
cared to remember at that moment that Henry the
Great was in his grave, and that his royal widow
had been sacrificed to the insatiable ambition and
the quenchless hate of a low-born minion.</p>

<p>But it is now time that we should return to the
Queen-mother.</p>

<p>Alarmed by the report of firearms within the
boundary of the palace, Marie de Medicis, who had
not yet completed her toilet, desired Caterina
Selvaggio to throw open one of the windows, and
to demand the cause of so singular and unpardonable
an infraction of the law. She was obeyed;
and the Italian waiting-woman no sooner perceived
De Vitry advancing below the apartments of her
royal mistress than she inquired of him what had
occurred.</p>

<p>"The Marchal d'Ancre has been shot," was his
abrupt reply.</p>

<p>"Shot!" echoed Caterina; "and by whom?"</p>

<p>"By myself," said De Vitry composedly; "and
by the command of the King."</p>

<p>"Madame!" exclaimed the terrified attendant, as
she rushed to the side of the Queen-mother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>[pg 423]</span>
"M. le Marchal has been killed by order of his
Majesty."</p>

<p>Marie de Medicis started from her seat; her
cheeks were blanched, her lips quivered, and she
wrung her hands convulsively, as she gasped out,
"I have reigned seven years. I must now think
only of a crown in heaven."</p>

<p>Her attendants, stupified with terror, rapidly
gathered round her; and ere long she learnt that
her guards had been disarmed, and replaced by
those of the King. She listened vaguely to each
successive report, and paced the room with rapid
but uncertain steps. At length she exclaimed
vehemently, "I do not regret that my son should
have taken the life of Concini, if he believed it
necessary to the safety of his kingdom; but his
distrust of myself in concealing such a project from
my knowledge is more than I can bear."</p>

<p>When the first violence of her emotion had subsided
she sank into a seat, and with clasped hands
and drooping head appeared to be absorbed in
deep and bitter thought; for at intervals the blood
mounted to her brow and burned there for a time,
after which she again became pale as ashes, and as
motionless as a corpse. She was still in this attitude
when one of her confidential servants imprudently
approached her, and inquired how the
melancholy event was to be communicated to the
Marchale d'Ancre? "Perhaps," he incautiously
suggested, "your Majesty will condescend to
acquaint her with it yourself."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>[pg 424]</span>
Marie de Medicis suddenly raised her hand,
swept back her dishevelled hair from her face, and
fixing her flashing eyes upon the officious gentleman,
passionately replied, "I have other things to
attend to at this moment. If no one can tell the
Marchale that her husband has been killed, <i>let
them sing it to her</i>. Let me never again hear the
name of those people. I told them long ago that
they would do right to return to Italy. Yes," she
continued, more particularly addressing the Dowager
Duchess of Guise, the Princesse de Conti, and the
other ladies who were standing near her, "they
have at last accomplished my ruin. I foresaw it; I
warned them, but they would not be convinced. I
told Concini that he had no time to lose, but with
his habitual self-sufficiency he declared repeatedly
that the King became more courteous to him every
day. I was not deceived, however; I charged him
not to trust to appearances, for that Louis never
said all he thought; he disregarded my words,
and he has now involved me in his own destruction." <a id="footnotetag287" name="footnotetag287"></a><a href="#footnote287">[287]</a></p>

<p>After this outburst of temper no one ventured to
intrude even a remark upon the Queen-mother, who
once more fell into a deep reverie, from which
she, however, ultimately aroused herself to demand
M. de Bressieux.<a id="footnotetag288" name="footnotetag288"></a><a href="#footnote288">[288]</a> The equerry immediately
approached.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>[pg 425]</span>
"Go, sir," she said, "to his Majesty, and request
that he will grant me an interview."</p>

<p>Her command was obeyed, and in a few
moments De Bressieux found himself in the
presence of the King, to whom he delivered his
message.</p>

<p>"I am occupied at present," was the cold reply;
"and the visit of the Queen must be delayed until a
better opportunity. Tell her, however, from me
that I shall always honour her, and that I feel
towards her all the sentiments of a good son; but
God willed that I should be born a King, and I am
resolved henceforth to govern for myself. It is
desirable that the Queen should have no other
guards but mine. Let her know that such is my
will."</p>

<p>Marie de Medicis listened incredulously when,
on his return to her apartment, the equerry
announced the failure of his mission. She would
not comprehend that the stripling who had until
that day shrunk before her frown could thus suddenly
have acquired the necessary courage to brave
her authority; and once more M. de Bressieux was
instructed to urge her request upon the King. As
he reached the royal anteroom her envoy encountered
De Luynes, who dreaded nothing so much as a
meeting between the mother and son, which could
scarcely fail to prove fatal to himself; and he
accordingly reported the return of the applicant in
a manner which induced Louis to exclaim impatiently,
"If he is here by desire of the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>[pg 426]</span>
his mistress, tell him that there is nothing to apprehend,
as I shall treat her well." <a id="footnotetag289" name="footnotetag289"></a><a href="#footnote289">[289]</a></p>

<p>Still Marie de Medicis would not be discouraged.
She felt that in order to avert the ruin which impended
over her she must put every instant to its
use; and accordingly M. de Bressieux was a third
time despatched to solicit in still more urgent terms
that she might be permitted to see his Majesty,
were it only for a few moments. But, unfortunately
for the agonized Queen, the triumphant favourite
was as fully aware as herself of the value of time at
so critical a juncture; and he had accordingly profited
so well by the opportunities which he was
enabled to command, that on this last occasion the
Marquis was rudely ordered to abstain from all
further intrusion upon his Majesty unless he wished
to repent his pertinacity within the walls of a
prison.</p>

<p>Convinced at last that there was no hope through
her own agency of effecting her object, the Queen-mother
next endeavoured to secure its accomplishment
through the medium of her daughter-in-law,
the two Princesses, and the Duc d'Anjou; but
when she summoned them to her apartment, she
was informed that each and all had been forbidden
to hold any intercourse with herself until the pleasure
of the King should be made known.</p>

<p>The despair of the unhappy Marie was at its
height; and as she paced her apartment, and
approached a window looking upon the gardens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[pg 427]</span>
she discovered that a bridge which she had caused
to be constructed for the purpose of reaching them
without being compelled to traverse the galleries of
the palace, was already in process of demolition;
while she was also made aware that every other
avenue leading to her apartments was strictly
guarded, and thus she saw herself a prisoner in her
own palace and entirely at the mercy of her son's
advisers. Even yet she struggled against so cruel a
conviction; and, eager to test its truth, sent to
desire the presence of one of her confidential friends.
Her messenger was not, however, permitted to
accomplish his errand, but returned with the heart-sickening
intelligence that thenceforward her Majesty
would not be permitted to hold any communication,
save with the members of her own immediate household,
without the express sanction of the King.<a id="footnotetag290" name="footnotetag290"></a><a href="#footnote290">[290]</a></p>

<p>While the Queen-mother was still writhing under
this new indignity, the unfortunate Leonora, who
had been apprised of the murder of her husband,
rushed into the apartment, and flinging herself at
the feet of her royal foster-sister, implored her protection
for herself and her young son; but sudden
adversity had steeled the heart of Marie de Medicis,
and sternly upbraiding her former favourite as the
cause of her own overthrow, she refused to afford
her any aid, and commanded her instantly to retire.
The wretched woman obeyed without comment or
remonstrance; and having regained her own apartment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>[pg 428]</span>
which was immediately contiguous to that of
the Queen, she hastened to conceal the Crown jewels
which were in her keeping between the mattresses
of her bed, with the exception of the rings, which
were of great value, and which she habitually wore.
This task accomplished, she threw herself upon her
miserable couch to await in trembling and in tears
the next act of the frightful tragedy in which she
was called upon to play so conspicuous a part. Her
suspense was not of long duration, as only a few
minutes had elapsed when a tumult was heard without,
amid which cries of "Vive le Roi!" "Vive
M. de Luynes!" and "Death to the Italian!" were
distinctly audible.</p>

<p>Leonora bounded from her recumbent position
like a lioness at bay. Her parted lips were bloodless,
her breath came quick and hard, and her heart
heaved by its violent pulsations the rich velvet of
the robe in which she was attired.</p>

<p>"My child!" she at length gasped out, as her
attendants gathered about her&mdash;"save my child!
He at least is guiltless."</p>

<p>The appeal was not made in vain. M. du
Rouvray<a id="footnotetag291" name="footnotetag291"></a><a href="#footnote291">[291]</a> took her little son, the Comte de la Pna,
by the hand, raised him in his arms that his lips
might once more touch those of his mother, and
then, without uttering a syllable, led him from the
apartment. In another instant the Norman noble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>[pg 429]</span>
was once more at her side. "The child is in sure
hands," he said hurriedly; "and now, Madame, to
provide for your own safety. Follow me&mdash;you
have no time to spare."</p>

<p>It was, however, already too late; for as Du
Rouvray ceased speaking, De Vitry, still reeking with
the blood of Concini, stood upon the threshold of
the chamber, attended by a troop of halberdiers.</p>

<p>"You are my prisoner, Madame," he exclaimed
harshly: "prepare to accompany me to the
Bastille."</p>

<p>"I am ready, Sir," replied the Marchale, with
the composure of utter despair, "All is as it should
be. The murderer of the husband is well fitted to
be the gaoler of the wife."</p>

<p>The rings belonging to the Crown were then removed
from the fingers of the Marquise; and upon
her refusal to reveal where the remainder of the
jewels were secreted, her apartments were strictly
searched; and not only were the royal ornaments
carried off by De Vitry and his companions, but also
every other article of value which fell into their hands.
While this unmanly outrage was going on around
her, the Marchale d'Ancre passively permitted her
women to fasten her mantle, and to adjust her mask
and hood; her thoughts were evidently elsewhere.
Within a few yards of where she was then seated,
and within hearing of the tumult occasioned by the
reckless insolence of the men-at-arms by whom she
was surrounded, her foster-sister, the playmate of
her girlhood, the friend of her youth, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>[pg 430]</span>
protectress of her latter years&mdash;whose tears she
had so often wiped away, whose sorrows she had
so often soothed, and whose hopes and fears she
had equally shared throughout so long a period&mdash;remained
cold and unmoved by her misery. It was
a bitter pang: and drops of anguish, wrung from
the deepest recesses of a bursting heart, fell large
and heavy upon the cheek of the new-made widow
and the abandoned favourite, and moistened her
clasped hands. None, however, heeded her agony;
each of her attendants, whatever might have been
the previous attachment of all to her person, was
absorbed by her own terrors; while the strangers
who had invaded her privacy were eager, under the
specious pretext of performing their duty to the
King, to avail themselves to the uttermost of so
favourable an opportunity of furthering their individual
interests.</p>

<p>At length all was over: every cabinet and chest
had been ransacked to its deepest recesses; every
article of use or ornament had been displaced in
search of plunder; and the wretched Leonora was
warned that it was time to depart. She rose silent
and rigid; and as De Vitry preceded her from the
room, his guards closed up behind her. A carriage
was in waiting at the foot of the staircase by which
she descended; the twilight was rapidly deepening
into night, and her melancholy path was lighted at
intervals by the torches of the numerous attendants
who were hurrying through the corridors in the service
of their several employers. The long dark shadows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>[pg 431]</span>
of the Louvre lay heavy on the dull pavement of
the court, save where they were broken at intervals
by the resinous flambeaux which glared and
flickered against the walls of the building. All
looked wild, and sad, and strange; and not one
kindly accent fell upon the ear of the unhappy
captive as she was hurried onward. A few harsh
words were uttered in a tone of authority: she was
lifted into the conveyance which had been prepared
for her: the cavalcade slowly traversed the enclosure;
and then as the iron gates of the palace
were passed, the horses were lashed into a gallop;
and in less than an hour the life-long companion
of Marie de Medicis, husbandless, childless, and
friendless, was an occupant of the gloomy prison-chamber
which had recently been vacated by the
Prince de Cond.</p>

<p>The noise created by the entrance of the new
prisoner, the clashing of arms, the grating of the
heavy portcullis, as it groaned and strained in its
ascent, the dull fall of the drawbridge, the voices of
men, and the rattling of wheels, awakened the
Prince; who, with the natural weariness of a
captive, had already retired to rest. Summoning
an attendant he demanded to know the cause of the
disturbance.</p>

<p>"It is M. de Vitry, Monseigneur," was the
reply; "who has just transferred the Marchale
d'Ancre to the safe keeping of the
governor."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the Prince, as he once more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>[pg 432]</span>
settled himself to sleep; "I have now one enemy
the less." <a id="footnotetag292" name="footnotetag292"></a><a href="#footnote292">[292]</a></p>

<p>This rapid succession of misfortunes produced an
extraordinary effect upon the sensitive organization
of Leonora Galiga. As we have already hinted,
she had for a considerable period suffered under
mental hallucination; and the disease had latterly
fastened so tenaciously upon her system that she
had even shunned the presence of the Queen,
believing that every eye which rested on her
produced some baneful result; while her very
attendants were dismissed from her presence when
they had terminated their duties, and she thus
remained hour after hour in solitude, brooding over
the sickly fancies of her disordered brain. The
sight of her husband's murderer had, however,
instantly and for ever restored the healthful tone of
her mind. She did not weep, for she had already
exhausted all her tears; she asked no mercy, for
she was aware that, whatever might be her fate, she
was alike prejudged and pre-condemned; but she
resigned herself passively into the hands of her
persecutors, with a Spartan firmness which she
maintained to the last hour of her existence.</p>

<p>Who shall venture to follow her to her prison-cell,
and to trace the tide of back-flowing thought
which rolled like a receding wave from the present
to the past? Now, indeed, she left little behind
her to regret. From the husband to whom she had
once been devoted with a love which blinded her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>[pg 433]</span>
all his errors and to all his egotism, she had, during
the last two years, been almost utterly estranged;
her first-born and idolized daughter was in her
grave; the royal friend and almost relative, to
whom she had clung from her youth up, had refused
even a tear to her sufferings, or a shelter to her
peril; her hoarded wealth was in the hands of her
enemies; and of all that she once boasted there
remained only her son. And what might be his
fate?</p>

<p>But memory held wider stores than these; and
who can doubt that throughout that first long night
of captivity they were probed to their very
depths! What palace-pageants&mdash;what closet-conspiracies&mdash;what
struggles for pre-eminence and
power&mdash;what heart-burnings at defeat, and exultation
at success&mdash;must have swept hurricane-like
across her awakened soul, to be forgotten in their
turn as she recalled the childish sports of her early and
hopeful years, under the sunny sky and among the
orange-groves of her native Florence, where, with
her royal playmate, she chased the hours along as
though they were made only for the happy!</p>

<p>Did she sleep the weary and outworn sleep of
the wretched while those sweet and soothing visions
were still busy at her heart? And if so, breathes
there one who would have roused her, whatever
may have been her faults, from such a slumber?</p>

 Henri de Schomberg was the representative of an ancient family
of Meissen established in France. He succeeded his father, Gaspard
de Schomberg, in the government of La Marche, and in 1617 served
in Piedmont. He was also one of the generals of Louis XIII, in
1621 and 1622, and in 1625 was created Marshal of France. He
distinguished himself by defeating the English in the battle of the
Isle de Rh in 1627, and in forcing the defile of Susa in 1629. In
the following year he took Pignerol. He was then despatched to
Languedoc against the rebels, and in 1632 gained the battle of
Castelnaudary, at which the Duc de Montmorency was made
prisoner. For this victory he was invested with the government of
Languedoc. He died in 1633.

 In his <i>History of the Parliament of Paris</i>, Voltaire, whose
party-spirit was ever too ready to betray his judgment, and to obscure
his genius, has not hesitated, in allusion to the arrogant boast of the
Italian adventurer, to express himself thus:&mdash;"This Concini, at this
very time, performed an action which merited a statue. Enriched by
the liberality of Marie de Medicis, he raised at his own expense an
army of between five and six thousand men against the rebels; he
supported France as though she had been his native country." It is
impossible to dwell upon the career of Concini, and not be startled
by so extraordinary an encomium.

 Alphonse d'Ornano, colonel-general of the Corsican troops in
the French service, and himself a native of Corsica, was the son of
San Pietro di Bastelica, a man of low birth, who attained to the rank
of colonel of the Corsican infantry in France, and who married (in
1548) Vanina d'Ornano, the daughter and heiress of one of the most
wealthy nobles in Corsica. The avowed enemy of the Genoese, by
whom himself and his family were proscribed and banished from
their native island, San Pietro strangled his wife with his own hands
on discovering that she had attempted to escape from Marseilles in
order to obtain a revocation of the edict issued by the Genoese in
1563. Alphonse, the son of San Pietro, to whom his very name
had become odious, adopted that of his mother, under which he
rendered important services to Henri IV during the wars of the
League, and by whom he was first appointed lieutenant of the King
in Dauphiny, and subsequently Marshal of France (1595). He died
in 1620, at the age of seventy-two. He was a man of probity, but
had inherited the violent character of his father.

<p>On the return of De Vitry from the Bastille he
found the htel of the Marchal d'Ancre entirely
pillaged, not even excepting the chamber of the
little Comte de la Pna, whose escape having been
prevented, he was also placed under arrest, and left
until the following morning without clothes, food, or
bed. On the morrow, however, the Comte de
Fiesque,<a id="footnotetag293" name="footnotetag293"></a><a href="#footnote293">[293]</a> touched by the extreme beauty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>[pg 435]</span>
desolate condition of the child, and probably
anxious to secure one friend to him in his necessity,
became answerable for his safe keeping; and,
wrapping him in the cloak of one of his lackeys,
he carried him to the Louvre, and introduced him
to the young Queen, informing her Majesty that no
one at Court could dance a <i>branle</i> in such perfection.
Anne of Austria was enchanted with the
beauty of the boy, who had just attained his twelfth
year, and whose intellect was as remarkable as his
person; but giddy, thoughtless, and ever eager for
amusement, the girl-Queen, overlooking the fatal
circumstances in which he was placed, immediately
commanded that he should exhibit his talent; and
the poor fatherless child, whose whole career had
been blighted only a few short hours before, was
compelled to this unseemly display; after which he
was regaled with sweetmeats, and returned to the
custody of his gaolers, by whom he was shortly
afterwards imprisoned in the castle of Nantes.<a id="footnotetag294" name="footnotetag294"></a><a href="#footnote294">[294]</a></p>

<p>While this incredible scene was being enacted in
an apartment of the palace, another of a far more
terrible nature was to be witnessed in the streets
of Paris; but before we describe this, we must
explain all that had passed since the murder of the
Marchal d'Ancre. As we have already stated, the
body was pillaged where it lay; and then, as no
further booty could be anticipated, it was carried
into a small closet attached to the common guard-room,
where it remained until nightfall, when a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>[pg 436]</span>
coarse sheet, for which fifty sous were given, was
folded about it, and it was buried without any
religious ceremony under the organ of the church
of St. Germain l'Auxerrois near the Louvre. A
priest who attempted to chant a funeral-hymn as it
was laid in the earth was compelled to desist, in
order that the place of burial might not be known;
and the flags which had been raised were so
carefully replaced that it was only by secret information
that the spot could possibly have been
discovered. This information was however given;
and early in the morning the pavement was torn up,
and a rope fastened round the neck of the corpse,
which was then dragged through the streets by the
infuriated mob; and the desecrated remains of the
recently powerful favourite were hung by the feet to
a gibbet, dismembered in the most brutal manner,
and finally burned.<a id="footnotetag295" name="footnotetag295"></a><a href="#footnote295">[295]</a></p>

<p>At the close of this tragedy the Baron de Vitry
received the wages of his brutality, and found
himself before sunset a Marshal of France: while
Du Hallier his brother became his successor as
Captain of the Royal Guard; and Persan, the
husband of his sister, who had also assisted in the
massacre of Concini, was recompensed by the
lieutenancy of the Bastille, and entrusted with the
safe keeping of the Prince de Cond. On the same
day it was publicly proclaimed in the streets of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>[pg 437]</span>
Paris that all the relatives and adherents of the
Marchale d'Ancre were forthwith to leave the
capital, and that the Sieur de Vitry had acted
throughout the late execution by the express command
of the King; the ministers who had recently
held office under the Queen-mother were dismissed,
and those whom she had displaced were restored to
power; De Luynes was formally invested with
the confiscated property of Concini; and a new
Government was organized which had for its leading
object the subversion of all previously concerted
measures.<a id="footnotetag296" name="footnotetag296"></a><a href="#footnote296">[296]</a></p>

<p>The death of Concini no sooner became known
in the provinces than the Duc de Mayenne resigned
Soissons and all the other towns and fortresses
throughout his government into the hands of the
King. Both parties suspended hostilities; and the
royal troops and those of the insurgents drank
and feasted together in a general rejoicing. This
example was followed by the army in Champagne;
and on every side the rebel Princes declared their
readiness to offer their submission to the King.
The moment was a perilous one for De Luynes,
but to Louis it afforded only triumph and exultation;
and ere long the self-exiled nobles reappeared in the
capital, where they were graciously received. On
the 12th of May a declaration was registered by
the Parliament in which their past offences were
pardoned, and they were assured that thenceforward
they would be held as good and loyal subjects to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>[pg 438]</span>
Crown; while no single exception was made save in
the person of the Prince de Cond, who was still
retained a prisoner in the Bastille, and who
appeared to be totally forgotten by his former
adherents.</p>

<p>Rendered confident by this increase of strength,
Louis remained inflexible to the tears and prayers
of his mother, and readily suffered himself to be
persuaded by those about him that she had, in
conjunction with Concini, determined to take his
life by poison in order to place the Duc d'Anjou
upon the throne. In vain did the estimable
Marquise de Guercheville throw herself at his feet,
and offer the most solemn assurances of the
innocence of her unhappy mistress: she was
listened to with impatience, and dismissed with an
abruptness which left no room for hope.<a id="footnotetag297" name="footnotetag297"></a><a href="#footnote297">[297]</a> Meanwhile
the captivity of Marie de Medicis became
each day more irksome, through the unrestrained
insolence of De Vitry, who caused her apartments to
be searched by the officers under his command, her
chests to be emptied, and even her bed to be
displaced. The Queen devoured her mortification,
and bore the insult in silence; but Madame de
Guercheville could not restrain her indignation, and
insisted upon learning the reason for such an
outrage.</p>

<p>"I am ordered to ascertain, Madame," was the
reply of the individual to whom she addressed
herself, "if there be not a cask of powder in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>[pg 439]</span>
apartments destined to destroy the King who sleeps
above."</p>

<p>"Let them obey their orders," said Marie coldly;
"their employers are capable of even more than this." <a id="footnotetag298" name="footnotetag298"></a><a href="#footnote298">[298]</a></p>

<p>As she learnt each successive arrival at Court,
the unfortunate Princess trusted from day to day
that her position would be ameliorated through the
influence of some of her former friends; but until
the Duc de Rohan reached the capital none of the
great nobles appeared to remember her existence.
Well might the Duke exclaim when he learnt how
utterly friendless she had become in her adversity,
"There are few generous and bold enough to
cleave to the misfortunes of those whom they
honoured in their prosperity." <a id="footnotetag299" name="footnotetag299"></a><a href="#footnote299">[299]</a> He was himself,
however, one of those noble exceptions; and
although he excited the undisguised displeasure of
De Luynes, he persisted in demanding the royal
sanction to pay his respects to the Queen-mother;
an example which was subsequently followed by
Bassompierre, who, being unable to obtain the
permission which he sought, availed himself of the
medium of the Queen's tailor to offer his assurances
of devotion and fidelity to her person, through the
Duchesse de Guise and the Princesse de Conti.<a id="footnotetag300" name="footnotetag300"></a><a href="#footnote300">[300]</a></p>

<p>Weary of her utter isolation in a palace of which
she had so lately been the undisputed mistress, and
where she had received the homage of all by whom
she was approached; heart-sick and disgusted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>[pg 440]</span>
the ingratitude of those whose fortunes had been
her own work; and pining for that rest which she
could never hope to find amid the persecutions to
which she was daily subjected, Marie de Medicis at
length resolved to retire to Moulins in the province
of Bourbon, which was one of her dower-cities; and
she accordingly sent to request the consent of the
King to her departure.</p>

<p>This was precisely what De Luynes had hoped;
and his exultation was consequently great. Her
exile by the command of her son might have
excited a murmur, and he had therefore forborne
from advising such a step; but when it could be
publicly asserted that the Queen-mother was about
to leave the Court for a few months by her own
express desire, not even those who still remained
faithful to her cause would be enabled to resent her
absence. Her demand under such circumstances
could not fail to prove successful; and it was
conceded by Louis himself with the greater alacrity
that her presence as a prisoner in the Louvre was
irksome and painful to a youth whose conscience
was not yet totally seared; and who professed, even
while exposing her from hour to hour to the insults
of his hirelings, to feel towards her "all the sentiments
of a good son."</p>

<p>The contemplated retirement of Marie de
Medicis from the capital soon became publicly
known, and at once decided the measures of
Richelieu. He himself informs us that immediately
after his cold reception by the King he despatched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>[pg 441]</span>
his valet to assure the Queen-mother of his
sympathy in her sorrows, and of his anxiety to
serve her;<a id="footnotetag301" name="footnotetag301"></a><a href="#footnote301">[301]</a> nor could he fail to believe that such
an assurance at such a moment had produced the
desired effect, unconscious as the unfortunate Marie
must necessarily have been of the circumstances
which had induced him to feel for her reverses
when all the other members of the Court were intent
only upon winning the good graces of the monarch
and his favourite. The time was now come, as he
at once saw, to profit by so signal a proof of policy
and forethought; and Richelieu was prepared to
use it with the craft and cleverness which were
destined to shape out his future fortunes. To his
active and ambitious spirit a residence in the capital
in the character of a deposed minister was impossible;
while he equally deprecated the idea of
burying himself in his diocese among the marshes
of Lower Poitou. He resolved, therefore, to share
the exile of the Queen-mother, and by this display of
devotion to gain her confidence; while, at the same
time, he communicated his intention to De Luynes
in a manner which ensured its sanction. Few
words were needed. Ere the conference was at an
end the favourite was aware that no <i>safer</i> person
could be admitted to the privacy of Marie de
Medicis; while Richelieu had, on his side, been
careful to avoid any acknowledgment of the real
motive by which he was influenced.<a id="footnotetag302" name="footnotetag302"></a><a href="#footnote302">[302]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>[pg 442]</span>
"You incur no risk by acceding to his request,
Sire," said De Luynes in a subsequent interview
with the King; "M. de Luon will understand how
to calm the mind of the Queen-mother, and to
advise her as we could wish. He may be the
means of establishing a good understanding between
you; and even should he fail to do this, it will
be easy to compel him to reside in his diocese, or to
banish him to a distant province, should your
Majesty not be satisfied with his conduct."</p>

<p>"It must not be expected," gravely observed
Richelieu in his turn, while negotiating the arrangement,
"that I should act as a Court spy when I
am admitted to the confidence of the Queen; nor
that I should report all which may take place; but
to this I will pledge myself&mdash;that I will immediately
retire to Luon should she refuse to be guided by
my advice, or adopt any resolutions inimical to
the interests of the King."</p>

<p>It would have been unreasonable to require more,
and with a thrill of pleasure to which she had been
long a stranger, the beguiled Queen learnt that the
Bishop of Luon-Richelieu had received the royal
permission to devote himself to her fallen fortunes.
This was, indeed, more than she had ever ventured
to hope, for she was capable of appreciating to the
utmost the talents of the individual who thus, as she
fondly believed, sacrificed his own interests to her
necessities; and she consequently lost no time in
making him the medium of her communications
with the King. Before her departure she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>[pg 443]</span>
anxious to secure such terms as might tend, in some
degree, to diminish the bitterness of her exile; and
she accordingly availed herself of the services of
her new adherent to convey her wishes to Louis.
These were that she might be permitted to reside
for some days at Blois, until the castle of Moulins,
which had been uninhabited for a considerable time,
could be prepared for her reception; that she might
be informed of the number and identity of those
who would be allowed to follow her in her retreat;
that she might retain unlimited authority in the
place of her residence; that she should be immediately
informed whether it were the pleasure of
the King that she should be left in possession of
the whole of her revenues, or restricted in her
income, in order that she might be prepared to
regulate the expenses of her household accordingly;
and, finally, that her son would accord her an
interview before her departure.</p>

<p>In reply to these demands, Louis, after having
conferred with his favourite, replied that, had circumstances
permitted such a measure, he should not,
during the last few days, have deprived himself of
the happiness of her society, of which he had deeply
felt the privation; but that since it was her wish to
retire from the Court, she was at perfect liberty to
reside at Moulins, or in any other city which she
thought proper to select, and to include in her suite
all the individuals whom she might be desirous of
retaining about her person: that she was fully
authorized to exert the most absolute authority, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>[pg 444]</span>
only in the city, but throughout the province in
which it was situated; and that so far from seeking
to diminish her resources, although they greatly
exceeded those of any previous Queen-Dowager of
France,<a id="footnotetag303" name="footnotetag303"></a><a href="#footnote303">[303]</a> he would willingly augment them should
she deem it necessary, even to his own inconvenience;
while as regarded her desire for a parting
interview, he could not, on his side, suffer her to
leave the capital without assuring her in his own
person of his anxiety for her happiness.<a id="footnotetag304" name="footnotetag304"></a><a href="#footnote304">[304]</a></p>

<p>Despite these professions, however, it was agreed
on both sides that each party should previously
arrange, and submit to the other, the substance of
all that was to pass between them; and in consequence
of this extraordinary arrangement Richelieu
was desired by the Queen-mother to compose her
address to the King, which having been submitted
to the Council and approved, the reply of Louis was
in like manner prepared by the ministers. A flight
of stairs alone separated the mother and the son:
the footsteps of the stripling monarch could be heard
in the apartment of Marie as he passed from one
room to the other; and were not the subject too sad
for ridicule, it would be difficult to suppress a smile
at these puerile and undignified formalities. No
political negotiation was ever conducted, however,
with more circumspection and mutual distrust;
every detail of the interview was regulated beforehand;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>[pg 445]</span>
the two principal actors pledged themselves
to say no more than was set down for them; and
each committed to memory the harangue which was
to be pronounced. The Princesses were to pay their
parting respects to the Queen-mother so soon as she
should have assumed her travelling-dress, but the
nobles and officers of the Court were only to be permitted
to salute her after she had taken leave of the
King; a privilege from which, at her express request,
De Vitry and his brother were, however, excluded.</p>

<p>On the 4th of May, the day fixed for her departure
from the capital, Marie caused her ladies to
dress her with extraordinary care, but at the same
time with extreme simplicity; the slighted mother
and the humbled Queen yet entertained a hope that
the sight of her mourning attire and subdued
deportment might produce their effect upon her son;
and as, at the appointed hour, she left her chamber,
and with words of gratitude and affection joined her
attendants, there was a faint smile upon her lips,
and a tremulous light in her dark eyes which
betrayed her secret trust. The members of her
household were assembled in one of those noble
halls which were enriched by the grand creations
of Jean Goujon,<a id="footnotetag305" name="footnotetag305"></a><a href="#footnote305">[305]</a> and the magnificent tapestried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>[pg 446]</span>
hangings that were subsequently destroyed during
the Revolution; they were grouped together near
the door by which she entered, and, despite every
effort which she made to overcome her emotion,
Marie de Medicis could not suppress a sigh as she
marked how small a space they occupied in that
vast apartment which had so lately been thronged
with princes and nobles, all professedly devoted to
her cause. Suddenly, as she was exchanging a few
words with the Marquise de Guercheville, the royal
bodyguards appeared upon the threshold; and a
page, advancing one step into the hall, announced&mdash;"The
King!"</p>

<p>At the same instant Louis XIII appeared, with
the Duc d'Anjou on his right hand, leaning upon
his favourite, preceded by Cadenet and Brants,
and followed by the Prince de Joinville and Bassompierre.
As he entered the Queen-mother rose and
curtsied profoundly, while the ladies and gentlemen
of her household imitated her example, as they
retired a pace or two behind her. Hitherto the
Queen-mother had exhibited the most perfect composure,
but she no sooner found herself once more
in the presence of her son than she burst into a
passionate flood of tears, which she attempted to
conceal as she approached him by spreading her fan
before her face. Louis moved forward in his turn,
still clinging to De Luynes, but no trace of emotion
was visible in his countenance, which was cold, and
almost careless in its expression.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the unhappy Queen so soon as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>[pg 447]</span>
had recovered her composure, "the tender care
with which I watched over your youth, the efforts
which I made for the preservation of your kingdom,
the dangers which I braved, and which I might
have avoided had I been induced to hazard the
safety of your crown, will justify me before God,
and prove that I have never had any other view
than that of securing your welfare. I have repeatedly
entreated that you would be pleased to
take the reins of government into your own hands,
and relieve me from so heavy a responsibility, but
you considered my services to be necessary, and
commanded their continuance. I have obeyed you,
both because I was bound to respect your will, and
because I felt that it would have been cowardly to
abandon you when you were threatened with
danger.<a id="footnotetag306" name="footnotetag306"></a><a href="#footnote306">[306]</a> If I have failed to meet your wishes, or
have contravened them, I can only entreat of you
to pardon me; and to believe that had you explained
your pleasure it should have been fulfilled. I
rejoice that you are now about to govern your
kingdom in your own person; and I pray God
to grant you every prosperity. I thank you for the
concessions which you have made; and I trust that
you will henceforward act towards me like a good
son and a good sovereign; while I, on my side,
pledge myself that I shall ever continue to be
your very humble and very obedient mother and
servant."</p>

<p>"Madame," replied Louis in a cold and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>[pg 448]</span>
constrained tone, while the Queen was still struggling
to suppress her tears, "I am convinced that you
have always acted with the greatest zeal and
affection. I am perfectly satisfied, and beg to thank
you. You have expressed a wish to retire to Blois,
and I have consented to that wish. Had you
remained near me you should still have retained
that share in the government which you have so
long held; and you are still at liberty to do so,
whenever you may desire it. Rest assured that I
shall never fail to love, honour, and obey you as my
mother upon every occasion; and that I shall continue
throughout my life to be your very humble
son."</p>

<p>This notable oration had been delivered by the
young King with all the monotonous intonations of
a studied recital, and was terminated by a sigh
of relief as he saw himself near the conclusion of
the comedy. It had been arranged that so soon as
he ceased speaking the Queen should stoop forward
to embrace him; but in the excess of her agitation
the outraged mother disregarded the instructions
which she had previously received, and in an accent
of heart-broken anguish she exclaimed: "I am
about to leave you, Sir; do not deny my last prayer.
Release my faithful Barbin, and suffer him to share
my exile."</p>

<p>Louis, unprepared for this request, was uncertain
how he should reply, and glanced uneasily from De
Luynes to Richelieu.</p>

<p>"Do not refuse me this, Sir," urged Marie once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>[pg 449]</span>
more; "it is the only boon I ask&mdash;perhaps," she
added after a moment's pause, "the last I shall ever
ask of you,"</p>

<p>Still Louis remained silent, with his cold stern
eyes riveted upon her agitated countenance.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Queen could not mistake the
meaning of that fixed and passionless look: her lip
quivered for an instant, and then she bent her
stately head and slightly touched the forehead of
her son. Louis replied to the embrace by a
profound and silent bow, and turned away hurriedly,
as if weary of the scene in which he had played so
undignified a part. As he moved aside, De Luynes
approached the Queen-mother; and having bent his
knee, and kissed the hem of her robe, he uttered a
few words in so low a voice that they were inaudible
to those who stood behind her. In reply she was
overheard to say that she had solicited his Majesty
to allow Barbin to follow her to Blois, and to
continue his duties as superintendent of her household;
and that she should consider herself greatly
indebted to the kindness of the favourite if he would
exert his influence to that effect. De Luynes was
about once more to speak, when the voice of the
King was heard loudly calling for him; and putting
forward as an excuse the impossibility of compelling
his Majesty to wait, he once more bowed to the
ground, and made his retreat.</p>

<p>When she saw him disappear in the crowd
Marie de Medicis gave free vent to the emotion
which she had so long partially controlled; and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>[pg 450]</span>
the other great nobles of the Court successively
bent before her, she remained with her face buried
in her handkerchief, sobbing audibly, and apparently
unconscious of their homage. Ten minutes afterwards
she descended the great staircase, and took
her seat in the coach which was to convey her to
Blois, accompanied by the Princesses and all the
principal ladies of the Court, who were to attend
her to the city gates. An immense crowd had
collected on the quay of the Louvre to see her pass;
but, contrary to the apprehensions of her friends,
not a word of insult or reproach was uttered.
There was something so appalling even to the most
reckless in her sudden fall; something so sad in this
gorgeous procession which seemed rather to mock
than to honour her misfortunes; so sharp and bitter
a lesson in the spectacle of a Princess lately all-powerful
thus driven from her palace-home to
immure herself in a fortress, and this too in broad
daylight, under the eyes of her subjects, and in the
streets of the capital, that she excited the involuntary
sympathy even of her enemies.</p>

<p>This sympathy was, however, unfelt by her son;
who no sooner became aware that she was about to
enter her carriage than he hurried to the balcony
of the Queen's apartment, whence he attentively
watched the departure of the <i>cortge</i>, manifesting
the most lively interest in the preliminary arrangements;
and as the last equipage disappeared, he
returned to the room saying gaily: "Now then,
gentlemen, we will start for Vincennes."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>[pg 451]</span>
Some minutes afterwards, the palace resounded
with the voices of ushers, pages, and men-at-arms;
a dozen carriages rolled into the Court; the King
paid a farewell visit to his dogs, his birds, and
his wife; and then, desiring that the Queen and
her ladies should follow him on the morrow, he
left orders that the Louvre should be minutely
searched throughout, in order to ascertain beyond
all possibility of doubt that no gunpowder had been
concealed within the edifice for the purpose of effecting
his destruction; after which he sprang into his
coach, with an undisguised cheerfulness which left
no doubt that his affected respect and attachment
for his mother were by no means incompatible with
a hearty sense of relief at his emancipation from her
control.<a id="footnotetag307" name="footnotetag307"></a><a href="#footnote307">[307]</a></p>

<p>The Marchale d'Ancre had been committed to
the Bastille on the 29th of April, lightly dressed,
despoiled of all her ornaments, and without the
most trifling pecuniary resource; so thoroughly
destitute, indeed, of the common necessaries of life
that she was indebted to Madame Persan, the wife
of the lieutenant of the fortress, for a couple of
changes of body-linen. Even the Prince de Cond,
who was professedly her enemy, was deeply moved
when he ascertained her pitiable condition. "It
was not to Leonora that political crimes should be
attributed," he said, with an indignation which did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>[pg 452]</span>
honour to his heart; "but to the insatiable ambition
of her husband."</p>

<p>Her only attendants were an Italian maid and
her apothecary, whose constant care was required
from the precarious state both of her bodily and
mental health; but she nevertheless maintained a
self-command and composure which astonished all
by whom she was approached. She uttered no
complaint; exhibited no resentment; and in reply
to the condolences of her gaolers, simply replied:
"I must have patience; my enemies are powerful,
the Queen-mother is absent, and no doubt I shall be
compelled to leave France. I will retire with my
son to Florence; we have still the means of subsistence,
and I must endeavour to forget the past."</p>

<p>Some days subsequently her women succeeded in
conveying to her a few changes of apparel and two
hundred crowns in money; but when, on the 11th
of May, she was transferred to the prison of the
Conciergerie, these effects were in their turn stolen
from her, and she once more found herself totally
penniless. In addition to this misfortune she was
apprised that she could no longer be permitted to
retain her attendants, as the regulations of a felon
prison did not admit of such an indulgence; and on
hearing this, she said with a cry of agony: "I am
lost!"</p>

<p>The Court remained a fortnight at Vincennes,
after which the King returned to the Louvre.
There, instead of endeavouring, according to the
sage advice of his ministers, to render the absence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>[pg 453]</span>
of his mother unfelt by the adoption of measures
calculated to prove that he was equal to the responsibility
which he had been so eager to assume, he
soon returned to the puerile amusements he had
latterly affected to despise; and spent the day in
colouring prints, beating a drum, blowing a bugle,
or making <i>jets d'eau</i> with quills.<a id="footnotetag308" name="footnotetag308"></a><a href="#footnote308">[308]</a> On one occasion
when Bassompierre was complimenting him upon
the facility with which he acquired everything that
he desired to learn, he replied with great complacency:
"I must begin again with my hunting-horn,
which I blow very well; and I will practise
for a whole day."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Sire," was the reply of the courtier;
"I would not advise your Majesty to indulge too
much in such a diversion, as it is injurious to the
chest; and I have even heard it asserted that the
late King Charles IX burst a blood-vessel on the
lungs from his abuse of that instrument; an accident
which terminated his life."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Sir," said Louis with one of his
cold saturnine looks; "it was his quarrel with
Catherine de Medicis which caused his death. If
he had not followed the bad advice of the Marchal
de Retz, and resided with her subsequently at
Monceaux, he would not have died so young."</p>

<p>Bassompierre was silenced; and thenceforward
resolved never again to mention the name of the
Queen-mother in the presence of his royal master.<a id="footnotetag309" name="footnotetag309"></a><a href="#footnote309">[309]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>[pg 454]</span>
Meanwhile it was universally anticipated that as
all the other Princes had been restored to favour, M.
de Cond would be liberated; but such a measure
by no means accorded with the views of De Luynes,
who, aware of the influence of the noble prisoner,
felt himself too weak to cope openly with the first
Prince of the Blood; and, consequently, the only
benefit which Cond derived from the death of the
Marchal d'Ancre was a mitigation of the extreme
vigilance with which he had hitherto been guarded.
The conduct of the Princess his wife was at this
juncture above all praise. She had, from the first
period of his imprisonment, been persevering in
her efforts to accomplish his liberation; and having
failed to do this, had solicited the permission of the
King to share his captivity; but, by the advice of
his favourite, Louis had hitherto resolutely refused
to accede to such an arrangement; although he
might justly have been struck by the heroism of
a sacrifice which in her case was heightened tenfold
by the fact that, despite the jealousy which
he had constantly exhibited, M. de Cond had
made no secret of his utter indifference to his
wife, and would never forgive her relations with
Henri IV. After the departure of the Queen-mother,
however, De Luynes judged it expedient to
accept the offer of the Princess; and she was
accordingly informed that she might proceed to the
Louvre, where the King would grant her an
audience. She had no sooner received this permission
than she hastened, accompanied by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>[pg 455]</span>
Duchesse d'Angoulme her sister, to throw herself
at the feet of the young sovereign; where, bathed
in tears, she sobbed out her acknowledgment of
the indulgence extended to her, and implored him
to extend his clemency to the Prince her husband.
"But should you unhappily consider it expedient to
detain him in the Bastille, Sire," she concluded with
deep emotion, "I entreat of your Majesty to allow
me to share his prison."</p>

<p>"Madame," replied Louis, "it was already my
intention so to do. I am sincerely attached to M.
de Cond, and to all his house; and every attention
shall be paid to him until my government is perfectly
established. I greatly regret that at the present
moment I am prevented by circumstances from
restoring him to liberty; but assure him from me
that I will cause his liberation at the earliest opportunity."</p>

<p>Again and again did the delighted Princess utter
her thanks; and after having been graciously dismissed
by the King, she lost not a moment in
proceeding, armed with the royal authority, to the
Bastille, where, having constituted herself a prisoner,
she hastened to impart her hopeful tidings to the
Prince.</p>

<p>Despite the assurances which she had received,
however, from the lips of Louis himself, four more
weary months were passed by M. and Madame de
Cond in the fortress, in that daily and hourly fever
of expectation which is more agonizing than utter
despair; and even at the close of that dreary time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>[pg 456]</span>
instead of the liberty for which the husband and
wife alike panted, an order arrived at the Bastille
for the transfer of the deluded and unhappy couple
to the Castle of Vincennes, which was communicated
to them as a signal mark of the royal clemency;
and in that citadel they were detained until the
autumn of 1619.<a id="footnotetag310" name="footnotetag310"></a><a href="#footnote310">[310]</a> The result of Madame de
Cond's admirable self-abnegation was, however, a
source of triumph for her woman-heart, as the
Prince was not proof against so unequivocal a
demonstration of attachment, and thenceforward
evinced towards her a tenderness which amply repaid
her sacrifice.</p>

<p>Shortly after the transfer of Madame d'Ancre to
the Conciergerie she was put upon her trial; but as
her mental hallucination, together with her estrangement
from her husband, rendered it probable that
sufficient proof of political delinquency could not be
adduced against her to justify an extreme sentence,
and as her escape from the scaffold must necessarily
tend to render his tenure of the confiscated
property of Concini (of which he had already
obtained the reversion) difficult, if not impossible,
De Luynes did not hesitate to tamper with her
judges, and to induce them, alike by bribes and
threats, to accomplish her death. For this purpose
a second charge was coupled with that of <i>lse-majest</i>,
which was brought conjointly against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>[pg 457]</span>
herself and her murdered husband. She was
accused of sorcery as well as of conspiring against
the state; of casting alike nativities to compass the
destruction of the King, and cannon for the service
of the disaffected Princes; together with a host of
other crimes, none of which could be proved against
her. So palpable, indeed, was the motive of her
persecutors, that it excited the popular indignation;
and the masses, who had so recently execrated the
name of the unfortunate woman, began, ere the
conclusion of her trial, to look upon her only as the
victim of De Luynes. "You will see," said some
of the citizens, as they learnt with what dignified
calmness and logical precision she refuted the
several charges brought against her, "that here the
case of the Duc de Biron will be reversed&mdash;like
her he was the victim of policy, but he died
like a woman, while she will meet her fate like a
man."</p>

<p>And they were correct in their conclusion.
Whatever might have been her faults while she
continued the favourite of fortune, Leonora Galiga
was grand in her adversity; and one of her judges
was so much overpowered by his conviction of her
innocence, that on recollecting the pledge which he
had given to De Luynes to decide upon her guilt,
he fainted and was carried from the Court. When
accused of treason against the state, the prisoner
replied by reminding her accusers of her total
estrangement from her husband during the last two
years, throughout which period he had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>[pg 458]</span>
all-powerful with the Queen-mother, and her own
consequent loss of influence; and when questioned
as to the nature of the sorcery by which she had so
long governed her royal mistress, she answered that
it was simply the magic exercised by a strong mind
over a weak one.<a id="footnotetag311" name="footnotetag311"></a><a href="#footnote311">[311]</a> To the other charges she
responded with equal composure and conclusiveness;
and many among them were of so puerile a
character that, despite the fearful position in which
she was placed, she could not suppress a smile of
mingled pity and amusement.</p>

<p>She was foredoomed, however; and on the 8th
of July the sentence was pronounced. It was in
truth a frightful one! Both the husband and the
wife were declared guilty of <i>lse-majest</i> divine and
human; and she herself was condemned to lose her
head, and to be afterwards burned; their house was
to be levelled with the ground; their property, not
only in France, but also all that they possessed at
Rome and Florence, was to be confiscated to the
Crown; and their son deprived of his rank, and rendered
incapable of holding any office in the kingdom.<a id="footnotetag312" name="footnotetag312"></a><a href="#footnote312">[312]</a></p>

<p>When this sentence was declared the wretched
woman, who had never anticipated a more severe fate
than exile, exclaimed in a piteous voice: "Oim
poveretta!" but shortly recovering herself, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>[pg 459]</span>
resumed the same calm courage which she had previously
evinced.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most merciful portion of her sentence
was that which condemned her to suffer on the same
day; and for this she was undoubtedly indebted to
the impatience of De Luynes, who did not feel himself
secure of the succession until she should have
ceased to breathe. The revelations which she had
made of the extent of her wealth during the preliminary
examinations in the prison had sealed her
fate, as they so far exceeded all his anticipations that
they silenced every throb of compunction and negatived
every other feeling; and they thus at least
spared her a night of agony during which she might
have brooded over the miserable prospects of her
idolized son.</p>

<p>It is painful to reflect upon the position which the
Marquise had filled, and to see her thus shaken and
withered both in mind and body; abandoned by the
protectress to whom she had clung so long and so
confidingly; widowed by violence; separated from
her only surviving child; and compelled to drain her
cup of bitterness to the very dregs. Not a pang
was, however, voluntarily spared to her. She might,
in consideration of her rank as the wife of a Marshal
of France, and out of respect for the Queen-mother,
of whom she had not only been the foster-sister but
also the familiar friend, have been conveyed to the
place of execution in a covered carriage, and thus
have been in some degree screened from the public
gaze; but no such delicacy was observed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>[pg 460]</span>
criminal's cart, with its ghastly faggot for a seat,
was her ordained conveyance; but her step did not
falter as she stepped into the vehicle which had been
previously tenanted by the vilest and most degraded
culprits. Never had there been seen so dense a
crowd in the Place de Grve; and as she glanced
hurriedly around, unaware of the popular reaction of
feeling, she cowered for an instant panic-struck, and
murmured helplessly: "Oh, what a multitude to
gaze upon a miserable woman!"</p>

<p>Not a word, not a gesture of vengeance or of
hate, escaped, however, from the populace. Her
deportment had been so dignified, her courage so
great, her piety so perfect, that those who were once
her bitterest enemies looked on her through their
tears. Her charities had been unremitting and
extensive; and those whom she had aided in their
necessities had thronged, through a morbid and
mingled feeling of gratitude and awe, to see her
die.<a id="footnotetag313" name="footnotetag313"></a><a href="#footnote313">[313]</a></p>

<p>Her head fell&mdash;her body was burned&mdash;and her
ashes were scattered to the wind.</p>

<p>De Luynes had, as we have stated, constituted
himself her heir; but it was not without difficulty
that he succeeded in appropriating the principal portion
of the coveted wealth of his victims. Du Vair,
with a firmness for which the favourite was not prepared,
refused for a considerable time to countersign
the letters of consignment which had been granted
by the King to that effect; declaring that as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>[pg 461]</span>
property of Concini and his family had been confiscated
to the Crown, it could not be otherwise disposed
of. This difficulty was, however, surmounted
after the fashion of the period, and the signature of
the scrupulous minister was purchased by the rich
bishopric of Lisieux; after which De Luynes himself
negatived the destruction of the magnificent
htel of the Marchal, to which he transferred his
own establishment, and then proceeded to enforce
his claims upon the funded property in Rome. This
pretension was, however, opposed by the Pope, who
declared that all monies confiscated within the
Roman states must necessarily revert to himself;
and Louis XIII, after having in vain endeavoured
to induce the Sovereign-Pontiff to rescind this declaration,
found himself ultimately compelled to make
a donation of the five hundred thousand francs
claimed by his favourite to the cathedral of St.
Peter's.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke of Tuscany, in his turn, refused
to recognize the right of De Luynes to the funds
which had been entrusted to him by the Marchal
d'Ancre, but from a higher and a holier motive; as
the young Comte de la Pna was no sooner set at
liberty, with an injunction immediately to leave
France, than he received him with all the sympathy
due to his unmerited misfortunes, and put him in
possession of this remnant of his inheritance. Thenceforward
the son of Concini remained in Italy until
the year 1631, when he fell a victim to the plague.<a id="footnotetag314" name="footnotetag314"></a><a href="#footnote314">[314]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>[pg 462]</span>
Before we quit the Court to follow exclusively the
fortunes of Marie de Medicis, it is necessary that we
should record three circumstances of social interest
which occurred during the year 1617. The first in
order is the death of the President de Thou, one of
the most able and upright ministers, and, perhaps,
the most conscientious historian that France had
ever known. He expired on the 7th of May. The
next, in point of chronology, is the marriage of De
Luynes, who&mdash;having obtained the most absolute
power, not only over the King personally, but also
over all state affairs&mdash;being anxious to strengthen
his position yet more by a great alliance, after having
for a time contemplated an union with the
daughter of the Duc de Vendme, ultimately entered
into a negotiation for the hand of Mademoiselle de
Montbazon.<a id="footnotetag315" name="footnotetag315"></a><a href="#footnote315">[315]</a> This negotiation proved successful;
and through her means he became closely connected
with the most ancient and powerful families in the
kingdom. The marriage took place on the 13th of
September, and the bride was admitted to the
honours of the <i>tabouret</i>;<a id="footnotetag316" name="footnotetag316"></a><a href="#footnote316">[316]</a> while in order to render
him more acceptable to the haughty houses into
which the favour of his sovereign had thus afforded
him ingress, the exulting favourite was elevated to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>[pg 463]</span>
duchy-peerage, and took his seat in the Parliament.
The last circumstance to which allusion has been
made is the death of M. de Villeroy, who terminated
his life at the ripe age of seventy-four years on the
30th of December. As we have already stated, he
was possessed of little education, had no taste for
either literature or art, but was singularly upright
and shrewd in the management of public business;
while he was, moreover, so thoroughly disinterested,
that in the midst of all the cupidity which at that
period disgraced the Court of France, after having
been fifty-one years in office, he died with the mere
addition of two thousand livres <i>per annum</i> to his
patrimonial income.<a id="footnotetag317" name="footnotetag317"></a><a href="#footnote317">[317]</a></p>

<p>In order to enlist popular opinion in his favour,
De Luynes had, as we have seen, induced the King
to recall the old ministers to power; and the people,
still remembering the wisdom which they had
displayed during their administration, welcomed
with joy the reappearance of Sillery, Villeroy, and
Jeannin in the Council; but although the favourite
ostensibly recognized their privileges, he was far
from intending to permit their interference with his
own interests;<a id="footnotetag318" name="footnotetag318"></a><a href="#footnote318">[318]</a> and so thoroughly did he enslave
the mind of the young King, that while Louis, like
a schoolboy who had played truant, and who was
resolved to enjoy his new-found liberty to the uttermost,
was constantly changing his place of abode,
and visiting in turn St. Germain, Fontainebleau,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>[pg 464]</span>
Villers-Cotterets, and Monceaux, without one care
save the mere amusement of the hour, De Luynes
was multiplying his precautions to prevent a reconciliation
between the mother and the son; an event
which must, as he believed, whenever it should
occur, prove the ruin of his own fortunes. For
this purpose, so soon as he saw a cloud upon the
brow of the royal stripling, he hastened to devise for
him some new and exciting pursuit, which might
tend to deaden his remorse for the past, and to
render him more conscious of the value of that
moral emancipation which he had purchased at so
fearful a price; but ere long even this subtle policy
failed to dissipate the apprehensions of the favourite.
Like all persons who occupy a false position of
which they fully appreciate the uncertain tenure, he
became suspicious of all around him; and would not
allow any individual, whatever might be his rank, to
approach the King without his knowledge, nor to
attempt to converse with him in private. Thus,
therefore, while Louis fondly believed that he had
indeed become a monarch in fact as well as name,
he was in reality more enslaved than ever.</p>

<p>Enriched by the spoils of Concini and his wife,
De Luynes next caused himself to be appointed lieutenant
of the King in Normandy; and this was no
sooner done than he entered into a negotiation for
one of the principal governments in the kingdom.
He appeared suddenly to have forgotten that one of
the most cogent reasons which he had so lately
given for the necessity of sacrificing the Marchal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>[pg 465]</span>
d'Ancre and his wife was the enormous wealth of
which they had possessed themselves at the expense
of the state. His ambition as well as his avarice
became insatiable; and not contented with pushing
his own fortunes to a height never before attained
by a mere petty noble, he procured great advantages
for his brothers, and lodged them in his apartments
in the Louvre. But while Louis remained unconscious
or careless of the new bondage into which he
had thus fallen, the courtiers and the people were
alike less blind and less forbearing. With that
light-heartedness which has enabled the French
in all ages to find cause for mirth even in their misfortunes,
some wag, less scrupulous than inventive,
on one occasion, under cover of the darkness, affixed
above the door leading to the rooms occupied by the
brothers a painting which represented the adoration
of the Magi, beneath which was printed in bold
letters, "At the sign of the Three Kings"; a practical
jest which afforded great amusement to the
Court.<a id="footnotetag319" name="footnotetag319"></a><a href="#footnote319">[319]</a></p>

<p>At this period Louis XIII, still a mere youth,
and utterly inexperienced in those great questions of
public policy which determine the prosperity or the
peril of a nation, resolved upon a measure which
Henri IV himself had not ventured to undertake.
The Roman Catholic religion had been abolished in
Barn by Jeanne d'Albret, his grandmother, and the
property of that church seized in virtue of an Act
passed at the assembly of the States; and now, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>[pg 466]</span>
the demand of his clergy, he determined to issue a
decree ordaining the restitution of all the ecclesiastical
property, and the re-establishment of the Roman
faith. This was, of course, resisted by the Protestants,
as well as the annexation of the principality of
Barn to the Crown of France; but the advisers of
the young King considered the opportunity to be a
favourable one for effecting both measures; and
they easily persuaded him to persevere in his purpose.
The edict was consequently published; and
its effects were destined to be painfully felt by the
reformed party throughout the remainder of his
reign.</p>

<p>The people, on their side, had not forgotten the
promises which they had received of a reform in the
government, and De Luynes still continued to give
them hopes of their accomplishment; but as no
measures to that effect were taken, they, at this
period, demanded a new assembly of the States-General.
They were, however, induced to modify
this demand; and a meeting of the <i>Notables</i><a id="footnotetag320" name="footnotetag320"></a><a href="#footnote320">[320]</a> was
finally conceded, which was to take place at Rouen
on the 24th of November, in the presence of the
sovereign. This assembly was accordingly held,
but thanks to the influence of De Luynes produced
none of the results which had been anticipated.<a id="footnotetag321" name="footnotetag321"></a><a href="#footnote321">[321]</a></p>

<p>A few days before the departure of Marie de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>[pg 467]</span>
Medicis from Paris the King of Spain declared war
against the Duke of Savoy, who immediately appealed
to France for aid, which was in the first
instance refused; but, on the representations of the
Marchal de Lesdiguires, it was finally accorded,
and troops were raised which proceeded to Piedmont
under the command of that general.<a id="footnotetag322" name="footnotetag322"></a><a href="#footnote322">[322]</a></p>

<p>Such was the general aspect of the Court
and kingdom of France at the close of the year
1617; of which we have considered it necessary to
sketch the principal features, in order to remind the
reader of the exact position of the country at the
period of the Queen-mother's exile. Henceforward
we shall principally confine ourselves to following
her in her banishment.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
