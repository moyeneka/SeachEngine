<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<br />
<p> <b>TO BE HAPPY THOUGH MARRIED.</b>
</p>  <p>
&quot;Some dear relatives of mine proposed Ada as my future bride. I like Ada and I gladly accepted the offer, and I mean to wed her about the middle of this year. Is this a working of the Law of Attraction? I want to make our married life happy and peaceful. I long for a wedded life of pure blessedness and love and joy  without even a pinhead of bitterness ever finding lodgment in our household. How can I attain this state of peace? This is what I now do: I enter into the Silence daily at a particular hour and enjoy the mental picture of how I desire to be when married. Am I right? Please tell me how to make my ideal real.&quot; Tudor, Island of Ceylon.
  </p>
  <p>
The above letter comes from a member of the Success Circle who is a highly cultured and interesting looking native East Indian. We have a full length photo of him in native costume.
  </p>
  <p>
He asks if &quot;this is the working of the Law of Attraction.&quot; Certainly it is. Just as the sun acts through a sheet of glass so the Law of Attraction acts through the conventionalities of a race. Whatever comes together is drawn together by the Law. Whatever is held together is held by that same Law of Attraction.
  </p>
  <p>
This is just as true in unhappy marriages as in happy ones. If two people are distinctly enough individualized; that is, if they understand and command themselves sufficiently; their attraction and marriage will bring to them only pleasure. If they are not distinctly enough individualized there will be a monkey-and-parrot experience whilst they are working out the wisdom <i>for which they were attracted</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
When soda and sour milk are drawn together there is a great stew and fizz, but the end thereof is sweetness and usefulness. So with two adverse and uncontrolled natures; but out of the stew comes added wisdom, self-command and rounded character for each.
  </p>
  <p>
When each has finished the work of helping the other to develop they
will either find themselves <i>really</i> in love with each other, or they will fall apart. <i>Some stronger attraction will separate them at the right time</i>--perhaps through divorce, perhaps through death.
  </p>
  <p>
<i>All</i> our goings and comings are due to the Law of Attraction. The Law of Attraction giveth, and it taketh away. <i>Blessed</i> is the Law. <i>Let</i> it work. And forget not that <i>all</i> things are due to its working.
  </p>
  <p>
This does not mean that the Law has no way of working <i>except</i> through the conventionalities of a people. Many times the attraction is to break away from the conventional. <i>The stronger attraction always wins</i>--whatever is, is <i>best</i> for <i>that time and place</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
&quot;Tudor&quot; says he &quot;enters into the silence daily at a  particular hour and enjoys the mental picture of how he desires to be when married.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
His success all depends upon the <i>equity</i> in that picture; upon its truth to the law of being.
  </p>
  <p>
An impractical idealist lives in the silence with beautiful pictures of &quot;how he desires to be when married.&quot; When he gets married there isn't a single detail of his daily experience which is like his mental picture. He is sadly disappointed and perhaps embittered or discouraged.
  </p>
  <p>
It all depends upon the picture. If Tudor's picture contains a benignant lord and master and a sweet little Alice Ben Bolt sort of wife who shall laugh with delight when he gives her a smile and wouldn't hurt his feelings for a farm; who does his bidding before he bids and is always content with what he is pleased, or able, to do for her; if this is the style of Tudor's mental picture he is certainly doomed to disappointment.
  </p>
  <p>
I have a suspicion that Tudor is a natural born teacher.
  His mental pictures may represent himself as a dispenser of moral and mental blessings. He may see Ada sitting adoringly at his feet, ever eager to learn. If so there will certainly be disappointment. East Indian girls may be more docile than American girls; East Indian men may be better and wiser lords and masters; but &quot;Ada&quot; is a Human Being before she is an East Indian; and a Human Being instinctively revolts from a life passed in leading strings. If Tudor continues to remind her that he is her schoolmaster she will certainly revolt; inwardly if not outwardly. Whether the revolt comes inwardly or outwardly harmony is doomed.
  </p>
  <p>
The first principle of happy marriage is <i>equality</i>. The second principle is <i>mutual confidence</i>, which can NEVER exist without   the first.
  </p>
  <p>
I do not mean by &quot;equality&quot; what is usually meant. One
member of the married twain may be rich, the other poor in worldly goods; one an aristocrat, the other plebeian; one educated, the other unschooled; and yet they may be to each other what they are in <i>truth</i>, equals.
  </p>
  <p>
Equality is a <i>mental state</i>, not a matter of birth or breeding, wisdom or ignorance. The TRUTH is that <i>all</i> men and women are equal; all are sparks of the One Life; all children of the one highly aristocratic &quot;Father&quot;; all heirs to the wisdom and wealth of the ages which go to make up eternity.
  </p>
  <p>
But all men and women are more or less unconcious, in spots at least, of this truth. They spend their lives &quot;looking down&quot; upon each other. Men &quot;look down&quot; upon their wives as &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;inferior,&quot; and women look down upon their husbands as &quot;animals&quot; or &quot;great brutes.&quot; Men are contemptuous of their wives visionariness, and women despise their husbands for &quot;cold and calculating&quot; tendencies.
  </p>
  <p>
Every man and woman values certain qualities highly, and in proportion as another fails to manifest these particular qualities he is classed as &quot;low,&quot; and his society is not valued.
  </p>
  <p>
This is the great source of trouble between husbands and wives. Each values his or her own qualities and despises the other's. So <i>in their own minds</i> they are not equal, and the first principle of harmony is missing.
  </p>
  <p>
The real truth is that in marriage a man is schoolmaster to his wife <i>and she is equally schoolmistress to him.</i> This is true in a less degree, of <i>all</i> the relationships of life.
  </p>
  <p>
The Law of Attraction draws people together <i>that they may learn</i>. There is but one Life, which is growth in wisdom and knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
 There is but one Death, <i>which is refusal to learn</i>. If husbands and wives were equals <i>in their own minds</i> they would not despise each other and <i>refuse to learn</i> of each other.
  </p>
  <p>
The Law of Attraction, or Love, almost invariably attracts opposites, and for their own good. A visionary, idealistic woman is drawn to a practical man, where, kick and fuss and despise  each other as they will, she is bound to become more practical and he more idealistic. They exchange qualities in spite of themselves; each is an unconscious agent in rounding out the character and making more abundant the life of the other.
</p>

<p>Much of this blending of natures is accomplished
through passion, the least understood of forces. And
the children of a union of opposites, even where there
is <i>great</i> contempt and unhappiness between the parents,
are almost invariably <i>better balanced</i> than <i>either</i>
of the parents.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that unhappy marriages are &quot;mistakes&quot;
or that they serve no good purpose. The Law
of Attraction draws together those who need each
other at that particular stage of their growth. The
unhappiness is due to their own foolish <i>refusal</i> to
learn; and this refusal is due to their contempt for
each other. They are like naughty children at school,
who cry or sulk and refuse to work out their problems.
Like those same naughty children they <i>make themselves</i>
unhappy, and fail to &quot;pass&quot; as soon as they
might.</p>

<p>Remember, that contempt for each other is at the
very bottom of all marital unhappiness. The practical
man despises his wife's impulsive idealism and tries
to make her over. The wife despises his &quot;cold and
calculating&quot; tendencies and tries to make him over.
That means war, for it is impossible to make over
<i>anybody but yourself</i>.</p>

<p><i>Because</i> the man despises his wife's tendencies and
she despises his, it never occurs to either to try making
over <i>themselves</i>, thus helping along the very thing
they were drawn together for.</p>

<p>If Tudor's picture holds two people who are
<i>always</i> equal though utterly different; whose future
actions are an unknown quantity to be taken as they
come and each action to be met in a spirit of <i>respect</i>
and inquiry, with a view to understanding and learning
from it; if over and through all his picture Tudor
spreads a glow of <i>purpose</i> to preserve <i>his own</i> respect
and love <i>for her</i>, at all costs;--if this is the sort of
picture Tudor makes in the silence he will surely
realize it later.</p>

<p>It requires but one to strike the keynote of respect
and personal freedom in marriage; the other will soon
come into harmony.</p>

<p>You can readily see that all marital jars come
from this lack of equality in the individual mind. If
a man thinks he is perfectly able to take care of and
to judge for himself he resents interference from another.
On the other hand if he believes his wife is
equally able to judge for <i>herself</i>, he <i>never</i> thinks of
interfering with her actions. Of course the same is
true of the wife. It is lack of respect and confidence
which begets the making-over spirit in a family, and
from this one cause arises all in harmony.</p>

<p>Individual freedom is the <i>only</i> basis for harmonious
action; not only in marriage but in all other relationships
of life.</p>

<p>And individual freedom <i>cannot</i> be granted by the
man or woman who considers his or her judgments
superior to the judgments of another. A man <i>must</i>
accord his wife <i>equal</i> wisdom and power with himself,
else he <i>cannot</i> free her to act for herself. A woman
must accord her husband that same equality, or she
<i>cannot</i> leave him free.</p>

<p>It is human (and divine) nature to correct what
we believe to be wrong. Only in believing that the
other &quot;king (or queen) can do no wrong,&quot; lies the
possibility of individual freedom, in marriage or out.</p>

<p>The man or woman who knows he or she is believed
in and trusted is very careful to <i>deserve</i> that trust.
Did you know that? The sure way to have your
wishes consulted is to exalt and appreciate the other
party. Did you know that a man or woman will
cheerfully sacrifice his or her own opinions in order
to retain the respect and love of the other? But if he
thinks the respect and love of the other party is growing
less he will give free reign to his own desires.</p>

<p>Married people &quot;grow apart&quot; for the one reason
that they find fault with each other. Of course it
begins by their being disrespectful to each other's
faults, but it soon develops into disrespect of each
other. From &quot;looking down&quot; upon a husband's faults
it is only a few short steps to looking down upon <i>him</i>.
His faults keep growing by recognition, and his good
points keep shrivelling for lack of notice, until <i>in your</i>
<i>mind</i> there is nothing left but faults. From trying to
make him over you come to despair, and give him up as
an altogether bad job.</p>

<p>And there isn't a grain of sense in all this madness.
Stick to the TRUTH and you will get rid of the madness
and the friction, too. The truth is that your
husband, or your wife, would be an egregious <i>fool</i>
to follow your judgments. You don't know beans
from barley corn when it comes to the actions of
anybody but yourself. The One Spirit which enlightens
<i>you</i> as to <i>your</i> actions is also enlightening
your other half as to <i>her</i> actions; and do you suppose
this Spirit is going to favor <i>you</i> with better judgment
about your other half's duties, than it has given <i>her?</i>
I guess <i>not</i>. Don't be presumptuous, my boy. Do
you own little best, and <i>trust</i> your other half to do
hers. Trust that she <i>is</i> doing the best.</p>

<p>And above all trust the One Spirit to run you
both.</p>

<p>If you do this your wife will <i>rise fast</i> in your
esteem. And the higher she finds herself in your
esteem the harder she will try to please you--and rise
higher.</p>

<p>And, girls, don't forget that the shoe fits equally
well the other foot. Either man or wife can bring
harmony out of chaos simply by <i>respecting</i> the other
half <i>and all his or her acts</i>.</p>

<p>A marriage without &quot;even a pinhead of bitterness&quot;
is a marriage without a pin-point of fault-finding,
mental or oral.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>A TALE OF WOE.</b></p>

<p>&quot;Why is it that, in more than two-thirds of
families the wife and mother bears not only the children
but the burdens and heartaches? The husband
supplies the <i>money</i> (generally not enough), the wife
has the care of a growing and increasing family, the
best of everything is saved for 'Father' and he is
waited on, etc. If the children annoy him he goes to
his club; if the wife dies, why there are plenty more
women for the asking. Thousands of women are
simply starving for Love and men are either willfully
blind or wholly and utterly selfish. You possibly know
that this is quite true. Another thing that has caused
me many a time to question everything: During the
Christmas holidays many times I have seen half-clad,
hungry, shivering little ones gazing longingly into the
wonderful show windows, wanting probably just one
toy, while children no more worthy drive by in carriages,
having more than they want. Love, home,
mother, everything; on the other hand hunger, want,
blues (many times), and both God's children. Let us
hear what you have to say about this.&quot; B. B.</p>

<p>Why does the mother in two-thirds of the families
bear not only the children but the burdens and heartaches?
<i>Because she is too thoughtless and inert not to</i>.
It is <i>easier</i> to submit to bearing children than it is to
rise up and take command of her own body. It is
easier to carry burdens than to wake up and <i>fire</i> them.
It is easier to &quot;bear&quot; things and grumble than it is to
kick over the traces and <i>change</i> them. To be sure, most
women are yet under the hypnotic spell of the old
race belief that it is woman's duty to &quot;submit&quot; herself
to any kind of an old husband; but that is just
what I said--women find it easier to go through life
half asleep rather than to <i>think</i> for themselves. Paul
says a woman is <i>not</i> to think, she is to ask her husband
to think for her. (At least that is what the translators
<i>say</i> Paul says. Privately, I have my suspicions that
those manly translators helped Paul to say a bit more
than he meant to.) It is <i>easier</i> to let her husband
think for her even when she doesn't like his thoughts.
So she uses her brain in <i>grumbling</i> instead of thinking.</p>

<p>People who don't think are ruled by <i>feeling</i>.
Women feel. They feel not only for themselves but
for other people. They shoulder the burdens of the
whole family and a few outside the family. They do
it themselves--because it is <i>easier</i> to feel than to think.
Nobody walks up to a woman and says, &quot;Here--I have
a burden that's very heavy--<i>you</i> carry it whilst I go
off and have a good time.&quot; No. The woman simply
<i>takes</i> the burden and hugs it and &quot;feels&quot; it--and
<i>prides herself on doing it</i>. And maybe the thing <i>she</i>
hugs as a burden is no burden at all to the other
people in the family. My dear, women as a rule are
chumps. They'd rather feel <i>anything</i> than to <i>think</i>
the right thing.</p>

<p>Now I'd like to know if you think a woman who
has made herself round-shouldered and wrinkled and
sour-visaged over burdens--<i>anybody's</i> burdens, real
or fancied--is such a creature as attracts love or consideration
from <i>anybody</i>. Of course she is not. It is
no wonder she receives no love or consideration from
her husband or anybody else. She has made a pack
mule out of herself for the carrying of utterly useless
burdens that nobody <i>wants</i> carried and the carrying
of which benefits nobody; and now that she has grown
ugly and sour at the business she need not feel surprised
at being slighted. And she need not blame
folks for slighting her. <i>She</i> assumed the burdens;
<i>she</i> carried them; <i>she</i> wore herself out at it; it is all
her own fault. It was <i>easier</i> for her to feel, and
grumble, than to wake up and THINK, and change
things.</p>

<p>Nobody who <i>thinks</i> will carry a single burden for
even a single day. He knows that fretting and worrying
and grumbling only <i>double the burden</i> and accomplish
nothing.</p>

<p>Woman has <i>built herself</i> for bearing children and
burdens. When she gets tired of her bargain she will
<i>think her way out of the whole thing</i>. In the meantime
the harder the burdens grow the more quickly she
will revolt and make of herself something besides a
burden bearer.</p>

<p>It is all nonsense to talk about the men being &quot;willfully
blind or wholly and utterly selfish.&quot; No man
<i>wants</i> a burden-bearing, round-shouldered, wrinkled
and fagged-out wife. No man respects or loves a
woman who will &quot;submit&quot; to bearing unlimited burdens
or babies either. And if a woman &quot;submits&quot;
and yet keeps up a continual grumbling and nagging
about it, a man simply despises her.</p>

<p>What every man <i>hopes</i> for when he marries a
woman, is that she will be a bright, trim, <i>reasonable
comrade.</i> If she is even half-way that she will get all
the love and consideration she can long for. But in
three-quarters of the cases of marriage the woman
degenerates into a whining bundle of <i>thought-less</i>
FEELINGS done up in a slattern's dress and smelling
like a drug-shop. Her husband in despair gives up
trying to understand her, or to love her either.</p>

<p>The woman in such a case is apt to suffer most.
Why not? <i>She makes it the business of her life to
&quot;suffer.&quot;</i> She <i>prides</i> herself on how much she has had
to &quot;suffer,&quot; and &quot;bear.&quot; She cultivates her &quot;feelings&quot;
to the limit. A man thinks it &quot;unmanly&quot; to
<i>give way</i> to &quot;feelings.&quot; So he uses all his wits to keep
from doing so, and to enable him to hide his own
disappointment and make the best of life as he finds it.</p>

<p>A man uses his best <i>judgment</i> when he meets disappointment.
A woman trots out her &quot;feelings&quot; and
her best pocket-handkerchief, and calls in the neighbors.
So the woman gets the lion's share of &quot;sympathy&quot;--which
means that all the other women get
out <i>their</i> best handkerchiefs and try to imagine just
how <i>they</i> would &quot;feel&quot; if in her place.</p>

<p>Of course there <i>are</i> exceptions. I <i>have</i> heard of
men who wept and retailed their woes; and I have
heard of women with gumption.</p>

<p>The woman who wrote the letter at the head of
this chapter is a feel-er, not a thinker. She looks at
the forlorn, bedraggled specimens of her own sex and
&quot;<i>feels</i>&quot; with them, never THINKING that the women
themselves have anything to do with making their conditions.
She &quot;feels&quot; with the woman because <i>she</i> is
a woman. Being an unthinking creature she cannot
&quot;feel&quot; for the man at all.</p>

<p>Woman is the weaker creature for no other reason
than that she lives in her &quot;feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>Man is the stronger for no other reason than that
he uses his wits and his will to <i>control</i> his feelings.
&quot;B. B.&quot; has seen children gazing into shop windows.
Immediately she imagines how <i>she</i> would
&quot;feel&quot; if in their places. She does not stop to THINK
that in all probability the simple act of gazing into
the window may bring more real joy to those children
than the <i>possession</i> of the whole windowful of toys
would bring to some rich man's child. She does not
<i>think</i> that life consists not in possessions or environment,
but in the <i>ability to use</i> possessions or environment.
If she were an Edwin Abbey or a Michael
Angelo she would gaze on our chromo-bedecked walls
and work herself up into a great state of &quot;feeling&quot;
because we had to have such miserable daubs instead
of real works of art. If she saw us gazing on an
Abbey or Angelo picture she would weep tears to
think we couldn't have such pictures instead of those
hideous bright chromos on our walls. It would never
occur to her that we might be privately comparing her
Abbeys and Angelos with our chromos, <i>and wondering
how anybody could possibly see beauty in the Abbeys
and Angelos</i>.</p>

<p>About nine-tenths of women's so-called &quot;sympathy&quot;
is just about as foolish and misplaced as that.
If &quot;B. B.&quot; would go up and get acquainted with some
of those small youngsters she sees gazing into the
shop windows she would find some of her illusions
dispelled. She would find among them less &quot;longing&quot;
than she thinks, and more wonder and criticism and
pure curiosity--such as she would find in her own
heart if she were gazing at a curio collection.</p>

<p>I remember a large family of very small boys that
I used to &quot;feel&quot; for, very deeply. Poor little pinched,
ragged looking fellows they were, and always working
before and after school hours. I gave them nickels
and dimes and my children's outgrown clothes, and
new fleece lined gloves for their blue little hands.
They kept the clothes hung up at home and the gloves
stuffed in their pants pockets. And one day I discovered
that every one of those small youngsters had
a <i>bank account</i>--something I had never had in my
life! They lived as they <i>liked</i> to live, and I had been
harrowing my feelings and carrying their (?) burdens
for nothing.</p>

<p>This world is <i>not</i> a pitiful place. It is a lovely
great world, full of all sorts of people, every one of
whom <i>exactly fits into</i> his conditions.</p>

<p>And the loveliest thing of all about this bright,
blessed old world is that there is not a man, woman
or child in it who cannot <i>change</i> his environment if he
doesn't like the one he now occupies. He can THINK
his way into anything.</p>

<p>A real, deep, tender feeling will prompt one to do
all he can to alleviate distress or add to the world's
joy. <i>Real</i> feeling prompts to action. But this sentimental
slush which slops over on anything and everything
in general is nothing but an imitation of the
real thing. To sympathize to the extent of <i>acting</i> is
good; to harrow up the feelings when you cannot or
will not act, is simply weakness.</p>

<p>&quot;Feeling&quot; is subject to the same law as water.
Take away its banks and it spreads all over creation
and becomes a stagnant slough of despond. Confine it
by banks of <i>common-sense</i> and <i>will</i> and it grows deep
and tender and powerful, and bears blessings on its
bosom.</p>

<p>The professional pity-er is adding to the sum total
of the world's misery.</p>

<p>The world is like &quot;sweet Alice Ben Bolt&quot;; it
laughs with delight when you give it a smile, and
gets out its pocket handkerchief to weep with you
when you call it &quot;Poor thing!&quot;</p>

<p>Then it cuts its call short and runs around the
corner to tell your neighbor what a tiresome old thing
you are anyway.</p>

<p>Never you mind the tribulations you can't help,
dearie. Just wake up and <i>be</i> the brightest, happiest,
sweetest thing you know how to be, and the world will-be
that much better off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>TO BE LOVED.</b></p>

&quot;I desire to attract love from the Infinite or somewhere,<br />
that I may not be starved for it, as I have been<br />
ever since I married. My husband sneers at the New<br />
Thought, and in fact at nearly all that is best in me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline.<br />

<p>And yet this woman has children to love her. She
thinks she is in need of being loved; but what she
really needs is <i>to love</i>. Being loved is the <i>effect</i> of
loving. A loving man or woman can never want for
love. Others turn to them in love as naturally as
flowers turn to the sun.</p>

<p>In order to be loved you must <i>radiate</i> love. Instead
of trying to attract the love of others, seek to <i>give</i> your
love to others, <i>expecting nothing in return</i>. After a
time you will find the unexpected coming to you spontaneously.</p>

<p>Learn to love by loving <i>all</i> people and <i>things</i>, and
especially all things you find to do.</p>

<p>This same Caroline wants to &quot;rise above drudgery."
What <i>is</i> drudgery? <i>It is simply unloved work</i>--nothing
more nor less. <i>Any</i> work which is looked
down upon, and which is done with the hands <i>whilst
the heart and mind are criticizing it</i>, and running out
after other things,--<i>any</i> work thus done is drudgery.
Work done with the hands <i>and a small and unwilling
part</i> of the mind, is drudgery. To her who <i>respects</i>,
and <i>loves</i>, and does with a will what she finds to do,
there is no drudgery.</p>

<p>Let the woman who longs to be loved begin to <i>love</i>,
by practicing on her work. To quit calling it &quot;drudgery&quot;;
to put <i>all</i> her mind and will and <i>soul</i> into <i>each</i> piece of work as it comes; is the first and longest step
toward loving it. It is an easily demonstrated fact
that we learn to love anything we persist in doing
with a whole-souled will.</p>

<p>To love our work enlarges our capacity for loving
people, and the more we love people, <i>and the more
people we love</i>, the more radiant we become.</p>

<p>It is the radiant lover whom all the world loves.
Do you know that love and the lack of love are
governed by &quot;auto-suggestion&quot;? It is <i>natural</i> to love,
as every child does. But as we grow up we keep saying
to ourselves (this is auto-suggestion, you know)
that we &quot;don't like this,&quot; and we &quot;don't like that,&quot;
until really we <i>shut up</i> our love and live in a continual
state of &quot;don't like&quot;--a state which in due time
develops into <i>hate</i>--hate for self as well as others.
&quot;Don't like&quot; does it all.</p>

<p>Now <i>cultivate</i> love by auto-suggestion. Keep saying,
&quot;I <i>like</i> this,&quot; and &quot;I like that.&quot; <i>Hunt</i> for things
to like, and even tell yourself you like things when you
don't <i>feel</i> that you like them at all.</p>

<p>Feeling is a <i>result</i> of suggestion. Nothing easier
to prove than that. A hypnotist can, by suggestion,
make you feel almost anything, whether it is true or
not. He will say, &quot;You feel sad,&quot; and straightway
you will feel so. Then he will say, &quot;You feel happy,&quot;
and you do. Your feelings are like a harp, and your
<i>statements</i>, or auto-suggestions, are the fingers which
pick the strings. Take good care to play the tunes
you <i>want</i>--to say you <i>like</i> things, or love them. Then
you will quickly respond and <i>feel</i> that you like or love
them. Keep <i>practicing</i> until you love <i>all</i> the time.
Then you will <i>be</i> loved to your heart's content.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>THE PHARISEE UP-TO-DATE.</b></p>

<p>As long as you continue to hug the delusion that
you are &quot;not to blame&quot; for the unpleasant things in
your conditions you might just as well profess the old
thought as the new. The very fundamental principle
of mental science is the statement that <i>man is a magnet
and able to attract what he will</i>. To repudiate
this statement is to knock the props out from under
the whole philosophy. Better stay an old-thoughter
and let Jesus suffer for your sins and those of your
relatives and friends. At least Jesus <i>took</i> the sins of
the world to bear, all of his own free will. There is
some comfort in letting Jesus do what he chose to do.</p>

<p>But you have turned away from Jesus as a scapegoat.
You refuse to lay your burdens on him who
offered to bear them; and you refuse to bear them
yourself. Instead you distribute them around among
your relations and friends and then fret your soul
because they won't accept your distributions. Of
course you excuse yourself by acknowledging &quot;your
share of responsibility&quot; for the unpleasantness of conditions,
but if you will examine carefully you will
find that your portion of the responsibility includes
most of the <i>good</i> things in your conditions, whilst you
have portioned off almost <i>all</i> the responsibility for the
<i>bad</i> things among your protesting--or indifferent--relatives.
You always say, &quot;<i>I</i> try so hard,&quot; but you
never balance that with, &quot;<i>He</i> tries so hard,&quot;--&quot;<i>They</i>
try so hard.&quot; You get all the I-try-items in your
own pile and the don't-try-items in other folk's piles.
&quot;<i>If</i> it were not for Tom and Dick and Harry and Fan
you would do wonders--<i>if</i> they'd only treat you with
<i>half</i> the consideration other people give you, or half
<i>they</i> give other people!--<i>if!--if!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder why they don't indeed! It is just because
you are you, <i>and you attract your own particular kind
of treatment</i>. To all intents and purposes Tom, Dick,
Harry and Fan are a punch and Judy show and <i>you
pull the strings</i>. When other people pull the strings
there's a different sort of show. YOU are the motive
power in <i>all their treatment of you</i>. Not a tone or
look or act of theirs in your direction but <i>you</i> are
responsible for; it was <i>you</i> and no other who drew
them to you; and it is you and no other who hold them
there.</p>

<p>Now don't say, &quot;I don't see <i>how</i>!&quot; Of course not
--<i>you haven't wanted to see how</i>--you've been too
intent justifying yourself. And anyway, it takes an
open mind, and some time, and much <i>faith</i> to enable
us to see the <i>principles</i> of things. We have to <i>act</i> as if
they were so, a long time before we see that they are.
If you had <i>acted</i> upon the principle that you are a
magnet and that <i>all</i> that comes to you comes by your
attraction, you'd have long ago had your eyes opened
to &quot;see how.&quot; And you'd have made progress and
<i>changed your conditions</i>.</p>

<p><i>If you are ever going to be a magnet you are one
now.</i> If you are ever going to be able to attract to the
hair's breadth whatsoever you will <i>then you are doing
it now</i>. There will be no miraculous change in the
running gear of this universe to enable you to attract
what you want.</p>

<p><i>What you now are in essence and working principle
you have always been, and you will always be--the
same yesterday, today and forever--a self-made</i> MAGNET,
<i>working to the hair's breadth</i>.</p>

<p>ONLY BY CHANGING THE QUALITY OF
YOUR MAGNETISM CAN YOU CHANGE YOUR
ENVIRONMENT AND ATTRACT DIFFERENT
TREATMENT FROM TOM, DICK, HARRY AND
FAN.</p>

<p>Sweetness within brings sweetness without. You
have been more or less bitter and self-justifying
within, and Tom, Dick, Harry and Fan have danced
to the strings you pulled.</p>

<p>As long as you think <i>you</i> try and they don't; as
long as you think <i>your</i> judgment superior to theirs;
<i>your</i> ideals loftier and worthier; <i>your</i> ways better;
you will get from them responses of carelessness,
bitterness, lack of consideration, selfishness.</p>

<p><i>You</i> are inconsiderate of <i>their</i> ideas, ideals, judgments
and ways; <i>in self-preservation</i> they are inconsiderate
of yours. If you had your way they'd be
pretty little putty images of <i>your</i> ideals, judgments, wishes, ways and feelings. The Law of Individuality prevents your imposing yourself on them. You think
you are finding fault with <i>their</i> &quot;lack of consideration&quot;;
<i>you are really condemning the law of being</i>.</p>

<p>If you are ever to be a magnet you are one NOW.
<i>All</i> that comes <i>is</i> &quot;your fault.&quot; If anything different
comes it will come through <i>your</i> change of mental
attitude and action.</p>

<p>It will not do to throw it on &quot;Karma&quot; either, and
say you are receiving now the unpleasant things deserved
in a previous state of existence. The mills of
the gods grind slowly but they are not so dead slow
as all that. What you thought and did in a previous
state has determined your parentage and childhood
environment in this. But the pangs you suffer today
have their roots in yesterday or day before, or the
year before that. Cause and effect trip close upon each
other's heels--so close that the careless or ignorant
observer misses the trip. He exaggerates the <i>effect</i> if
it be an unhappy one, and goes nosing for a bigger
cause than the real one. How could <i>his</i> little slip of
this morning, or yesterday, be the cause of this <i>terrible</i>
evil which has befallen him?--and he slides completely
over the real cause. <i>And keeps on repeating it</i>.</p>

<p>Self-righteousness, by blinding your eyes to the
truth, is the direct cause of the most gigantic and
the most subtle miseries of the world. These awfully
good people who fully realize how hard they have always
tried to do right, are the unhappiest people in
the world--unless I except Tom, Dick, Harry and Fan,
the victims of these self-righteous reformers. No, I
can't even except these; for they at least generally
succeed in having their own way in spite of the would-be
reformer. But what so utterly disheartening as
continued <i>lack of success</i>? And the self-righteous one
never succeeds. It is hard, <i>hard</i>, to be so wise and
willing, with such <i>high</i> ideals (the self-righteous one
is strong on ideals), and <i>never</i> to succeed in making
Tom, Dick and Harry conform to them. Do you see
why Jesus said so often, &quot;Woe comes to the Pharisee&quot;
--the self-righteous? And why he called them hypocrites?
Of course they are unconsicous of their hypocrisy--self-righteousness
blinds them to the truth; they think <i>others</i> are to blame for most of the self-righteous one's own hard conditions.</p>

<p>The self-righteous one is doomed to a tread-mill of
petty failures. He goes round and round his own little
personal point of view and learns nothing.</p>

<p>It is by getting at the <i>other fellow's</i> point of view
that we learn things--about him and ourselves, too.
When the self-righteous one wakes up to the <i>fact</i> that
the world is <i>full</i> of people whose points of view are
<i>just exactly</i> as right and wise and ideal as his own;
and begins to <i>feel with</i>, and PULL WITH these other
people, instead of against them; when he does this he
will find himself out of the treadmill to <i>stay</i>. As he
shows a disposition to consider <i>other</i> people's ideals
and help others in the line <i>they</i> want to go, he will find
the whole world eager to help <i>him</i> in the way <i>he</i> wants
to go. The self-righteous one works alone and meets
defeat. The one who, recognizing his own righteousness
<i>in intent</i>, yet forgets not that <i>others are even as
he,</i> is the true friend and <i>be</i>-friended, of all the world.</p>

<p>Now don't let this homily slip off <i>your</i> shoulders.
We are <i>all</i> self-righteous in spots, and none of us is so
<i>very</i> wise that he cannot by self-examination and readjustment
learn a lot more.</p>

<p>Each soul <i>in its place</i> is wisest and best. Don't <i>you</i>
try to get into the pilot house and steer things for Tom,
Dick, or Harry. Stay in your own and steer clear of
the rocks of anger, malice, revenge, <i>resentment, re-sistance,</i>
INTERFERENCE and <i>immoderation</i>.</p>


<br /><br /><hr style="width: 35%;" /><br /><br />
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR.</b></p>

<p>&quot;Help me to make things go forward instead of
backward. I want to be neat and attractive, with a
good head of hair, a good complexion and good health.
I want to help my husband so he will fall in love with
me to make home beautiful, attractive and comfortable.
I want bright eyes and freedom from that careworn
look. Oh, I want to draw my husband nearer
to me.&quot; (From a Taurus woman, aged twenty-seven.)</p>

<p>Isn't that pitiful? And heaven knows--or ought
to--how many poor women, <i>and men, too</i>, live with
that same dumb longing to get nearer and be chums
with somebody. That cry touches my heart, for I lived
years in the same state.</p>

<p>And, oh, how I struggled to draw others nearer
to me. How I agonized and cried and prayed over
it. How I worked to make home attractive. How I
cooked and washed and scrubbed, sewed and patched
and darned to please! How I quickly brushed my hair
and hustled into a clean dress so as to be neat and
ready when my husband came in! And how I ached
and despaired inwardly because he frowned and found
fault! How I studied books of advice to young wives!
How their advice failed! How I <i>tried</i> and TRIED
to get him to confide in me and make a chum of me!
And how the more I tried the more he had business
downtown! Oh, the growing despair of it all! And
the growing illnesses, too! Oh, the gulf that widened
and widened between us! Oh, the <i>loneliness</i>! Oh,
the <i>uselessness</i> of life!</p>

<p>I <i>had</i> to give it up. I wasn't enough of a hanger-on
to sink into a state of perpetual whining protest, or to
commit suicide. When I was finally <i>convinced</i> that I
<i>couldn't</i> draw him nearer I gave it up and began to
take notice again, <i>of other things</i>. I <i>let</i> him live his
life and I took up the <i>&quot;burden&quot;</i> of my own &quot;lonely&quot;
existence.</p>

<p>And the first thing I knew my &quot;burden&quot; had
grown <i>interesting</i>, and I was <i>no longer lonesome</i>. I
began to live my life to <i>please myself</i>, instead of living
it for the purpose of <i>making over</i> the life of another.</p>

<p>The <i>next</i> thing I knew my husband didn't have so
much business downtown, and he had more things
he wanted to tell me. I found we were nearer than I
ever dreamed we'd be.</p>

<p>You see, I had become <i>more comfortable to live
with.</i> I had quit <i>trying</i> to draw him nearer, and behold,
<i>he was already near</i>.</p>

<p>In the old days I lived strenuously. I hustled so
to get the house and the children and myself <i>just so</i>,
that I got <i>my aura</i> into a regular snarl. My husband
being a healthy animal, felt the snarl before he saw
the immaculateness; and like any healthy animal he
snarled back--and had business downtown. He responded
to my <i>real</i> mental and emotional state, responded
against his will many times; and I did not
know it. I supposed him perverse and impossible of
pleasing. I <i>knew I</i> had tried my best (according to
my lights, which it had not occurred to me to doubt),
but it never entered my cranium that <i>he</i> had tried, too.
I looked upon the outward appearance--my immaculate
appearance, met by fault-finding or indifference I
Poor me! Perverse he!</p>

<p>Poor Martha, troubled about many things, when
only one thing is needful--a quiet mind and faithful
soul. History does not state if Martha had a husband.
If she did, he was perpetually downtown. And Jesus
preferred Mary, the Comfortable One, to Martha.
Poor lonesome Martha! And she tried <i>so hard</i> to
please.</p>

<p>I used to know a woman who never did a thing
but look sweet. She was pretty and sympathetic and
<i>cheery</i>. Her husband and six children idolized her,
and fairly fell over themselves to please her and keep
the home beautiful for her. There was physical energy
galore lavished <i>gladly</i> by the family, in doing
what is commonly considered the mother's work.</p>

<p>And there was apparently nothing whatever the
matter with that woman, who was always sweet and
pretty as a new blown rose, and looked not a day over
twenty. She was simply born tired and wouldn't
work. Of course the neighbors said things about her;
but nobody <i>could</i> say things <i>to</i> such a sweet tempered,
cordial and pretty woman. And there'd have been
razors flying through the air if anybody had dared
hint to that husband or one of those children that
mother was anything less than perfection. The family
explanation was that &quot;mother is not strong.&quot;</p>

<p>But that mother did more for that family than all
the others put together. <i>She made the atmosphere</i>,
and she was the life-giving sun around which husband
and children revolved, and from which they received
the real Light of Life--the power which develops the
good in us.</p>

<p>The mother's main business in life was that of
<i>appreciating</i>. She was the confidante, the counsellor,
the optimistic teacher, and the appreciative audience
for six children and a husband, besides a lot of neighbors
who carried their troubles to her. She performed
more mental work than it takes to manage a billion
dollar trust. She kept six children, not only out of
mischief, but <i>happily busy</i> at all sorts of household
and outdoor work which it was well for them to know.
They learned to keep house and farm by keeping them,
whilst she sat by and enthused and directed their
efforts. She made them <i>love</i> it all. She helped them
over the hard places in their school work and enthused
them to do better work. They carried off the school
prizes under her admiring eyes, and ran straight to
lay them in her lap and receive that proud and happy
smile of hers.</p>

<p>Her husband worked like a slave <i>with the heart of
a king</i>. She thought him the best, bravest, brightest
of men, and told him so a dozen times a day, besides
<i>looking</i> it every time he came in range of her big,
loving brown eyes and smooth, rosy cheeks.</p>

<p>I never heard of an unkind word in that family,
and those six children grew up into splendid young
manhood and womanhood. Their mother is still the
blessed sun of their existence. She is prettier, healthier
and happier now, and so proud of her fine children.</p>

<p>And she is <i>up-to-date.</i> She has studied and read
with her whole family and is interested with them
in the world's present events, art, literature and religion.</p>

<p>Do you think that woman ever complains of loneliness,
or &quot;tries so hard&quot; to draw husband or children
&quot;nearer&quot;? No. She long ago chose the &quot;one
thing needful&quot;--<i>a faith-full heart</i>. Her physical
strength would not bear much strain without depressing
her faith-full-ness; therefore she left the physical
labor out, <i>as less important</i>. To her the <i>Life</i> was more
than meat or raiment, so she ministered to the Life--
to the joy of living. A stronger woman, physically,
could have ministered more efficiently to the physical
side without neglecting the &quot;one thing needful.&quot;
This woman chose the better part and stuck to it; and
<i>results</i> prove her righteousness.</p>

<p>The foolish woman looketh upon the outward appearance
and is troubled over <i>many</i> things. She wears
herself out trying to keep the <i>outside</i> immaculate and
grieves her heart out because she misses the one
thing of great price, the <i>joy of loving and being loved,
of trusting and being trusted</i>.</p>

<p>Do you know that we are <i>never</i> far away from <i>anybody</i>?
We are close, <i>so close</i> to our husbands; our
children; our friends; <i>even to our enemies if we have
them;</i> and to those we never saw or heard of. <i>We are
all One. Your</i> soul is MY SOUL TOO. Only our
bodies are at all separated, and they are separated
<i>only as the harbor is separated from the sea</i>. Our
bodies are but inlets of One Great Soul; and they are
but the smallest part of ourselves. Is it then not
foolish to <i>try</i> to draw another nearer? Why, we are
<i>now</i> so near we <i>can't</i> be nearer; we are <i>One</i>. Why
strive to do what is <i>already</i> done?</p>

<p>Ah, you see, we work from a false hypothesis. We
are so concerned with the many things on the <i>outside</i>
that we lose sight of <i>inside truths</i>.</p>

<p><i>Take your husband's nearness for granted</i>. Be
not troubled over the many things of appearance.
<i>Have faith in him</i>. If there is any &quot;drawing nearer&quot;
to be done see that <i>you</i> draw near to him <i>in faith and
love</i>. Instead of mentally or verbally sitting down on
his motives, words or acts, <i>try to feel as he does, that
you may understand him</i>.</p>

<p>AS WE GEOW IN UNDERSTANDING OF
ANOTHER WE GROW IN LOVE AND REALIZATION
OF OUR NEARNESS TO THAT ONE. <i>In
proportion as we dislike or are repelled by any person</i>
OR HIS ACTIONS, <i>in that proportion we fail to
understand him</i>.</p>

<p>As one human being is revealed to another the sense
of nearness grows. Now do you imagine that distrust
and censure will help a soul reveal itself? Of course
not. But if you can be comfortable and indulgent to
a man, and especially if you can cultivate a real admiring
confidence in him, he will unfold his very heart
of hearts to you. It is <i>you</i> who must come near in
faith and love, if you would find your husband near
to you.</p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<p>1. You and your husband ARE close together--
so close you are <i>One</i>.</p>

<p>2. If you would <i>feel</i> the truth of this you must
come to your husband in faith-full love, and you <i>must
not allow yourself</i> to condemn or judge, verbally or
mentally, his revelations of himself. You must vibrate
<i>with</i> him where you can, and <i>keep still in faith</i> where
you can't understand him and meet him.</p>

<p>3. You must persist in thus doing, until faith
and love and understanding become the habit of your
life.</p>

<p>4. The same rules apply if you would feel your
nearness to any other person, <i>or to all persons</i>.</p>

<p>Every man is in embryo a good and thoughtful and
loving husband. A wise wife will give him the loving,
full-of-faith, appreciative atmosphere which encourages
development.</p>

<p>&quot;We are all just as good as we know how to be, and
as bad as we dare be.&quot; <i>And we are all growing better</i>.
Why not chant the beauties of the good instead of
imagining it our &quot;duty&quot; to eternally bark against the
bad?</p>

<p>It is said there cannot be a model husband without
a model wife, and <i>vice versa</i>. True. Then if yours is
not a model husband <i>don't assume that you are a
model wife fitted to judge and admonish him</i>.</p>

<p>Be still and get acquainted with him.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" /><br />

<p>Make it your <i>first</i> object in life to cultivate a
serene and faith-full heart and aura.</p>

<p>As a means toward this end cultivate a <i>full</i> appreciation
of whatever and whoever comes near you.
Cultivate the spirit of praise; and <i>trust</i> where you
cannot see.</p>

<p>Second, take <i>good</i> care of your body and personal
appearance. Allow plenty of time for bathing, caring
for your hair, nails, teeth, and clothing. Wear plain
clothes if need be, but DON'T wear soiled or ragged
ones. And don't ever put a pin where a hook or
button ought to be. No man can continue to love a
woman who is slatternly.</p>

<p>Third, allow at least an hour <i>every</i> day for reading
and meditating on new thought lines, <i>and for going
into the silence. Let nothing rob you of this hour,
for of it will come wisdom, love and power to meet the
work and trials of all other hours. Remember the parable
of the ten virgins and take this hour for filling your
lamp, that you be ready for the Unexpected. Only in
such hours can you lay up love, wisdom and power
which will enable you to make the best of the other
hours. Let not outward things rob you of your source
of power</i>.</p>

<p>Fourth, unless you wish to fall behind the world's
procession see that you spend some time every day
in reading the best magazines and newspapers, taking
pains to skip most of the criminal news. Read optimistically
and cultivate a quick eye for all the good
things. Take the <i>best</i> magazines even if you have to
leave feathers off your hat and desserts off your table.
If you can find an <i>interesting</i> literary club it might be
well to join it and do your part of the work. But see
that you do not <i>rob</i> the Peter of your energies to pay
the Paul of club ambitions.</p>

<p>And fifthly comes your housework. This is the
juggernaut department which grinds many a woman
to skin and bones--and her husband discards the remains!
When it comes to housekeeping a woman has
need of all the love, wisdom and power she can muster
in her hours of silence. Even a five room flat or
cottage is more than one woman can keep <i>spotless</i> and
allow time for anything else. Many things <i>must</i> be
left undone. The wise woman simplifies to the last
degree compatible with comfort. Useless bric-a-brac
is dispensed with. &quot;Not how much but <i>how good</i>,&quot; is
her rule when buying. A few good things <i>kept in
place</i>, are better than a clutter of flimsy things which
pander only to an uncultured esthetic taste--and make
work. <i>Order</i> is the wise woman's first law in housekeeping; cleanliness her second, which is like unto the
first in importance. She lets extra rooms, furniture
and fallals go <i>until she can pay well to have them
cared for</i>. The same rule obtains in her kitchen and
her personal dress.</p>

<p>The wise woman thinks of comfort and allows time
for the <i>joys</i> of life, wherefore <i>all</i> her life is a pleasure.</p>

<p>The foolish woman is ground under the wheels of
routine. To her, housework is a stern &quot;duty&quot; which
comes <i>first</i>, and to which body, mind, personal appearance,
happiness, the joy of living, all must be sacrificed.</p>

<p>Lastly, firstly, and all the time, the wise woman is
guided in what to do and in what to leave undone, by
the Spirit of Love; whilst the foolish woman is guided
by the Spirit of Appearances.</p>

<p>Note the order in which I have written these
needs of life; an exact reversal of the usual order.
Housework <i>last</i>, and the Spirit of Comfort first. The
tendency of every woman is to lose <i>herself</i> in troubling
over the many things of her household. If she would
be happy, useful, young and growing she MUST turn
her life the other side up.</p>

<p>The best way to begin, the only successful way so
far as I know, is by MAKING time for the hour of
reading and meditation and silence. She must <i>take</i>
the time, by sheer force of will--take it until it grows
into a habit which <i>takes her</i>. Out of this hour will
come first peace and self-control; and gradually she
will find unfolding out of this peace and control, the
wisdom to know what to do, and how; and what <i>not</i>
to do. From this unfolding comes the ONLY power
which can make new thought practical to the individual
case.</p>

<p>Are you satisfied with yourself and your condition?
Then pursue your old ways.</p>

<p>Are you dissatisfied with yourself and surroundings?
<i>In order to change them</i> YOU <i>must change</i>--
<i>that which was first with you must become last</i> AND
THE LAST MUST BE FIRST.</p>

<p>Be still and know the I AM God of you; and, lo,
all <i>things</i> shall be added. But the <i>things</i> must be last,
not first.</p>

<p>Seek ye <i>first</i> the kingdom of Good in yourself, <i>and
to be right with it</i>; and all things shall be added. All
things shall be added to YOU, not to <i>other things</i>.</p>

<p>Be still until you find yourself--your wise, loving,
joy-giving Self which dwells in the silence and is able
to do whatsoever you desire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>MARRIAGE CONTRACTS.</b></p>

<p>&quot;That article of yours, 'So Near and Yet So
Far,' has worried me to an extent I am ashamed
of. To my 'judgment' that article is disingenuous.
It is not so much that you jumped on that poor
soul with hob-nailed shoes, but that you formulated
the 'jump' quite as the husband might have
done. That is, if <i>she</i> would repent and change her
course, she would soon find that <i>he</i> was all right,
and--inferentially--all the trouble was of her making.
Not one word on the other side! You even quote your
own experience <i>against</i> her. My dear, <i>did</i> you really
find that your 'trouble' was of your own making, and
<i>did</i> you really change ANYTHING except your own
amount of distress during the process of disintegration?
Marriage is the only contract which society does
not promptly admit to be broken when either party
refuses to fulfill his obligations--as agreed to. And
in view of the custom of ages, and the instinct in
woman formed by such custom (when instinct makes
the establishing of Individuality the <i>very</i> hardest
thing in life for a generous woman), I think that your
implication against the woman, trying with all the
light she's <i>got</i> to keep her side of that very one-sided
contract is simply--cruel! I wish I could get at that
girl and tell her that her <i>only</i> chance for happiness
is through the paradox 'Whoso <i>will</i> not lose his life
<i>cannot</i> find it.' Whoso will not 'let go' of the love
which his five per cent judgment claims as his only
<i>righteous</i> chance, cannot inherit that which the ninety-five
per cent would attract if the five per cent were
'offered up' to the spirit. This is the first time I have
ever disagreed with your point of view.&quot; Jane.</p>

<p>That article, &quot;So Near and Yet So Far,&quot; has
brought forth volumes of comment, most of it highly
favorable, and nearly all of it from women themselves.
But among the writers were three critics, and among
the critics one of the brightest women I know, whose
letter appears above.</p>

<p>And she says that article is to her disingenuous.
Of course it is, for she has not yet arrived at the point
of <i>giving up her own way</i>. She is still a Pharisee of
the Pharisees--on the surface. She is proud; she
<i>knows</i> she has done her best to bring things right--according
to her judgment of right; and she <i>does hate</i>
to acknowledge her foolishness! She will &quot;hold fast
her own integrity&quot; as long as there is a shred of it
left! Don't I know? Didn't I do exactly the same
thing? Of course. But the pressure of the great
spirit of love, wisdom, justice, was too much for me;
I <i>had</i> to give up my judgment; I <i>had</i> to acknowledge
that there <i>must</i> be the same spirit expressing in
my husband's judgment; I <i>had</i> to let go, be still
and get at <i>his</i> point of view. Jane, too, will have to do
it. And the fact that that article &quot;worried her to an
extent she is ashamed of,&quot; is the proof. When Truth
presses her point we worry until we can hold out no
longer; then we give in.</p>

<p>One of the other two critics writes that over that
article she &quot;shed the first tears in over seven years.&quot;
Then she asks me if I don't think I was a &quot;little hard
on the Taurus woman,&quot; and goes on to reveal plainly
that her tears were those of <i>self-pity.</i> Don't I know?
Haven't I shed quarts of such tears? Of course. But
not more than an ounce or two were shed after I gave
up my own way. But this second critic is arriving
just as I did, and as Jane will--arriving all unconsciously
to herself. Her letter sounds like a chapter
from my own thinking of a dozen years ago. She gives
a bird's eye view of her husband--no, of her husband's
<i>faults</i>; she tells how she reads new thought literature
on the sly--just as I did; and she winds up with this
<i>piece</i> of good advice:</p>

<p>&quot;I will say to such, live your own life as God intended
you to, regardless of the fact of your husband.
Be brave, hope, will and pray. Dress, look sweet. If
your husband tells you he doesn't care how you look
but to not come near him with your foolishness, as
mine does, why, let him live his life in his own way,
make home attractive for your own sake, read good
books; and in time books will be your chum.&quot;</p>

<p>The third critic, too, is full of self-pity, though she
does not mention her tears; and her letter is a long
portrait of her husband's faults. She wants a little
encouragement to leave him, but she is afraid he will
go to the dogs if she does. So, like a generous woman,
she sticks to him and makes the best (?) of a bad
bargain.</p>

<p>Jane says my article was &quot;cruel.&quot; Dearie, it was--as
the surgeon's knife is cruel. But it is the truth,
and it hurts but to make way for healing. The woman
who blames has in her eye something worse than a
cataract. The woman who sheds tears over her &quot;fate&quot;
is moved by the &quot;meanest of emotions.&quot; She attracts
&quot;cruelty,&quot; not only from that article, <i>but from her
husband.</i></p>

<p>It takes <i>two</i> to quarrel, <i>and either one can stop it</i>.
It takes <i>two</i> to maintain &quot;strained relations,&quot; and
<i>either one can ease the strain</i>. The principles I tried
to elucidate in that article are as applicable to a man
as to a woman. But it was a woman, a Taurus woman,
who asked me; therefore I talked straight to her.
And <i>I</i> am a Taurus woman who has been through the
same mill; and I wrote not from a hardened heart but
from one made tender by experience and the Spirit
of Truth. My point of view &quot;might have been the
husband's&quot; <i>if</i> the husband had been an unusually just
one. And I must say the husband's point of view is
more apt to be <i>just</i>, than the wife's; for the reason that
a woman is more apt to be blinded by <i>emotional self-interest.</i>
In proportion as man or woman is ruled by
emotion his judgment is distorted. <i>As a rule man's
judgment</i> is straighter than a woman's. But judgment
is a shallow thing, based upon <i>already revealed
facts.</i> Woman's intuition goes to the heart of things
and flashes facts into revelation. Women as a rule
<i>see farther</i>, but are apt to misjudge what is <i>close at
hand.</i> Only as man wakes in woman and woman in
man do right judgment and love commune. Why not
judge with the husband, as I <i>feel</i> with the wife? Is
any man <i>totally</i> depraved?</p>

<p>Jane feels abused because she thinks <i>I</i> think that
in family strains the woman is more at fault. <i>In a
sense</i> I do. <i>Women cannot only make and unmake
empires but they DO make or fail to make harmony</i>
<i>at home</i>. Why, men with all their power are mere
rag babies in the hands of women of <i>tact</i>. Women
are the <i>real</i> power in the world--the power behind the
throne. If only they would develop that particular
kind of power instead of coming around in front of
the throne to lay down the law!--instead of measuring
their <i>man</i>-strength against man. Real <i>woman</i>-strength
will move the most stubborn of men. If I
&quot;blame&quot; the woman <i>(I blame neither, any more than
I blame a child for childishness)</i> it is because <i>I know
she is the ruling power</i>. Her responsibility is determined
by her real power.</p>

<p>And above all a Taurus woman may rule her home--<i>and
does</i>. Either she rules by force--for she has
more than her share of the man in her--and makes
war and trouble for herself and others; or she learns
her lesson and rules by <i>loving tact</i>; in which case her
husband rises up and calls her <i>blessed</i>. The <i>woman
who knows and rules herself</i> is the woman of Proverbs
XXXI, 10th to 31st verses. Her husband is honored
among men <i>because he is honored at home</i>; and because
he is honored he <i>lives up to it</i>. Why, girls, you
hold your husband's destiny in the hollow of your
hand, in a far greater sense than any man holds a
woman's.</p>

<p>But as I said before, <i>it takes two to make an unhappy
home and either one can bring harmony out of
discord.</i> Any ordinary woman can do it <i>if she will</i>.
And any extraordinary man can do it quite as well
as an ordinary woman.</p>

<p>This is not a question of what &quot;society&quot; admits;
it is a personal question between one man and one
woman. It <i>is</i> a partnership, whether society so admits
or not. And the failure of one of the partners to live
up to the expressed or implied agreement does not
justify the other party in the misdoing of her part
<i>as long as they live together</i>. Does one theft or murder
justify another? No! Neither does a neglectful
husband justify a scolding or spiteful wife, nor <i>vice
versa.</i></p>

<p>Two people marry <i>first</i>, for the happiness of love;
and second, for home privileges. No matter whether
love flees or not, <i>as long as they keep up</i> the home-privileges
partnership it should be done in the spirit
of harmony. Remember, it takes <i>two</i> to destroy harmony
and <i>either one can restore it</i>. If marriage is not
a love contract let it at least be a harmonious business
contract. If you can't, or won't, <i>adjust yourself</i> to
your husband, then leave him. Don't stay and half-do
your part of the business and cultivate hate and
contempt. It's hell. <i>Get out</i>.</p>

<p>I have known several couples who lived years in
comparative happiness after love had flown; who were
kind to each other, considerate, business-like. The
wives made pleasant homes and the husbands
came and went at will. In their spare time the
wives developed their personal interests and &quot;lived
their own lives,&quot; as critic number two advises. When
the husbands took cranky streaks the wives simply
made light of it to themselves, and forgot it as soon
as possible. They lived on as comfortable terms as
if the wives were simply <i>first-class</i> hired house-keepers;
little crankisms were all in the bargain. Eventually
every one of these couples separated, and nearly
all the parties are now <i>happily</i> married. <i>And every</i>
<i>couple parted amicably</i>; each being <i>satisfied</i> to terminate the old partnership.</p>

<p>To me a divorce is not a disgrace, but a family
row <i>is</i>. And I suspect that most divorce <i>rows</i> are
worked up to <i>drown guilty consciences</i>. Neither has
done his best by the other, and he knows it; so he
raises a great row to fix attention on the other's shortcomings
that his own may escape observation.</p>

<p>Until a man and woman have succeeded in living
up to their home privileges in a manner befitting
honest and intelligent man and woman, <i>they can't be
sure that they are not fitted for a real loving union</i>.
Friction over small things obscures vision and judgment,
and hate hides the lovableness that <i>must</i> lie in
every being. Get rid of the rowing over little things
of every day life, and you will be able to love as much
as your marriage will permit; <i>and you will be free
to dissolve the entire partnership if you desire</i>.</p>

<p>Did I <i>really</i> change anything? <i>Yes</i>. Is it &quot;anything&quot;
to bring peace and quiet pleasure and comfort
and appreciation where their opposites were wont to
hold bacchanale? <i>Yes</i>.</p>

<p>No woman who <i>honestly</i> tries the course I have
endeavored to outline will ever doubt that she really
accomplishes <i>something</i>; neither will she regret.</p>

<p>Here is a word every married woman will do well
to heed as long as she lives with her husband: <i>If you
can't have your way without a fuss, then try his with
a good will</i>.</p>

<p>Peace be unto you; peace, which is the foundation
for <i>all you desire</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>SOME HINTS AND A KICK.</b></p>

<p>&quot;And now, Elizabeth, let me suggest something.
Punch up the <i>men</i> a little in the matter of cultivating
cleanly habits, etc. Women are preached to eternally
on these matters and the men wholly neglected. It
would be a 'new thought' to take to the men a little
and might assist in making more of them fit companions
for the sweet and cleanly women they delight in
associating with. The absolute neglect of the masculine
sex by writers on these subjects causes them to
think that nothing in the way of the aesthetic is expected
of them. It is a wrong to the men not to en-me
and make me his chum as well as his wife. Help
courage them to aspire to a common plane with woman
in the matters of purity and cleanliness. Cleanliness
is next to Godliness, but no more so in the case of
woman than of man. It is time for equality to be
recognized in this matter as in all others.&quot; Carrie.</p>

<p>It is funny how many women squirm when reminded
that it is they who set the pace in the home!
We are always longing for power and a field of effort,
and then when a 20th century prophetess arises and
tells us we <i>are</i> all but almighty, and shows us how to
direct our almightiness to accomplish results, we--well,
we squirm. One would think some of us are a
little bit ashamed of the pace we have been setting, of
the things we have been accomplishing with our almightiness!
You know, our first impulse when we see
an error in our own selves is to sound the trumpet and
charge upon the error in the other fellow. Is this why
Carrie wants the men scolded?</p>

<p>Well, <i>don't</i> they get scolded? What are their
wives and daughters and sweethearts for but to scold
'em or coax 'em into cleaner ways of living? No use
to talk to men as a class, about anything but politics.
Don't you know that Adam couldn't even taste an
apple until Eve coaxed him? Adam is a great theorizer;
he will gaze at an apple and tell you that he
ought not to eat it, and <i>why</i> not; he will even amble
long and wishfully about that apple; but it takes <i>Eve</i>
to wake in him the <i>living impulse</i> to take it. Just so
with matters of personal neatness. He knows--oh,
yes, knowing is his long suit!--he knows he &quot;ought&quot;
to be neat; and he thinks he wants to be; but unless
Eve and the serpent come along he hasn't the <i>living
impulse</i>.</p>

<p>And Eve must not lose sight of the serpent, however
far away the dove may fly. Eve must use wisdom
and tact, as well as example; if she would have Adam
accept her standard of cleanliness she must see to it
that her example is <i>beautifully</i> clean instead of <i>painfully</i> so. There are men who are careless about their
persons simply as a matter of relief from the painful
cleanness of their surroundings.</p>

<p>Then there are Adams who are careless for lack of
interest in pleasing Eve. In these cases you will find
that Eve has little or no interest in pleasing Adam; or
that she overdoes the matter of trying to please, and
frequently dissolves in tears and precipitates countless
reproaches upon luckless Adam.</p>

<p>Then there are Adams who are careless from petty
spite--with shame I say it. And with greater shame
I say, you will find their Eves are spiteful, too; probably
more spiteful than the Adams; for Eve, you
know, is generally smart enough and ambitious enough
to outdo Adam in any line of endeavor--especially in
the use or misuse of the tongue.</p>

<p>In matters of niceness it is Eve who sets the pace.
Adam is built for strength; Eve for beauty and adornment.
It is <i>natural</i> for Eve to set the pace and for
Adam to follow, in all matters of detail and niceness.
Whether Adam follows with good grace or ill depends
upon Eve and the serpent. If Eve is wise as the
serpent in her, and harmless as the dove in her, she
can lead Adam a <i>willing</i> captive to heaven or hell.</p>

<p>Now will you rise again and--squirm--because I
attribute to Eve all power over Adam? Will you say
I excuse Adam's transgressions and come down hard
on Eve? I suppose so. But the very fact that you
resent the imputation is proof that in your heart of
hearts you know I have hit <i>very close</i> to the mark.
When an arrow flies wide we are merely amused at
the poor marksmanship; but the closer the arrow
strikes to the center the more excited we grow--either
with resentment or admiration, according to our sympathies.</p>

<p>In matters of cleanliness, niceness and adornment
Eve sets the pace; and if her pace is a graceful one
and <i>not too fast</i> Adam follows. In due time he <i>acquires
the habit</i> of doing the little ablutions and adornings
Eve has taught him.</p>

<p>If your Adam is <i>very</i> careless about these matters
you may depend upon it that when he was growing up
his mother was either dead or careless or tactless;
and you may safely suspect that Adam in his previous
state of existence was a forlorn old bach. So be gentle
with him, for it will take time to correct the faults of
such an Adam.</p>

<p>But don't give up, Eve, dear. Be gentle, but be
firm and persistent. Use your ingenuity in finding
ways to make Adam <i>want</i> to please you; and if you
can look back over a year or two and see that he <i>has</i>
improved in <i>some</i> respects at least, that there are even
one or two little tricks of niceness which have become
almost if not quite habitual, then hold a little praise
meeting and rejoice. Praise him for learning, and
praise yourself for what you have succeeded in teaching
him. And if your success has come <i>without friction</i>,
if you have inspired Adam to <i>want</i> to please you,
then glorify yourself exceedingly--<i>all to yourself, of
course</i>. If you let Adam know you are managing
him even for his own good, he will show his independence
by going back to his old tricks--just as <i>you</i>
would do if in his place. If there has been friction, or
lack of success, let it wake you up to use henceforth
<i>more of the wisdom and love which is in you</i>.</p>

<p>Now this little homily is written ostensibly to
women; but all my men subscribers will read it and
applaud. <i>I wonder how many of them will see that
every word of it is as applicable to themselves, as to
their mothers, sisters, sweethearts, wives</i>? Every Eve
is Adam at heart, and every Adam is Eve; and what
in sauce for Adam will prove equally effective with
Eve. Adam and Eve are both green, and growing.
They are the two halves of a ripening peach, brought
together by the Law of Attraction or Love because at
this stage in their development <i>they fit</i>. You will be
inclined to doubt that every Adam's nature fits his
Eve's, but I say unto you judge not according to outward
appearance but judge righteous judgment. Now
listen:--Every human being has his manifested good
points and his <i>latent</i> good points. The manifest good
points of a man are the Adam of him; the <i>latent</i> good
points--the weak places in him--are the Eve of him--the
interior as-yet-undeveloped part of him. The
strong points, the good points, of a woman are the
Eve; the weak points, where she is as yet undeveloped,
are the Adam or interior nature of her.</p>

<p>If it were not for personal attractions, particularly
the attractions of one man and one woman, the <i>latent</i>
parts of both men and women would remain forever
undeveloped and their strong points would continue
to grow stronger. In time (supposing the race did
not die out), there would be two classes of people
utterly different and at variance with each other--two
opposites with no understanding or sympathy for each
other.</p>

<p>Attraction brings together opposites; the strong,
steady man falls in love with a frivolous butterfly;
a handsome woman attracts a homely man and <i>vice
versa;</i> a strong, capable woman marries a sickly, incompetent
man--and supports him; a sentimental
woman is attracted to a matter-of-fact man who develops
her common sense by pruning her sentimentalities;
an artistic temperament is drawn to a phlegmatic;
a sanguine to a bilious; a mental to a vital;
an active man marries a lazy wife, or <i>vice versa</i>; a
bright man marries a stupid girl; and so on and on.</p>

<p>Man and wife are a rounded whole in which the
man manifests what is latent in the woman, and the
woman supplies that which in the man is as yet undeveloped.
Just as Eve coaxes, or scolds, Adam into
habits of neatness; as Adam coaxes, scolds or drives
Eve into having his meals on time, thus developing her
self-command and <i>promptness</i>; so they act and re-act
upon each other to develop a thousand latencies of
which they, and the onlookers, are more or less unconscious.</p>

<p>The foolish Adams and Eves fret and strain against
these processes of development, and bewail their &quot;mistake&quot;
in marrying; not seeing that the association is
really benefiting both. The wise Adams and Eves
reduce the friction <i>by kindness</i>, by <i>co-operation with
each other</i>; Adam <i>tries</i> to please Eve, Eve tries to
please Adam, and both are kind about it, wherefore
in due time their <i>appreciation</i> for each other grows,
and mayhap their love grows with it. If love wanes
instead of growing at least they are <i>friends</i>, and can
<i>part</i> as friends if they so desire.</p>

<p>Someone has well said that without a model husband
there can be no model wife. I believe it. As
long as man and woman are held together by love,
attraction, or &quot;conditions&quot; (in its last analysis it is
<i>all</i> the Law of Attraction, or <i>God</i>) they are literally
<i>one</i>, no matter how hard they kick against the oneness;
and neither man nor woman can <i>alone</i> be a model, any
more than one side of a peach can be <i>entirely</i> ripe and
sweet and the other side entirely hard and green.</p>

<p>So when I speak to Eve about tact and kindness
I speak to <i>the Eve in Adam</i> as well as in Eve herself.</p>

<p>And what I say of the attractions of man and wife
applies equally well to other family relationships, to
friendships, to acquaintanceships and even to our relationship
to the people we pass on the street or <i>the
heathen we never saw</i>. Every person who touches us
even in the slightest degree, <i>is drawn by the law of
attraction because we need him to bring out some latency
in ourselves, and because HE needs us to help
develop some latency in him</i>. IT IS OUR OWN
HIGHEST DESIRES (the god in us) WHICH CONSTITUTE
THE ATTRACTION.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but <i>that</i> can't be,&quot; you exclaim, &quot;because So-and-So
brings out only the <i>evil</i> in me. He makes me
feel <i>so</i> hateful and mean.&quot; Let us see, dearie. <i>The
hateful and mean feelings are due to your RESISTING
that which his influence would bring out of you.</i>
For instance, you were late at your appointment with
him. Of course you <i>thought</i> you had a good excuse;
but if promptitude were <i>one of your strong points</i>,
instead of one of your latencies, you would have been
on time in spite of that excuse--if it were your <i>habit</i>
to be on time you'd have swept aside a much greater
hindrance before you would have allowed yourself to
be behind time. Now So-and-so is naturally prompt
and, having had some experience with you he knew
you were not; so when, he having arrived fifteen minutes
ahead of time as it is <i>his</i> nature to do, <i>you</i> came
tripping in fifteen minutes late--smiling confidingly
as you excused yourself (he, having spent the half
hour in cultivating a grouch at you for not being
as prompt as himself)--he, of course, looked sulky and
answered shortly. Then you pouted and finally
<i>worked yourself</i> into quite a temper over his inconsiderateness
and crankiness because of that paltry
little fifteen minutes he had to wait. He <i>worked himself</i>
into a temper because you were not on time; you
<i>worked yourself</i> into a temper because he wasn't
&quot;nice.&quot; All that working was your individual doings.</p>

<p>But it all resulted in your resolving that if ever
you had another engagement with that man (you'd
take good care not to if you could help it, though!)
you'd be <i>on time</i> if it killed you. Of course you didn't
tell him so. And <i>he</i> resolved that the next time he
made an engagement with you he'd know it, but <i>if</i>
he did he would make up his mind to be <i>on</i> time instead
of ahead of time, and he'd not care if you <i>were</i>
late.</p>

<p>So you see, the Law of Attraction accomplished
its divine purpose in attracting you two to make that
engagement--it waked in you a <i>resolution</i> toward
promptness; and it waked in him a <i>resolution</i> to be
<i>on</i> time rather than <i>before</i> time in future, and to be
civil if you happened to be late--since you are only a
woman and can't be expected to appreciate the value
of promptness!</p>

<p>This is the way all our associations in life work together
for good <i>to develop our latencies</i>, to strengthen
our weak points. <i>The wiser we are the less emotion
we waste in resenting the developing process--the
more readily we see the point and take the resolution
hinted at.</i> You see you and your friend had had other
such experiences as the one described--you had been
late before when So-and-so condoned the matter and
said nothing. <i>He let you off so easily that you never
thought of resolving not to be late again.</i> You <i>felt</i>
that he had been displeased but you depended upon
your niceness to make it all right again, and it never
occurred to you to call yourself to account and <i>resolve</i>
that it should not happen so again. You were <i>too
heedless</i> to take a hint, so you had to have a kick.</p>

<p>You may set this down as a rule without exceptions:
<i>That all the kicks you get from relatives or
friends come after you have ignored repeated hints
from your own inner consciousness and them</i>. You
have gone on excusing yourself <i>without correcting the
fault</i> (perhaps without seeing it) until the Law of
Attraction stopped hinting and administered a kick.
And if <i>one</i> kick will not cause you to develop that weak
point the Law of Attraction will bring you other and
yet harder kicks on the same line. <i>You will attract</i>
worse experiences of the same sort.</p>

<p>It is this very law which makes married folks (or
other relatives or friends) quarrel. Adam refuses
Eve's <i>hints</i> about neatness, and Eve kicks--harder and
harder. Eve refuses Adam's hints and he gets to
kicking. <i>It</i> ALWAYS <i>takes two to start the kicking</i>,
AND EITHER ONE CAN STOP IT. <i>A frank acknowledgement
of error and a</i> RESOLUTION <i>to mend
your end of the fault no matter what is done with the
other end; then a pleasant expression and</i> NO MORE
WORDS;--this will stop the kicking. <i>And in proportion
as you learn to take the</i> HINTS <i>you attract,
you will cease to attract kicks</i>.</p>

<p>By all of which I am reminded of that old testament
statement that '<i>the Lord hardened the heart of
Pharoah</i>.' The &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lord God&quot; of the old
testament is what I call the <i>God in us</i>, or the Law of
Attraction in us; and the &quot;God&quot; of the Bible is The
Whole--the God <i>over all</i> as well as <i>in the individual</i>.
It is the <i>God in us</i> which attracts to us our experiences,
<i>in order to teach us wisdom and knowledge</i>. Pharoah
was not <i>wise</i> enough to let those people go, so the God
in Moses gave him a hint--which he failed to take.
Wherefore he attracted a gentle kick in the way of a
plague. This dashed his ardor a bit and he gave permission
for the Israelites to go; but he was only <i>scared</i>
into doing it; and after the plague was called off he
was not wise enough to keep his word--here was a
great lot of valuable slaves which he <i>could</i> keep, and
why shouldn't he?--his word was easy broken and
all's fair in business; so <i>his heart hardened</i> and he held
the Israelites. So he attracted a harder kick; which
failed to accomplish its purpose. Kick after kick
came, each a bit harder than the last; each scaring
Pharoah for the moment, but <i>none convincing him</i>.
He still thought it <i>right</i> to hang onto his slaves if he
could, and he had the courage of his convictions. A
man of such splendid courage seems worthy of a better
fate. Pharoah had the courage of a Christ, coupled
with the ethics of a savage, whose only law is his own
desire of possession. Because he could not take the
hint and <i>see his mistake</i>, he attracted a series of kicks
increasing in power until one finally landed him in the
Red Sea. Perhaps a glimmer of the truth reached
him as the waters rolled over. But his soul goes
marching on and his mistakes are still re-incarnating
here on earth.</p>

<p>Is Adam kicking, Eve? Take a hint before he kicks
harder. Is Eve making things warm for you, Adam?
Take care you jump not out of the frying pan into the
fire. Are circumstances plaguing you, Everybody?
Take the hint lest worse plagues arrive; learn wisdom
and avoid the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Be not wise in thine own conceits. <i>Lean</i> not upon
thine own understanding, but in <i>all</i> thy ways <i>and thy
neighbor's ways</i>, acknowledge that the One Good
Spirit leads, and He shall direct thy feet in paths
of peace and pleasantness.</p>

<p>The proof of foolishness is unrest and friction.</p>

<p>The proof of wisdom is peace.</p>

<p><i>Be still and know the Lord thy God, and learn from
what He draws to thee</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>THE HEART OF WOMAN.</b></p>

<p>&quot;My wife has fallen in love with another man.
She keeps house for me and I am trying to show her
all the love I can but it seems to have no effect upon
her. I love her dearly and desire to win her back.
What should be my attitude toward her and toward
the man?&quot; A.J. (who is one of many who have thus
written me.)</p>

<p>Goodness knows! <i>Be</i> good and you will know.
In other words, be just to all three before you are
generous to anybody. Of course that is not easy to
do, but it is possible; and it is the only thing you can
never be sorry for afterward.</p>

<p>First, get down to first principles. There are three
INDIVIDUALS concerned--three separate and complete
beings, each with his inherent right of choice.
Nobody <i>owns</i> anybody else; nobody &quot;owes&quot; anybody
else anything in the way of &quot;duty.&quot; Each individual
stands on his or her own two feet and makes an effort
at least to go where he or she will find the most happiness.</p>

<p>Every one of these three Individuals has made
mistakes--he or she has thought happiness was to be
found in this place, or that. He or she has made the
choice and trotted on his or her two feet to this place
or that, only to find happiness was not there as he or
she supposed. <i>We don't always know what is for our
happiness</i>. But goodness knows!--and <i>all</i> our mistakes
work together for ultimate happiness.</p>

<p>In the truest sense there are <i>no</i> mistakes; a mistake
being simply a case where things failed to come out
as we calculated. <i>They came out right nevertheless</i>.
That is, they came out right for our enlightenment.
By them we grew in wisdom and knowledge. Next
time our judgment will be better.</p>

<p>The wife in this case no doubt thinks just now that
her marriage to A.J., was &quot;all a terrible mistake.&quot;
If so she is making another &quot;mistake.&quot; That is, she
is thinking what &quot;ain't so.&quot; Whatever experiences
she has had with A.J. were drawn to her by herself,
for her own enlightenment and development. They
were all <i>good</i>.</p>

<p>It <i>may</i> be that she and A.J. have gained from their
association all there is in it. Doubtless the wife thinks
a separation and a new marriage would make her
supremely happy. May be it would. May be her
judgment is right this time.</p>

<p>On the other hand it may be wrong, as it has been
oft before. Many a woman has jumped out of the
frying pan of one marriage into the fire of another.</p>

<p><i>Only time will tell</i>. If this new love is the &quot;soul
mate&quot; she thinks, the attraction will be all the stronger
and steadier in a year or two from now. If he is not
the soul mate she thinks him, the attraction will wane.</p>

<p>I know women who, under similar conditions, have
elected to wait; women whose consciences would not
allow them to leave a kind husband or young children
for the sake of gratifying their passion for another
man. <i>I have known these same women to despise a
year or two later, the men they had thought themselves
passionately and everlastingly in love with</i>. They
have never got over thanking whatever gods there be
that they were saved from that rash step. I have
known <i>many</i> cases of this kind, and have received
many letters of fervent thanks from both men and
women who followed my private counsel to <i>let time
prove the new attraction</i> before severing old ties and
making new ones.</p>

<p>And I must say that <i>not one</i> who waited but has
said to me, &quot;I am <i>glad</i> I waited&quot;; <i>whilst many who
did not wait have bitterly regretted</i>.</p>

<p>A love affair is emotional insanity. Lovers are
insane; not in fit condition to decide their own actions.
The state of &quot;falling in love&quot; is moon-madness. For
the time being the lover's sense of justice, his reason,
his judgment, is distorted by <i>reflections from another
personality</i>. This is especially so in the woman's
case, for the reason that she is generally a creature
of untrained impulse, instead of reasoning will.</p>

<p>There is that recent case of the beautiful and beloved
Princess Louise who ran away from her royal
husband. She thought she loved Monsieur Giron so
devotedly that she could bear anything for the sake
of being with him. And surely she was miserable
enough in her old environment. But when it came
to the reality she could not bear the consequences.
She wanted her children; her proud spirit winced
at the snubs she got; she longed a little for the old
life; and familiarity with her soul mate revealed the
knowledge that he was not <i>all</i> soul. She flunked
miserably and went home to her sick child. You see,
she was literally love-<i>sick</i>. Her mind was disordered;
a life spent with her soul mate loomed to her so large
and dazzling that all other things were as nothing.
She couldn't for the time being see straight. She
was literally insane.</p>

<p>If she had only <i>waited</i> until the new wore off her
passion! Waited until she saw things in their proper
proportions and relations to each other; until she was
<i>sure</i> she could <i>live the life</i> made inevitable by her
change.</p>

<p>That is the trouble;--love-sick-ness <i>blinds her to
the truth</i>. When she wakes up by <i>experience</i> of the
truth, <i>she wishes she hadn't.</i></p>

<p>The only safe thing for a woman to do who finds
herself married to one man and in love with another
is to <i>wait</i>, a year, or two or three years, until time
proves her love and <i>she knows in her heart</i> that she
can make the change and never regret it, no matter
what happens. <i>You see, she can NEVER be happy
with the new love as long as</i> CONSCIENCE OR
HEART <i>reproaches her for her treatment of the old
love.</i> It behooves her to consider well.</p>

<p>Time will prove the new love. In many such cases
times reveals the idol's feet of clay. He shows that
his love is for <i>himself</i>, not for her. He pouts and kicks
and teases like a petulant child. He wants her NOW,
no matter how she may suffer in consequence of his
haste.</p>

<p>In spite of herself, in spite of her love for the new
love, she finds he is not panning out as she supposed.
She begins to see his other, his everyday side--<i>the side
she will have to live with</i> if she goes to him.</p>

<p>Now is the husband's chance. She <i>knows his</i>
every-day side, from experience; she has tried it in
weal and woe. If he rises to this occasion the Ideal
Man, he stands a fair chance of winning from his
wife a <i>deeper</i> love than she has yet given any man.
He may catch her <i>whole</i> heart in its rebound from the
idol with feet of clay.</p>

<p>To a husband in such a position I would say, <i>Be
kind.</i> &quot;There is nothing so kingly as kindness!&quot;--and
true kindness under this most trying condition
will in time win even a recalcitrant wife's admiration
and love--IF <i>the two are really mates</i>. If they are
not real mates; if they have outgrown their usefulness
to each other; the sooner they part the better. To
hold them together would only be another &quot;mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>Because a man and wife were mates five or ten
years ago is no proof that they are mates today. We
are all <i>growing</i>, and it is often literally true that we
&quot;grow away&quot; from people.</p>

<p><i>Every loved one who goes out of our lives makes
room for a better, fuller love--unless we shut ourselves
in with our &quot;grief.&quot;</i></p>

<p>It is said that Robert Louis Stevenson fell in love
with the wife of his best friend. He told his friend
frankly, intending to leave the city. His friend questioned
the wife and found she reciprocated Stevenson's
love. Stevenson stayed with his friend in Paris
and the wife went to her father's home in California.
A year later, the attachment between his wife and
Stevenson still remaining, the friend applied for a
divorce. Then he and Stevenson journeyed all the
way to California together, where Stevenson was married
to the ex-wife. The ex-husband attended the
wedding, and that same evening announced his engagement
to a girl friend of Mrs. Stevenson.</p>

<p>I glory in the friendship of those two men who
refused to allow the unreasoning caprices of love to
sever their love for each other. A separation and remarriage
like that is a <i>credit</i> to all parties concerned.
<i>It is the quarrels and estrangements which are the
real disgrace</i> in cases of separation and remarriage.</p>

<p>John Ruskin was another man too great and too
good to resent love's going where it is sent. He had
married, knowing that her respect and admiration but
not her <i>love</i>, were his, a beautiful and brilliant girl
much younger than himself. They lived happily a
number of years. Then Ruskin brought home the
painter, Millais, to make a picture of his wife. Artist
and model fell in love. Ruskin found it out, and
refused to allow his wife to sacrifice herself for him.
He divorced her and gave her to Millais, and the three
were life-long friends.</p>

<p>If I were a man in such a case as A. J.'s I should
treat my wife as I would a daughter. I would treat
her as an Individual with the right of choice.</p>

<p>Many a daughter has rushed headlong into a marriage
which her relatives opposed and she regretted at
leisure.</p>

<p>If someone grabs you by the arm and pulls hard
in one direction you are forced to pull hard in the
opposite direction, or lose your balance and fall. If
a daughter is pulled away from the man to whom she
is attracted, her Individuality rebels and she pulls
toward him harder than she would if let alone. She
<i>chooses</i> to follow the attraction which at the time is
pleasanter than that between herself and her frowning
relatives.</p>

<p>Remembering this I would <i>free</i> daughter or wife
and trust to the God in her to work out her highest
good. I would <i>believe</i> that whatever she chose to do
was really for her highest good. If I <i>really</i> loved <i>her</i>
I would <i>prefer</i> her happiness to my own.</p>

<p>And in it all I should be <i>deeply</i> conscious that
whatever is, is best, and that <i>all things worked together
for</i> MY <i>best good as well as for hers</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever appearances may show to the shortsighted,
the real TRUTH is this:--<i>Justice reigns;
the happiness of one person is not bought at the expense
of another; the law of attraction brings us our
own and holds to us our own in spite of all its efforts
to get away; it never leaves us until</i>, THROUGH
SOME CHANGE OR LACK OF CHANGE IN OURSELVES,
<i>it has ceased to be our own</i>.</p>

<p>A man's &quot;mental attitude&quot; toward the other man
in such cases as A.J.'s should be the same as toward
other men--the attitude of real kindness toward an
Individual who, like the rest of us, is being &quot;as good
as he knows how to be and as bad as he dare be.&quot;</p>

<p>This does not mean that the husband shall allow
himself to be used for a door mat, nor held up for
the ridicule of the neighbors. A sensible father expects
his daughter to observe the proprieties. The
daughter of a sensible father is more than willing to
meet these expectations. In the same way a sensible
husband will expect his wife to see no more of the
lover than &quot;society&quot; permits her to see of any man
not related to her. No sensible American woman will
jeopardize her good name under such circumstances.
She will control her feelings until she has proved her
new attraction and been duly released from the old.
If a woman will not conduct herself in a self-respecting
manner the sooner she leaves the better for the
husband. As for herself, she will learn by experience--as
Princess Louise did.</p>

<p>Love is the mightiest force in creation. It will not
be gainsaid. But it can be controlled. To pen it up
too completely brings explosion, devastation. To give
it too free rein means madness with no less devastation.
To <i>direct</i> it within reasonable limits is the only
safe way.</p>

<p>It takes a cool head and steadfast heart to meet
such emergencies as A.J.'s. And eye hath not seen
nor ear heard the &quot;Well done&quot; and its attendant
glory, which enters into the heart and character of
the man who meets such condition and conquers--<i>himself</i>.
Not once in a thousand lives has a man such
opportunity to prove his godship and bless himself
and the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>THE LAW OF INDIVIDUALITY.</b></p>

<p>All growth is by <i>learning</i>.</p>

<p>All learning comes by the gratification of desire.
Truly, experience is not only the best teacher, but
the <i>only</i> infallible one.</p>

<p>The gratification of desire, good or bad, leaves
always one imperishable residue of wisdom. The rest
of the experience goes with the chaff for burning.</p>

<p>Desire points invariably according to the individual's
intelligence. In proportion as this is faulty
his desires are &quot;bad.&quot;</p>

<p>What <i>is</i> a bad desire, anyway? In the main
&quot;bad&quot; desires are self-made or thoughtlessly accepted.
Dancing is wicked to a Methodist and &quot;good&quot; to an
Episcopalian.</p>

<p>But aside from these personal standpoints which
are legion there is an immutable Law, to which intelligence
is conforming all action and thought--the
Law of Individuality--the Law recognized and expressed
by Confucius and Jesus in negative and
positive forms of the &quot;golden rule&quot;; &quot;Do not unto
others what ye would not they should do unto you.&quot;</p>

<p>Interference with the freedom of the individual
is &quot;bad&quot;--that is, <i>it invariably brings pain</i> to the
one who interferes, in thought or deed. Listen to
this:</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot know anything of the sources or
causes of the crisis you are judging, for no one who
knows will tell you, and you would not know if you
were told. The depths of elemental immortality, of
self-deceit and revenge, lie in our eagerness to judge
one another, and to force one another under the yoke
of our judgments. When there is the faith of the Son
of man in the world, life will be left to make its own
judgments. The only judgment we have a right to
make upon one another is the free and truthful living
of our own lives.&quot; George D. Herron.</p>

<p>This forcing of others, in mind or action, under
the yoke of <i>our</i> judgment is the only possible way we
can break a <i>real</i> Law. To be <i>ourselves</i> and to leave
others free is to &quot;<i>be good</i>.&quot; Dancing will come and
go, and come again; so will fashions of all kinds;
conventionalities and creeds; but this Law remains an
eternal chalk line to be toed. And eternal torments
await him who does not toe it.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p>Take the case of a man who desires to &quot;run away&quot;
with another man's wife. The one immutable Law
of Individuality says <i>no man owns a wife</i>. Instead
of this being a problem with two men and one man's
property as factors, it is a case of <i>three individuals</i>
with god-given rights of individual choice. You have
heard it said that &quot;<i>where two are agreed</i> as touching
anything it shall be done unto them.&quot; It takes two
to make, or to keep made, a bargain. No matter what
hallucinations in regard to ownership any man may
labor under, <i>he does not</i> own a wife. He has no more
&quot;rights&quot; over one woman than over another, or over
another man, except as the <i>woman herself gives</i> him
the right and <i>keeps on</i> giving it to him.</p>

<p>The Law of Individuality is absolute, and in due
time husbands will know better than to imagine they
own wives; wives will know better than to be owned;
and the other man will not imagine he can gain great
pleasure from &quot;running away&quot; with anything. Each
will be free and leave the others so.</p>

<p>But &quot;as a man thinketh in his heart so is he.&quot;
Until a man <i>recognizes</i> the Law of Individuality his
actions are governed by the Law he <i>does</i> recognize,
and his desires act accordingly. When he desires
to &quot;run away&quot; with anything his <i>conscience</i> tells
him he is stealing. If desire is strong enough he
steals a wife, and eventually suffers for it. For,
though he may not have broken a real law, he <i>has</i>
broken an imagined one and in his <i>own mind</i> he deserves
punishment and in his own mind he gets it.
&quot;As a man thinketh so <i>is</i> he,&quot; and what he is <i>determines
what he attracts</i>.</p>

<p>Never was a deeper, truer saying than Paul's
&quot;BLESSED is the man that <i>doubteth not</i> in that
thing which he alloweth.&quot; The man who <i>waits</i>, until
he is &quot;<i>fully persuaded</i> in his own mind&quot; will be
blessed in following desire, and he will grow in wisdom
thereby.</p>

<p>The man who <i>thinks</i> his desire is &quot;bad&quot; and yet
follows it, will grow in wisdom <i>by the scourging he
gets</i>. He has transgressed <i>his conception</i> of the One
Law and suffers in getting back to <i>at-one-ment</i>.</p>

<p>In either case he <i>grows in wisdom</i> and eventually
he will desire only in accordance with the One Law of
Individual Choice.</p>

<p>There is no question of &quot;ought&quot; about it. The
individual is free to follow desire or to crucify it.
And the fact is, <i>he follows desire when he crucifies it</i>.
He <i>desires</i> to crucify desire, because he <i>is afraid</i> to
gratify it.</p>

<p>The man who is not afraid follows desire and
grows fast <i>in wisdom and in knowledge</i>. He may
make mistakes and suffer all sorts of agonies as a
result. But he learns from his misses as well as from
his hits, and he progresses.</p>

<p>The man who is afraid to follow desire crucifies
<i>his life</i> and stunts his growth.</p>

<p>It were better for the individual to follow his
desire and afterward repent, than to crush his desires
and repent for a lifetime under the false impression
that the universe unjustly gives to another that which
should have belonged to him.</p>

<p>There is just one kind of growth--<i>growth in
wisdom.</i> We hear of children &quot;who grow up in
ignorance.&quot; We likewise hear that the earth is square
and the moon a green cheese. Children can no more
grow in ignorance than they can grow in a dark and
air-tight case. <i>All</i> growth, mental, moral, spiritual
or &quot;physical,&quot; is by increase in in-telligence; i.e., by
<i>recognition</i> of more truth. All things exist in a limitless
sea of pure wisdom waiting, waiting <i>to be understood</i>.
As fast as this universal wisdom is used it
becomes <i>in-told--</i>intelligence--<i>recognized</i> wisdom.
We <i>breathe in wisdom</i> and grow in intelligence. <i>All</i>
growth, mineral, plant, animal, man or god, conscious
or unconscious--ALL growth is by this process.
It is DESIRE that makes us breathe. Everything
cries out for more, <i>more!--it</i> cannot define always
<i>what</i> it wants, but it <i>wants,</i> with insatiable craving.
It is <i>more wisdom</i> the whole creation groaneth and
travaileth to get. &quot;Give me more understanding or
I die!&quot;--the visible eternally cries out to the Invisible.
Desire is the ceaseless life-urge of all things, from
amoeba to archangel. Desire is &quot;Immanuer'--<i>God
with us</i>--God <i>in</i> us to will and to do.&quot;</p>


<br /><br /><hr style="width: 35%;" /><br /><br />
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>HARMONY AT HOME.</b></p>

<p>&quot;I have recently married for the second time. My
husband is a splendid man but his grown up children
are not in harmony with me. Good people, but a
different point of view. I make no pretensions to
perfection, of course, but I do try to do the best
lean.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the gist of several letters I have received
from as many different women. I will answer them
together.</p>

<p>When you enter a new home the matter of importance
is <i>not</i> whether your new relatives harmonize
with you, but whether <i>you</i> harmonize with <i>them</i>. It
is for <i>you</i> to do <i>all</i> the adjusting.</p>

<p>This may seem hard, but it is not. It is an easier
matter for one person to readjust her living than for
a whole family to change. The family has not only its
individual customs to hold each one, but its family
customs as well; whilst you have left your family
and have only your individual self to readjust. If you
refuse to adjust yourself, for no matter what reason,
you will act upon this family you have entered, as a
red hot iron would act upon a pan of water--there'll
be boil and bubble, toil and trouble and the family
will fly to pieces. All because you came in with
<i>positive</i> notions of your own which you insist upon
enforcing.</p>

<p>But if you come into the family like a lump of
sugar into a glass of water you will all, <i>in time</i> melt
together and the whole family will be the sweeter and
better for your coming. Whatever there is in you
which is better and sweeter than their own ideas and
customs will in time be <i>absorbed</i> by the family; for
what is good is ever positive to the less good, and has
a power of its own to convert; and every human soul,
if left free, will eventually <i>choose</i> the good.</p>

<p>The only danger lies in your tilting your nose at
<i>their</i> ways and ideas, and insisting upon your own.
That rouses the sense of <i>individuality</i> in them and
they then fight for <i>their</i> ways and ideas--then there's
boil and bubble and sputter and flying apart.</p>

<p>Learn to vibrate <i>with</i> people where you can and
keep still when you can't. <i>Look</i> for the little things
you can enjoy together, and make light of the others.
Recognize their <i>right</i> to differ from you, and REMEMBER
that &quot;<i>all</i> judgment is of God&quot;--<i>their</i>
judgment as well as <i>yours</i>.</p>

<p>All this differing of judgment among the people of
earth is simply <i>God reasoning out things</i>. All the
brains God has are your brains and mine. Just as
in your brain you reason things for and against, wondering
which is right and waiting for time and experience
to decide; so God reasons one way through <i>your</i>
brain and another and opposite way through <i>my</i>
brain, and then rests and observes until the &quot;logic
of events&quot; shall show <i>him</i>, and us, the point of real
harmony. Just be still and <i>let</i> God think through
your brain, and don't kick up a muss because he thinks
out the other side of things through my brain, or your
new relatives' brains.</p>

<p>Toleration is a great thing; but loving <i>willingness</i>
to <i>let</i> God think out <i>all</i> sides of a question through all
sorts of brains, is a glorious thing. Let's stand for
our point of view when it is called for, but don't let's
insist upon it. Let's remember always to use God's
&quot;still, small voice.&quot;</p>

<p>Do I need to tell you that what I have just said
applies to you whether you have just married a second
time or not? The whole world is our family, you
know. Let's respect it and be kind to it, and <i>trust</i> it
to recognize and appropriate our point of view just as
far as is good for it. Let's be more interested in
getting at the <i>other</i> points of view than insisting upon
our own. That is the way we shall grow in wisdom
and knowledge. And, too, that is the way we shall
all get close enough together to really see the truth
about things.</p>


<br /><br /><hr style="width: 35%;" /><br /><br />
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>A MYSTERY.</b></p>

<p>&quot;I desire to come face to face with the person or
persons who are controlling and influencing my husband
against his home and children and myself.
He has been estranged from us all for several years,
although sleeping under the same roof. Once I can
find out the person or cause of his actions I can remove
the effect, for I shall know just what to do. I
want to solve the mystery.&quot;</p>

<p>The chances are you will never find that out, and
if you did it would do you absolutely no good. Your
husband is no dumb fool to be &quot;influenced&quot; this way
or that by two women! He is a man with ideas of his
own. If he was disappointed in you as wife, he has
possibly turned to some other woman. If so the more
you pry and suspect and hint around, the more positively
he will turn away from you. If you &quot;found
out&quot; and made things warm for him or another he
would simply hate and despise you and be the harder
set against you. This is the Law.</p>

<p>The thing for you to do is to recognize your
husband's RIGHT to make and answer for his own
mistakes. Then drop the whole thing from your
mind and calculations.</p>

<p>Then treat your husband as you would any man
who came to visit you. Make yourself as attractive
and cultured and agreeable as possible, and look out
for his comfort, but never get in his way nor question
his doings. Stand square up on your own feet and be
as fine a woman as you know how to be--as gracious
a one. If he does love some other woman it may
be but a temporary infatuation and if you are attractive
and kind and sensible and independent enough he
may return to his first love in his own good time.</p>

<p>If not, why, no matter. Just you get interested in
life on your own account and let him do as he will.
If he does care for another woman he deserves credit
for not deserting you, as many a man would have
done. Just respect and honor him for the good that is
in him, instead of condemning him mentally because
the good does not show just according to your ideas
of how it should.</p>

<p>Love does not stay put, no matter how hard folks
try to keep it put. All we can do is to be as lovable
as possible and thus do our part to <i>attract</i> love.</p>

<p>It may be that you are simply a sentimental goose
who imagines her husband is &quot;influenced&quot; away from
her, because, forsooth, he does not pay her the attentions
he used to.</p>

<p>I was once that kind of a goose myself, and it
widened a breach that did not then exist except in my
mind; widened it until at last it became a real breach--my
husband went elsewhere for his companionship.
I was too morbid and finicky and exacting for a
healthy man.</p>

<p>Just as the husband of the woman in &quot;Confessions
of a Wife,&quot; in <i>Century</i> did. I read that serial each
month and feel like shaking that little simpleton!--she
is just the kind of a sentimental hair-splitting
little idiot that I used to be! Instead of getting at
her husband's point of view and enjoying <i>with</i> him,
at least sometimes, she insists on acting the martyr
because he will not dawdle around and gush at her
feet.</p>

<p>Whatever is the cause of your trouble the only
cure for it is Common-Sense. Live your own life,
cheerily, happily, and enter into your husband's life
so far as you can. Take all the good things that come
your way and rejoice in them, but don't moon around
and fuss because you can't have the sort of love-life
described in some sentimental novel. Your business
in life is to LOVE, not to <i>be</i> loved. The latter is a
secondary matter and the first is the thing that brings
happiness to you. Go in to win now, and you can
develop within yourself the full Life that you really
desire. All you desire is yours and you will realize
it in due time. But every moment you set your
thought on straightening out Some Other body's life
you are delaying your own realization and happiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>THE FAMILY JAR.</b></p>

<p>&quot;If a man and woman love each other and are
every way suited to marry should they yield to the
opposition of his grown daughter?&quot; M.A.</p>

<p>This question in varying forms comes to me often.
It always stirs within me something I used to call
&quot;righteous indignation.&quot; And incidentally it makes
me smile. Translate the question into Plain English
and anybody can answer it without hesitancy. Put it
this way: When two Individuals know what they
want and the whole world approves, should they go
away back and sit down because a third Individual
tries to interfere with their inherent right to the
pursuit of happiness?</p>

<p>Of course <i>not</i>. A man or woman old enough to
have a grown daughter is old enough to know whether
he wants to marry again. Not even the most precocious
daughter is a better judge than her father as to
what is best for his own happiness.</p>

<p>Ah, there's the rub! It is not <i>his</i> happiness she
is concerned about. It is her own. A new marriage
would interfere with the daughter's plans. She would
have to give the chief place to the new wife. She
would have to give up a share of the prospective
inheritance she has more or less consciously been
counting upon. So she opposes her father's re-marrying.</p>

<p>But apparently not on these grounds--dear, no!
Her father is &quot;too old,&quot; or &quot;too weakly,&quot; or the intended
wife is &quot;not nice.&quot; The daughter conjures up
a dozen excuses, but never the <i>real</i> one; of which she
is not fully conscious herself,--and <i>doesn't want to be</i>.</p>

<p>The parent's &quot;duty&quot; to children is great; far
greater than the child's duty to parent; but parental
self-sacrifice should certainly <i>not</i> be continued for life.
A grown daughter is an Individual, who should stand
on her own feet and make her own happiness <i>without</i>
curtailing the happiness of parents.</p>

<p>Let her leave her father to a renewal of youth and
happiness; or let her gracefully and kindly accept
her rightful second place and use her loving energies
in helping to make bright the home.</p>

<p>A sensible, well trained, loving daughter will do
one of these two things.</p>

<p>A sensible, well trained, loving parent will consider
his daughter's feelings and will do all he can
to gain her <i>willingness</i> before he marries; but he will
not make a lasting sacrifice of his own and the other
woman's happiness simply to please a selfish girl.</p>

<p>If daughter and parent are not sensible, well
trained and loving, it will be a case of frying pan or
fire either way.</p>

<p>The recognition of individual rights to the pursuit
of happiness according to individual desire, is the
only basis of happiness in family relations.</p>

<p>The daughter who <i>helps</i> her father do as he desires
will find <i>him</i> ready to help <i>her</i> do as <i>she</i> desires. And
<i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>The daughter who &quot;opposes&quot; her father's marriage
is quite apt to be the daughter who has <i>been
opposed by her father</i>; he reaps as he has sown. Or
else she is the daughter who has been brought up with
the idea that parents are a mere convenience for her
use.</p>

<p>The way out of the Family Jar is often labyrinthine;
but the Loving Individual can always thread it.</p>


<br /><br /><hr style="width: 35%;" /><br /><br />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>THE TRUTH ABOUT DIVORCE.</b></p>

<p>In January <i>Psychic and Occult Views and Reviews</i>
the editor, M.T.C. Wing, presents a view of &quot;Wives
and Work&quot; which is anything but an <i>occult</i> view of
the subject. He evidently still clings to the old notion
that man was made for the family, and not the family
for man. He inveighs against George D. Herron and
Elbert Hubbard <i>et al</i> because they permitted themselves
to be separated from their wives. Apparently
he thinks the chief end of man is to tote some woman
around on a chip, and the fact that in his callow youth
man picked out (or was picked out by) the wrong
woman, cuts no figure in the matter. Man must keep
on toting her even if he has to give up his life work
by which he has been enabled to supply the chip, not
to mention the other things the woman demands.</p>

<p>All of which is the very superficial view of the
world at large, and has no place among new thought,
&quot;occult&quot; teachings. It is entirely too obvious--to
the old-fashioned sentimentalist, who is blind to the
real facts in cases of separation.</p>

<p>The sentimentalist gets just two views of the
family, and draws his hasty conclusions therefrom.
He sees first a happy family, a charming, clinging
little simpleton of a wife, with half a dozen or so
infants clinging to her skirts and bosom, and her
round eyes lifted in adorable helplessness to the face
of that great, strong lord and master, her husband. In
his second view of the family he beholds this strong
man turn his back upon this adoring family and walk
deliberately forth to self-gratification, leaving them
to perish from hunger and grief. Fired with these
pretty and entirely fanciful pictures the superficial
observer burns with indignation and calls down anathema
upon the head of the deserter.</p>

<p>The fact is that <i>no</i> man ever deserts a family under
such conditions. There is always a long period of
disintegration before any family goes to pieces--a
period of which <i>both</i> man and wife are well aware.
When a separation comes it is <i>really</i> a relief to <i>both</i>
parties. The only real pain in such cases comes from
the spirit of <i>revenge</i>, or a desire on the part of one
or the other to pose as injured innocence, that she or
he may rake in the sympathy and fire the indignation
of just such uninformed friends as M.T.C. Wing.</p>

<p>I have known a lot of people who separated--known
them intimately and observed them well. In
not one of these cases did the deserted party claim to
<i>love</i> the deserter. In all there was a real <i>relief</i> when
it was all over. In every case the one thing which had
held them together so long was <i>fear of disgrace</i>. &quot;Oh,
<i>what</i> will people think of me?&quot;--is the first cry of
everybody--especially women. It was <i>that</i> which
made the deserted one unhappy and resentful. It is
that which makes many women pose as injured innocents
and rate the deserter as a villain. And all the
time <i>in secret</i> they are glad, <i>glad</i> that they are relieved
of the burden of living with an uncongenial
husband or wife.</p>

<p>Of course there are other reasons why women hate
to be left by their husbands. One is that their support
is apt to go with the deserter.</p>

<p>Public opinion keeps many a family in the same
house years after it really <i>knows</i> it is separated widely
as the poles.</p>

<p>The dread of having to take care of herself keeps
many a woman hanging like grim death to a man she
knows she does not love, and who despises her.</p>

<p>The fear of public opinion and the love, not of
money, but of <i>ease</i>, holds together under one roof
tens of thousands of families who have been <i>occultly</i>
and really separated for years.</p>

<p>A man is held by the same sentimental notion that
M.T.C. Wing has--that he must &quot;protect&quot; the
woman. So he stays in hell to do it. He <i>has</i> to stay
in hell <i>until she gets out</i>.</p>

<p>In almost every one of these separation cases it is
the woman and <i>not</i> the man, who gives the signal. In
George D. Herron's case the wife offered to take a
certain sum of money and release him from supporting
her. He met her conditions--and bore all the
odium like a man. To her credit be it said she did
not pose as an injured woman. I know nothing about
Elbert Hubbard's case, but I venture to say that if he
and his wife are separated that <i>she</i> was the one who
did the leaving act.</p>

<p>We hear a lot about the &quot;Biblical reason&quot; for
divorce; but I say unto you that infidelity is no reason
at all for divorce. The one just cause for separation
is <i>incompatibility of temper</i>.</p>

<p>A man is an Individual; a woman is another Individual;
and neither can make himself or herself over
to please the other.</p>

<p>When two people from lack of similar ideals and
aims cannot <i>pull together</i> the quicker they pull apart
the better it will be for them--and the children, too.</p>

<p>I know well a couple who lived together long
enough to have grown children. For nearly a score of
years they pulled like a pair of balky horses--what
time they were not doing the monkey and parrot act.
The husband stayed out nights and tippled. The wife
sat at home and felt virtuous. Finally the woman
worked up spunk enough to do what she had been
dying to do for years. She packed up and left. Now
she is happily married to a man she can pull <i>with</i>,
And he is married to another woman who pulls with
him. She has quit feeling virtuous and he has quit
tippling. They are both prospering financially. The
children have <i>two</i> pleasant homes, and more educational
and other advantages than they ever dared hope
for. Everyone of the family is <i>glad</i> of that separation.</p>

<p>The family is an institution of man's own making.
It is a good and glorious thing so long as it serves
to increase the happiness and health of its members.
But whenever the family institution has to be maintained
at the expense of the life, liberty or happiness
of its members it is time to lay that particular institution
on the shelf.</p>

<p>What God does not hold together by LOVE let not
man try to paste together by law.</p>

<p>One great cause of the increase of divorces is the
financial emancipation of woman. Women can now
get out and take care of themselves, where a few
years ago they had to grin and bear it; or bear it
without grinning.</p>

<p>If the new thought means anything, Brother Wing,
it means that every individual man or woman, has
the RIGHT to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
wherever and with whom he chooses to seek it,
so long as he or she does not attempt to abridge the
same rights for others. It means that a woman is as
much an Individual as a man, and must stand or
fall, hold her husband or lose him, <i>on her own merits</i>.
The new thought deals with Individuals regardless of
sex.</p>

<p>Marriage is a partnership, subject in the eyes of
Justice to the same rules which govern other partnerships.
Let us be just to the deserter, be he man or
woman, before we are sentimentally generous to the
deserted.</p>

<p>And don't let us be <i>too</i> sure that we know all the
facts in these separation cases. It is human nature
to fix up outward appearances for the benefit of the
passer-by.</p>

<p>Seek rather to <i>understand</i>. Condemn not.</p>

<p>Has any one told you it is lucky to be married?</p>

<p>I hasten to inform you it is just as lucky to be
divorced, and I know it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<br />

<p><b>THE OLD, OLD STORY.</b></p>

<p>This is the springtime, when fancy lightly turns to
thoughts of love and everybody wants to go a-soul-mating.
Consequently my mail is leavened with letters
from those who are unhappily married but who are
sure they have got their eye on the One who from the
foundation of the ion was intended for them. They
all want to leave the old mis-mate and go to the new
found soul mate, and they all want my advice and
encouragement--to do it! Some of these writers have
already left their husbands (?) and want to know
whether or not they should go back, or go on. To one
such I wrote the following letter, which I publish in
the hope that it will help others to find and follow
<i>themselves</i>. Here is the letter:</p>

<p>One thing at a time! Get off with the old love
before you go fretting about a new one! Don't you
think you are a silly girl to ask <i>anybody's</i> advice as
to whether or not you are to go back to your so-called
husband? If <i>I</i> know what <i>you</i> ought to do I don't see
what <i>you</i> are worth to yourself or the universe. The
truth is that YOU are the only person in creation who
can make that decision. If you don't yet <i>know</i> that
you have a right to make your own life as you see fit;
if you don't yet <i>know</i> whether or not you could go
back to him; then <i>be still</i> until you <i>do</i> know.</p>

<p>You know things today that you did not know
yesterday, and tomorrow you will know things you
&quot;can't decide about&quot; today. So attend strictly to
business and keep still, and stiller yet, until you
KNOW what is best to do.</p>

<p>Then DO it.</p>

<p>So much for the old love. As to the new one, not
even <i>you</i> can know for certain whether that other man
would pan out the soul mate you now imagine him.
But the Law of Love, or Attraction, will <i>prove</i> whether
or not he is what you think. <i>Your Own</i> will come to
you, and all creation can't hinder it--IF you keep
that man was NOT what I longed for, a real comrade;
sweet and cool, and free in your own mind, and make
the best of THIS day as it comes along.</p>

<p>Ages ago I had a similar experience to yours. I
found the only and original one intended for me.
But I was tied to another man--NOT by a ceremony,
for that ties nobody, but by my own conscience, which
compelled me to &quot;stand by&quot; the man I thought
&quot;needed&quot; me. So I stood, though I thought my heart
was broken. In a few years I found that my soul mate
was no mate at all!--I wouldn't have had him as a
gracious gift! I felt like Ben Franklin who, as a
barefooted boy, resolved that when he grew up and
had pennies he would buy a stick of red striped peppermint
candy; but when he grew up and had the
pennies he didn't want the candy.</p>

<p>I have learned to smile at that experience as the
bitterest and sweetest of my past life, and the source
of volumes of wisdom. The <i>Law of Attraction knew</i>
and the Law kept him from me. I afterward found
the real comrade, and <i>more</i> than the joy I thought I
had forever missed!</p>

<p>&quot;We are pretty silly children, dearie, without the
child's best quality, TRUST."</p>

<p>Just you <i>let go</i> of everything and everybody and
apply yourself to doing THIS hour, with <i>love</i>, what
your <i>hands</i> find to do; and trust the Law to bring you
in due time ALL the good things you ever desired.</p>

<p>ACCEPT what comes as <i>from</i> the Law; meet it
kindly and do your best.</p>

<p>The time came when I left my husband and secured
a divorce. This may be your time to leave, or it may
not. But NO one can know but yourself, and you
will know as soon as you really <i>want</i> to know what is
RIGHT, and get quiet enough to find the decision
<i>about which you have no doubt</i>. &quot;BLESSED is he
that <i>doubteth</i> not in that thing which he alloweth.&quot;
&quot;He that doubteth is <i>damned already</i>.&quot; When you
are <i>sure</i>, then go ahead; and the whole universe,
seen and unseen, will work together for you and with
you.</p>

<p>What is it that ties you to one man and not to
another? Not the words of a priest or a justice of the
peace. It is <i>your thought</i> about the matter, and <i>his</i>
thought about the matter, which ties you. You may
not have thought you were tied until the preacher
told you; but not his words but <i>your acceptance</i> does
the real tying.</p>

<p>If you are ever freed from a husband you must
<i>think</i> yourself free--just as you must think yourself
free from any other bondage. I thought myself free
several years before I applied for a legal separation;
so that when I did apply it was to me merely a
technicality.</p>

<p>Divorce or no divorce you are <i>tied</i> to a man until
you think yourself untied.</p>

<p>Be still and find your mental freedom. Then you
will know what to do.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p>A year after I wrote the above letter to a young
woman who wanted to leave her husband and go to
her &quot;soul mate,&quot; I received from her another letter in
which she thanked me from her heart for my letter,
which, she said, had saved her from a terrible mistake.
She had let time try the new love; who was found
sadly wanting. More than that she had come to love
and respect her husband as never before. Many
others, both men and women, have written me to the
same effect.</p>

<p>Can you learn from the experiences of others--learn
<i>caution</i> at least? I hope so. Be <i>sure</i> you are
right before you resort to separation.</p>

<p>In the meantime make it the aspiration and business
of your life to know <i>that</i> ALL <i>things are</i> NOW
<i>working for good to you and your mate, and all you
hold in common</i>.</p>

<p>Keep sweet, dearie, and <i>let</i> them work--at least
until you know exactly <i>what</i> to do, and <i>how</i> to do it;
and can feel <i>sure</i> in your heart of hearts that, <i>whatever
the consequences</i>, you will never regret your
action.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
