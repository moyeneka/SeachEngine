children, whose dull eyes<br />
See nothing save their own unlovely woe,<br />
Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,&mdash;<br />
But that the roar of thy Democracies,<br />
Thy reigns of Terror, thy great Anarchies,<br />
Mirror my wildest passions like the sea<br />
And give my rage a brother&mdash;!&nbsp; Liberty!<br />
For this sake only do thy dissonant cries<br />
Delight my discreet soul, else might all kings<br />
By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades<br />
Rob nations of their rights inviolate<br />
And I remain unmoved&mdash;and yet, and yet,<br />
These Christs that die upon the barricades,<br />
God knows it I am with them, in some things.</p>

And all the deadly fires which are<br />

<p class="poetry">The strong sea-lion of England&rsquo;s wars<br

think thy spirit hath passed away<br />
From these white cliffs and high-embattled towers;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This gorgeous fiery-coloured world of ours<br />
Seems fallen into ashes dull and grey,<br />
And the age changed unto a mimic play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein we waste our else too-crowded hours:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all our pomp and pageantry and powers<br />
We are but fit to delve the common clay,<br />
Seeing this little isle on which we stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This England, this sea-lion of the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By ignorant demagogues is held in fee,<br />
Who love her not: Dear God! is this the land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which bare a triple empire in her hand<br />

where were thy wings<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; In fight unequal, by an obscure hand,<br />
Fell the last scion of thy brood of Kings!</p>
<p class="poetry">Poor boy! thou shalt not flaunt thy cloak of
red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ride in state through Paris in the van<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thy returning legions, but instead<br />
Thy mother France, free and republican,</p>
<p class="poetry">Shall on thy dead and crownless forehead
place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The better laurels of a soldier&rsquo;s crown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That not dishonoured should thy soul go down<br />
To tell the mighty Sire of thy race</p>
<p class="poetry">That France hath kissed the mouth of
Liberty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And found it sweeter than his honied bees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that the giant wave Democracy<br />
Breaks on the shores where Kings lay couched at ease.</p>

MASSACRE OF THE CHRISTIANS IN BULGARIA</span></p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Christ</span>, dost Thou
live indeed? or are Thy bones<br />
Still straitened in their rock-hewn sepulchre?<br />
And was Thy Rising only dreamed by her<br />
Whose love of Thee for all her sin atones?<br />
For here the air is horrid with men&rsquo;s groans,<br />
The priests who call upon Thy name are slain,<br />
Dost Thou not hear the bitter wail of pain<br />
From those whose children lie upon the stones?<br />
Come down, O Son of God! incestuous gloom<br />
Curtains the land, and through the starless night<br />
Over Thy Cross a Crescent moon I see!<br />
If Thou in very truth didst burst the tomb<br />
Come down, O Son of Man! and show Thy might<br />
Lest Mahomet be crowned instead of Thee!</p>

17</span>QUANTUM MUTATA</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a time in
Europe long ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When no man died for freedom anywhere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But England&rsquo;s lion leaping from its lair<br />
Laid hands on the oppressor! it was so<br />
While England could a great Republic show.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness the men of Piedmont, chiefest care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Cromwell, when with impotent despair<br />
The Pontiff in his painted portico<br />
Trembled before our stern ambassadors.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How comes it then that from such high estate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have thus fallen, save that Luxury<br />
With barren merchandise piles up the gate<br />
Where noble thoughts and deeds should enter by:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Else might we still be Milton&rsquo;s heritors.</p>

democracy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And liking best that state republican<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where every man is Kinglike and no man<br />
Is crowned above his fellows, yet I see,<br />
Spite of this modern fret for Liberty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Better the rule of One, whom all obey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than to let clamorous demagogues betray<br />
Our freedom with the kiss of anarchy.<br />
Wherefore I love them not whose hands profane<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plant the red flag upon the piled-up street<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For no right cause, beneath whose ignorant reign<br

Arts, Culture, Reverence, Honour, all things fade,<br />

19</span>THEORETIKOS</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">This</span> mighty empire
hath but feet of clay:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all its ancient chivalry and might<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our little island is forsaken quite:<br />
Some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay,<br />
And from its hills that voice hath passed away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which spake of Freedom: O come out of it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come out of it, my Soul, thou art not fit<br />
For this vile traffic-house, where day by day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wisdom and reverence are sold at mart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rude people rage with ignorant cries<br />
Against an heritage of centuries.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It mars my calm: wherefore in dreams of Art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loftiest culture I would stand apart,<br />
Neither for God, nor for his enemies.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruled the whole world for many an age&rsquo;s

Then of the peoples wert thou royal Queen,<br />
Till in thy streets the bearded Goth was seen;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now upon thy walls the breezes fan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ah, city crowned by God, discrowned by man!)<br />
The hated flag of red and white and green.<br />
When was thy glory! when in search for power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine eagles flew to greet the double sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wild nations shuddered at thy rod?<br />
Nay, but thy glory tarried for this hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When pilgrims kneel before the Holy One,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The prisoned shepherd of the Church of God.</p>

white lilies in the spring,<br />
Sad olive-groves, or silver-breasted dove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Teach me more clearly of Thy life and love<br />
Than terrors of red flame and thundering.<br />
The hillside vines dear memories of Thee bring:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A bird at evening flying to its nest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tells me of One who had no place of rest:<br />
I think it is of Thee the sparrows sing.<br />
Come rather on some autumn afternoon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When red and brown are burnished on the leaves,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fields echo to the gleaner&rsquo;s song,<br

Come when the splendid fulness of the moon<br />

Priest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head:<br />
In splendour and in light the Pope passed home.<br />
My heart stole back across wide wastes of years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To One who wandered by a lonely sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sought in vain for any place of rest:<br />
&lsquo;Foxes have holes, and every bird its nest.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,<br />
And the rose-petals falling from the wreath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the night breezes wandered through the shrine,<br

And seemed to be in some entranc&egrave;d swoon<br />
Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon</p>
<p class="poetry">Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; When from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,<br />
And flinging wide the cedar-carven door<br />

And armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared<br />
From the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin
flared</p>
<p class="poetry">Like a red rod of flame, stony and steeled<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gorgon&rsquo;s head its leaden eyeballs
rolled,<br />
And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold<br />
In passion impotent, while with blind gaze<br />
The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.</p>
<p class="poetry">The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far out at sea off Sunium, or cast<br />
The net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp<br />

Divide the folded curtains of the night,<br />

<p class="poetry">And guilty lovers in their venery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgat a little while their stolen sweets,<br />
Deeming they heard dread Dian&rsquo;s bitter cry;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats<br />
Ran to their shields in haste precipitate,<br />
Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.</p>
<p class="poetry">For round the temple rolled the clang of
arms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,<br />
And the air quaked with dissonant alarums<br />

And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,<br />
And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.</p>

That calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The marvel of that pitiless chastity,<br />
Ah! well content indeed, for never wight<br />
Since Troy&rsquo;s young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a
sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ready for death he stood, but lo! the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And from his limbs he throw the cloak away;<br />
For whom would not such love make desperate?<br />
And nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands
violate</p>
<p class="poetry">Undid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bared the breasts of polished ivory,<br />
Till from the waist the peplos falling down<br />

Which to no lover will Athena show,<br />
The grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of
snow.</p>

To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,<br />
Ye who have learned who Eros is,&mdash;O listen yet awhile.</p>
<p class="poetry">A little space he let his greedy eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight<br />
Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then his lips in hungering delight<br />
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Fed on
her lips, and round the towered neck<br />
He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion&rsquo;s will to
check.</p>
<p class="poetry">Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all night long he murmured honeyed word,<br />
And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pale and argent body undisturbed,<br />
And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed<br />
His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.</p>
<p class="poetry">It was as if Numidian javelins<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierced through and through his wild and whirling

Was such sweet anguish that he never drew<br />
His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.</p>
<p class="poetry">They who have never seen the daylight peer<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,<br />
And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And worshipped body risen, they for certain<br />
Will never know of what I try to sing,<br />
How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.</p>

106</span>The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sign which shipmen say is ominous<br />
Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the low lightening east was tremulous<br />
With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,<br />
Ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.</p>
<p class="poetry">Down the steep rock with hurried feet and
fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,<br

And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran<br />
Like a young fawn unto an olive wood<br />
Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;</p>
<p class="poetry">And sought a little stream, which well he
knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For oftentimes with boyish careless shout<br />
The green and crested grebe he would pursue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or snare in woven net the silver trout,<br />
And down amid the startled reeds he lay<br />
Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.</p>
<p class="poetry">On the green bank he lay, and let one hand<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,<br />
And soon the breath of morning came and fanned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly<br />
<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>The
tangled curls from off his forehead, while<br />
He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.</p>
<p class="poetry">And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,<br />
And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Curled through the air across the ripening oats,<br

And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed<br />
As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle
strayed.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when the light-foot mower went afield<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,<br />
And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from its nest the waking corncrake flew,<br />
Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream<br />
And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is young Hylas, that false runaway<br />
Who with a Naiad now would make his bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetting Herakles,&rsquo; but others,
&lsquo;Nay,<br />
It is Narcissus, his own paramour,<br />
Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can
allure.&rsquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is young Dionysos who has hid<br />
His spear and fawnskin by the river side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,<br />
And wise indeed were we away to fly:<br />
They live not long who on the gods immortal come to
spy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So turned they back, and feared to look
behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And told the timid swain how they had seen<br />
Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no man dared to cross the open green,<br />
And on that day no olive-tree was slain,<br />
Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,</p>
<p class="poetry">Save when the neat-herd&rsquo;s lad, his empty
pail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound<br />
Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoping that he some comrade new had found,<br />
And gat no answer, and then half afraid<br />
Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade</p>
<p class="poetry">A little girl ran laughing from the farm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not thinking of love&rsquo;s secret mysteries,<br />
And when she saw the white and gleaming arm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all his manlihood, with longing eyes<br />
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Whose
passion mocked her sweet virginity<br />
Watched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far off he heard the city&rsquo;s hum and
noise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now and then the shriller laughter where<br />
The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,<br />
And now and then a little tinkling bell<br />
As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.</p>
<p class="poetry">Through the grey willows danced the fretful
gnat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,<br />
In sleek and oily coat the water-rat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breasting the little ripples manfully<br />
Made for the wild-duck&rsquo;s nest, from bough to bough<br />
Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the
slough.</p>
<p class="poetry">On the faint wind floated the silky seeds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the bright scythe swept through the waving
grass,<br />
The ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flecked with silver whorls the forest&rsquo;s
glass,<br />
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Which
scarce had caught again its imagery<br />
Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.</p>
<p class="poetry">But little care had he for any thing<br />

And from the copse the linnet &rsquo;gan to sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To its brown mate its sweetest serenade;<br />
Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen<br />
The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when the herdsman called his straggling
goats<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With whistling pipe across the rocky road,<br />
And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to
bode<br />
Of coming storm, and the belated crane<br />
Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain</p>
<p class="poetry">Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he
rose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from the gloomy forest went his way<br />
Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And came at last unto a little quay,<br />
And called his mates aboard, and took his seat<br />
On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping
sheet,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,<br />
And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the chaste stars their confessors, or told<br />
Their dearest secret to the downy moth<br />
That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging
froth</p>
<p class="poetry">Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked<br />
As though the lading of three argosies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were in the hold, and flapped its wings and
shrieked,<br />
And darkness straightway stole across the deep,<br />
Sheathed was Orion&rsquo;s sword, dread Mars himself fled down
the steep,</p>
<p class="poetry">And the moon hid behind a tawny mask<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean&rsquo;s
marge<br />
Rose the red plume, the huge and horn&egrave;d casque,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!<br />
And clad in bright and burnished panoply<br />
Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!</p>
<p class="poetry">To the dull sailors&rsquo; sight her loosened
looks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet<br

Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>And, marking how the rising waters beat<br />
Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried<br />
To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side</p>
<p class="poetry">But he, the overbold adulterer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A dear profaner of great mysteries,<br />
An ardent amorous idolater,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he beheld those grand relentless eyes<br />
Laughed loud for joy, and crying out &lsquo;I come&rsquo;<br />
Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then fell from the high heaven one bright
star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One dancer left the circling galaxy,<br />
And back to Athens on her clattering car<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the pride of venged divinity<br />
Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,<br />
And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,<br />
And the old pilot bade the trembling crew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen<br />
Close to the stern a dim and giant form,<br />
And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the
storm.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,<br />

sought<br />
The toll-gate of the city hastily,<br />
And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.</p>

This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,<br />

Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known<br />

Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar<br />
From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows<br />
With careless scythe too near some flower bed,<br />

And with the flower&rsquo;s loosened loneliness<br />
Strews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness</p>

Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine<br />

Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,<br />
And let Desire pass across dread Charon&rsquo;s icy ford.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Ithaca&rsquo;s cliff, Lycaon&rsquo;s snowy peak,<br

And all the flower-strewn hills of Arcady.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The flapping of the sail against the mast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ripple of the water on the side,<br />
The ripple of girls&rsquo; laughter at the stern,<br />

And for excess of Love my Love is dumb.</p>

Of unkissed kisses, and songs never sung.</p>

Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm</p>
<p class="poetry">Genders unlawful children, Anarchy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom&rsquo;s own Judas, the vile prodigal<br />
Licence who steals the gold of Liberty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real<br />
One Fraticide since Cain, Envy the asp<br />
That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp</p>
<p class="poetry">Is in its extent stiffened, moneyed Greed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For whose dull appetite men waste away<br />
Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of things which slay their sower, these each day<br
/>
Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet<br />
Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.</p>
<p class="poetry">What even Cromwell spared is desecrated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By weed and worm, left to the stormy play<br />
Of wind and beating snow, or renovated<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Lincoln&rsquo;s lofty choir, till the air<br

Seems from such marble harmonies to ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sweeter song than common lips can dare<br />
To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now<br />
The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches
bow</p>
<p class="poetry">For Southwell&rsquo;s arch, and carved the
House of One<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who loved the lilies of the field with all<br />
Our dearest English flowers? the same sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rises for us: the seasons natural<br />
Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:<br />
The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed
away.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet perchance it may be better so,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen,<br />
Murder her brother is her bedfellow,<br />

Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!</p>

Our souls up more than even Agnolo&rsquo;s<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! somehow life is bigger after all<br />

And balanced symmetry of what in man<br />
Would else wage ceaseless warfare,&mdash;this at least within the

<p class="poetry">Between our mother&rsquo;s kisses and the

The soul in flawless essence high enthroned,<br />
Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,</p>
<p class="poetry">Mark with serene impartiality<br />

Knowing that by the chain causality<br />

<p class="poetry">Of Life in most august omnipresence,<br />

<p class="poetry">Ah! it was easy when the world was young<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep one&rsquo;s life free and inviolate,<br />
From our sad lips another song is rung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By our own hands our heads are desecrate,<br />
Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed<br />
Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest.</p>
<p class="poetry">Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has
flown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of all men we are most wretched who<br />
Must live each other&rsquo;s lives and not our own<br />

All that we lived for&mdash;it was otherwise<br />
When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.</p>
<p class="poetry">But we have left those gentle haunts to pass<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; With weary feet to the new Calvary,<br />
Where we behold, as one who in a glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze<br />
Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.</p>
<p class="poetry">O smitten mouth!&nbsp; O forehead crowned with
thorn!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O chalice of all common miseries!<br />
Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An agony of endless centuries,<br />
And we were vain and ignorant nor knew<br />
That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we
slew.</p>
<p class="poetry">Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The night that covers and the lights that fade,<br

The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lips betraying and the life betrayed;<br />
The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we<br />
Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Is this the end of all that primal force<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, in its changes being still the same,<br />
From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,<br />

Till the suns met in heaven and began<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain<br

Loosen the nails&mdash;we shall come down I know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Staunch the red wounds&mdash;we shall be whole

No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,<br />
That which is purely human, that is godlike, that is God.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Save to wait for the sign to come:<br />
So, like things of stone in a valley lone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiet we sat and dumb:<br />
But each man&rsquo;s heart beat thick and quick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a madman on a drum!</p>
<p class="poetry">With sudden shock the prison-clock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smote on the shivering air,<br />
And from all the gaol rose up a wail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of impotent despair,<br />
Like the sound that frightened marshes hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From some leper in his lair.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>And as one sees most fearful things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the crystal of a dream,<br />
We saw the greasy hempen rope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hooked to the blackened beam,<br />
And heard the prayer the hangman&rsquo;s snare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangled into a scream.</p>
<p class="poetry">And all the woe that moved him so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he gave that bitter cry,<br />
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; None knew so well as I:<br />
For he who lives more lives than one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More deaths than one must die.</p>

The Chaplain&rsquo;s heart is far too sick,<br />

Or there is that written in his eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which none should look upon.</p>
<p class="poetry">So they kept us close till nigh on noon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they rang the bell,<br />
And the Warders with their jingling keys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Opened each listening cell,<br />
And down the iron stair we tramped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each from his separate Hell.</p>
<p class="poetry">Out into God&rsquo;s sweet air we went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But not in wonted way,<br />
For this man&rsquo;s face was white with fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that man&rsquo;s face was grey,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; In happy freedom by.</p>
<p class="poetry">But there were those amongst us all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who walked with downcast head,<br />
And knew that, had each got his due,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They should have died instead:<br />
He had but killed a thing that lived,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst they had killed the dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">For he who sins a second time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wakes a dead soul to pain,<br />
And draws it from its spotted shroud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes it bleed again,<br />
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes it bleed in vain!</p>

<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">year</span> ago I
breathed the Italian air,&mdash;<br />
And yet, methinks this northern Spring is fair,&mdash;<br />
These fields made golden with the flower of March,<br />
The throstle singing on the feathered larch,<br />
The cawing rooks, the wood-doves fluttering by,<br />
The little clouds that race across the sky;<br />
And fair the violet&rsquo;s gentle drooping head,<br />
The primrose, pale for love uncomforted,<br />
The rose that burgeons on the climbing briar,<br />
The crocus-bed, (that seems a moon of fire<br />
Round-girdled with a purple marriage-ring);<br />
And all the flowers of our English Spring,<br />
Fond snowdrops, and the bright-starred daffodil.<br />
Up starts the lark beside the murmuring mill,<br />
And breaks the gossamer-threads of early dew;<br />
And down the river, like a flame of blue,<br />
Keen as an arrow flies the water-king,<br />
While the brown linnets in the greenwood sing.<br />
A year ago!&mdash;it seems a little time<br />
Since last I saw that lordly southern clime,<br />
<a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>Where
flower and fruit to purple radiance blow,<br />
And like bright lamps the fabled apples glow.<br />
Full Spring it was&mdash;and by rich flowering vines,<br />
Dark olive-groves and noble forest-pines,<br />
I rode at will; the moist glad air was sweet,<br />
The white road rang beneath my horse&rsquo;s feet,<br />
And musing on Ravenna&rsquo;s ancient name,<br />
I watched the day till, marked with wounds of flame,<br />
The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O how my heart with boyish
passion burned,<br />
When far away across the sedge and mere<br />
I saw that Holy City rising clear,<br />
Crowned with her crown of towers!&mdash;On and on<br />
I galloped, racing with the setting sun,<br />
And ere the crimson after-glow was passed,<br />
I stood within Ravenna&rsquo;s walls at last!</p>

of life or joy<br />
Startles the air; no laughing shepherd-boy<br />
Pipes on his reed, nor ever through the day<br />
Comes the glad sound of children at their play:<br />
O sad, and sweet, and silent! surely here<br />
A man might dwell apart from troublous fear,<br />
Watching the tide of seasons as they flow<br />
From amorous Spring to Winter&rsquo;s rain and snow,<br />

Thy noble dead are with thee!&mdash;they at least<br />

Led him against thy city, and he fell,<br />
As falls some forest-lion fighting well.<br />
Taken from life while life and love were new,<br />

Sleeps after all his weary conquering.<br />
Time hath not spared his ruin,&mdash;wind and rain<br />

His gilded shrine lies open to the air;<br />
And cunning sculptor&rsquo;s hands have carven there<br />
The calm white brow, as calm as earliest morn,<br />
The eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn,<br />
The lips that sang of Heaven and of Hell,<br />
The almond-face which Giotto drew so well,<br />
The weary face of Dante;&mdash;to this day,<br />
Here in his place of resting, far away<br />
From Arno&rsquo;s yellow waters, rushing down<br />
Through the wide bridges of that fairy town,<br />
Where the tall tower of Giotto seems to rise<br />
A marble lily under sapphire skies!</p>

Man&rsquo;s nobler nature with the sense of wrong.<br />
Yet this dull world is grateful for thy song;<br />
Our nations do thee homage,&mdash;even she,<br />
That cruel queen of vine-clad Tuscany,<br />
Who bound with crown of thorns thy living brow,<br />
Hath decked thine empty tomb with laurels now,<br />
And begs in vain the ashes of her son.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O mightiest exile! all thy

For from the East there came a mighty cry,<br />
And Greece stood up to fight for Liberty,<br />
And called him from Ravenna: never knight<br />
Rode forth more nobly to wild scenes of fight!<br />
None fell more bravely on ensanguined field,<br />
Borne like a Spartan back upon his shield!<br />
O Hellas!&nbsp; Hellas! in thine hour of pride,<br />
Thy day of might, remember him who died<br />
To wrest from off thy limbs the trammelling chain:<br />
O Salamis!&nbsp; O lone Plat&aelig;an plain!<br />
O tossing waves of wild Euboean sea!<br />
O wind-swept heights of lone Thermopyl&aelig;!<br />
He loved you well&mdash;ay, not alone in word,<br />
Who freely gave to thee his lyre and sword,<br />
Like &AElig;schylos at well-fought Marathon:</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And England, too, shall glory
in her son,<br />
Her warrior-poet, first in song and fight.<br />
No longer now shall Slander&rsquo;s venomed spite<br />
Crawl like a snake across his perfect name,<br />
Or mar the lordly scutcheon of his fame.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as the olive-garland of
the race,<br />
Which lights with joy each eager runner&rsquo;s face,<br />
<a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>As the
red cross which saveth men in war,<br />
As a flame-bearded beacon seen from far<br />
By mariners upon a storm-tossed sea,&mdash;<br />
Such was his love for Greece and Liberty!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byron, thy crowns are ever
fresh and green:<br />
Red leaves of rose from Sapphic Mitylene<br />
Shall bind thy brows; the myrtle blooms for thee,<br />
In hidden glades by lonely Castaly;<br />
The laurels wait thy coming: all are thine,<br />
And round thy head one perfect wreath will twine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">V.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pine-tops rocked before
the evening breeze<br />
With the hoarse murmur of the wintry seas,<br />
And the tall stems were streaked with amber bright;&mdash;<br />
I wandered through the wood in wild delight,<br />
Some startled bird, with fluttering wings and fleet,<br />
Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,<br />
Like silver crowns, the pale narcissi lay,<br />
And small birds sang on every twining spray.<br />
O waving trees, O forest liberty!<br />
Within your haunts at least a man is free,<br />
And half forgets the weary world of strife:<br />
The blood flows hotter, and a sense of life<br />
<a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>Wakes
i&rsquo; the quickening veins, while once again<br />
The woods are filled with gods we fancied slain.<br />
Long time I watched, and surely hoped to see<br />
Some goat-foot Pan make merry minstrelsy<br />
Amid the reeds! some startled Dryad-maid<br />
In girlish flight! or lurking in the glade,<br />
The soft brown limbs, the wanton treacherous face<br />
Of woodland god! Queen Dian in the chase,<br />
White-limbed and terrible, with look of pride,<br />
And leash of boar-hounds leaping at her side!<br />
Or Hylas mirrored in the perfect stream.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O idle heart!&nbsp; O fond
Hellenic dream!<br />
Ere long, with melancholy rise and swell,<br />
The evening chimes, the convent&rsquo;s vesper bell,<br />
Struck on mine ears amid the amorous flowers.<br />
Alas! alas! these sweet and honied hours<br />
Had whelmed my heart like some encroaching sea,<br />
And drowned all thoughts of black Gethsemane.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">VI.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lone Ravenna! many a tale
is told<br />
Of thy great glories in the days of old:<br />
Two thousand years have passed since thou didst see<br />
C&aelig;sar ride forth to royal victory.<br />
<a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>Mighty
thy name when Rome&rsquo;s lean eagles flew<br />
From Britain&rsquo;s isles to far Euphrates blue;<br />
And of the peoples thou wast noble queen,<br />
Till in thy streets the Goth and Hun were seen.<br />
Discrowned by man, deserted by the sea,<br />
Thou sleepest, rocked in lonely misery!<br />
No longer now upon thy swelling tide,<br />
Pine-forest-like, thy myriad galleys ride!<br />
For where the brass-beaked ships were wont to float,<br />
The weary shepherd pipes his mournful note;<br />
And the white sheep are free to come and go<br />
Where Adria&rsquo;s purple waters used to flow.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fair!&nbsp; O sad!&nbsp; O
Queen uncomforted!<br />
In ruined loveliness thou liest dead,<br />
Alone of all thy sisters; for at last<br />
Italia&rsquo;s royal warrior hath passed<br />
Rome&rsquo;s lordliest entrance, and hath worn his crown<br />
In the high temples of the Eternal Town!<br />
The Palatine hath welcomed back her king,<br />
And with his name the seven mountains ring!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Naples hath outlived her
dream of pain,<br />
And mocks her tyrant!&nbsp; Venice lives again,<br />
New risen from the waters! and the cry<br />
Of Light and Truth, of Love and Liberty,<br />
Is heard in lordly Genoa, and where<br />
The marble spires of Milan wound the air,<br />
<a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>Rings
from the Alps to the Sicilian shore,<br />
And Dante&rsquo;s dream is now a dream no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou, Ravenna, better
loved than all,<br />
Thy ruined palaces are but a pall<br />
That hides thy fallen greatness! and thy name<br />
Burns like a grey and flickering candle-flame<br />
Beneath the noonday splendour of the sun<br />
Of new Italia! for the night is done,<br />
The night of dark oppression, and the day<br />
Hath dawned in passionate splendour: far away<br />
The Austrian hounds are hunted from the land,<br />
Beyond those ice-crowned citadels which stand<br />
Girdling the plain of royal Lombardy,<br />
From the far West unto the Eastern sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, indeed, that sons of
thine have died<br />
In Lissa&rsquo;s waters, by the mountain-side<br />
Of Aspromonte, on Novara&rsquo;s plain,&mdash;<br />
Nor have thy children died for thee in vain:<br />
And yet, methinks, thou hast not drunk this wine<br />
From grapes new-crushed of Liberty divine,<br />
Thou hast not followed that immortal Star<br />
Which leads the people forth to deeds of war.<br />
Weary of life, thou liest in silent sleep,<br />
As one who marks the lengthening shadows creep,<br />
Careless of all the hurrying hours that run,<br />
Mourning some day of glory, for the sun<br />
<a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>Of
Freedom hath not shewn to thee his face,<br />
And thou hast caught no flambeau in the race.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet wake not from thy
slumbers,&mdash;rest thee well,<br />
Amidst thy fields of amber asphodel,<br />
Thy lily-sprinkled meadows,&mdash;rest thee there,<br />
To mock all human greatness: who would dare<br />
To vent the paltry sorrows of his life<br />
Before thy ruins, or to praise the strife<br />
Of kings&rsquo; ambition, and the barren pride<br />
Of warring nations! wert not thou the Bride<br />
Of the wild Lord of Adria&rsquo;s stormy sea!<br />
The Queen of double Empires! and to thee<br />
Were not the nations given as thy prey!<br />
And now&mdash;thy gates lie open night and day,<br />
The grass grows green on every tower and hall,<br />
The ghastly fig hath cleft thy bastioned wall;<br />
And where thy mail&egrave;d warriors stood at rest<br />
The midnight owl hath made her secret nest.<br />
O fallen! fallen! from thy high estate,<br />
O city trammelled in the toils of Fate,<br />
Doth nought remain of all thy glorious days,<br />
But a dull shield, a crown of withered bays!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet who beneath this night of
wars and fears,<br />
From tranquil tower can watch the coming years;<br />
Who can foretell what joys the day shall bring,<br />
Or why before the dawn the linnets sing?<br />
<a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>Thou,
even thou, mayst wake, as wakes the rose<br />
To crimson splendour from its grave of snows;<br />
As the rich corn-fields rise to red and gold<br />
From these brown lands, now stiff with Winter&rsquo;s cold;<br />
As from the storm-rack comes a perfect star!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O much-loved city!&nbsp; I
have wandered far<br />
From the wave-circled islands of my home;<br />
Have seen the gloomy mystery of the Dome<br />
Rise slowly from the drear Campagna&rsquo;s way,<br />
Clothed in the royal purple of the day:<br />
I from the city of the violet crown<br />
Have watched the sun by Corinth&rsquo;s hill go down,<br />
And marked the &lsquo;myriad laughter&rsquo; of the sea<br />
From starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady;<br />
Yet back to thee returns my perfect love,<br />
As to its forest-nest the evening dove.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O poet&rsquo;s city! one who
scarce has seen<br />
Some twenty summers cast their doublets green<br />
For Autumn&rsquo;s livery, would seek in vain<br />
To wake his lyre to sing a louder strain,<br />
Or tell thy days of glory;&mdash;poor indeed<br />
Is the low murmur of the shepherd&rsquo;s reed,<br />
Where the loud clarion&rsquo;s blast should shake the sky,<br />
And flame across the heavens! and to try<br />
Such lofty themes were folly: yet I know<br />
That never felt my heart a nobler glow<br />
<a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>Than
when I woke the silence of thy street<br />
With clamorous trampling of my horse&rsquo;s feet,<br />
And saw the city which now I try to sing,<br />
After long days of weary travelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">VII.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu, Ravenna! but a year
ago,<br />
I stood and watched the crimson sunset glow<br />
From the lone chapel on thy marshy plain:<br />
The sky was as a shield that caught the stain<br />
Of blood and battle from the dying sun,<br />
And in the west the circling clouds had spun<br />
A royal robe, which some great God might wear,<br />
While into ocean-seas of purple air<br />
Sank the gold galley of the Lord of Light.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet here the gentle stillness
of the night<br />
Brings back the swelling tide of memory,<br />
And wakes again my passionate love for thee:<br />
Now is the Spring of Love, yet soon will come<br />
On meadow and tree the Summer&rsquo;s lordly bloom;<br />
And soon the grass with brighter flowers will blow,<br />
And send up lilies for some boy to mow.<br />
Then before long the Summer&rsquo;s conqueror,<br />
Rich Autumn-time, the season&rsquo;s usurer,<br />
Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,<br />
<a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>And see
it scattered by the spendthrift breeze;<br />
And after that the Winter cold and drear.<br />
So runs the perfect cycle of the year.<br />
And so from youth to manhood do we go,<br />
And fall to weary days and locks of snow.<br />
Love only knows no winter; never dies:<br />
Nor cares for frowning storms or leaden skies<br />
And mine for thee shall never pass away,<br />
Though my weak lips may falter in my lay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu!&nbsp; Adieu! yon
silent evening star,<br />
The night&rsquo;s ambassador, doth gleam afar,<br />
And bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold.<br />
Perchance before our inland seas of gold<br />
Are garnered by the reapers into sheaves,<br />
Perchance before I see the Autumn leaves,<br />
I may behold thy city; and lay down<br />
Low at thy feet the poet&rsquo;s laurel crown.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu!&nbsp; Adieu! yon
silver lamp, the moon,<br />
Which turns our midnight into perfect noon,<br />
Doth surely light thy towers, guarding well<br />
Where Dante sleeps, where Byron loved to dwell.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
