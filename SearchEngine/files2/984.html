  <h2>Introduction</h2><br>

  <p>Father, what is a Legislature?</p>

  <p>A representative body elected by the people of the state.</p>

  <p>Are women people?</p>

  <p>No, my son, criminals, lunatics and women are not people.</p>

  <p>Do legislators legislate for nothing?</p>

  <p>Oh, no; they are paid a salary.</p>

  <p>By whom?</p>

  <p>By the people.</p>

  <p>Are women people?</p>

  <p>Of course, my son, just as much as men are.</p>

  these verses first appeared, the author here wishes to express
  her gratitude</i>.</p>

  <p>On February 15, the House of Representatives passed a bill

  a mill, cannery or factory which have been produced by the labor
  of children under fourteen years.</p>

  <p>Forty-three gentlemen voted against it.</p>

  <h2>The Unconscious Suffragists</h2><br>

  <p>"They who have no voice nor vote in the electing of
  representatives do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved
  to those who have votes."&mdash;Benjamin Franklin.</p>

  <p>"No such phrase as virtual representation was ever known in
  law or constitution."&mdash;James Otis.</p>

  <p>"But these great cities, says my honorable friend, are
  virtually, though not directly represented. Are not the wishes of
  Manchester, he asks, as much consulted as those of any other town
  which sends members to Parliament? Now, sir, I do not understand
  how a power which is salutary when exercised virtually can be
  noxious when exercised directly. If the wishes of Manchester have
  as much weight with us as they would have under a system which
  gives representatives to Manchester, how can there be any danger
  in giving representatives to Manchester?"&mdash;Lord Macaulay's
  Speech on the Reform Bill.</p>

  <p>"Universal suffrage prolongs in the United States the effect
  of universal education: for it stimulates all citizens throughout
  their lives to reflect on problems outside the narrow circle of
  their private interests and occupations: to read about public
  questions; to discuss public characters and to hold themselves
  ready in some degree to give a rational account of their
  political faith."&mdash;Dr. Charles Eliot.</p>

  <p>"But liberty is not the chief and constant object of their
  (the American people) desires: equality is their idol; they make
  rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty and if they miss their
  aim, resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can
  satisfy them without equality, and they would rather perish than
  lose it."&mdash;De Tocqueville: Democracy in America, 1835.</p>

  <p>"A government is for the benefit of all the people. We believe
  that this benefit is best accomplished by popular government
  because in the long run each class of individuals is apt to
  secure better provision for themselves through their own voice in
  government than through the altruistic interest of others,
  however intelligent or philanthropic."&mdash;William H. Taft in
  Special Message.</p>

  <p>"I have listened to some very honest and eloquent orators
  whose sentiments were noteworthy for this: that when they spoke
  of the people, they were not thinking of themselves, they were
  thinking of somebody whom they were commissioned to take care of.
  And I have seen them shiver when it was suggested that they
  arrange to have something done by the people for
  themselves."&mdash;The New Freedom, by Woodrow Wilson.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
