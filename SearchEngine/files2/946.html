<h2>CHARIVARIA</h2>
.
<p>Professor THATCHER of New York describes President WILSON as one
of the five greatest men in the world. Sir ERIC GEDDES is anxious
to know who the other three are.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The Jazz boom is dying out," says Mr. HERMAN DAREWSKI, "but the
next boom will be an Oriental one." There seems nothing to do about
it except to bear up.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The fact that for some time no arrest was made for the Plaistow
safe robbery seems to indicate that the thieves desired to remain
anonymous.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Like soothing balm from the dear old days comes the intimation
that Sir THOMAS LIPTON is confident of lifting the America Cup in
1920.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Up to the time of going to Press it had not been officially
decided what new uniform will be designed for the R.A.F. to be worn
during the Peace Celebrations.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The City of Philadelphia has decreed that sitting-out places in
ball-rooms must be adequately lighted. Following upon the
unauthorised publication of the Peace Terms, this is a further blow
at secret covenants.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Forty thousand children visited the Zoo on Whit-Monday, and one
anxious father who had mislaid a couple of infants stayed for a
long time in the reptile-house, looking suspiciously at the swollen
appearance of the boa constrictor.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The people of London have never understood that wisdom is not
concentrated here," said Sir GEORGE LUNN at the conference of
Associated Education Committees. These cheap sneers at Sir
FREDERICK BANBURY are beneath his notice.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Vicar of South Acton suggests that a huge prize should be
offered for the invention of a good temperance drink. We regret to
say that this is not the first studied insult that has been offered
to Government ale.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A new race, who had never seen a white man before, is reported
to have been found on Prince Albert Land, and one of them is being
taken to Maine, U.S.A. That ought to teach them to be discovered
again.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Incidentally so many errors have been made of late in executing
people in Russia that in future all orders for executions will be
signed by LENIN and will bear the words, "Errors and Omissions
Excepted."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Bolshevists have their trials just like human beings. One of
them last week was mistaken for a bourgeois and shot.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Civil servants engaged by the various Ministries will in future
be required to have special qualifications for their work. We have
always thought that this would be an advantage.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Se&ntilde;or FERNANDEZ denies the allegation that Mexico is not
now at war with any nation. It is supposed to have been spread by
jealous rivals.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In the Isle of Sheppey there is not a single person who is
drawing the unemployment donation. There seems to be no excuse
whatever for this apathy. Full particulars have appeared in the
Press.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The embargo on the export of gold from the United States is to
be raised almost immediately; meanwhile all shipments will be
carefully watched, the stuff being now nearly worth its weight in
coal.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>County Tyrone has a dog specially trained to trace whiskey.
Several people in this country have already offered it a good home,
where it will be treated as one of the family.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Asked to describe the cuckoo the other day, a small boy said it
was the bird which put its eggs out to be laid by another bird.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>At last an obliging taxi-driver has been discovered. His clock
registered six shillings and his passenger had only
five-and-sixpence, so he offered to reverse his engine in order to
wipe off the deficit.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We now hear that the authorities have decided that, if a child
should fall into any lake or river and be in peril of drowning, any
dog may be allowed to remove its muzzle for the purpose of
effecting a rescue.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>During the removal of a safe weighing three hundredweight some
burglars last week used cushions and mats to deaden the sound. We
are greatly pleased to note a tendency to study residents a little.
After all it is most irritating to be awakened by noisy burglars in
the house.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The No-Treating Order was revoked on June 4th, and it is
generally expected that this date will be made an annual, public
holiday in Scotland.</p>

<h2>THE BALAAM STAKES</h2>
.
<p>They were speeding along in the train to the Dispersal Area,
and, having moved heaven and earth to achieve demobilisation, were
now absolutely miserable on nearing their goal.</p>
<p>"Like to pick your fancy for the Derby, Docker?" asked Jimmy
Ferguson, proffering his daily paper with an air of acute
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>"Not fer me," said Docker Morgan dismally; "I sworn off after
the Balaam Stakes."</p>
<p>"I never 'eard tell of that race," said Jimmy.</p>
<p>"Well, it ain't one of the classic events. It were run over
there." Docker jerked a thumb vaguely in the direction of France.
"At a 'Concours Hippique,' which is posh fer 'Race Meeting.' Our
orficers arranged it just afore our troops left the area, and
nacherally fixed it fer the most awkward time fer me an' Nigger
Rolf, being just between paydays. After payin' to go on the course
we'd only got five francs left fer investment purposes. Nigger
wanted to plunge right away, but I stopped 'im.</p>
<p>"'No,' says I; 'we don't know 'orses, but we does know mules,
leastways as much as anyone does know mules. Let's scoop on
this.'</p>
<p>"'An' I showed 'im the programme, which said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'5.30.&mdash;THE BALAAM STAKES. For Government Mules ridden or
driven by British N.C.O.'s and men during the War.'</p>
<p>"We walked round the course an' tumbled acrost Ping Brown, got
up <i>ong chevalier</i>.</p>
<p>"'Aw-aw, Donoghue' says I, 'is it worth while backing you for a
cool thou for the Balaam?'</p>
<p>"'Well,' says he, 'I'm riding Perishing Percy. If it wus a
clog-dancing competition it 'ud be easy money, but bein' a race,
back any one, even the starter, sooner than me.'</p>
<p>"Then I met Spruggy Boyce, who useter drive with me in the
Umpteenth Field Ambulance.</p>
<p>"'Glory, Docker,' says he, falling on my neck, his top-boots
being a bit loose, 'I was looking for you.'</p>
<p>"'I ain't got no money,' says I.</p>
<p>"'But you <i>can</i> 'ave,' he whispers confidential, like they
do in the pictures. 'I'm riding Red Liz in the Balaam.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' I replies, 'I'm not denying that Red Liz is a perfect
lady; but that's 'er trouble&mdash;she's too ladylike to pass
anyone.'</p>
<p>"'Docker,' he hisses, 'do you remember driving 'er one day down
the Menin Road when Fritz started shelling?'</p>
<p>"'Don't I just! Why, she didn't fetch up till nearly at St.
Omer, and the shells lost heart becos they couldn't catch 'er.
But,' I says regretfully, it takes shells to start Red Liz, an' we
ain't got none.'</p>
<p>"'No, we 'aven't got shells,' whispers Spruggy, 'but I 've got
some crackers; an' if you sprinkle some on the course, it's a
cert.'</p>
<p>"'Right-o!' says I. 'Me an' Nigger will see it through, if
you'll lend us another five francs to invest.'</p>
<p>"Then I went to <i>cherchay</i> a bookie, but I couldn't find
one anywheres.</p>
<p>"'They don't 'ave 'em 'ere,' says Nigger. 'You invests at the
sheds over there&mdash;the <i>Paree Mutual</i>.'</p>
<p>"'That's an insurance company,' answers I. 'I want to put a bit
on, not take out a life policy.'</p>
<p>"'That's the place, I tells you,' says Nigger; 'the <i>Paree
Mutual</i> or the <i>Total Liza</i>. If you don't 'urry you won't
get it on before the race starts.'</p>
<p>"So I fights my way through the surging mob to the counter.</p>
<p>"'What odds for Red Liz in the five-thirty?' says I.</p>
<p>"'<i>Je ne comprong pas</i>,' says the bet merchant, and before
I could say another word the crowd swept me away. I went back to
Nigger.</p>
<p>"'Look 'ere, Nigger,' says I indignantly, 'I don't like this
way. I likes to speckerlate with a bookie&mdash;one with a wooden
leg as can't run for preference&mdash;who tells you what odds 'e's
going to give an' doesn't 'ave to work it out in vulgar fractions
afterwards.'</p>
<p>"'You 'eart-breaking turnip!' says Nigger; 'give me the
money.'</p>
<p>"'E came back in a few minutes with a bit o' card that looked
like a pawn-ticket.</p>
<p>"'That's done,' he says. 'If it wins we just takes this ticket
an' 'e pays out on it. An' now let's go an' see 'em come out.'</p>
<p>"There wus ten starters, and four changed their minds at the
post. Perishing Percy did some neat an' effective steps that would
'ave gone better with music, an' then stopped dead to listen for
the applause. Whips nor spurs weren't allowed in the race, an'
peaceful persuasion don't go far with a mule; but about five of 'em
pursued the narrow and straight path that leads to the
winning-post. A big, raw-boned animal, named Gentle Maggot,
floundering along with one foot in the franc side an' tother in the
enclosure, with two other feet that couldn't be simultaneously
located, was leading, an' a chestnut named Coughdrop was a good
second. Red Liz was flapping her long ears an' coming along very
genteelly in the rear. When they wus nearly level to us, Nigger
whispers to me to get the cracker ready; but me hands were
trembling so with excitement that I couldn't light it.</p>
<p>"'Give 'em to me, you idjut!' says Nigger, and he plunked one
neatly by Red Liz's ribs. She started, and Nigger plants another
one behind 'er. Then she put 'er 'ead down and tore along like mad.
She passed three, got level with Coughdrop, passed 'er, an' thirty
yards from home was neck with Gentle Maggot. Both Jocks were
whooping like mad, but just as everyone was swearing it was going
to be a dead-heat, I thumped Nigger hard on the back an' yelled
out, 'We've won!'</p>
<p>"Spruggy 'ad jerked Red Liz's head down just at the post, an'
she 'ad won by an ear!"</p>
<p>"Well, that was good enough, wasn't it?" said Jimmy, as Docker
finished his narrative with a mournful downward inflexion of
voice.</p>
<p>"It would 'ave been," replied Docker; "only Nigger 'ad put the
ticket in 'is mouth while 'e lighted the cracker, an' when I
thumped 'im on the back it startled 'im, an'&mdash;'<i>e swallered
it</i>."</p>

<h2>THE POET.</h2>
<p>In a distant country, at a remote epoch, was born of humble
parents a poet. "Born" advisedly, since the poet is always born,
not made. Even before he could write he composed little poems,
which he would recite aloud. The simple pleasures of the poor,
among whom he grew up&mdash;intoxication, pugilism, funeral
merry-makings&mdash;furnished the themes of his verse.</p>
<p>Upon reaching man's estate he adopted the calling of
night-watchman, an occupation which provided him at once with a
livelihood and ample opportunities for meditation. It is to this
period that the "Nocturnes" belong.</p>
<p>Now it happened that the poet's work reached the eye of the
Prince, who, anxious to encourage genius, appointed him to some
minor place about Court and endowed it with a pension. Moreover, to
complete his happiness he gave him in marriage a beautiful and
accomplished maiden, for whom the poet had long cherished an ardent
but hopeless passion. So, as by enchantment, the course of the
poet's existence was changed. He no longer waked while others
slept. On the contrary he seldom left his couch until a late hour
in the morning, and when at last he rose it was often to pass the
rest of the day in a Turkish bath.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of altered circumstances he still remained a poet,
for the poet is born, not made, or unmade. The tenor of his poetry
however was changed. Instead of the rude and vigorous subjects
which formerly engaged his lyre he would now employ his art in
verse of the daintiest, to celebrate flowers, ladies' eyebrows and
similar trivialities.</p>
<p>This style however was not altogether to the taste of the
munificent Prince. He had expected something stronger, something
more in the grand manner. So he consulted a Wise Man, an adept in
the ways of poets, one greatly in demand as a writer of
biographical prefaces to poetical reprints.</p>
<p>The Wise Man heard him to the end and replied as follows: "Sire,
you have been ill-advised. Who ever heard of a happy poet? Poetry
and prosperity are incompatible. Instead of trying to make your
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> joyful you should have heaped sorrow
upon him. It is well known that sorrow ennobles a man and enlarges
his emotional experience. 'Poets learn in suffering what they teach
in song' sang one of them who knew.</p>
<p>"However it is not too late. When next he seeks your Presence,
indicate to him with that tact which is the birthright of princes
that he no longer enjoys your favour. At the same time stop his
pension and allow him to taste once more the life from which your
bounty removed him. Could you contrive that he loses the affection
of his wife, and that he falls into a consumption, so much the
better. In addition, if it please your Highness, I will arrange
that all his work is unfavourably noticed in the Press and that
calumnies concerning his private life are circulated in the
personal paragraph columns."</p>
<p>"Thanks very much," said the Prince, and dismissed the Wise Man
with a handsome fee.</p>
<p>A few days later, when the poet presented himself at Court, the
monarch rose from his throne, took a short run and kicked him in a
vulnerable part. Breathless the poet was borne by lackeys from the
royal presence, wherein he never again showed himself. At the next
meeting of the Council the Prince annulled his pension by a stroke
of the pen. Thus the poet was thrust back into the cold world.</p>
<p>Now began a period for him of intense unhappiness. Having lost
his old business <span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id=
"page477"></a>[pg 477]</span> connection he could no longer obtain
employment in his original vocation. He had therefore no
alternative to avert starvation but to follow the precarious
calling of a cab-runner. These events, it will be recalled,
happened in a bygone age, before the motor superseded the horse.
Often, after a weary trail half across the town behind a
luggage-laden Cab, only to find that the family kept a man-servant,
he would return to the cellar that was now his home, penniless and
exhausted.</p>
<p>Long hours spent over the washtub, to eke out their scanty
earnings, had rendered his wife&mdash;once the "Fay" of the "Love
Songs"&mdash;both muscular and short-tempered. On such occasions
she would lay hands on the poet and thrash him till he wept. But
throughout all he remained a poet, for the poet is born not made.
Every tear in falling turned to a sonnet. His sorrows were
transmuted into poems&mdash;poems now suffused with the
concentrated emotions of the human race.</p>
<p>Nevertheless each one as it appeared was brutally slated in the
organs controlled by the literary adviser to the Crown, and himself
belittled and ridiculed. When, as luck would have it, his wife
eloped with a wrestler, a flood of melody poured from his soul
which, connoisseurs have assured us, ranks high amongst the lyrical
masterpieces of the world. These verses will be found amongst the
collection known as "Swan Songs," published posthumously, for, not
long after, the poet unfortunately developed phthisis and died.</p>
<p>But though he was thus cut-off in early manhood his name will
live for ever. It is borne by a square in the boarding-house
quarter of the capital and by a cravat which, though, alas, no
longer in the fashion, is still worn every Sunday by countless
artisans.</p>
<p>His poems too have achieved immortality. Showily bound they make
a favourite school prize and have given entertainment to
generations of cultured refined persons, who have never paused in
their reading to give a thought to the author of their enjoyment,
the sagacious Prince to whose action they owe their emotional
treat. His royal Highness's reward was his own aesthetic
satisfaction. "By Heaven, this is more like," he rapturously
exclaimed as he laid down the last volume of the collected works;
"this verse has got some stuff in it." And on the occasion of his
next birthday he conferred the Companionship of a Household Order
upon the poet's publisher.</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>
<p>"<i>Gurr finny,"</i> says T. Atkins, and there seems no doubt
about the well-known War being over at last. Home-keeping folk, who
imagine it ended when the whistle blew at the eleventh hour of
November 11th, are wide, very wide, of the mark. We have
experienced some of its direst horrors since then. Why, at one time
(and not so long ago) we were without the bare necessities of life
itself.</p>
<p>I have seen hardy old soldiers; banded like zebras with
wound-stripes and field-service chevrons, offering to barter a
perfectly good horse for a packet of Ruby Queen cigarettes, or swap
a battery of Howitzers for a flagon of Scotch methylated. Then came
the Great Downfall. Nabobs, who for years had been purring about
back areas in expensive cars, dressed up like movie-kings, were
suddenly debussed and dismantled. Brigadiers sorrowfully plucked
the b&acirc;tons from off their shoulder-straps and replaced them
in their knapsacks. The waste-paper baskets brimmed with red
flannelette and gilt edging. Field officers cast down their golden
crowns and crept slowly back to their original units as substantive
lieutenants.</p>
<p>And now all are gone, some home to England to write for <i>The
Times</i> (Appointments Required column) and some to watch the
Rhine and see that it gets up to no irregularities, such as running
the wrong way or dry. Here, on the fringe of the old
battle-grounds, only the merest handful of us remain, deserted by
the field armies, apparently forgotten by the management.</p>
<p>It has happened before. Bob, our Camp Commandant, swears that a
battalion of his regiment, while garrisoning some ocean isle, got
mislaid for years and years, and they would have been there to this
day, chatting to the crabs and watering the palm-trees with their
tears, if some junior subaltern had not sent his birthday-book to
KITCHENER with the request that the Field-Marshal would inscribe
some verses therein.</p>
<p>Occasionally the boom of explosions coming from the devastated
areas tells us that our brave allies the Chinese are still on deck,
salvaging ammunition after their own unique fashion of rapping
shells smartly over the nose-caps with sledge-hammers to test
whether they be really duds or no.</p>
<p>Although a very courageous man, I do not linger in their
whereabouts unless I have to. I don't follow their line of thought.
One of them unearthed a MILLS bomb the other day. It gave off blue
smoke and fizzed prettily. When last seen he was holding it to the
ear of a chum, who was smiling entrancedly, as a child smiles at
the croon of a conch-shell.</p>
<p>By the way, whilst we are on the subject, who is this MILLS? The
illustrated papers have shown us THE MAN WHO WON THE WAR, the
thousand-and-one sole and only inventors of Tinribs the Tank; their
prattle-pages are crammed daily with portraits of war-worn
flag-sellers, heroic O.B.E.'s, and so on; but what of our other
benefactors, the names of whom are far more familiar to the average
Atkins than are those of the Twelve Apostles or his own Generals? I
confess, to a great desire to behold the features of Mr. MILLS, the
bombster (I picture him a benevolent-looking old gentleman with a
flowing white beard), Mr. STOKES of the gun, Mrs. AYRTON of the
gas-fan, and Messrs. ARMSTRONG and NISSEN, the hutters. Can no
enterprising picture-paper supply the want?</p>
<p>But to return to ourselves. With the exception of the faithful
Celestial, the land is empty of human interest. The roads that once
rumbled unceasingly with wheels and swarmed with merry men now run
bare under a sad sky. The deepway side drains, in which our lorries
used to play at submarines, now harbour nothing more exciting than
tadpoles. We are hard-pressed to find mischief for our idle hands
to do.</p>
<p>Sherlock the Sleuth keeps himself in fair fettle by prowling
round the countryside and trying to restrain the aborigines from
pinching what little British material they have not already
pinched. Yesterday he came upon a fatigue party of Gauls staggering
down a by-way under the shell of an Armstrong hut. He whooped and
gave chase. The Gauls, sighting the A.P.M. brassard, promptly
dumped the hut and dived through a wire fence. Sherlock hitched his
horse to a post and followed afoot, snorting fire and brimstone.
They led him at a smart trot over four acres of boggy plough,
through a brambly plantation, two prickly hedges and a
richly-perfumed drain and went to ground inextricably in some mine
buildings. He returned, blown, battered and baffled, to the
starting-point, to find that some third party had in the meantime
removed the Armstrong hut&mdash;also his horse.</p>
<p>Ronald, our only remaining Red Hat, saves his soul from boredom
by keeping all the H.Q. departments open and conducting, on his
own, a brisk correspondence between them. As there are about thirty
of these and he conducts them all himself it will be understood
that this entails a certain amount of movement on his part.</p>
<p>Bob, the Camp Commandant, spends his time trying to square his
returns and interviewing Violet. Violet is a middle-aged gentleman
who came to us from some Labour unit and refuses to leave. He has
an enormous head, a walrus moustache, a hairy nose, and feet which
flap as they walk. His <i>m&eacute;tier</i> is to keep the place
tidy and the incinerator fires burning. He prowls about at night,
accompanied by a large ginger tom-cat, harpooning loose scraps of
paper. Any dust he meets he deals with on the blotting-paper
principle, by rolling in it and absorbing it. When his clothes are
so stiff with dirt that they will stand up without any inside
assistance from Violet, they are sawn off him and consigned to the
incinerator and he is given a new suit. Whenever his back hair has
grown so long that it is liable to impede his movements, a
<i>posse</i> of grooms is despatched to his lair to rope, throw and
shear him with horse-clippers. Last time they did it they swear
they lost the instrument twice and that two bats and an owl flew
out of his tresses.</p>
<p>He is allowed out only at night, because the German prisoners
laugh at him, which is bad for his <i>moral</i> and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>[pg 479]</span> good
for theirs. He lives, he and his cat, deep in the chateau woods in
a tiny semi-subterranean cabin he has constructed of odds and ends
of tin and tar-paper. He was supposed to have been demobilised ages
ago, but we cannot get him off the premises.</p>
<p>Bob goes and interviews him on the subject about three times a
day&mdash;all to no avail. "'Tain't a bit o' use you comin' an'
flappin' them there paperses at me, Mister" (all officers,
irrespective of rank, are "Mister" to Violet), says he to Bob; "you
know very well I aren't no scholard an' I won't sign nothin' I
can't read, even if I could sign, which I can't, bein' no scholard;
so there's the end of it, as I've told you scores of times before,
with all due respect, of course, as the sayin' is."</p>
<p>He doesn't want to go home and he <i>won't</i> go home, he says.
His wife beats him "somethink crool," he says; in fact he never
knew what real peace meant until war broke out. Furthermore she has
been putting on a lot of muscle of late and demobilisation means
certain death. He is going to stay where he is. What with the
ginger cat's poaching proclivities and the bully beef he has buried
in the plantation he can hold out almost indefinitely, he says; so
there is no cause for us to be anxious on his behalf. When we come
back for the next war we shall find him on the old stand, ready to
resume business, he says, and for his part the next war can't break
out any too soon.</p>
<p>The remainder of Bob's time, as I said before, is occupied in
trying to square his establishment returns. Some time ago he
discovered that he was a water-cart short. This was serious, very.
A water-cart is a large and expensive item, and as far as he could
see it would end in his having to make good the loss out of his own
pocket, which at that moment contained ten centimes and a
corkscrew.</p>
<p>However he was determined he would see what a little applied
cunning would do first. He locked himself into his office and took
thought. After an hour's violent mental disturbance he penned a
letter to the authorities, saying that his establishment was
complete in all details, with the exception of one water-bottle.
As, however, he had come by several superfluous knives, spoons and
forks considerably exceeding the water-bottle in value, might they
be taken in exchange and the account squared? The Government would
be greatly the gainer thereby.</p>
<p>Four days later he was notified that the transaction was
approved. After waiting till he was reasonably certain that the
correspondence was safely lost, burnt or consigned to impenetrable
archives, he sent the following wire:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Reference my R.L.217, dated April 1st, for 'bottle' read
'cart.'"</p>
<p>The reply came back, "Noted."</p>

<h2>THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS;</h2>
<p class="center">OR, THE FIGHT AGAINST REACTION.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MY DEAR KNOTT,&mdash;It has occurred to me that since the
closing of our little V.A.D. dep&ocirc;t there is a good deal of
energy in Filby without a suitable outlet, and I am writing to you
on the matter as I feel sure you will have some helpful suggestion
to make.</p>
<p>Of course a great deal of this energy might be profitably
expended on the ever-increasing spiritual needs of the parish, but
I feel that if some society of a secular character were got up just
now it would be helpful, especially to the female portion of our
community.</p>
<p>Miss Timlin has suggested a Philatelic Society, and I shall be
pleased to hear your views on her proposal.</p>
<p>Believe me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours ever sincerely,</p>
<p class="author">THEODORE BLAND.</p>
<br />
<p>"DEAR VICAR,&mdash;I have your letter and quite agree as to the
advisability of starting some society for working off the latent
energy which has accumulated since the demise of the War and the
consequent closing down of War activities. I do not however fancy
Philately as a safety-valve. I suppose one <i>could</i> stand up to
stick stamps in a book, and would get a certain amount of physical
exercise in going about swapping duds and duplicates, but generally
speaking it is a sedentary occupation and, to my mind, a selfish
one.</p>
<p>As you ask for a suggestion from me, I propose an Archaeological
Society. The pursuit of Archaeology has this advantage: it connotes
digging, an aptitude for which has been distinctly fostered here by
the allotment habit.</p>
<p>As for our objective, without going further than Filby there is
the alleged tunnel leading from the ruins of the nunnery to no one
knows where. It would be interesting to know whether the
thirteenth-century Lord of Filby had a private way (on the score of
feudalities) to the Ursuline convent, or whether the good nuns had
a back-way to the Old Swan for the conveyance of mead, sack and
such other strong waters as the times and licensing laws afforded.
But perhaps the tunnel, like most things, is controlled, and a
<i>mandamus</i> (which, I take it, is a kind of ecclesiastical
coupon) would be required before we could touch it.</p>
<p>Of course there are a mound and the foundations of an old wall
in my paddock which the Society are welcome to tackle. Don't you
think they would do to begin on?</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="author">ARCHIBALD C. KNOTT.</p>
<br />
<p>MY DEAR KNOTT,&mdash;Many thanks for your valuable help. I think
you may expect quite a good turn up of members on Tuesday. I have
always thought that the tumulus in your field might yield some
interesting archaeological find. The land and a former mansion were
part of the Convent demesne, as you probably know. I am sorry that
I shall not be present as I have to attend the Bishop's Conference
at Bray Chester, which is expected to last a week or two.</p>
<p>Wishing you all success and with kind regards to yourself and
Mrs. Knott,</p>
<p>I am,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours ever sincerely,</p>
<p class="author">THEODORE BLAND.</p>
<br />
<p>MY DEAR VICAR,&mdash;Thanks for yours. I am very sorry you have
been called away at such a time.</p>
<p>The first meeting was so successful that a second was fixed for
Wednesday. But enthusiasm seemed to flag on Wednesday evening, as
nothing of interest had been discovered.</p>
<p>A few die-hards agreed to put in some hours' digging on
Thursday, when Colonel Stacey and Mrs. Cottingham each dug up a
Roman bronze coin (both denarii, I fancy) from the mound. This of
course acted as a great stimulant, and we had a bumper meeting on
Friday. Stacey, I understand, intends to read a paper, at the first
indoor meeting of the society, on the Roman occupation of
Filby-in-the-Wold. The mound is now levelled, and the wall
foundations have all been dug up and carted away; but the latter
yielded nothing of interest.</p>
<p>Hoping that the Conference is going as you would wish,</p>
<p>I am,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="author">ARCHIBALD C. KNOTT.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;Couldn't you touch up the Bishop on the subject of
the Convent tube?</p>
<br />
<p>DEAR VICAR,&mdash;We have had an archaeological strike. The
mound is levelled, the wall foundations have disappeared, and so
have the diggers. I am afraid the Society are now awaiting your
return to give them a lead. My grounds, alas, have produced nothing
beyond the two denarii.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="author">ARCHIBALD C. KNOTT.</p>
<br />
<p><i>[Extract.]</i></p>
<p>DEAR BOY,&mdash;Your mother and I are delighted that you will be
demobbed in about a week from now.... By the way you will be glad
to hear that we can start making that second tennis-court in the
paddock as soon as you get back. I have had the remains of what was
known as Knott's Folly in your great-grandfather's day removed, at
a total cost of two denarii (which had been lying in a drawer in my
dressing-room for years); not so bad, considering the present cost
of labour. But of this more anon.</p>

<h3>FOR THE CHILDREN.</h3>
<p>At this season, when their own children are already counting the
days that lie between them and their holidays, Mr. Punch appeals to
his kind readers not to forget the greater needs of the children in
our elementary schools. The cost of sending them away to the sea or
countryside for fresh air and change of scene is constantly
increasing and the Children's Country Holidays Fund cannot keep up
its good work without generous help. There can be no better way of
making a Peace-offering than by helping to build up the health and
strength of the new generation. Mr. Punch begs that liberal gifts
may be sent to the Secretary of the Fund at 18, Buckingham Street,
Strand, W.C.2.</p>

<h3>OUR MOVIE-MINISTERS.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>(Deductions by a Political Expert.)</i></p>
<p>The admirable plan of transplanting Ministers admittedly doing
excellent work in their departments just as they are settling down
in the saddle, though generally commended by supporters of the
Government, is meeting with a certain amount of criticism.
Appointments which show "imagination" are, it is urged, shorn of
their possibilities when the holders are moved on just when they
are beginning to provide the public with sensation.</p>
<p>Speculations are rife as to the appointment of a new Minister of
Education, and the best-informed opinion inclines to the view that
Sir ERIC GEDDES, who has occupied his present position for quite a
number of weeks, will succeed Mr. FISHER. Some experts however hold
that the PREMIER has a magnificent opportunity for displaying his
imagination by the choice of Mr. WELLS, who is burning to disprove
the recent astounding allegation of General WILSON that the War
could not have been won without the Universities. The chief
objection to Mr. WELLS, however, is that he cannot be transferred,
because he is not already in office; and this drawback also
operates in the case of Mr. SMILLIE and Mr. BOTTOMLEY.</p>
<p>In this context it is to be noted that Lord READING (so at least
we understand from the peculiarly plaintive smile which he wears in
recent photographs) is much disappointed that the claims of Mr.
T.P. O'CONNOR to the post of Ambassador at Washington have so far
failed of due recognition. American antagonism over the Irish
Question has not been conciliated by this strange oversight.</p>

<h2>THE ROOFS OF THE MIGHTY.</h2>
<p>At the meeting held recently in the hall of the Worshipful
Company of Hatters in Tile Street, the Chair was taken jointly (as
in the old monarchical days at Brentford) by the Bishop of LINCOLN
and Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT, and among the company were the SPEAKER,
Lord RIBBLESDALE, Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT, Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL and
Mr. EUGENE CORRI.</p>
<p>The two Chairmen, speaking almost in unison, stated that the
meeting had been convened in order that the views of the
enlightened might be gathered regarding the proposed revival of the
tall hat or topper. A recrudescence of this form of covering for
the hair (or otherwise) was threatened under the name of the
Victory Derby, and a paragraph in <i>The Times</i> announced that
"so remarkable has been the revival in the silk-hat trade that old
men who had gone into retirement in the Denton and Stockport
districts are being asked to come back and give what productive
energy they possess." What the meeting desired to ascertain was the
views as to this revival that were held by those empowered to offer
opinions.</p>
<p>Lord RIBBLESDALE said that there was no doubt that a tall hat
was the most becoming headgear for a gentleman. But a certain
regard for idiosyncracies was important. No gentleman should take
without scrutiny what the hatter offered. Hats were individual
things, and as the character changed and developed so should the
hat. The hat that suited one at forty might be a sad anachronism at
fifty. He himself had endeavoured not only to make his life
correspond to his hats, but his hats correspond to his life. (Loud
applause.) As the Master of the Buck-hounds he wore, as any visitor
to the National Gallery at the present moment might see, at the
head of the staircase on the left, a tall hat that was slightly
lower than that which he wore to-day, now that he had relinquished
that responsible and romantic post. He urged his hearers to
encourage the silk hat revival.</p>
<p>Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT concurred with the illustrious nobleman who
had just spoken. The choice of a hat should be the subject of the
most earnest thought, even of prayer. (Cheers.) Not only the shape
but the colour. There were hats that were black and hats that were
white. (Shouts of "Hurrah!") There were even white hats with black
trimming. (Sensation.) The older he grew the more convinced he was
that an Englishman's hat was his castle.</p>
<p>Miss DAISY ASHFORD, author of <i>The Young Visiters</i>, said
that she was all in favour of the top hat. No one who had read her
famous novel could doubt that. In the society of <i>Mr.
Salteena</i> and his friends to wear a tall hat was always the
idear.</p>
<p>Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL said that none of the speakers had
mentioned the most essential desideratum of a hat, and that was
that it should be too small. Whether it began by being too small,
or became in time too small, depended upon the wearer; but there
was something smug and cowardly about a hat that fitted. It
suggested failure.</p>
<p>Mr. H.B. IRVING said that he was an impenitent advocate of the
soft or Southern hat. It was the duty of a hat to afford not only
covering for the head but shelter for the eyes, and no topper did
this. A hat should have a flexible brim, which neither topper nor
bowler possessed. It was absurd to wear a hat which could not
sustain damage without showing it. Let there be a revival in the
silk-hat industry by all means, but there must be no <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>[pg 487]</span>
imposition of any one kind of hat on the public. The individual
must be allowed perfect freedom to wear what he liked. (Hear,
hear!) He personally hoped never to be seen either in a pith helmet
or a Tam-o'-shanter, but if the whim took him to wear
either&mdash;or indeed both&mdash;he claimed the right to do so.
(Loud cheers.) Meanwhile he should adhere to his soft hat.</p>
<p>Mr. MASKELYNE, who followed, urged upon the company the
desirability of the silk-hat mode. If tall hats, he said, went out
of fashion, what would become of conjurers? Rabbits could be
satisfactorily extracted only from tall hats. (Prolonged cheering.)
An omelette made in a sombrero was unthinkable. (Renewed
cheering.)</p>
<p>Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT said that all this talk about toppers was
pernicious nonsense. The topper had become obsolete and should not
be disinterred. The only honest form of hat for an honest
straightforward man was a white bowler. A white bowler and a blue
serge suit made as stylish and effective a garb as anyone needed.
Soft hats no doubt were comfortable, but they were also slovenly.
Moreover they were not practical. At a horse sale, for example, you
could not rattle them. As for the plea that tall hats were of value
to conjurers, he had no use for such arguments. Conjurers dealt in
illusion and all illusion was retrograde. (Oh! Oh!).</p>
<p>The Bishop of LINCOLN said that he felt bound to dissociate
himself from his, partner's remarks. He himself looked upon a silk
hat as an essential. (A voice, "With rigging?") Yes, Sir, with
rigging. But that was not why he advocated it. He advocated it
because it was the proper coping-stone of a gentleman.</p>
<p>The SPEAKER, after eulogising the white tall hat, added that
although he was glad that they had Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT with them
(Hear, hear) he was bound to remark that not infrequently of late
he had seen that illustrious histrion wearing in the streets of
London a cloth cap more suitable to the golf-links or the
Highlands. For the devotee of the white hat of a blameless life
thus to descend gave him pain. So distinguished an edifice as Sir
SQUIRE, he contended, should not trifle with its top-storey.
(Cheers.)</p>
<p>Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT, rising again, expressed regret that his
cloth cap should have caused any distress, He wore it, he was bound
to admit, for convenience (Oh!) and comfort (Sensation). But he
would not offend again. (Loud cheers.)</p>
<p>At this point the meeting adjourned, but doubtless, taking a
hint from the Coal inquiry, it will often be resumed during the
coming year.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<p class="center">"L'AIGLON."</p>
<p>In a note given away with the programme Mr. LOUIS N. PARKER,
describes <i>L'Aiglon</i> as "the Hamlet of the nineteenth
century." Certainly they had in common the habits of introspection,
and indecision; but the egoism of <i>Hamlet</i> was at least
tempered by a knowledge of the world; he was a student; he had
travelled and seen men and things outside the bounds of Elsinore;
and he was capable of throwing off some quotable generalities out
of his stock of philosophy. On the other hand the <i>Eaglet</i>,
mewed in his Austrian cage, knew nothing of life at large, and had
small chance of learning anything beyond the bowdlerised history
which his tutors and warders thought good to have him stuffed
with.</p>
<p>Somehow he had contrived surreptitiously to pick up the dates
and leading facts of his father's campaigns (making a speciality of
the Battle of Wagram), but the vague ambitions which they inspired
only helped his little mind to prey upon itself. It was not "the
times" (as with <i>Hamlet</i>) but his own nose that he found to be
"out of joint."</p>
<p>The appeal of <i>Hamlet</i> is to the intelligence; that of
<i>L'Aiglon</i>, so obviously pathetic in his own eyes, is rather
to the heart. Indeed the intelligence of the audience is here often
in trouble; for a certain acquaintance with history is required and
both actors and stage-management offer little aid to the average
ignorance. While the more obvious and melodramatic
situations&mdash;such as the death of <i>L'Aiglon</i> or the
business of the sentry&mdash;are treated at great leisure, it is
assumed that all historical allusions, however necessary to an
understanding of the situation, will be as tedious to the audience
as to the players, and they are rushed through&mdash;as in the
mirror scene&mdash;-at a pace that baffles our halting pursuit.</p>
<p>If any male character lends itself to interpretation by a woman,
it is such a character as <i>L'Aiglon</i>, who, for all his spasms
of martial ardour, was half feminine. And to this side of him, and
not this side alone, Miss MARIE L&Ouml;HR did justice in a
performance of which her high spirit had not underrated the
difficulties. But it is a long and exigent part, and there were
times in the play when her physical strength was overtaxed. It
would have taken the voice of a strongish <i>basso</i> to drown the
roar of a whole battlefield of ghostly warriors, with a military
band thrown in.</p>
<p>I am not sure that Miss L&Ouml;HR quite realised for us the
<i>Duke of Reichstadt's</i> personality. I should not care to have
the task myself, for a good many complicated elements were mixed in
his nature. As Mr. Louis PARKER reminds you, a French father
supplied him with ambition and love of action, an Austrian
grandfather with hesitancy, and Spanish ancestors with fatalism, a
very trying combination for even the original <i>Eaglet</i> to
handle&mdash;a mere boy who had never so much as heard of President
WILSON'S League of Nation's. So it was excusable if Miss L&Ouml;HR
failed to make us completely realise a personality which was almost
certainly too much for the comprehension of its actual owner.</p>
<p>But she was always ah intriguing figure. Perhaps,
indeed&mdash;for the apparel does not always proclaim the man, and
the <i>Eaglet</i> was no <i>Hamlet</i> in the matter of his
clothes&mdash;her rather striking costumes were a source of too
much distraction.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href=
"images/488.png"><img width="100%" src="images/488.png" alt=
"" /></a>THE LITTLE EAGLE TRIES TO FLY.<br />
Miss Marie L&ouml;hr.</div>
<p>In a very large cast, whose identities were here and there a
little shadowy, the interest was so distributed that nobody except
Miss L&Ouml;HR had very much chance. But Mr. FISHER WHITE made a
touching picture of the weak old Austrian Emperor, torn between
love of his grandchild and fear of <i>Metternich</i>.
<i>Metternich</i> himself, in the person of Mr. HENRY VIBART,
seemed hardly sinister, enough for the part he had to play in
keeping the <i>Eaglet</i> under the talons of the "two-headed
fowl." But it is perhaps difficult to look really sinister in the
full official uniform of a Chancellor.</p>
<p>Mr. LYN HARDING, as <i>Flambeau</i>, veteran of NAPOLEON'S Army,
introduced a faint suggestion of badly-needed humour, and relieved
the general atmosphere of Court artificiality by a touch of nature
which almost reconciled us to the improbable burst of eloquence
that ROSTAND, with his reckless prodigality, assigned to this rough
soldier.</p>
<p>Miss LETTICE FAIRFAX gave a pleasant air of irresponsibility to
the shallow <i>Maria Louisa</i>, and made her bear very lightly her
cross of widowhood (with bar). The briefest possible vision of Miss
BETTY FAIRE as <i>Fanny Elssler</i> made me want to see much more
of her; but Mr. Louis PARKER had been Napoleonically ruthless with
the text. His translation sounded well, though the delivery of it
sometimes left me doubtful as to what was prose and what was verse.
As for his production of the play, it showed the old skill of a
Past-Master of Pageantry.</p>
<p>Altogether Miss MARIE L&Ouml;HR has been justified of her
courage. In a happy little speech from which we learnt that every
one of the voices (off) in the Wagram scene was a demobilised voice
from the fighting fronts, she told us that her revival of
<i>L'Aiglon</i> was intended as a tribute to Art after all these
years of War. We were not, I think, meant to take this as a
reflection upon the part played by the British Theatre in
sustaining the nation's soul during the War. Anyhow, I for one
shall read into her words just a brave promise&mdash;not, I hope,
too sanguine&mdash;of what we may expect from the new birth of the
Arts of Peace.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER PENDING INDEMNITY</h2>
.
<p>It has been said that the man who for his daily shave resorts
habitually to a barber has already become a subject for a drastic
moral operation. That may or may not be so, but having chambers in
Ryder Street and Alphonse residing within the precincts of St.
James's, I would rather have been carved morally into mincemeat
than have robbed such an artist of his self-expression.</p>
<p>That is how I felt about it in 1914 and in many preceding years,
during which, under the magic spell of Alphonse, the razor fell
upon my cheek like thistledown. Even to be lathered by him was an
alluring form of hypnosis. Alphonse was a Hokusai of barbers, but
he was also a true son of France; and there were Alsace and
Lorraine and the arrogance of 1870 still to be accounted for. So
Alphonse went, and in his place reigned Ferdinand.</p>
<p>Ferdinand, what there was of him, was a good fellow. He was an
old fire-eater. He had lost a leg in Algeria and an eye somewhere
else, and he could not comprehend why such trivial matters should
disqualify a man for killing pigs. He was, as I have said, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>[pg
489]</span> good fellow, but his methods of using a razor were
mediaeval. However we were not long for one another, and, as the
R.N.V.R. tolerate such things, I grew a beard, an equable,
regulation torpedo beard.</p>
<p>Omitting several super-emotional lifetimes, let us speak of a
certain day not very remote when I stood, bereft of all sea power,
at the top of St. James's Street, considering what was the very
best worst thing to do to a body which was bored with the reaction
that follows four years' strife upon the narrow seas. I fingered my
beard meditatively. Yes, after all there was Alphonse. I had almost
forgotten him. I turned my steps towards his exclusive retreat. I
entered in, and behold! there as of yore, clothed in his samite
raiment, stood the incomparable Alphonse. He had returned. Yet in
appearance he was not quite the Alphonse of old. There was
something less resilient about him, something more enduring had
crept into his personality; his elasticity had somehow turned to
bronze. He was slightly grey. Nevertheless he greeted me with a
Gallic warmth that gave refreshment to my jaded spirit.</p>
<p>"But M'sieu would be shaved.... Yes, a beard was permissible in
time of War, but in Peace&mdash;pouf! it was barbaric."</p>
<p>I allowed myself to be robed and tucked comfortably into the
chair. Alphonse busied himself with the instruments of his
profession.</p>
<p>"Five years ago it was another world, M'sieu," he said, churning
a wooden bowl to mountains of lather. "It is never again the same.
The Marne ... Verdun ... Soissons. If M'sieu permits I would like
to tell him of those years."</p>
<p>I nodded and he advanced upon me with the brush. He spoke of the
retreat to Paris and the strategy of JOFFRE which so nearly
overthrew three Prussian armies. He brandished his razor and swept
the Boches back over the Marne, he swept them through Senlis, he
swept them across the Aisne. His intensity was inspiring. The
smouldering fires of bygone battles leapt into his eyes. But it was
not the mesmeric shave of 1914. He apologised humbly and applied
small pieces of plaster.</p>
<p>The next morning we fought a swaying battle in front of Rheims,
and for some few following mornings we skirmished about painlessly
in the same vicinity. Then came a sanguinary excursion to Flanders
which nearly put me into blue overalls.</p>
<p>A few weeks of trench warfare gave me some respite and allowed
my worst wounds to heal.</p>
<p>Then came the epic of Verdun. At least it was to have come, but
at the last moment I lost my nerve.</p>
<p>To hear the story of that heroic defence from the lips of one
who was concerned so intimately with it is one of my greatest
desires. But I am a coward. I cannot face the extravaganza that
Alphonse would improvise, neither dare I approach him for a mere
haircut and so confess to having deserted his other form of
artistry.</p>
<p>Yesterday I purchased a safety-razor and a packet of new
blades.</p>

<h2>ART IN THE ARCTIC.</h2>
<p>To know that you can't draw and to be told so by your friends
are two very different things. Honnell can't draw, but hates his
inseparable Swan to tell him so. Honnell's sketches have hitherto
been criticised only by people who also wanted their drawing
flattered. Swan learned bluntness on the Yukon. So they are an odd
pair to be chumming now in the Arctic circle. They are so friendly
that they will tramp together for half a day and exchange scarcely
so much as a grunt of conversation.</p>
<p>Swan, of course, feels quite at home in North Russia and smiles
at the people who call it cold and its distances big. Honnell has
lived in Edinburgh, so doesn't notice the temperature, though he
misses the tramway system. Both can say about six words&mdash;the
same&mdash;in Russian, and both have bought a pair of
moccasins&mdash;Swan because he likes them, and Honnell because he
would like to.</p>
<p>Recently they set off together from Kola on the Murman Coast to
try to find a village from which jolly little Laplanders and
Laplanderesses come sliding and skidding to market behind their
stout-hearted reindeer. They left all their picturesque Arctic gear
behind them except their moccasins, Swan being one of those trying
people who don't care how they look, if only they "mush" along fast
enough. Their provisions consisted of a tin of bully and four
edible tiles or army biscuits, with some margarine in a Y.M.C.A.
envelope.</p>
<p>The story they told on their return&mdash;for they did return
and in good time for dinner&mdash;was mostly Honnell's, but I must
admit that Swan could not be got to refute it. As they approached
the village&mdash;some huts on a white hillside above a frozen
lake&mdash;a representative of the dog-colony came to meet them,
waving his tail with an anti-clockwise circular motion impossible
to the dog of temperate zones. Having inspected them he escorted
them on their way in a perfectly civilised and even courteous
manner.</p>
<p>So far from being resisted, their entry was ignored save by the
little fur-capped boys, who collected at their heels as if they had
formed the vanguard of a circus, and the little brightly-kerchiefed
girls, who bolted for cover. All the adult male inhabitants,
fiercely-bearded little men like trolls done up in reindeer-skin
from top to toe, appeared to be engrossed in the manufacture of
sleighs, although the village was already littered and cluttered up
with them; and all the ladies were indoors sewing reindeer-skin
into trousers or making tea.</p>
<p>Having exchanged a noise like "<i>Sdrastetye</i>" (which in
these parts seems to mean "<i>Bon jour</i>") with everybody they
saw, our two friends sat on a log, and rested, while Honnell set
about sketching, as he calls it, the primitive wooden church. The
little boys, of course, formed a sort of pyramid on his shoulders
to watch. Whether because his fingers were cold and so not
completely under his control, or because the vibrations of the
human pyramid communicated to his pencil some lucky jerks, the
marks Honnell committed to (or on) his note-book were such as
supplied the simple children of the snow with a clue as to his
intentions, and he was intensely gratified to hear one say to
another, "<i>Tzerhof</i>!"&mdash;knowing that noise to signify
"church" in the local tongue.</p>
<p>Swan, perceiving the moral damage likely to be done to his
friend by this flattering incident, sought to puncture Honnell's
unhealthy pride by saying, "<i>Plaho?</i>" (or "bad") as a
suggestion to the critics; but this only caused them to say
repeatedly and with emphasis, "<i>Dobra</i>!"&mdash;which was one
of Honnell's six words and means "good."</p>
<p>Thus the mischief was done. Honnell returned to his billet a man
changed and as it were possessed. To hear him talk now one would
suppose culture had fled from the Temperate to the Arctic zone. Of
the Lapps' habits and their houses he knows nothing, cares nothing;
all his enthusiasm is reserved for the honesty and the innate
artistic perception of their children. So seriously has he been
affected by this unaided and impartial recognition of the subject
of his drawing that some of us wonder if he will not settle down
amongst those who alone understand and appreciate him. Returning
home what can he hope to be? At best a hero of the Relief Force.
But in his Lapp village he could imagine himself an Artist.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
Clerks.)</i></p>
<p>A book of little novels, or long-shorts, from the pen of Mr.
ROBERT HICHENS, will be welcomed with pleasure by a very large
public. <i>Snake-Bite</i> (CASSELL) contains a half-dozen various
tales, all but one of which are eminently characteristic of their
author. It sounds unkind to add that this one is for artistry the
best of the bunch; but I mean no more than that Mr. HICHENS has
here done very well a slight and delicate sketch of a style not
generally associated with his work. In the name-piece his admirers
will find themselves on more familiar ground&mdash;none other
indeed than that well-known desert in which they have enjoyed such
delicious thrills in the same company already. When Mr. HICHENS'
characters get the sand in their eyes almost anything may be
expected of them. Here he has given us a new version of the ancient
scheme of two men and a woman, complicated in this instance by a
cobra; the problem being, whether a doctor should cure his wife's
lover of a snake-bite. More original is the longest story in the
collection, one called "The Lost Faith," an affair of mental
healing and love and crime too complex for compression. It is
admirably told. It leads up to a situation as novel as it is
dramatic&mdash;the confession of a young fanatic, who believes in a
lady-healer so implicitly that he puts typhoid germs into the drink
of a celebrated general in order to provide her with an impressive
subject. As a sensation this wants some beating; though it failed
to shake my own preference for the other story, which you will
observe I have purposely left unnamed. You will, I hope, enjoy
finding it for yourself.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Heritage</i> (COLLINS) gives me much the same impression that
one obtains from the spectacle of a man wire-walking in a sack or
painting pictures with his toes&mdash;attempting, in short, any
task under conditions of the greatest possible handicap. That
certainly is what Miss V. SACKVILLE-WEST has been at pains to
impose upon herself. With a straightforward, simple and interesting
tale and some considerable gifts for reproducing character, she has
deliberately sacrificed these advantages by telling her story in
the most roundabout and awkward manner imaginable. The theme is the
influence of heredity, as shown in the working out of a strain of
Spanish blood in a Sussex peasant stock, the victims of this
inconvenient blend being <i>Ruth</i> and the young cousin whom
half-unwillingly she marries; with devastating results.
<i>Ruth</i>, as I say, was attracted to <i>Westmacott</i> with only
part of her being; the better (or at least less Spanish) elements
in her were employed in making soft eyes at two other men, one of
whom, <i>Malory</i>, is supposed to relate portions of the affair
to the quite superfluous outsider who puts them down. This
<i>viv&acirc;-voci</i> recital is subsequently rounded off by
<i>Malory</i>, in what is surely the least credible of all the
unlikely letters in fiction, nearly a hundred printed pages of it.
So you see the obstacles that Miss SACKSVILLE-WEST has placed in
her own and her reader's path. That, despite them all, the
interest, and passion of this first novel do get home is an
encouraging omen for her success when she has learnt a greater
simplicity of attack.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Wings of the Morning</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) might have
been a most recommendable book, for it is in essentials a pleasant
story of a great artist who for the crime of his hot-headed youth
suffered imprisonment in the United States, and, having "covered
his tracks," came home, fell in love with his delightful sister's
delightful step-daughter <span class="pagenum"><a name="page492"
id="page492"></a>[pg 492]</span> and, after much suffering for them
both, told his history and won his lady. But unfortunately the
inessentials&mdash;and among these I have the temerity to include
the great European War, or, at any rate, very much that is here
told of it&mdash;are so harrowing that they do not accord with the
pleasant story to which they are tacked on. I would not ask to be
spared the knowledge of anything faced by other people while I sat
immune at home, but there are many incidents which cannot with
decency or dignity be served up in fiction to add a thrill to the
enjoyment of an hour's light reading. Miss JOAN SUTHERLAND would
have done well to have left detail to more serious exponents, and
to have discarded entirely one scene of bestial cruelty which has
no real bearing on her tale. Never in a novel&mdash;and seldom in
historical accounts of fighting&mdash;have I been asked to wallow
in so much gore. It is all the more regrettable because when Miss
SUTHERLAND uses her imagination on less horrible subjects she is
much more successful.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. ARTHUR TURBERVILLE has taken almost over-elaborate pains
with his sketch of a type which must have been common enough in the
new armies&mdash;the young officer of pacifist leanings, who,
intellectually convinced of the futility of war and by no means out
of sympathy with the ultralogical or illogical (and anyway
impossible) position of the Conscientious Objector, yet joins up
and makes the very best of a bad job. <i>Kenneth, Dugdale</i>
(METHUEN), the prize prig (according to the verdict of his Mess),
became a brave and efficient subaltern; and the author's idea of
bringing him by means of the discipline of war-training and war
itself to a better understanding of the ordinary spontaneous
fighting types, and of bringing these by the same discipline to a
readier appreciation of the intellectual and idealist position, is
well enough worked out. The character-drawing impressed me less
favourably. The author, I should say, finds it rather difficult to
understand the ordinary good or indifferent fellow with his
qualities and their defects. I doubt the possibility of such a
snake in the grass as <i>Lieutenant Seymour</i> carrying on without
getting kicked. Nor do I think that that simple soldier man,
<i>Fortescue, V.C.</i>, would have so tamely accepted
<i>Dugdale's</i> betrayal to the woman they both loved of the fact
that he had just seen his rival putting a dubious young lady into a
cab in Regent Street at midnight. There is a good deal of
thoughtful work in this novel which should be interesting to
amateur students of the psychology of war and men of war.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The latest of Mrs. J. B. BUCKROSE'S genial little comedies about
a comfortable world is concerned with war-weddings, their cause,
and some hints for their successful conduct. She calls it
<i>Marriage While You Wait</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON), and
illustrates her theme with the case of a young man and maiden, who
dashed, like so many others, into matrimony in the breathless haste
of short leave, and came dangerously near repenting at leisure.
Only near, of course; Mrs. BUCKROSE is too confirmed an optimist
not to make it clear that the blackest boredom has a silver lining;
and I had never any real fear that her nice young couple were
becoming more than quite temporarily estranged. Still, things went
so far that <i>Sophia</i> left the cottage where she and
<i>Arthur</i> and a cooing dove had proposed to live the idyllic
life of happiness-ever-after, and betook herself to the mansion of
the local villain; while <i>Arthur</i> cut the throat of the dove
(there my sympathies were with him entirely) and relapsed into
nervous breakdown. But <i>Denyer</i>, being only a BUCKROSE
villain, which is a very mild variety, packed <i>Sophia</i> home
again; <i>Arthur</i>, after the usual crisis, recovered; and the
symbolic dove was the only inmate of the cottage for whom the
little rift remained unhappily permanent. So there you are; with
the gentlest short sermon to wind up, and a blessing to all
concerned. Perhaps I have read stories more briskly entertaining
from Mrs. BUCKROSE'S flowing pen; one feels that her intent here
was not solely laughter. But as a smiling homily, preaching much
the same moral that Sir ARTHUR PINERO once treated more caustically
in perhaps his best play, her story, <i>Marriage While You
Wait</i>, should have at least two sympathetic readers in many
scores of homes.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Whenever I finish a book by Mr. S.P.B. MAIS I am left with the
feeling that he has only to enlarge his horizon to write something
worth reading and remembering. If <i>The Education of a
Philanderer</i> (GRANT RICHARDS) had been written, by an unknown
man I should have welcomed it as work of great promise. But the
trouble with Mr. MAIS is that he seems to find it perilously easy
to write about young school-masters who fall in and out of love
with facility and who are financially at their wits' end. <i>Rupert
Blundell</i>, the philanderer, described here, is a clear and
clever picture of a young man who loved where he listed and listed
quite a lot. As far as he goes he can be visualized perfectly both
at Oxford and as a schoolmaster. But he does not go far enough and
he belongs to a type of which one can easily tire. Mr. MAIS is not
so callow as he once was in his judgement of people mentally
distasteful to him, but he still needs a wider outlook on life and
a wider knowledge, and I sincerely hope that he will take steps to
remove the limitations which at present prevent him from giving
entire satisfaction to his admirers.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
