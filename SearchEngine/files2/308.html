<h2><a name="chap01"></a>CHAPTER I.<br/>
THE SNAKE AND THE SOUL.</h2>

<p>
When Colonel Matthew Devon de Warrenne, V.C., D.S.O., of the Queen&rsquo;s Own
(118th) Bombay Lancers, pinned his Victoria Cross to the bosom of his dying
wife&rsquo;s night-dress, in token of his recognition that she was the braver
of the twain, he was not himself.
</p>

<p>
He was beside himself with grief.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards he adjured the sole witness of this impulsive and emotional act,
Major John Decies, never to mention his &ldquo;damned theatrical folly&rdquo;
to any living soul, and to excuse him on the score of an ancient sword-cut on
the head and two bad sun-strokes.
</p>

<p>
For the one thing in heaven above, on the earth beneath, or in the waters under
the earth, that Colonel de Warrenne feared, was breach of good form and
stereotyped convention.
</p>

<p>
And the one thing he loved was the dying woman.
</p>

<p>
This last statement applies also to Major John Decies, of the Indian Medical
Service, Civil Surgeon of Bimariabad, and may even be expanded, for the one
thing he ever <i>had</i> loved was the dying womanâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Matthew Devon de Warrenne did the deed that won him his Victoria Cross,
in the open, in the hot sunlight and in hot blood, sword in hand and with hot
blood on the sword-hand&mdash;fighting for his life.
</p>

<p>
His wife did the deed that moved him to transfer the Cross to her, in darkness,
in cold blood, in loneliness, sickness and silence&mdash;fighting for the life
of her unborn child against an unseen foe.
</p>

<p>
Colonel de Warrenne&rsquo;s type of brave deed has been performed thousands of
times and wherever brave men have fought.
</p>

<p>
His wife&rsquo;s deed of endurance, presence of mind, self-control and cool
courage is rarer, if not unique.
</p>

<p>
To appreciate this fully, it must be known that she had a horror of snakes, so
terrible as to amount to an obsession, a mental deformity, due, doubtless, to
the fact that her father (Colonel Mortimer Seymour Stukeley) died of snake-bite
before her mother&rsquo;s eyes, a few hours before she herself was born.
</p>

<p>
Bearing this in mind, judge of the conduct that led Colonel de Warrenne,
distraught, to award her his Cross &ldquo;For Valour&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
One oppressive June evening, Lenore de Warrenne returned from church (where she
had, as usual, prayed fervently that her soon-expected first-born might be a
daughter), and entered her dressing-room. Here her Ayah divested her of hat,
dress, and boots, and helped her into the more easeful tea-gown and satin
slippers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bootlair wanting ishweets for dinner-table from go-down,<a href="#fn1" name="fnref1" id="fnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
please, Mem-Sahib,&rdquo; observed Ayah, the change of garb accomplished.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn1" id="fn1"></a> <a href="#fnref1">[1]</a>
Store-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The butler wants sweets, does he? Give me my keys, then,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. de Warrenne, and, rising with a sigh, she left the dressing-room and
proceeded, <i>via</i> the dining-room (where she procured some small silver
bowls, sweet-dishes, and trays), to the go-down or store-room, situate at the
back of the bungalow and adjoining the &ldquo;dispense-khana&rdquo;&mdash;the
room in which assemble the materials and ministrants of meals from the
extra-mural &ldquo;bowachi-khana&rdquo; or kitchen. Unlocking the door of the
go-down, Mrs. de Warrenne entered the small shelf-encircled room, and, stepping
on to a low stool proceeded to fill the sweet-trays from divers jars, tins and
boxes, with guava-cheese, crystallized ginger, <i>kulwa</i>, preserved mango
and certain of the more sophisticated sweetmeats of the West.
</p>

<p>
It was after sunset and the <i>hamal</i> had not yet lit the lamps, so that
this pantry, a dark room at mid-day, was far from light at that time. But for
the fact that she knew exactly where everything was, and could put her hand on
what she wanted, she would not have entered without a light.
</p>

<p>
For some minutes the unfortunate lady stood on the stool.
</p>

<p>
Having completed her task she stepped down backwards and, as her foot touched
the ground, she knew <i>that she had trodden upon a snake.</i>
</p>

<p>
Even as she stood poised, one foot on the ground, the other on the stool, both
hands gripping the high shelf, she felt the reptile whipping, writhing,
jerking, lashing, flogging at her ankle and instep, coiling round her legâ€¦. And
in the fraction of a second the thought flashed through her mind: &ldquo;If its
head is under my foot, or too close to my foot for its fangs to reach me, I am
safe while I remain as I am. If its head is free I am doomed&mdash;and matters
cannot be any the worse for my keeping as I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>And she kept as she was,</i> with one foot on the stool, out of reach, and
one foot on the snake.
</p>

<p>
And screamed?
</p>

<p>
No, called quietly and coolly for the butler, remembering that she had sent
Nurse Beaton out, that her husband was at polo, that there were none but native
servants in the house, and that if she raised an alarm they would take it, and
with single heart consider each the safety of Number One.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; she called calmly, though the room swam round her and a
deadly faintness began to paralyse her limbs and loosen her hold upon the
shelf&mdash;&ldquo;Boy! Come here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Antonio Ferdinand Xavier D&rsquo;Souza, Goanese butler, heard and came.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mem-Sahib?&rdquo; quoth he, at the door of the go-down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring a lamp quickly,&rdquo; said Lenore de Warrenne in a level voice.
</p>

<p>
The worthy Antonio, fat, spectacled, bald and wheezy, hurried away and
peremptorily bade the <i>hamal</i><a href="#fn2" name="fnref2" id="fnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>,
son of a jungle-pig, to light and bring a lamp quickly.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn2" id="fn2"></a> <a href="#fnref2">[2]</a>
Footman and male &ldquo;housemaid&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The <i>hamal</i>, respectfully pointing out to the Bootlair Sahib that the
daylight was yet strong and lusty enough to shame and smother any lamp,
complied with deliberation and care, polishing the chimney, trimming the wick,
pouring in oil and generally making a satisfactory and commendable job of it.
</p>

<p>
Lenore de Warrenne, sick, faint, sinking, waited â€¦ waited â€¦ waited â€¦ gripping
the shelf and fighting against her over-mastering weakness for the life of the
unborn child that, even in that awful moment, she prayed might be a daughter.
</p>

<p>
After many cruelly long centuries, and as she swayed to fall, the good Antonio
entered with the lamp. Her will triumphed over her falling body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Boy, I am standing on a snake!&rdquo; said she coolly. &ldquo;Put the
lamp&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Antonio did not stay to &ldquo;put&rdquo; the lamp; incontinent he dropped
it on the floor and fled yelling &ldquo;Sap! Sap!&rdquo; and that the Mem-Sahib
was bitten, dying, dead&mdash;certainly dead; dead for hours.
</p>

<p>
And the brave soul in the little room waited â€¦ waited â€¦ waited â€¦ gripping the
shelf, and thinking of the coming daughter, and wondering whether she must die
by snake-bite or fire&mdash;unborn&mdash;with her unhappy mother. For the
fallen lamp had burst, the oil had caught fire, and the fire gave no light by
which she could see what was beneath her foot&mdash;head, body, or tail of the
lashing, squirming snake&mdash;as the flame flickered, rose and fell, burnt
blue, swayed, roared in the draught of the door&mdash;did anything but give a
light by which she could see as she bent over awkwardly, still gripping the
shelf, one foot on the stool, further prevented from seeing by her loose
draperies.
</p>

<p>
Soon she realized that in any case she could not see her foot without changing
her position&mdash;a thing she would <i>not</i> do while there was
hope&mdash;and strength to hold on. For hope there was, inasmuch as <i>she had
not yet felt the stroke of the reptile&rsquo;s fangs</i>.
</p>

<p>
Again she reasoned calmly, though strength was ebbing fast; she must remain as
she was till death by fire or suffocation was the alternative to
flight&mdash;flight which was synonymous with death, for, as her other foot
came down and she stepped off the snake, in that instant it would
strike&mdash;if it had not struck already.
</p>

<p>
Meantime&mdash;to call steadily and coolly again.
</p>

<p>
This time she called to the <i>hamal</i>, a Bhil, engaged out of compassion,
and likely, as a son of the jungle&rsquo;s sons, to be of more courage than the
stall-fed butler in presence of dangerous beast or reptile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Hamal</i>: I want you,&rdquo; she called coolly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mem-Sahib?&rdquo; came the reply from the lamp-room near by, and the man
approached.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That stupid butler has dropped a lamp and run away. Bring a pail of
water quickly and call to the <i>malli</i><a href="#fn3" name="fnref3" id="fnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
to bring a pail of earth as you get it. Hasten!&mdash;and there is
baksheesh,&rdquo; said Mrs. de Warrenne quietly in the vernacular.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn3" id="fn3"></a> <a href="#fnref3">[3]</a>
Gardener.
</p>

<p>
Tap and pail were by the door of the back verandah. In a minute the
<i>hamal</i> entered and flung a pail of water on the burning pool of oil,
reducing the mass of blue lambent flames considerably.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now <i>hamal</i>,&rdquo; said the fainting woman, the more immediate
danger confronted, &ldquo;bring another lamp very quickly and put it on the
shelf. Quick! don&rsquo;t stop to fill or to clean it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Was the pricking, shooting pain the repeated stabbing of the snake&rsquo;s
fangs or was it &ldquo;pins and needles&rdquo;? Was this deadly faintness death
indeed, or was it only weakness?
</p>

<p>
In what seemed but a few more years the man reappeared carrying a lighted lamp,
the which he placed upon a shelf.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Mrs. de Warrenne, &ldquo;and have no fear, brave
Bhil. I have <i>caught</i> a snake. Get a knife quickly and cut off its head
while I hold it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man glancing up, appeared to suppose that his mistress held the snake on
the shelf, hurried away, and rushed back with the cook&rsquo;s big
kitchen-knife gripped dagger-wise in his right hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you see the snake?&rdquo; she managed to whisper. &ldquo;Under my
foot! Quick! It is moving â€¦ moving â€¦ moving <i>out</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a wild Bhil cry the man flung himself down upon his hereditary dread foe
and slashed with the knife.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. de Warrenne heard it scratch along the floor, grate on a nail, and crush
through the snake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;ArÃ©!! Dead, Mem-Sahib!! Dead!! See, I have cut off its head! ArÃ©!!!!
Wah!! The brave mistress!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As she collapsed, Mrs. de Warrenne saw the twitching body of a large cobra with
its head severed close to its neck. Its head had just protruded from under her
foot and she had saved the unborn life for which she had fought so bravely by
just keeping stillâ€¦. She had won her brief decoration with the Cross
by&mdash;keeping still. (Her husband had won his permanent right to it by
extreme activity.) â€¦ Had she moved she would have been struck instantly, for
the reptile was, by her, uninjured, merely nipped between instep and floor.
</p>

<p>
Having realized this, Lenore de Warrenne fainted and then passed from fit to
fit, and her child&mdash;a boy&mdash;was born that night. Hundreds of times
during the next few days the same terrible cry rang from the sick-room through
the hushed bungalow: &ldquo;It is under my foot! It is moving â€¦ moving â€¦ moving
â€¦ <i>out!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
&ldquo;If I had to make a prophecy concerning this young fella,&rdquo; observed
the broken-hearted Major John Decies, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon of Bimariabad, as
he watched old Nurse Beaton performing the baby&rsquo;s elaborate ablutions and
toilet, &ldquo;I should say that he will <i>not</i> grow up fond of
snakes&mdash;not if there is anything in the &lsquo;pre-natal influence&rsquo;
theory.&rdquo;

THE SEARING OF A SOUL.</h2>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II.<br/>
THE SWORD AND THE SNAKE.</h2>

<p>
Colonel Matthew Devon De Warrenne, commanding the Queen&rsquo;s Own (118th)
Bombay Lancers, was in good time, in his best review-order uniform, and in a
terrible state of mind.
</p>

<p>
He strode from end to end of the long verandah of his bungalow with clank of
steel, creak of leather, and groan of travailing soul. As the top of his
scarlet, blue and gold turban touched the lamp that hung a good seven feet
above his spurred heels he swore viciously.
</p>

<p>
Almost for the first time in his hard-lived, selfish life he had been thwarted,
flouted, cruelly and evilly entreated, and the worst of it was that his enemy
was&mdash;not a man whom he could take by the throat, but&mdash;Fate.
</p>

<p>
Fate had dealt him a cruel blow, and he felt as he would have done had he,
impotent, seen one steal the great charger that champed and pawed there at the
door, and replace it by a potter&rsquo;s donkey. Nay, worse&mdash;for he had
<i>loved</i> Lenore, his wife, and Fate had stolen her away and replaced her by
a squealing brat.
</p>

<p>
Within a year of his marriage his wife was dead and buried, and his son alive
and&mdash;howling. He could hear him (curse him!).
</p>

<p>
The Colonel glanced at his watch, producing it from some mysterious recess
beneath his belted golden sash and within his pale blue tunic.
</p>

<p>
Not yet time to ride to the regimental parade-ground and lead his famous corps
to its place on the brigade parade-ground for the New Year Review and
march-past.
</p>

<p>
As he held the watch at the length of its chain and stared, half-comprehending,
his hand&mdash;the hand of the finest swordsman in the Indian Army&mdash;shook.
</p>

<p>
Lenore gone: a puling, yelping whelp in her placeâ€¦. A tall, severe-looking
elderly woman entered the verandah by a distant door and approached the savage,
miserable soldier. Nurse Beaton.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Will</i> you give your son a name, Sir?&rdquo; she said, and it was
evident in voice and manner that the question had been asked before and had
received an unsatisfactory, if not unprintable; reply. Every line of feature
and form seemed to express indignant resentment. She had nursed and
foster-mothered the child&rsquo;s mother, and&mdash;unlike the man&mdash;had
found the baby the chiefest consolation of her cruel grief, and already loved
it not only for its idolized mother&rsquo;s sake, but with the devotion of a
childless child-lover.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The christening is fixed for to-day, Sir, as I have kept reminding you,
Sir,&rdquo; she added.
</p>

<p>
She had never liked the Colonel&mdash;nor considered him &ldquo;good
enough&rdquo; for her tender, dainty darling, &ldquo;nearly three times her age
and no better than he ought to be&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Name?&rdquo; snarled Colonel Matthew Devon de Warrenne. &ldquo;Name the
little beast? Call him what you like, and then drown him.&rdquo; The
tight-lipped face of the elderly nurse flushed angrily, but before she could
make the indignant reply that her hurt and scandalized look presaged, the
Colonel added:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, look here, call him <i>Damocles</i>, and done with it. The Sword
hangs over him too, I suppose, and he&rsquo;ll die by it, as all his ancestors
have done. Yes&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a nice name, Sir, to my thinking,&rdquo; interrupted the
woman, &ldquo;not for an only name&mdash;and for an only child. Let it be a
second or third name, Sir, if you want to give him such an outlandish
one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She fingered her new black dress nervously with twitching hands and the tight
lips trembled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s to be named Damocles and nothing else,&rdquo; replied the
Master, and, as she turned away with a look of positive hate, he added
sardonically:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then you can call him &lsquo;Dam&rsquo; for short, you know,
Nurse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nurse Beaton bridled, clenched her hands, and stiffened visibly. Had the man
been her social equal or any other than her master, her pent-up wrath and
indignation would have broken forth in a torrent of scathing abuse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never would I call the poor motherless lamb <i>Dam</i>, Sir,&rdquo; she
answered with restraint.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then call him <i>Dummy!</i> Good morning, Nurse,&rdquo; snapped the
Colonel.
</p>

<p>
As she turned to go, with a bitter sigh, she asked in the hopeless tone of one
who knows the waste of words:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will not repent&mdash;I mean relent&mdash;and come to the
christening of your only son this afternoon, Sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good morning, Nurse,&rdquo; observed Colonel Matthew Devon de Warrenne,
and resumed his hurried pacing of the verandah.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
It is not enough that a man love his wife dearly and hold her the sweetest,
fairest, and best of women&mdash;he should tell her so, morning and night.
</p>

<p>
There is a proverb (the unwisdom of many and the poor wit of one) that says
<i>Actions speak louder than Words</i>. Whether this is the most untrustworthy
of an untrustworthy class of generalizations is debateable.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, let no husband or lover believe it. Vain are the deeds of dumb
devotion, the unwearying forethought, the tender care, the gifts of price, and
the priceless gifts of attentive, watchful guard and guide, the labours of
Love&mdash;all vain. Silent is the speech of Action.
</p>

<p>
But resonant loud is the speech of Words and profitable their investment in the
Mutual Alliance Bank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Love me, love my Dog?</i>&rdquo; Yes&mdash;and look to the dog for a
dog&rsquo;s reward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Do not show me that you love me&mdash;tell me so.</i>&rdquo; Far too
true and pregnant ever to become a proverb.
</p>

<p>
Colonel de Warrenne had omitted to tell his wife so&mdash;after she had
accepted him&mdash;and she had died thinking herself loveless, unloved, and
stating the fact.
</p>

<p>
This was the bitterest drop in the bitter cup of the big, dumb, well-meaning
man.
</p>

<p>
And now she would never knowâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
She had thought herself unloved, and, nerve-shattered by her terrible
experience with the snake, had made no fight for life when the unwanted boy was
born. For the sake of a girl she would have striven to live&mdash;but a boy, a
boy can fend for himself (and takes after his father)â€¦.
</p>

<p>
Almost as soon as Lenore Seymour Stukeley had landed in India (on a visit with
her sister Yvette to friends at Bimariabad), delighted, bewildered,
depolarized, Colonel Matthew Devon de Warrenne had burst with a blaze of glory
into her hitherto secluded, narrow life&mdash;a great pale-blue, white-and-gold
wonder, clanking and jingling, resplendent, bemedalled, ruling men, charging at
the head of thundering squadrons&mdash;a half-god (and to Yvette he had seemed
a whole-god).
</p>

<p>
He had told her that he loved her, told her once, and had been accepted.
</p>

<p>
<i>Once</i>! Only once told her that he loved her, that she was beautiful, that
he was hers to command to the uttermost. Only once! What could <i>she</i> know
of the changed life, the absolute renunciation of pleasant bachelor vices, the
pulling up short, and all those actions that speak more softly than words?
</p>

<p>
What could she know of the strength and depth of the love that could keep such
a man as the Colonel from the bar, the bridge-table, the race-course and the
Paphian dame? Of the love that made him walk warily lest he offend one for whom
his quarter of a century, and more, of barrack and bachelor-bungalow life, made
him feel so utterly unfit and unworthy? What could she know of all that he had
given up and delighted to give up&mdash;now that he truly loved a true woman?
The hard-living, hard-hearted, hard-spoken man had become a gentle frequenter
of his wife&rsquo;s tea-parties, her companion at church, her constant
attendant&mdash;never leaving the bungalow, save for duty, without her.
</p>

<p>
To those who knew him it was a World&rsquo;s Marvel; to her, who knew him not,
it was nothing at all&mdash;normal, natural. And being a man who spoke only
when he must, who dreaded the expression of any emotion, and who foolishly
thought that actions speak louder than words, he had omitted to tell her
daily&mdash;or even weekly or monthly&mdash;that he loved her; and she had died
pitying herself and reproaching him.
</p>

<p>
Fate&rsquo;s old, old game of Cross Purposes. Major John Decies, reserved,
high-minded gentleman, loving Lenore de Warrenne (and longing to tell her so
daily), with the one lifelong love of a steadfast nature; Yvette Stukeley,
reserved, high-minded gentlewoman, loving Colonel de Warrenne, and longing to
escape from Bimariabad before his wedding to her sister, and doing so at the
earliest possible date thereafter: each woman losing the man who would have
been her ideal husband, each man losing the woman who would have been his ideal
wife.
</p>

<p>
Yvette Stukeley returned to her uncle and guardian, General Sir Gerald Seymour
Stukeley, K.C.B., K.C.S.I., at Monksmead, nursing a broken heart, and longed
for the day when Colonel de Warrenne&rsquo;s child might be sent home to her
care.
</p>

<p>
Major John Decies abode at Bimariabad, also nursing a broken heart (though he
scarcely realized the fact), watched over the son of Lenore de Warrenne, and
greatly feared for him.
</p>

<p>
The Major was an original student of theories and facts of Heredity and
Pre-natal Influence. Further he was not wholly hopeful as to the effect of all
the <i>post</i>-natal influences likely to be brought to bear upon a child who
grew up in the bungalow, and the dislike of Colonel Matthew Devon de Warrenne.
</p>

<p>
Upon the infant Damocles, Nurse Beaton, rugged, snow-capped volcano, lavished
the tender love of a mother; and in him Major John Decies, deep-running still
water, took the interest of a father. The which was the better for the infant
Damocles in that his real father had no interest to take and no love to lavish.
He frankly disliked the child&mdash;the outward and visible sign, the daily
reminder of the cruel loss he so deeply felt and fiercely resented.
</p>

<p>
Yet, strangely enough, he would not send the child home. Relations who could
receive it he had none, and he declined to be beholden to its great-uncle,
General Sir Gerald Seymour Stukeley, and its aunt Yvette Stukeley, in spite of
the warmest invitations from the one and earnest entreaties from the other.
</p>

<p>
Nurse Beaton fed, tended, clothed and nursed the baby by day; a worshipping
ayah wheeled him abroad, and, by night, slept beside his cot; a devoted
sepoy-orderly from the regiment guarded his cavalcade, and, when permitted,
proudly bore him in his arms.
</p>

<p>
Major John Decies visited him frequently, watched and waited, waited and
watched, and, though not a youth, &ldquo;thought long, long thoughts&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
He also frequently laid his views and theories on paternal duties before
Colonel de Warrenne, until pointedly asked by that officer whether he had no
duties of his own which might claim his valuable time.
</p>

<p>
Years rolled by, after the incorrigible habit of years, and the infant Damocles
grew and developed into a remarkably sturdy, healthy, intelligent boy, as
cheerful, fearless, impudent, and irrepressible as the heart of the Major could
desire&mdash;and with a much larger vocabulary than any one could desire, for a
baby.
</p>

<p>
On the fifth anniversary of his birthday he received a matutinal call from
Major Decies, who was returning from his daily visit to the Civil Hospital.
</p>

<p>
The Major bore a birthday present and a very anxious, undecided mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good morrow, gentle Damocles,&rdquo; he remarked, entering the big
verandah adown which the chubby boy pranced gleefully to meet his beloved
friend, shouting a welcome, and brandishing a sword designed, and largely
constructed, by himself from a cleaning-rod, a tobacco-tin lid, a piece of
wood, card-board and wire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thalaam, Major Thahib,&rdquo; he said, flinging himself bodily upon that
gentleman. &ldquo;I thaw cook cut a fowl&rsquo;s froat vis morning. It squorked
boofly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did it? Alas, that I missed those pleasing-er-squorks,&rdquo; replied
the Major, and added: &ldquo;This is thy natal day, my son. Thou art a man of
five.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a debble. I&rsquo;m a <i>norful</i> little debble,&rdquo;
corrected Damocles, cheerfully and with conviction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Incidentally. But you are five also,&rdquo; persisted the senior man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my birfday to-day,&rdquo; observed the junior.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I just said so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>That</i> you didn&rsquo;t, Major Thahib. This is a thword.
Father&rsquo;s charger&rsquo;s got an over-weach. Jumping. He says it&rsquo;s a
dam-nuithanth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a sword, is it? And &lsquo;Fire&rsquo; has got an
over-reach. And it&rsquo;s a qualified nuisance, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeth, and the mare is coughing and her <i>thythe</i> is a blathted fool
for letting her catch cold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mare has a cold and the <i>syce</i><a href="#fn4" name="fnref4" id="fnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
is a qualified fool, is he? H&rsquo;m! I think it&rsquo;s high time you had a
look in at little old England, my son, what? And who made you this elegant
rapier? Ochterlonie Sahib or&mdash;who?&rdquo; (Lieutenant Lord Ochterlonie was
the Adjutant of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys, a friend of Colonel de Warrenne, an
ex-admirer of his late wife, and a great pal of his son.)
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn4" id="fn4"></a> <a href="#fnref4">[4]</a>
Groom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tithn&rsquo;t a waper. It&rsquo;th my thword. I made it
mythelf.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who helped?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody. At leatht, Khodadad Khan, Orderly, knocked the holes in the tin
like I showed him&mdash;or elthe got the Farrier Thargeant to do it, and thaid
<i>he</i> had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but who told you how to make it like this? Where did you see a
hand-part like this? It isn&rsquo;t like Daddy&rsquo;s sword, nor Khodadad
Khan&rsquo;s <i>tulwar</i>. Where did you copy it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t copy itâ€¦. I shot ten rats wiv a bow-and-arrow last night.
At leatht&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I shot ten. Nor one. I don&rsquo;t think I
didn&rsquo;t, pwaps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But hang it all, the thing&rsquo;s an Italian rapier, by Gad. Some one
<i>must</i> have shown you how to make the thing, or you&rsquo;ve got a
picture. It&rsquo;s a <i>pukka</i><a href="#fn5" name="fnref5" id="fnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
mediaeval rapier.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn5" id="fn5"></a> <a href="#fnref5">[5]</a>
Real, solid, permanent, proper, ripe, genuine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No it&rsquo;th not. It&rsquo;th my thword. I made itâ€¦. Have a jolly
fight&rdquo;&mdash;and the boy struck an extraordinarily correct fencing
attitude&mdash;left hand raised in balance, sword poised, legs and feet well
placed, the whole pose easy, natural, graceful.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough, the sword was held horizontal instead of pointing upward, a
fact which at once struck the observant and practised eye of Major John Decies,
sometime champion fencer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been teaching you fencing?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What ith &lsquo;fenthing&rsquo;? Let&rsquo;th have a fight,&rdquo;
replied the boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stick me here, Dam,&rdquo; invited the Major, seating himself and
indicating the position of the heart. &ldquo;Bet you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy lunged, straight, true, gracefully, straightening all his limbs except
his right leg, rigidly, strongly, and the &ldquo;sword&rdquo; bent upward from
the spot on which the man&rsquo;s finger had just rested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gad! Who <i>has</i> taught you to lunge? I shall have a bruise there,
and perhaps&mdash;live. Who&rsquo;s behind all this, young fella? Who taught
you to stand so, and to lunge? Ochterlonie Sahib or Daddy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody. What is &lsquo;lunge&rsquo;? Will you buy me a little baby-camel
to play with and teach tricks? Perhaps it would sit up and beg. Do camelth lay
eggth? Chucko does. Millions and lakhs. You get a thword, too, and we&rsquo;ll
fight every day. Yeth. All day long&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good morning, Sir,&rdquo; said Nurse Beaton, bustling into the verandah
from the nursery. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as mad as ever on swords and fighting, you
see. It&rsquo;s a soldier he&rsquo;ll be, the lamb. He&rsquo;s taken to making
that black orderly pull out his sword when he&rsquo;s in uniform. Makes him
wave and jab it about. Gives me the creeps&mdash;with his black face and white
eyes and all. You won&rsquo;t <i>encourage</i> the child at it, will you, Sir?
And his poor Mother the gentlest soul that ever stepped. Swords! Where he gets
his notions <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t think (though I know where he gets his
language, poor lamb!). Look at <i>that</i> thing, Sir! For all the world like
the dressed-up folk have on the stage or in pictures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t let him see any books, I suppose, Nurse?&rdquo; asked
the Major.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Sir. Never a book has the poor lamb seen, except those you&rsquo;ve
brought. I&rsquo;ve always been in terror of his seeing a picture of a
you-know-what, ever since you told me what the effect <i>might</i> be. Nor he
hasn&rsquo;t so much as heard the name of it, so far as I know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll see one to-day. I&rsquo;ve brought it with
me&mdash;must see it sooner or later. Might see a live one anywhere&mdash;in
spite of all your careâ€¦. But about this sword&mdash;where <i>could</i> he have
got the idea? It&rsquo;s unlike any sword he ever set eyes on. Besides if he
ever <i>did</i> see an Italian rapier&mdash;and there&rsquo;s scarcely such a
thing in India&mdash;he&rsquo;d not get the chance to use it as a copy. Fancy
his having the desire and the power to, anyhow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I give it up, Sir,&rdquo; said Nurse Beaton.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I give it upper,&rdquo; added the Major, taking the object of their
wonder from the child.
</p>

<p>
And there was cause for wonder indeed.
</p>

<p>
A hole had been punched through the centre of the lid of a tobacco tin and a
number of others round the edge. Through the centre hole the steel rod had been
passed so that the tin made a &ldquo;guard&rdquo;. To the other holes wires had
been fastened by bending, and their ends gathered, twisted, and bound with
string to the top of the handle (of bored corks) to form an ornamental
basket-hilt.
</p>

<p>
But the most remarkable thing of all was that, before doing this, the juvenile
designer had passed the rod through a piece of bored stick so that the latter
formed a <i>cross-piece</i> (neatly bound) within the tin guard&mdash;the
distinctive feature of the ancient and modern Italian rapiers!
</p>

<p>
Round this cross-piece the first two fingers of the boy&rsquo;s right hand were
crooked as he held the sword&mdash;and this is the one and only correct way of
holding the Italian weapon, as the Major was well aware!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I give it most utterly-uppermost,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
positively uncanny. No <i>uninitiated</i> adult of the utmost intelligence ever
held an Italian-pattern foil correctly yet&mdash;nor until he had been pretty
carefully shown. Who the devil put him up to the design in the first place, and
the method of holding, in the second? Explain yourself, you two-anna<a href="#fn6" name="fnref6" id="fnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
marvel,&rdquo; he demanded of the child. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
<i>jadu</i>&mdash;black magic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn6" id="fn6"></a> <a href="#fnref6">[6]</a>
Anna = a penny.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ayah lothted a wupee latht night,&rdquo; he replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lost a rupee, did she? Lucky young thing. Wish I had one to lose. Who
showed you how to hold that sword? Why do you crook your fingers round the
cross-piece like that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chucko laid me an egg latht night,&rdquo; observed Damocles. &ldquo;He
laid it with my name on it&mdash;so that cook couldn&rsquo;t steal it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No doubt. Look here, where can I get a sword like yours? Where can I
copy it? Who makes them? Who knows about them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know, Major Thahib. Gunnoo sells
&lsquo;Fire&rsquo;s&rsquo; gram to the <i>methrani</i> for her curry and
chuppatties.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how do you know swords are like this? <i>That</i> thing isn&rsquo;t
a <i>pukka</i> sword.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;th like Thir Theymour Thtukeley&rsquo;s in my
dweam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What dream?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The one I&rsquo;m alwayth dweaming. They have got long hair like Nurse
in the night, and they fight and fight like anything. Norful good fighters! And
they wear funny kit. And their thwords are like vis. _Egg_zackly. Gunnoo gave
me a ride on &lsquo;Fire,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;th a dam-liar. He thaid he forgot
to put the warm <i>jhool</i> on him when Daddy was going to fwash him for being
a dam-fool. I thaid I&rsquo;d tell Daddy how he alwayth thleepth in it
himthelf, unleth he gave me a ride on &lsquo;Fire&rsquo;. &lsquo;Fire&rsquo;
gave a <i>norful</i> buck and bucked me off. At leatht I think he
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Major Decies&rsquo; face was curiously intent&mdash;as of some midnight worker
in research who sees a bright near glimpse of the gold his alchemy has so long
sought to materialize in the alembic of fact.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come back to sober truth, young youth. What about the dream? Who are
they, and what do they say and do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thir Theymour Thtukeley Thahib tellth Thir Matthew Thahib about the
hilt-thwust. (What <i>is</i> &lsquo;hilt-thwust&rsquo;?) And Lubin, the
thervant, ith a <i>white</i> thervant. Why ith he white if he ith a
Thahib&rsquo;s &lsquo;boy&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good Gad!&rdquo; murmured the Major. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m favoured of the
gods. Tell me all about it, Sonny. Then I&rsquo;ll undo this parcel for
you,&rdquo; he coaxed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t wemember. They buck a lot by the tents and then Thir
Theymour Thtukeley goes and fights Thir Matthew and kills him, and it&rsquo;th
awful lovely, but they dreth up like kids at a party in big collars and silly
kit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; murmured the Major. &ldquo;Tell me what they say
when they buck to each other by the tents, and when they talk about the
&lsquo;hilt-thrust,&rsquo; old chap.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t wemember. I&rsquo;ll listen next time I dweam it, and
tell you. Chucko&rsquo;s egg was all brown&mdash;not white like those cook
brings from the bazaar. He&rsquo;s a dam-thief. Open the parcel, Major Thabib.
What&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A picture-book for you, Sonny. All sorts of jolly beasts that
you&rsquo;ll <i>shikar</i> some day. You&rsquo;ll tell me some more about the
dream to-morrow, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeth. I&rsquo;ll wemember and fink, and tell you what I have
finked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Turning to Nurse Beaton, the Major whispered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry him about this dream at all. Leave it to me.
It&rsquo;s wonderful. Take him on your lap, Nurse, and&mdash;er&mdash;be
<i>ready</i>. It&rsquo;s a very life-like picture, and I&rsquo;m going to
spring it on him without any remark&mdash;but I&rsquo;m more than a little
anxious, I admit. Still, it&rsquo;s <i>got</i> to come, as I say, and better a
picture first, with ourselves present. If the picture don&rsquo;t affect him
I&rsquo;ll show him a real one. May be all right of course, but I don&rsquo;t
know. I came across a somewhat similar case once before&mdash;and it was
<i>not</i> all right. Not by any means,&rdquo; and he disclosed the brilliantly
coloured Animal Picture Book and knelt beside the expectant boy.
</p>

<p>
On the first page was an incredibly leonine lion, who appeared to have solved
with much satisfaction the problem of aerial flight, so far was he from the
mountain whence he had sprung and above the back of the antelope towards which
he had propelled himself. One could almost hear him roar. There was menace and
fate in eye and tooth and claw, yea, in the very kink of the prehensile-seeming
tail wherewith he apparently steered his course in mid-air. To gaze upon his
impressive and determined countenance was to sympathize most fully with the
sore-tried Prophet of old (known to Damocles as Dannle-in-the-lines-den) for
ever more.
</p>

<p>
The boy was wholly charmed, stroked the glowing ferocity and observed that he
was a <i>pukka Bahadur</i>.<a href="#fn7" name="fnref7" id="fnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn7" id="fn7"></a> <a href="#fnref7">[7]</a>
Strong, powerful chief.
</p>

<p>
On the next page, burning bright, was a tiger, if possible one degree more
terrible than the lion. His &ldquo;fearful cemetery&rdquo; appeared to be full,
judging by its burgeoned bulge and the shocking state of depletion exhibited by
the buffalo on which he fed with barely inaudible snarls and grunts of
satisfaction. Blood dripped from his capacious and over-furnished mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Booful,&rdquo; murmured Damocles. &ldquo;I shall go shooting tigerth
to-mowwow. Shoot vem in ve mouth, down ve froat, so as not to spoil ve
wool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Turning over the page, the Major disclosed a most grievous grizzly bear,
grizzly and bearish beyond conception, heraldic, regardant, expectant, not
collared, fanged and clawed proper, rampant, erect, requiring no supporters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You could thtab him wiv a thword if you were quick, while he was doing
that,&rdquo; opined Damocles, charmed, enraptured, delighted. One by one, other
savage, fearsome beasts were disclosed to the increasingly delighted boy until,
without warning, the Major suddenly turned a page and disclosed a brilliant and
hungry-looking snake.
</p>

<p>
With a piercing shriek the boy leapt convulsively from Nurse Beaton&rsquo;s
arms, rushed blindly into the wall and endeavoured to butt and bore his way
through it with his head, screaming like a wounded horse. As the man and woman
sprang to him he shrieked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;th under my foot! It&rsquo;th
moving, moving, moving <i>out</i>&rdquo; and fell to the ground in a fit.
</p>

<p>
Major John Decies arose from his bachelor dinner-table that evening, lit his
&ldquo;planter&rdquo; cheroot, and strolled into the verandah that looked
across a desert to a mountain range.
</p>

<p>
Dropping into a long low chair, he raised his feet on to the long leg-rest
extensions of its arms, and, as he settled down and waited for coffee, wondered
why no such chairs are known in the West; why the trunks of the palms looked
less flat in the moonlight than in the daylight (in which, from that spot, they
always looked exactly as though cut out of cardboard); why Providence had not
arranged for perpetual full-moon; why the world looked such a place of
peaceful, glorious beauty by moonlight, the bare cruel mountains like
diaphanous clouds of tenderest soothing mist, the Judge&rsquo;s hideous
bungalow like a fairy palace, his own parched compound like a plot of Paradise,
when all was so abominable by day; and, as ever&mdash;why his darling, Lenore
Stukeley, had had to marry de Warrenne and die in the full flower and promise
of her beautiful womanhood.
</p>

<p>
Having finished his coffee and lighted his pipe (<i>vice</i> the over-dry
friable cheroot, flung into the garden) the Major then turned his mind to
serious and consecutive thought on the subject of her son, his beloved little
pal, Dammy de Warrenne.
</p>

<p>
Poor little beggar! What an eternity it had seemed before he had got him to
sleep. How the child had suffered. Mad! Absolutely stark, staring, raving
<i>mad</i> with sheer terrorâ€¦. Had he acted rightly in showing him the picture?
He had meant well, anyhow. Cruel phrase, that. How cuttingly his friend de
Warrenne had observed, &ldquo;You mean well, doubtless,&rdquo; on more than one
occasion. He could make it the most stinging of insultsâ€¦. Surely he had acted
rightlyâ€¦. Poor little beggar&mdash;but he was bound to see a picture or a real
live specimen, sooner or later. Perhaps when there was no help at handâ€¦. Would
he be like it always? <i>Might</i> grow out of it as he grew older and
stronger. What would have happened if he had encountered a live snake? Lost his
reason permanently, perhapsâ€¦. What would happen when he <i>did</i> see one, as
sooner or later, he certainly must?
</p>

<p>
What would be the best plan? To attempt gradually to inure him&mdash;or to
guard him absolutely from contact with picture, stuffed specimen, model, toy,
and the real thing, wild or captive, as one would guard him against a fell
disease?
</p>

<p>
<i>Could</i> he be inured? Could one &ldquo;break it to him gently&rdquo; bye
and bye, by first drawing a wiggly line and then giving it a head? One might
sketch a suggestion of a snake, make a sort of dissimilar clay model, improve
it, show him a cast skin, stuff it, make a more life-like picture, gradually
lead up to a well-stuffed one and then a live one. Might work up to having a
good big picture of one on the nursery wall; one in a glass case; keep a
harmless live one and show it him daily. Teach him by experience that
there&rsquo;s nothing supernatural about a snake&mdash;just a nasty reptile
that wants exterminating like other dangerous creatures&mdash;something to
<i>shikar</i> with a gun. Nothing at all supernaturalâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
But this was &ldquo;super&rdquo;-natural, abnormal, a terrible devastating
agony of madness, inherited, incurable probably; part of mind and body and
soul. Inherited, and integrally of him as were the colour of his eyes, his
intelligence, his physiqueâ€¦. Heredity â€¦ pre-natal influence â€¦ breedâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, nothing must be attempted yet awhile. Let the poor little chap get
older and stronger, in mind and body, first. Brave as a little bull-dog in
other directions! Absolutely devoid of fear otherwise, and with a natural bent
for fighting and adventure. Climb anywhere, especially up the hind leg of a
camel or a horse, fondle any strange dog, clamour to be put on any strange
horse, go into any deep water, cheek anybody, bear any ordinary pain with a
grin, thrill to any story of desperate deeds&mdash;a fine, brave, manly, hardy
little chap, and with art extraordinary physique for strength and endurance.
</p>

<p>
Whatever was to be attempted later, he must be watched, day and night, now. No
unattended excursions into the compound, no uncensored picture-books, no
juggling snake-charmersâ€¦. Yet it <i>must</i> come, sooner or later.
</p>

<p>
Would it ruin his life?
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, he must never return to India when he grew up, or go to any
snake-producing country, unless he could be cured.
</p>

<p>
Would it make him that awful thing&mdash;a coward?
</p>

<p>
Would it grow and wax till it dominated his mind&mdash;drive him mad?
</p>

<p>
Would succeeding attacks, following encounters with picture or reality,
progressively increase in severity?
</p>

<p>
<i>Her</i> boy in an asylum?
</p>

<p>
No. He was exaggerating an almost expected consequence that might never be
repeated&mdash;especially if the child were most carefully and gradually
reintroduced to the present terror. Later though&mdash;much later on.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, wait and hope: hope and waitâ€¦.

<h2><a name="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III.<br/>
THE SNAKE APPEARS.</h2>

<p>
The European child who grows up in India, if only to the age of six or seven
years, grows under a severe moral, physical, and mental handicap.
</p>

<p>
However wise, devoted, and conscientious its parents may be, the evil is great,
and remains one of the many heavy costs (or punishments) of Empire.
</p>

<p>
When the child has no mother and an indifferent father, life&rsquo;s handicap
is even more severe.
</p>

<p>
By his sixth birthday (the regiment being still in Bimariabad owing to the
prevalence of drought, famine, and cholera elsewhere) Damocles de Warrenne,
knowing the Urdu language and <i>argot</i> perfectly, knew, in theory also,
more of evil, in some directions, than did his own father.
</p>

<p>
If the child who grows up absolutely straight-forward, honest, above-board and
pure in thought, word, and deed, in England, deserves commendation, what does
the child deserve who does so in India?
</p>

<p>
Understanding every word they spoke to one another, the training he got from
native servants was one of undiluted evil and a series of object-lessons in
deceit, petty villainy, chicanery, oppression, lying, dishonesty, and all
immorality. And yet&mdash;thanks to his equal understanding of the words and
deeds of Nurse Beaton, Major Decies, Lieutenant Ochterlonie, his father, the
Officers of the Regiment, and the Europeans of the station&mdash;he had a
clear, if unconscious, understanding that what was customary for native
servants was neither customary nor possible for Sahibsâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
But he knew too muchâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
He knew what percentage of his or her pay each servant had to hand to the
&ldquo;butler-sahib&rdquo; monthly&mdash;or lose his or her place through false
accusation.
</p>

<p>
He knew why the ayah was graciously exempted from financial toll by this
autocrat. He knew roughly what proportion of the cook&rsquo;s daily bill
represented the actual cost of his daily purchases. He knew what the door-peon
got for consenting to take in the card of the Indian aspirant for an interview
with Colonel de Warrenne.
</p>

<p>
He knew the terms of the arrangements between the head-syce and the
grain-dealer, the lucerne-grass seller, the <i>ghas-wallah</i><a href="#fn8" name="fnref8" id="fnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
who brought the hay (whereby reduced quantities were accepted in return for
illegal gratifications). He knew of retail re-sales of these reduced supplies.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn8" id="fn8"></a> <a href="#fnref8">[8]</a>
Grass-man.
</p>

<p>
He knew of the purchase of oil, rice, condiments, fire-wood and other
commodities from the cook, of the theft (by arrangement) of the poultry and
eggs, of the surreptitious milking of the cow, and of the simple plan of
milking her&mdash;under Nurse Beaton&rsquo;s eye&mdash;into a narrow-necked
vessel already half full of water.
</p>

<p>
He knew that the ayah&rsquo;s husband sold the Colonel&rsquo;s soda-water,
paraffin, matches, candles, tobacco, cheroots, fruit, sugar, etc., at a little
portable shop round the corner of the road, and of the terms on which the
<i>hamal</i> and the butler supplied these commodities to the ayah for transfer
to her good man.
</p>

<p>
He knew too much of the philosophy, manners, habits, and morals of the dog-boy,
of concealed cases of the most infectious diseases in the compound, of the
sub-letting and over-crowding of the servants&rsquo; quarters, of incredible
quarrels, intrigues, jealousies, revenges, base villainies and wrongs,
superstitions and beliefs.
</p>

<p>
He would hear the hatching of a plot&mdash;an hour&rsquo;s arrangement and
wrangle&mdash;whereby, through far-sighted activity, perjury, malpractice and
infinite ingenuity, the ringleader would gain a <i>pice</i> and the follower a
<i>pie</i> (a farthing and a third of a farthing respectively).
</p>

<p>
Daily he saw the butler steal milk, sugar, and tea, for his own use; the
<i>hamal</i> steal oil when he filled the lamps, for sale; the <i>malli</i>
steal flowers, for sale; the coachman steal carriage-candles; the cook steal a
moiety of everything that passed through his hands&mdash;every one in that
black underworld stealing, lying, back-biting, cheating, intriguing (and all
meanwhile strictly and stoutly religious, even the sweeper-descended Goanese
cook, the biggest thief of all, purging his Christian soul on Sunday mornings
by Confession, and fortifying himself against the temptations of the Evil One
at early Mass).
</p>

<p>
Between these <i>nowker log</i>, the servant-people, and his own <i>jat</i> or
class, the <i>Sahib-log</i>, the master-people, were the troopers, splendid
Sikhs, Rajputs, Pathans and Punjabis, men of honour, courage, physique,
tradition. Grand fighters, loyal as steel while properly understood and
properly treated&mdash;in other words, while properly officered. (Men, albeit,
with deplorably little understanding of, or regard for, Pagett, M.P., and his
kind, who yearn to do so much for them.)
</p>

<p>
These men Damocles admired and loved, though even <i>they</i> were apt to be
very naughty in the bazaar, to gamble and to toy with opium, bhang, and
(alleged) brandy, to dally with houris and hearts&rsquo;-delights, to use
unkind measures towards the good <i>bunnia</i> and <i>sowkar</i> who had lent
them monies, and to do things outside the Lines that were not known in the
Officers&rsquo; Mess.
</p>

<p>
The boy preferred the Rissaldar-Major even to some Sahibs of his
acquaintance&mdash;that wonderful old man-at-arms, horseman, <i>shikarri</i>,
athlete, gentleman. (Yet how strange and sad to see him out of his splendid
uniform, in sandals, <i>dhotie</i>, untrammelled shirt-tails, dingy old cotton
coat and loose <i>puggri</i>, undistinguishable from a school-master, clerk, or
post-man; so <i>un</i>-sahib-like.)
</p>

<p>
And what a fine riding-master he made for an ambitious, fearless
boy&mdash;though Ochterlonie Sahib said he was too cruel to be a good
<i>horse</i>-master.
</p>

<p>
How <i>could</i> people be civilians and live away from regiments? Live without
ever touching swords, lances, carbines, saddles?
</p>

<p>
What a queer feeling it gave one to see the regiment go past the saluting base
on review-days, at the gallop, with lances down. One wanted to shout, to
laugh&mdash;to <i>cry</i>. (It made one&rsquo;s mouth twitch and chin work.)
</p>

<p>
Oh, to <i>lead</i> the regiment as Father did&mdash;horse and man one welded
piece of living mechanism.
</p>

<p>
Father said you couldn&rsquo;t ride till you had taken a hundred tosses, been
pipped a hundred times. A hundred falls! Surely Father had <i>never</i> been
thrown&mdash;it must be impossible for such a rider to come off. See him at
polo.
</p>

<p>
By his sixth birthday Damocles de Warrenne, stout and sturdy, was an
accomplished rider and never so happy (save when fencing) as when flogging his
active and spirited little pony along the &ldquo;rides&rdquo; or over the dusty
<i>maidans</i> and open country of Bimariabad. To receive a quarter-mile start
on the race-course and ride a mile race against Khodadad Khan on his
troop-horse, or with one of the syces on one of the Colonel&rsquo;s
polo-ponies, or with some obliging male or female early morning rider, was the
joy of his life. Should he suspect the competitor of &ldquo;pulling&rdquo; as
he came alongside, that the tiny pony might win, the boy would lash at both
horses impartially.
</p>

<p>
People who pitied him (and they were many) wondered as to how soon he would
break his neck, and remonstrated with his father for allowing him to ride
alone, or in charge of an attendant unable to control him.
</p>

<p>
In the matter of his curious love of fencing Major John Decies was deeply
concerned, obtained more and more details of his &ldquo;dweam,&rdquo; taught
him systematically and scientifically to fence, bought him foils and got them
shortened. He also interested him in a series of muscle-developing exercises
which the boy called his &ldquo;dismounted squad-dwill wiv&rsquo;out
arms,&rdquo; and performed frequently daily, and with gusto.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Lord Ochterlonie (Officers&rsquo; Light-Weight Champion at
Aldershot) rigged him up a small swinging sand-bag and taught him to punch with
either hand, and drilled him in foot-work for boxing.
</p>

<p>
Later he brought the very capable ten-year-old son of a boxing Troop-Sergeant
and set him to make it worth Dam&rsquo;s while to guard smartly, to learn to
keep his temper, and to receive a blow with a grin.
</p>

<p>
(Possibly a better education than learning declensions, conjugations, and
tables from a Eurasian &ldquo;governess&rdquo;.)
</p>

<p>
He learnt to read unconsciously and automatically by repeating, after Nurse
Beaton, the jingles and other letter-press beneath the pictures in the books
obtained for him under Major Decies&rsquo; censorship.
</p>

<p>
On his sixth birthday, Major John Decies had Damocles over to his bungalow for
the day, gave him a box of lead soldiers and a schooner-rigged ship, helped him
to embark them and sail them in the bath to foreign parts, trapped a squirrel
and let it go again, allowed him to make havoc of his possessions, fired at
bottles with his revolver for the boy&rsquo;s delectation, shot a crow or two
with a rook-rifle, played an improvised game of fives with a tennis-ball, told
him tales, and generally gave up the day to his amusement. What he did
<i>not</i> do was to repeat the experiment of a year ago, or make any kind of
reference to snakesâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, on the morning of the New-Year&rsquo;s-Day Review, Colonel
Matthew de Warrenne once again strode up and down his verandah, arrayed in full
review-order, until it should be time to ride to the regimental parade-ground.
</p>

<p>
He had coarsened perceptibly in the six years since he had lost his wife, and
the lines that had grown deepest on his hard, handsome face were those between
his eyebrows and beside his mouth&mdash;the mouth of an unhappy, dissipated,
cynical manâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
He removed his right-hand gauntlet and consulted his watchâ€¦. Quarter of an hour
yet.
</p>

<p>
He continued the tramp that always reminded Damocles of the restless, angry
to-and-fro pacing of the big bear in the gardens. Both father and the bear
seemed to fret against fate, to suffer under a sense of injury; both seemed
dangerous, fierce, admirable. Hearing the clink and clang and creak of his
father&rsquo;s movement, Damocles scrambled from his cot and crept down the
stairs, pink-toed, blue-eyed, curly-headed, night-gowned, to peep through the
crack of the drawing-room door at his beautiful father. He loved to see him in
review uniform&mdash;so much more delightful than plain khaki&mdash;pale blue,
white, and gold, in full panoply of accoutrement, jackbooted and spurred, and
with the great turban that made his English face look more English still.
</p>

<p>
Yes&mdash;he would ensconce himself behind the drawing-room door and watch.
Perhaps &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; would be bobbery when the Colonel mounted him, would
get &ldquo;what-for&rdquo; from whip and spur, and be put over the compound
wall instead of being allowed to canter down the drive and out at the gateâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Colonel de Warrenne stepped into his office to get a cheroot. Re-appearing in
the verandah with it in his mouth he halted and thrust his hand inside his
tunic for his small match-case. Ere he could use the match his heart was
momentarily chilled by the most blood-curdling scream he had ever heard. It
appeared to come from the drawing-room. (Colonel de Warrenne never lit the
cheroot that he had put to his lips&mdash;nor ever another again.) Springing to
the door, one of a dozen that opened into the verandah, he saw his son
struggling on the ground, racked by convulsive spasms, with glazed, sightless
eyes and foaming mouth, from which issued appalling, blood-curdling shrieks.
Just above him, on the fat satin cushion in the middle of a low settee, a huge
half-coiled cobra swayed from side to side in the Dance of Death.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s under my foot&mdash;it&rsquo;s
moving&mdash;moving&mdash;moving out</i>,&rdquo; shrieked the child.
</p>

<p>
Colonel de Warrenne attended to the snake first. He half-drew his sword and
then slammed it back into the scabbard. No&mdash;his sword was not for snakes,
whatever his son might be. On the wall was a trophy of Afghan weapons, one of
which was a sword that had played a prominent part on the occasion of the
Colonel&rsquo;s winning of the Victoria Cross.
</p>

<p>
Striding to the wall he tore the sword down, drew it and, with raised arm,
sprang towards the cobra. A good &ldquo;Cut Three&rdquo; across the coils would
carve it into a dozen pieces. No. Lenore made that cushion&mdash;and
Lenore&rsquo;s cushion made more appeal to Colonel de Warrenne than did
Lenore&rsquo;s son. No. A neat horizontal &ldquo;Cut Two,&rdquo; just below the
head, with the deadly &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; motion on it, would meet the case
nicely. Swinging it to the left, the Colonel subconsciously placed the sword,
&ldquo;resting flat on the left shoulder, edge to the left, hand in front of
the shoulder and square with the elbow, elbow as high as the hand,&rdquo; as
per drill-book, and delivered a lightning stroke&mdash;thinking as he did so
that the Afghan <i>tulwar</i> is an uncommonly well-balanced, handy
cutting-weapon, though infernally small in the hilt.
</p>

<p>
The snake&rsquo;s head fell with a thud upon the polished boards between the
tiger-skins, and the body dropped writhing and twitching on to the settee.
</p>

<p>
Damocles appeared to be dead. Picking him up, the callous-hearted father strode
out to where Khodadad Khan held &ldquo;Fire&rsquo;s&rdquo; bridle, handed him
to the orderly, mounted, received him again from the man, and, holding him in
his strong right arm, cantered to the bungalow of Major John Decies&mdash;since
it lay on the road to the parade-ground.
</p>

<p>
Would the jerking hurt the little beggar in his present comatose state? Well,
brats that couldn&rsquo;t stand a little jerking were better dead, especially
when they screamed and threw fits at the sight of a common snake.
</p>

<p>
Turning into Major Decies&rsquo; compound and riding up to his porch, the
Colonel saw the object of his search, arrayed in pyjamas, seated in his long
cane chair beside a tray of tea, toast, and fruit, in the verandah.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Morning, de Warrenne,&rdquo; he cried cheerily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s little&mdash;&rdquo; and caught sight of the inanimate
child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Little coward&rsquo;s fainted after throwing a fit&mdash;over a common
snake,&rdquo; observed the Colonel coolly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give him here,&rdquo; answered the Major, taking the boy tenderly in his
arms,&mdash;&ldquo;and kindly&mdash;er&mdash;clear out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not wish to strike his friend and senior. How the black rage welled up
in his heart against the callous brute who had dared to marry Lenore Seymour
Stukeley.
</p>

<p>
Colonel de Warrenne wheeled his horse without a word, and rode out of Major
Decies&rsquo; life and that of his son.
</p>

<p>
Galloping to the parade-ground he spoke a few curt words to his Adjutant,
inspected the <i>rissala</i>, and then rode at its head to the brigade
parade-ground where it took up its position on the left flank of the Guns and
the Queen&rsquo;s Greys, &ldquo;sat at ease,&rdquo; and awaited the arrival of
the Chief Commissioner at the saluting-base. A British Infantry regiment
marched to the left flank of the 118th (Bombay) Lancers, left-turned and stood
at ease. Another followed and was followed in turn by Native Infantry
Regiments&mdash;grand Sikhs in scarlet tunics, baggy black breeches and blue
putties; hefty Pathans and Baluchis in green tunics, crimson breeches and high
white gaiters, sturdy little Gurkhas in rifle-green, stalwart Punjabi
Mahommedans.
</p>

<p>
The great double line grew and grew, and stood patiently waiting, Horse, Foot,
and Guns, facing the sun and a dense crowd of spectators ranked behind the
rope-encircled, guard-surrounded saluting-base over which flew the Flag of
England.
</p>

<p>
The Brigadier and his Staff rode on to the ground, were saluted by the mile of
troops, and took up their position.
</p>

<p>
Followed the Chief Commissioner in his state carriage, accompanied by a very
Distinguished Guest, and surrounded by his escort. The mile of men again came
to attention and the review began. Guns boomed, massed bands played the
National Anthem, the crackling rattle of the <i>feu-de-joie</i> ran up the
front rank and down the rear.
</p>

<p>
After the inspection and the salutes came the march-past by the regiments.
</p>

<p>
Now the Distinguished Visitor&rsquo;s wife had told the Chief Commissioner that
she &ldquo;did not want to see the cavalry go past at the gallop as it raised
such a dreadful dust&rdquo;. But her maid bungled, her toilette failed, and she
decided not to accompany her husband to the Review at all. Her husband, the
Distinguished Visitor, <i>did</i> desire to see the cavalry go past at the
gallop, and so the Chief Commissioner&rsquo;s Distinguished Visitor&rsquo;s
wife&rsquo;s maid&rsquo;s bungling had a tremendous influence upon the fate of
Damocles de Warrenne, as will be seen.
</p>

<p>
Passed the massed Guns at the walk, followed by the Cavalry at the walk in
column of squadrons and the Infantry in column of companies, each unit saluting
the Chief Commissioner by turning &ldquo;eyes right&rdquo; as it passed the
spot where he sat on horseback surrounded by the civil and military staffs.
</p>

<p>
Wheeling to the left at the end of the ground the Guns and Cavalry again
passed, this time at the trot, while the Infantry completed its circular march
to its original position.
</p>

<p>
Finally the Cavalry passed for the third time, and now at the gallop, an
orderly whirlwind, a controlled avalanche of men and horses, with levelled
lances, and the hearts of all men were stirred at one of the most stirring
sights and sounds in the world&mdash;a cavalry charge.
</p>

<p>
At the head of the leading squadron galloped Colonel de Warrenne, cool,
methodical, keeping a distant flag-staff in line with a still more distant
church spire, that he might lead the regiment in a perfectly straight line.
(Few who have not tried it realize the difficulty of leading a galloping line
of men absolutely straight and at true right-angles to the line of their
ranks.)
</p>

<p>
On thundered the squadrons unbending of rank, uncrowded, unopened,
squadron-leaders maintaining distance, the whole mass as ordered, shapely, and
precisely correct as when at the walk.
</p>

<p>
Past the saluting-base thundered the squadrons and in full career Colonel de
Warrenne&rsquo;s charger put his near fore into ground honey-combed by insect,
reptile, or burrowing beast, crashed on its head, rolled like a shot rabbit,
and Colonel Matthew Devon de Warrenne lay dead&mdash;killed by his own sword.
</p>

<p>
Like his ancestors of that fated family, he had died by the sword, but unlike
them, he had died by the <i>hilt</i> of it.
</p>

<p>
Major John Decies, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon of Bimariabad, executor of the will of
the late Colonel de Warrenne and guardian of his son, cabled the sad news of
the Colonel&rsquo;s untimely death to Sir Gerald Seymour Stukeley at Monksmead,
he being, so far as Major Decies knew, the boy&rsquo;s only male relative in
England&mdash;uncle of the late Mrs. de Warrenne.
</p>

<p>
The reply, which arrived in a day or two, appeared from its redundancy and
incoherence to be the composition of Miss Yvette Seymour Stukeley, and bade
Major Decies either send or bring the infant Damocles to Monksmead
<i>immediately</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Major decided to apply forthwith for such privilege-leave and furlough as
were due to him, and to proceed to England with the boy. It would be as well
that his great-uncle should hear from him, personally, of the matter of the
child&rsquo;s mental condition resultant upon the tragedy of his own birth and
his mother&rsquo;s death. The Major was decidedly anxious as to the future in
this respect&mdash;all might be well in time, and all might be very far indeed
from well.
</p>

<p>
Nurse Beaton absolutely and flatly refused to be parted from her charge, and
the curious party of three set sail for England in due course.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hm!&mdash;He&rsquo;s every inch a Stukeley,&rdquo; remarked the General
when Damocles de Warrenne was ushered into his presence in the great library at
Monksmead. &ldquo;Hope he&rsquo;s Stukeley by nature too. Sturdy young fella!
&rsquo;Spose he&rsquo;s vetted sound in wind and limb?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Major replied that the boy was physically rather remarkably strong,
mentally very sound, and in character all that could be desired. He then did
his best to convey to the General an understanding of the psychic condition
that must be a cause of watchfulness and anxiety on the part of those who
guarded his adolescence.
</p>

<p>
At dinner, over the General&rsquo;s wonderful Clos Vougeot, the Major again
returned to the subject and felt that his words of advice fell upon somewhat
indifferent and uncomprehending ears.
</p>

<p>
It was the General&rsquo;s boast that he had never feed a doctor in his life,
and his impression that a sound resort for any kind of invalid is a lethal
chamberâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
The seven years since the Major had last seen her, seemed to have dealt lightly
with the sad-faced, pretty Miss Yvette, gentle, good, and very kind. Over the
boy she rhapsodized to her own content and his embarrassment. Effusive
endearments and embraces were new to Dam, and he appeared extraordinarily
ignorant of the art of kissing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how like his dear Father!&rdquo; she would exclaim afresh every few
minutes, to the Major&rsquo;s slight annoyance and the General&rsquo;s plain
disgust.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Every inch a Stukeley!&rdquo; he would growl in reply.
</p>

<p>
But Yvette Seymour Stukeley had prayed for Colonel de Warrenne nightly for
seven years and had idealized him beyond recognition. Possibly Fate&rsquo;s
greatest kindness to her was to ordain that she should not see him as he had
become in fact, and compare him with her wondrous mental imageâ€¦. The boy was to
her, must be, should be, the very image of her life&rsquo;s hero and belovedâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
The depolarized and bewildered Damocles found himself in a strange and truly
foreign land, a queer, cold, dismal country inhabited by vast quantities of
&ldquo;second-class sahibs,&rdquo; as he termed the British lower middle-class
and poor, a country of a strange greenness and orderedness, where there were
white servants, strangely conjoined rows of houses in the villages,
dangerous-looking fires inside the houses, a kind of tomb-stones on all
house-tops, strange horse-drawn vehicles, butlerless and <i>ghari</i><a href="#fn9" name="fnref9" id="fnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>-less
sahibs, and an utter absence of &ldquo;natives,&rdquo; sepoys,
<i>byle-gharies</i>,<a href="#fn10" name="fnref10" id="fnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
camels, monkeys, kites, squirrels, bulbuls, <i>minahs</i>,<a href="#fn11" name="fnref11" id="fnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
mongooses, palm-trees, and temples. Cattle appeared to have no humps, crows to
have black heads, and trees to have no fruit. The very monsoon seemed
inextricably mixed with the cold season. Fancy the rains coming in the cold
weather! Perhaps there was no hot weather and nobody went to the hills in this
strange country of strange people, strange food, strange customs. Nobody seemed
to have any tents when they left the station for the districts, nor to take any
bedding when they went on tour or up-country. A queer, foreign land.
</p>

A kind of starling.
</p>

<p>
But Monksmead was a most magnificent &ldquo;bungalow&rdquo; standing in a truly
beautiful &ldquo;compound&rdquo;&mdash;wherein the very <i>bhistis</i><a href="#fn12" name="fnref12" id="fnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
and <i>mallis</i> were European and appeared to be second-class sahibs.
</p>

<p class="footnote">

Water-carriers.
</p>

<p>
Marvellous was the interior of the bungalow with its countless rooms and
mountainous stair-cases (on the wall of one of which hung <i>the Sword</i>
which he had never seen but instantly recognized) and its army of white
servants headed by the white butler (so like the Chaplain of Bimariabad in
grave respectability and solemn pompousness) and its extraordinary white
&ldquo;ayahs&rdquo; or maids, and silver-haired Mrs. Pont, called the
&ldquo;house-keeper&rdquo;. Was she a <i>pukka</i> Mem-Sahib or a
<i>nowker</i><a href="#fn13" name="fnref13" id="fnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> or
what? And how did she &ldquo;keep&rdquo; the house?

Servant.
</p>

<p>
A wonderful place&mdash;but far and away the most thrilling and delightful of
its wonders was the little white girl, Lucille&mdash;Damocles&rsquo; first
experience of the charming genus.
</p>

<p>
The boy never forgot his first meeting with Lucille.
</p>

<p>
On his arrival at Monksmead he had been &ldquo;vetted,&rdquo; as he expressed
it, by the Burra-Sahib, the General; and then taken to an attractive place
called &ldquo;the school-room&rdquo; and there had found Lucilleâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo! Boy,&rdquo; had been her greeting. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo; He had attentively scrutinized a small white-clad, blue-sashed
maiden, with curling chestnut hair, well-opened hazel eyes, decided chin, Greek
mouth and aristocratic cheek-bones. A maiden with a look of blood and breed
about her. (He did not sum her up in these terms at the time.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you ride, Boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you fight?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> can&mdash;ever so farther. D&rsquo;you know French and
German?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Play the piano?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never heard of it. D&rsquo;you play it with cards or dice?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucky dog! It&rsquo;s music. I have to practise an hour a day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing â€¦ it&rsquo;s lessons. Beastly. How old are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seven&mdash;er&mdash;nearly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So&rsquo;m I&mdash;nearly. I&rsquo;ve got to be six first though. I
shall have a birthday next week. A big one. Have you brought any ellyfunts from
India?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a nellyfunt&mdash;only in pictures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A shudder shook the boy&rsquo;s sturdy frame.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you go like that? Feel sick?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t know. I seemed to remember something&mdash;in a book.
I dream about it. There&rsquo;s a nasty blue room with a mud floor. And
<i>Something</i>. Beastly. Makes you yell out and you can&rsquo;t. You
can&rsquo;t run away either. But the Sword dream is lovely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucille appeared puzzled and put this incoherence aside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a baby never to see ellyfunts! I&rsquo;ve seen lots. Hundreds. Zoo.
Circuses. Persessions. Camels, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I used to ride a camel every day. There was one in the compound with
his <i>oont-wallah</i>,<a href="#fn14" name="fnref14" id="fnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
Abdul Ghaffr; and Khodadad Khan used to beat the <i>oont-wallah</i> on cold
mornings to warm himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn14" id="fn14"></a> <a href="#fnref14">[14]</a>
Camel-man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an <i>oont-wallah</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <i>know</i>? Why, he&rsquo;s just the
<i>oont-wallah</i>, of course. Who&rsquo;d graze the camel or load it up if
there wasn&rsquo;t one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At tea in the nursery the young lady suddenly remarked:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like you, Boy. You&rsquo;re worth nine Haddocks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This cryptic valuation puzzled Damocles the more in that he had never seen or
heard of a haddock. Had he been acquainted with the fowl he might have been yet
more astonished.
</p>

<p>
Later he discovered that the comparison involved the fat boy who sat solemnly
stuffing on the other side of the table, his true baptismal name being Haddon.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Lucille was a revelation, a marvel.
</p>

<p>
Far quicker of mind than he, cleverer at games and inventing &ldquo;make
believe,&rdquo; very strong, active, and sporting, she was the most charming,
interesting, and attractive experience in his short but eventful life.
</p>

<p>
How he loved to make her laugh and clap her hands! How he enjoyed her quaint
remarks, speculations, fairy-tales and jokes. How he yearned to win her
approval and admiration. How he strove to please her!
</p>

<p>
In Lucille and his wonderful new surroundings he soon forgot Major Decies, who
returned to live (and, at a ripe old age, to die) at Bimariabad, where had
lived and died the woman whom he had so truly and purely loved. The place where
he had known her was the only place for him.
</p>

<p>
On each of his birthdays Damocles received a long fatherly letter and a
handsome present from the Major, and by the time he went away to school at
Wellingborough, he wondered who on earth the Major might be.
</p>

<p>
To his great delight Damocles found that he was not doomed to discontinue his
riding, fencing, boxing, and &ldquo;dismounted drill without arms&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
General Seymour Stukeley sent for a certain Sergeant Havlan (once a trooper in
his own regiment), rough-rider, swordsman, and boxer, now a professional
trainer, and bade him see that the boy learned all he could teach him of arms
and horsemanship, boxing, swimming, and general physical prowess and skill.
Lucille and Haddon Berners were to join in to the extent to which their age and
sex permitted.
</p>

<p>
The General intended his great-nephew to be worthy of his Stukeley blood, and
to enter Sandhurst a finished man-at-arms and horseman, and to join his
regiment, Cavalry, of course, with nothing much to learn of sword, lance,
rifle, revolver, and horse.
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Havlan soon found that he had little need to begin at the beginning
with Damocles de Warrenne in the matter of riding, fencing or boxing, and was
unreasonably annoyed thereat.
</p>

<p>
In time, it became the high ambition and deep desire of Dam to overcome
Sergeant Havlan&rsquo;s son in battle with the gloves. As young Havlan was a
year his senior, a trained infant prodigy, and destined for the Prize Ring,
there was plenty for him to learn and to do.
</p>

<p>
With foil or sabre the boy was beneath Dam&rsquo;s contempt.
</p>

<p>
Daily the children were in Sergeant Havlan&rsquo;s charge for riding and
physical drill, Dam getting an extra hour in the evening for the more manly and
specialized pursuits suitable to his riper years.
</p>

<p>
He and Lucille loved it all, and the Haddock bitterly loathed it.
</p>

<p>
Until Miss Smellie came Dam was a happy boy&mdash;but for queer sudden spasms
of terror of Something unknown; and, after her arrival, he would have been well
content could he have been assured of an early opportunity of attending her
obsequies and certain of a long-postponed resurrection; well content, and often
wildly happy (with Lucille) â€¦ but for the curious undefinable fear of Something
â€¦ Something about which he had the most awful dreams â€¦ Something in a blue room
with a mud floor. Something that seemed at times to move beneath his foot,
making his blood freeze, his knees smite together, the sunlight turn to
darknessâ€¦.

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br/>
THE SWORD AND THE SOUL.</h2>

<p>
One of the very earliest of all Dam&rsquo;s memories in after life&mdash;for in
a few years he forgot India absolutely&mdash;was of <i>the Sword</i> (that hung
on the oak-panelled wall of the staircase by the portrait of a cavalier), and
of a gentle, sad-eyed lady, Auntie Yvette, who used to say:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sonny darling, it is more than two-hundred-and-fifty years old. It
belonged to Sir Seymour Stukeley, who carried the King&rsquo;s Standard at
Edgehill and died with that sword in his hand â€¦ <i>You</i> shall wear a sword
some day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
(He did&mdash;with a difference.)
</p>

<p>
The sword grew into the boy&rsquo;s life and he would rather have owned it than
the mechanical steamboat with real brass cannon for which he prayed to God so
often, so earnestly, and with such faith. On his seventh birthday he preferred
a curious request, which had curious consequences.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can I take the sword to bed with me to-night, Dearest, as it is my
birthday?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the sword was taken down from the oak-panelled wall, cleaned, and laid on
the bed in his room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Promise you will not try to take it out of the sheath, sonny
darling,&rdquo; said the gentle, sad-eyed lady as she kissed him &ldquo;Good
night&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I promise, Dearest,&rdquo; replied the boy, and she knew that she need
have no fear.
</p>

<p>
He fell asleep fondling and cuddling the sword that had pierced the hearts of
many men and defended the honour of many ancestors, and dreamed, with far
greater vividness and understanding, the dream he had so often dreamt before.
</p>

<p>
Frequently as he dreamed it during his chequered career, it was henceforth
always most vivid and real. It never never varied in the slightest detail, and
he generally dreamed it on the night before some eventful, dangerful day on
which he risked his life or fought for it.
</p>

<p>
Of the early dreamings, of course, he understood little, but while he was still
almost a boy he most fully understood the significance of every word, act, and
detail of the marvellous, realistic dream.
</p>

<p>
It began with a view of a camp of curious little bell-tents about which strode
remarkable, big-booted, long-haired, bedizened men&mdash;looking strangely
effeminate and strangely fierce, with their feathered hats, curls, silk sashes,
velvet coats, and with their long swords, cruel faces, and savage oaths.
</p>

<p>
Some wore steel breastplates, like that of the suit of armour in the hall, and
steel helmets. The sight of the camp thrilled the boy in his dream, and yet he
knew that he had seen it all before actually, and in real life&mdash;in some
former life.
</p>

<p>
Beside one of a small cluster of tents that stood well apart from the rest sat
a big man who instantly reminded the boy of his dread
&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; whom he would have loved to have loved had he been
given the chance.
</p>

<p>
The big man was even more strangely attired than those others who clumped and
clattered about the lower part of the camp.
</p>

<p>
Fancy a great big strong man with long curls, a lace collar, and a velvet
coat&mdash;like a kid going to a party!
</p>

<p>
The velvet coat had the strangest sleeves, too&mdash;made to button to the
elbow and full of slits that seemed to have been mended underneath with blue
silk. There was a regular pattern of these silk-mended slits about the body of
the coat, too, and funny silk-covered buttons.
</p>

<p>
On his head the man had a great floppy felt hat with a huge feather&mdash;a hat
very like one that Dearest wore, only bigger.
</p>

<p>
One of his long curls was tied with a bow of ribbon&mdash;like young Lucille
wore&mdash;and the boy felt quite uncomfortable as he noted it. A grown
man&mdash;the silly ass! And, yes! he had actually got lace round the bottoms
of his quaint baggy knickerbockers&mdash;as well as lace cuffs!
</p>

<p>
The boy could see it, where one of the great boots had sagged down below the
knee.
</p>

<p>
Extraordinary boots they were, too. Nothing like &ldquo;Grumper&rsquo;s&rdquo;
riding-boots. They were yellowish in colour, and dull, not nicely polished, and
although the square-toed, ugly foot part looked solid as a house, the legs were
more like wrinkled leather stockings, and so long that the pulled-up one came
nearly to the hip.
</p>

<p>
Spurs had made black marks on the yellow ankles, and saddle and stirrup-leather
had rubbed the legsâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
And a sash! Whoever heard of a grown-up wearing a sash? It was a great blue
silk thing, wound round once or twice, and tied with a great bow, the ends of
which hung down in front.
</p>

<p>
Of all the Pip-squeaks!
</p>

<p>
And yet the big man&rsquo;s face was not that of a Pip-squeak&mdash;far from
it. It was very like Grumper&rsquo;s in fact.
</p>

<p>
The boy liked the face. It was strong and fierce, thin and
clean-cut&mdash;marred only, in his estimation, by the funny little tuft of
hair on the lower lip. He liked the wavy, rough, up-turned moustache, but not
that silly tuft. How nice he would look with his hair cut, his lower lip
shaved, and his ridiculous silks, velvet, and lace exchanged for a tweed
shooting-suit or cricketing-flannels! How Grumper, Father, Major Decies, and
even Khodadad Khan and the sepoys would have laughed at the get-up. Nay, they
would have blushed for the fellow&mdash;a Sahib, a gentleman&mdash;to tog
himself up so!
</p>

<p>
The boy also liked the man&rsquo;s voice when he turned towards the tent and
called:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lubin, you drunken dog, come hither,&rdquo; a call which brought forth a
servant-like person, who, by reason of his clean-shaven face and red nose,
reminded the boy of Pattern the coachman.
</p>

<p>
He wore a dark cloth suit, cotton stockings, shoes that had neither laces nor
buttons, but fastened with a kind of strap and buckle, and, queer creature, a
big Eton collar!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sword and horse, rascal,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;and warn
Digby for duty. Bring me wine and a manchet of bread.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man bowed and re-entered the tent, to emerge a moment later bearing <i>the
Sword</i>.
</p>

<p>
How the cut-steel hilt sparkled and shone! How bright and red the leather
scabbard&mdash;now black, dull, cracked and crumbling. But it was unmistakeably
<i>the</i> Sword.
</p>

<p>
It hung from a kind of broad cross-belt and was attached to it by several
parallel buckled straps&mdash;not like Father&rsquo;s Sam Browne belt at all.
</p>

<p>
As the gentleman rose from his stool (he must have been over six feet in
height) Lubin passed the cross-belt over his head and raised left arm so that
it rested on his right shoulder, and the Sword hung from hip to heel.
</p>

<p>
To the boy it had always seemed such a huge, unwieldy thing. At this big
man&rsquo;s side it looked&mdash;just right.
</p>

<p>
Lubin then went off at a trot to where long lines of bay horses pawed the
ground, swished their tails, tossed their heads, and fidgeted generallyâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
From a neighbouring tent came the sounds of a creaking camp-bed, two feet
striking the ground with violence, and a prodigious, prolonged yawn.
</p>

<p>
A voice then announced that all parades should be held in Hell, and that it was
better to be dead than damned. Why should gentlemen drill on a fine evening
while the world held wine and women?
</p>

<p>
After a brief space, occupied with another mighty yawn, it loudly and tunefully
requested some person or persons unknown to superintend its owner&rsquo;s
obsequies.
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Lay a garland on my hearse<br/>
Of the dismal yew;<br/>
Maidens, willow branches bear;<br/>
Say I died true.<br/>
My love was false, but I was firm<br/>
From my hour of birth.<br/>
Upon my buried body lie<br/>
Lightly, gentle earthâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May it do so soon,&rdquo; observed the tall gentleman distinctly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What ho, without there! That you, Seymour, lad?&rdquo; continued the
voice. &ldquo;Tarry a moment. Where&rsquo;s that cursed â€¦&rdquo; and sounds of
hasty search among jingling accoutrements were followed by a snatch of song of
which the boy instantly recognized the words. He had often heard Dearest sing
them.
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Drink to me only with thine eyes<br/>
And I will pledge with mine:<br/>
Or leave a kiss within the cup<br/>
And I&rsquo;ll not look for wine.<br/>
The thirst that from the soul doth rise<br/>
Doth ask a drink divine;<br/>
But might I of Jove&rsquo;s nectar sup,<br/>
I would not change for thine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lubin appeared, bearing a funny, fat, black bottle, a black cup (both appeared
to be of leather), and a kind of leaden plate on which was a small
funnily-shaped loaf of bread.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well you want none,&rdquo; observed the tall gentleman,
&ldquo;I had asked you to help me crush a flask else,&rdquo; and on the word
the singer emerged from the tent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jest not on solemn subjects, Seymour,&rdquo; he said soberly,
&ldquo;Wine may carry me over one more pike-paradeâ€¦. Good ladâ€¦. Here&rsquo;s to
theeâ€¦. Why should gentlemen drill?â€¦ I came to fight for the King, not to â€¦ But,
isn&rsquo;t this thy day for de Warrenne? Oh, ten million fiends! Plague and
pest! And I cannot see thee stick him, Seymour â€¦&rdquo; and the speaker dashed
the black drinking-vessel violently on the ground, having carefully emptied it.
</p>

<p>
The boy did not much like him.
</p>

<p>
His lace collar was enormous and his black velvet coat was embroidered all over
with yellow silk designs, flowers, and patterns. It was like the silly
mantel-borders and things that Mrs. Pont, the housekeeper, did in her leisure
time. (&ldquo;Cruel-work&rdquo; she called it, and the boy quite agreed.)
</p>

<p>
This man&rsquo;s face was pink and fair, his hair golden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Warn him not of the hilt-thrust, Seymour, lad,&rdquo; he said suddenly.
&ldquo;Give it him first&mdash;for a sneering, bullying, taverning, chambering
knave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tall gentleman glanced at his down-flung cup, raised his eyebrows, and
drank from the bottle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such <i>would</i> annoy <i>you</i>, Hal, of course,&rdquo; he murmured.
</p>

<p>
A man dressed in what appeared to be a striped football jersey under a leather
waistcoat and steel breast-plate, high boots and a steel helmet led up a great
horse.
</p>

<p>
The boy loved the horse. It was very like &ldquo;Fire&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman (called Seymour) patted it fondly, stroked his nose, and gave it
a piece of his bread.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Crony Long-Face?&rdquo; he said fondly.
</p>

<p>
He then put his left foot in the great box-stirrup and swung himself into the
saddle&mdash;a very different kind of saddle from those with which the boy was
familiar.
</p>

<p>
It reminded him of Circuses and the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show. It was big enough
for two and there was a lot of velvet and stuff about it and a fine gold
<i>C.R.</i>&mdash;whatever that might mean&mdash;on a big pretty cloth under it
(perhaps the gentleman&rsquo;s initials were C.R. just as his own were D. de W.
and on some of his things).
</p>

<p>
The great fat handle of a great fat pistol stuck up on each side of the front
of the saddle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Follow,&rdquo; said the gentleman to the iron-bound person, and moved
off at a walk towards a road not far distant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stap him! Spit him, Seymour,&rdquo; called the pink-faced man,
&ldquo;and warn him not of the hilt-thrust.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he passed the corner of the camp, two men with great axe-headed spear things
performed curious evolutions with their cumbersome weapons, finally laying the
business ends of them on the ground as the gentleman rode by.
</p>

<p>
He touched his hat to them with his switch.
</p>

<p>
Continuing for a mile or so, at a walk, he entered a dense coppice and
dismounted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Await me,&rdquo; he said to his follower, gave him the curb-rein, and
walked on to an open glade a hundred yards away.
</p>

<p>
(It was a perfect spot for Red Indians, Smugglers, Robin Hood, Robinson Crusoe
or any such game, the boy noted.)
</p>

<p>
Almost at the same time, three other men entered the clearing, two together,
and one from a different quarter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the hundredth time, Seymour, lad, <i>mention not the
hilt-thrust</i>, as you love me and the King,&rdquo; said this last one quietly
as he approached the gentleman; and then the two couples behaved in a
ridiculous manner with their befeathered hats, waving them in great circles as
they bowed to each other, and finally laying them on their hearts before
replacing them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mine honour is my guide, Will,&rdquo; answered the gentleman called
Seymour, somewhat pompously the boy considered, though he did not know the
word.
</p>

<p>
Sir Seymour then began to remove the slashed coat and other garments until he
stood in his silk stockings, baggy knickerbockers, and jolly cambric
shirt&mdash;nice and loose and free at the neck as the boy thought.
</p>

<p>
He rolled up his right sleeve, drew the sword, and made one or two
passes&mdash;like Sergeant Havlan always did before he began fencing.
</p>

<p>
The other two men, meantime, had been behaving somewhat similarly&mdash;talking
together earnestly and one of them undressing.
</p>

<p>
The one who did this was a very powerful-looking man and the arm he bared
reminded the boy of that of a &ldquo;Strong Man&rdquo; he had seen recently at
Monksmead Fair, in a tent, and strangely enough his face reminded him of that
of his own Father.
</p>

<p>
He had a nasty face though, the boy considered, and looked like a bounder
because he had pimples, a swelly nose, a loud voice, and a swanky manner. The
boy disapproved of him wholly. It was like his cheek to resemble Father, as
well as to have the same name.
</p>

<p>
His companion came over to the gentleman called Will, carrying the strong
man&rsquo;s bared sword and, bowing ridiculously (with his hat, both hands, and
his feet) said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall we measure, Captain Ormonde Delorme?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Captain Delorme then took the sword from Sir Seymour, bowed as the other had
done, and handed him the sword with a mighty flourish, hilt first.
</p>

<p>
It proved to be half an inch shorter than the other, and Captain Delorme
remarked that his Principal would waive that.
</p>

<p>
He and the strong man&rsquo;s companion then chose a spot where the grass was
very short and smooth, where there were no stones, twigs or inequalities, and
where the light of the setting sun fell sideways upon the combatants&mdash;who
tip-toed gingerly, and rather ridiculously, in their stockinged feet, to their
respective positions. Facing each other, they saluted with their swords and
then stood with the right arm pointing downwards and across the body so that
the hilt of the sword was against the right thigh and the blade directed to the
rear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One word, Sir Matthew de Warrenne,&rdquo; said Sir Seymour as they
paused in this attitude. &ldquo;If my point rests for a second on your hilt
<i>you are a dead man</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sir Matthew laughed in an ugly manner and replied:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what is your knavish design now, Sir Seymour Stukeley?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My design <i>was</i> to warn you of an infallible trick of fence, Sir
Matthew. It <i>now</i> is to kill you&mdash;for the insult, and on behalf of â€¦
your own unhappy daughter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The other yawned and remarked to his friend:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a parade in half an hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On guard,&rdquo; cried the person addressed, drawing his sword and
striking an attitude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Play,&rdquo; cried Captain Delorme, doing similarly.
</p>

<p>
Both principals crouched somewhat, held their swords horizontal, with point to
the adversary&rsquo;s breast and hilt drawn back, arm sharply bent&mdash;for
both, it appeared, had perfected the Art of Arts in Italy.
</p>

<p>
These niceties escaped the boy in his earlier dreamings of the dream&mdash;but
the time came when he could name every pass, parry, invitation, and riposte.
</p>

<p>
The strong man suddenly threw his sword-hand high and towards his left
shoulder, keeping his sword horizontal, and exposing the whole of his right
side.
</p>

<p>
Sir Seymour lunged hard for his ribs, beneath the right arm-pit and, as the
other&rsquo;s sword swooped down to catch his, twist it over, and riposte, he
feinted, cleared the descending sword, and thrust at the throat. A swift
ducking crouch let the sword pass over the strong man&rsquo;s head, and only a
powerful French circular parry saved the life of Sir Seymour Stukeley.
</p>

<p>
As the boy realized later, he fought Italian in principle, and used the best of
French parries, ripostes, and tricks, upon occasion&mdash;and his own perfected
combination of the two schools made him, according to Captain Delorme, the best
fencer in the King&rsquo;s army. So at least the Captain said to the other
second, as they amicably chatted while their friends sought to slay each other
before their hard, indifferent-seeming eyes.
</p>

<p>
To the boy their talk conveyed little&mdash;as yet.
</p>

<p>
The duellists stepped back as the &ldquo;phrase&rdquo; ended, and then Sir
Seymour gave an &ldquo;invitation,&rdquo; holding his sword-arm wide to the
right of his body. Sir Matthew lunged, his sword was caught, carried out to the
left, and held there as Sir Seymour&rsquo;s blade slid inward along it. Just in
time, Sir Matthew&rsquo;s inward pressure carried Sir Seymour&rsquo;s sword
clear to the right again. Sir Matthew disengaged over, and, as the sudden
release brought Sir Seymour&rsquo;s sword springing in, he thrust under that
gentleman&rsquo;s right arm and scratched his side.
</p>

<p>
As he recovered his sword he held it for a moment with the point raised toward
Sir Seymour&rsquo;s face. Instantly Sir Seymour&rsquo;s point tinkled on his
hilt, and Captain Delorme murmured &ldquo;Finis&rdquo; beneath his breath.
</p>

<p>
Sir Stukeley Seymour&rsquo;s blade shot in, Sir Matthew&rsquo;s moved to parry,
and the point of the advancing sword flickered under his hand, turned upward,
and pierced his heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain Delorme, as the stricken man fell, &ldquo;if he
parries outward the point goes under, if he anticipates a feint it comes
straight in, and if he parries a lunge-and-feint-under, he gets feint-over
before he can come up. I have never seen Stukeley miss when once he rests on
the hilt. <i>Exit</i> de Warrenne&mdash;and Hell the worse for
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and the boy awoke.
</p>

<p>
He kissed the sword and fell asleep again.
</p>

<p>
One day, when receiving his morning fencing and boxing lessons of Sergeant
Havlan, he astonished that warrior (and made a bitter enemy of him) by warning
him against allowing his blade to rest on the Sergeant&rsquo;s hilt, and by
hitting him clean and fair whenever it was allowed to happen. Also, by talking
of &ldquo;the Italian school of fence&rdquo; and of
&ldquo;invitations&rdquo;&mdash;the which were wholly outside the
fencing-philosophy of the French-trained swordsman. At the age of fifteen the
boy was too good for the man who had been the best that Aldershot had known,
who had run a <i>salle d&rsquo;armes</i> for years, and who was much sought by
ambitious members of the Sword Club.
</p>

<p>
The Sword, from the day of that newly vivid dream, became to the boy what his
Symbol is to the religious fanatic, and he was content to sit and stare at it,
musing, for hours.
</p>

<p>
The sad-eyed, sentimental lady encouraged him and spoke of Knights, Chivalry,
Honour, <i>Noblesse Oblige</i>, and Ideals such as the nineteenth century knew
not and the world will never know again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be a real and true Knight, sonny darling,&rdquo; she would say,
&ldquo;and live to <i>help</i>. Help women&mdash;God knows they need it. And
try to be able to say at the end of your life, &lsquo;I have never made a woman
weep&rsquo;. Yes&mdash;be a Knight and have &lsquo;Live pure, Speak true, Right
wrong&rsquo; on your shield. Be a Round Table Knight and ride through the world
bravely. Your dear Father was a great swordsman. You may have the sword down
and kiss it, the first thing every morning&mdash;and you must salute it every
night as you go up to bed. You shall wear a sword some day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
(Could the poor lady but have foreseen!)
</p>

<p>
She also gave him over-copiously and over-early of her simple, fervent, vague
Theology, and much Old and New Testament History, with the highest and noblest
intentions&mdash;and succeeded in implanting a deep distrust and dislike of
&ldquo;God&rdquo; in his acutely intelligent mind.
</p>

<p>
To a prattling baby, <i>Mother</i> should be God enough&mdash;God and all the
angels and paradise in one â€¦ (but he had never known a mother and Nurse Beaton
had ever been more faithfully conscientious in deed than tenderly loving in
manner).
</p>

<p>
She filled his soul with questionings and his mouth with questions which she
could not answer, and which he answered for himself. The questions sometimes
appalled her.
</p>

<p>
If God so loved the world, why did He let the Devil loose in it?
</p>

<p>
If God could do <i>anything</i>, why didn&rsquo;t He lay the Devil out with one
hand?
</p>

<p>
If He always rewarded the Good and punished the Bad, why was Dearest so
unhappy, and drunken Poacher Iggulsby so very gay and prosperously naughty?
</p>

<p>
He knew too that his dead Father had not been &ldquo;good,&rdquo; for he heard
servant-talk, and terrible old &ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo; always forgot that
&ldquo;Little Pitchers have Long Ears&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
If God always answered devout and faith-inspired prayer, why did He not
</p>

<p class="letter">
1. Save Caiaphas the cat when earnestly prayed for&mdash;having been run over
by Pattern in the dog-cart, coming out of the stables?
</p>

<p class="letter">
2. Send the mechanical steam-boat so long and earnestly prayed for, with Faith
and Belief?
</p>

<p class="letter">
3. Help the boy to lead a higher and a better life, to eat up his crusts and
fat as directed, to avoid chivvying the hens, inking his fingers, haunting the
stables, stealing green apples in the orchard, tearing his clothes, and
generally doing evil with fire, water, mud, stones and other tempting and
injurious things?
</p>

<p>
And was it entirely decent of God to be eternally spying on a fellow, as
appeared to be His confirmed habit?
</p>

<p>
As for that awful heart-rending Crucifixion, was that the sort of thing for a
Father to look on atâ€¦. As bad as that brutal old Abraham with Isaac his son â€¦
were <i>all</i> &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Fathers like that â€¦?
</p>

<p>
And nightmare dreams of Hell&mdash;a Hell in which there was a
<i>Snake</i>&mdash;wrought no improvement.
</p>

<p>
And the Bible! How strangely and dully they talked, and what people! That nasty
Jacob and Esau business, those horrid Israelites, the Unfaithful Steward; the
Judge who let himself be pestered into action; those poor unfortunate swine
that were made to rush violently down the steep place into the sea; Ananias and
Sapphira. No&mdash;not a nice book at all.
</p>

<p>
The truth is that Theology, at the age of seven, is not
commendable&mdash;setting aside the question of whether (at any age) Theology
is a web of words, ritual, dogma, tradition, invention, shibboleth; a web
originally spun by interested men to obscure God from their dupes.
</p>

<p>
So the boy worshipped Dearest and distrusted and disliked the God she gave him,
a big sinister bearded Man who hung spread-eagled above the world, covering the
entire roof of the Universe, and watched, watched, watched, with unwinking,
all-seeing eye, and remembered with unforgetting, unrelenting mind. Cruel.
Ungentlemanly. <i>Jealous!</i> Cold.
</p>

<p>
Also the boy fervently hoped it might never be his lot to go to Heaven&mdash;a
shockingly dreary place where it was always Sunday and one must, presumably, be
very quiet except when singing hymns. A place tenanted by white-robed Angels,
unsympathetic towards dirty-faced little sinners who tore their clothes.
Angels, cold, superior, unhuggable, haughty, given to ecstatic throes, singers
of <i>Hallelujah</i> and other silly words&mdash;always <i>praising</i>.
</p>

<p>
How he loathed and dreaded the idea of Dearest being an Angel! Fancy sweet
Dearest or his own darling Lucille with silly wings (like a beastly goose or
turkey in dear old Cook&rsquo;s larder), with a long trumpet, perhaps, in a
kind of night-gown, flying about the place, it wasn&rsquo;t decent at
all&mdash;Dearest and Lucille, whom he adored and hugged&mdash;unsympathetic,
cold, superior, unhuggable, haughty; and the boy who was very, <i>very</i>
tender-hearted, would throw his arms round Dearest&rsquo;s neck and hug and hug
and hug, for he abhorred the thought of her becoming a beastly angel.
</p>

<p>
Surely, if God knew His business, Dearest would be always happy and bright and
live ever so long, and be ever so old, forty years and more.
</p>

<p>
And Dearest, fearing that her idolized boy might grow up a man like&mdash;well,
like &ldquo;Grumper&rdquo; had been&mdash;hard, quarrelsome, adventurous,
flippant, wicked, pleasure-loving, drunken, Godless â€¦ redoubled her efforts to
Influence-the-child&rsquo;s-mind-for-good by means of the Testaments and
Theology, the Covenant, the Deluge, Miracles, the Immaculate Conception, the
Last Supper, the Resurrection, Pentecost, Creeds, Collects, Prayers.
</p>

<p>
And the boy&rsquo;s mind weighed these things deliberately, pondered them,
revolted&mdash;and rejected them one and all.
</p>

<p>
Dearest had been taken inâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
He said the prayers she taught him mechanically, and when he felt the need of
real prayer&mdash;(as he did when he had dreamed of the Snake)&mdash;he always
began, &ldquo;If you <i>are</i> there, God, and <i>are</i> a good, kind
God&rdquo; â€¦ and concluded, &ldquo;Yours sincerely, Damocles de
Warrenne&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
He got but little comfort, however, for his restless and logical mind
asked:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If God <i>knows</i> best and will surely <i>do</i> what is best, why
bother Him? And if He does not and will not, why bother yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Dearest succeeded, at any rate, in filling his young soul with a love of
beauty, romance, high adventure, honour, and all physical, mental, and moral
cleanliness.
</p>

<p>
She taught him to use his imagination, and she made books a necessity. She made
him a gentleman in soul&mdash;as distinct from a gentleman in clothes, pocket,
or position.
</p>

<p>
She gave him a beautiful veneration for woman that no other woman was capable
of destroying&mdash;though one or two did their best. Then the sad-eyed lady
was superseded and her professional successor, Miss Smellie, the governess,
finding the boy loved the Sword, asked Grumper to lock it away for the
boy&rsquo;s Good.
</p>

<p>
Also she got Grumper to dismiss Nurse Beaton for impudence and not
&ldquo;knowing her place&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
But Damocles entered into an offensive and defensive alliance with Lucille, on
whom he lavished the whole affection of his deeply, if undemonstratively,
affectionate nature, and the two &ldquo;hunted in couples,&rdquo; sinned and
suffered together, pooled their resources and their wits, found consolation in
each other when harried by Miss Smellie, spent every available moment in each
other&rsquo;s society and, like the Early Christians, had all things in common.
</p>

<p>
On birthdays, &ldquo;high days and holidays&rdquo; he would ask
&ldquo;Grumper&rdquo; to let him have the Sword for an hour or two, and would
stand with it in his hand, rapt, enthralled, ecstatic. How strange it made one
feel! How brave, and anxious to do fine deeds. He would picture himself bearing
an unconscious Lucille in his left arm through hostile crowds, while with the
Sword he thrust and hewed, parried and guardedâ€¦. Who could fear <i>anything</i>
with the Sword in his hand, the Sword of the Dream! How glorious to die
wielding it, wielding it in a good cause â€¦ preferably on behalf of Lucille, his
own beloved little pal, staunch, clever, and beautiful. And he told Lucille
tales of the Sword and of how he loved it!

LUCILLE.</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;If you drinks a drop more, Miss Lucy, you&rsquo;ll just go like my pore
young sister goed,&rdquo; observed Cook in a warning voice, as Lucille paused
to get her second wind for the second draught.
</p>

<p>
(Lucille had just been tortured at the stake by Sioux and
Blackfeet&mdash;thirsty work on a July afternoon.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how did she go, Cookie-Bird&mdash;<i>Pop?</i>&rdquo; inquired
Lucille politely, with round eyes, considering over the top of the big
lemonade-flagon as it rose again to her determined little mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Miss Lucy,&rdquo; replied Cook severely. &ldquo;Pop she did not. She
swole â€¦ swole and swole.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean &lsquo;swelled,&rsquo; Cookoo,&rdquo; corrected Lucille,
inclined to be a little didactic and corrective at the age of ten.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, she were <i>my</i> sister after all, Miss Lucy,&rdquo; retorted
Cook, &ldquo;and perhaps I may, or may not, know what she done. <i>I</i> say
she swole&mdash;and what is more she swole clean into a dropsy. All along of
drinking waterâ€¦. <i>Drops</i> of water&mdash;<i>Dropsy</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never drink water,&rdquo; murmured Dam, absentmindedly annexing, and
pocketing, an apple.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, water, but you see this is lemonade,&rdquo; countered Lucille.
&ldquo;Home-made, too, and not&mdash;er&mdash;gusty. It doesn&rsquo;t make you
go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and here it is regrettable to have to relate that
Lucille made a shockingly realistic sound, painfully indicative of the
condition of one who has imbibed unwisely and too well of a gas-impregnated
liquor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more does water in my experiants,&rdquo; returned Cook, &ldquo;and I
was not allooding to wulgarity, Miss Lucy, which you should know better than to
do such. My pore young sister&rsquo;s systerm turned watery and they tapped her
at the last. All through drinking too much water, which lemonade ain&rsquo;t so
very different either, be it never so &rsquo;ome-madeâ€¦. Tapped &rsquo;er they
did&mdash;like a carksk, an&rsquo; &rsquo;er a Band of &rsquo;Oper, Blue
Ribander, an&rsquo; Sunday Schooler from birth, an&rsquo; not departin&rsquo;
from it when she grew up. Such be the Ways of Providence,&rdquo; and Cook
sighed with protestive respectfulnessâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tapped &rsquo;er systerm, they did,&rdquo; she added pensively, and with
a little justifiable pride.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were they hard taps?&rdquo; inquired Lucille, reappearing from behind
the flagon. &ldquo;I hate them myself, even on the funny-bone or
knuckles&mdash;but on the <i>cistern!</i> Ugh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Hard</i> taps; they was <i>silver</i> taps,&rdquo; ejaculated Cook,
&ldquo;and drawed gallings and gallings&mdash;and nothing to laugh at, Master
Dammicles, neetherâ€¦. So don&rsquo;t you drink no more, Miss Lucy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Lucille&mdash;and indeed, to Dam, who
regarded his &ldquo;cousin&rdquo; with considerable concern, it did seem that,
even as Cook&rsquo;s poor young sister of unhappy memory, Lucille had
&ldquo;swole&rdquo;&mdash;though only locally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does <i>beer</i> make you swell or swole or swellow when you swallow,
Cooker?&rdquo; he inquired; &ldquo;because, if so, <i>you</i> had better
be&mdash;&rdquo; but he was not allowed to conclude his deduction, for cook,
bridling, bristling, and incensed, bore down upon the children and swept them
from her kitchen.
</p>

<p>
To the boy, even as he fled <i>via</i> a dish of tartlets and cakes, it seemed
remarkable that a certain uncertainty of temper (and figure) should invariably
distinguish those who devote their lives to the obviously charming and
attractive pursuit of the culinary art.
</p>

<p>
Surely one who, by reason of unfortunate limitations of sex, age, ability, or
property, could not become a Colonel of Cavalry could still find infinite
compensation in the career of cook or railway-servant.
</p>

<p>
Imagine, in the one case, having absolute freedom of action with regard to
raisins, tarts, cream, candy-peel, jam, plum-puddings and cakes, making life
one vast hamper, and in the other case, boundless opportunity in the matter of
leaping on and off moving trains, carrying lighted bull&rsquo;s-eye lanterns,
and waving flags.
</p>

<p>
One of the early lessons that life taught him, without troubling to explain
them, and she taught him many and cruel, was that Cooks are Cross.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What shall we do now, Dam?&rdquo; asked Lucille, and added,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s raid the rotten nursery and rag the Haddock. Little ass!
Nothing else to do. How I <i>hate</i> Sunday afternoonâ€¦. No work and no play.
Rotten.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Haddock, it may be stated, owed his fishy title to the fact that he once
possessed a Wealthy Relative of the name of Haddon. With far-sighted
reversionary intent his mother, a Mrs. Berners <i>nÃ©e</i> Seymour Stukeley, had
christened him Haddon.
</p>

<p>
But the Wealthy Relative, on being informed of his good fortune, had bluntly
replied that he intended to leave his little all to the founding of
Night-Schools for illiterate Members of Parliament, Travelling-Scholarships for
uneducated Cabinet Ministers, and Deportment Classes for New Radical Peers. He
was a Funny Man as well as a Wealthy Relative.
</p>

<p>
And, thereafter, Haddon Berners&rsquo; parents had, as Cook put it, &ldquo;up
and died&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo; had sent for, and adopted, the
orphan Haddock.
</p>

<p>
Though known to Dam and Lucille as &ldquo;The Haddock&rdquo; he was in reality
an utter Rabbit and esteemed as such. A Rabbit he was born, a Rabbit he lived,
and a Rabbit he died. Respectable ever. Seen in the Right Place, in the Right
Clothes, doing the Right Thing with the Right People at the Right Time.
</p>

<p>
Lucille was the daughter of Sylvester Bethune Gavestone, the late and lamented
Bishop of Minsterbury (once a cavalry subaltern), a school, Sandhurst, and
life-long friend of &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; and husband of
&ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;s&rdquo; cousin, Geraldine Seymour Stukeley.
</p>

<p>
Poor &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; known to the children as &ldquo;Grumper,&rdquo;
the ferocious old tyrant who loved all mankind and hated all men, with him
adoption was a habit, and the inviting of other children to stay as long as
they liked with the adopted children, a craze.
</p>

<p>
And yet he rarely saw the children, never played with them, and hated to be
disturbed.
</p>

<p>
He had out-lived his soldier-contemporaries, his children, his power to ride to
hounds, his pretty taste in wine, his fencing, dancing, flirting, and all that
had made life bearable&mdash;everything, as he said, but his gout and his liver
(and, it may be added, except his ferocious, brutal temper).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yesâ€¦. Let us circumvent, decoy, and utterly destroy the common
Haddock,&rdquo; agreed Dam.
</p>

<p>
The entry into the nursery was an effective night-attack by Blackfeet (not to
mention hands) but was spoilt by the presence of Miss Smellie who was sitting
there knitting relentlessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never burst into rooms, children,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;One
expects little of a boy, but a <i>girl</i> should try to appear a Young Lady.
Come and sit by me, Lucille. What did you come in for&mdash;or rather for what
did you burst in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We came to play with the Haddock,&rdquo; volunteered Dam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very kind and thoughtful of you, I am sure,&rdquo; commented Miss
Smellie sourly. &ldquo;Most obliging and benevolent,&rdquo; and, with a sudden
change to righteous anger and bitterness, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak the
truth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am speaking the truth, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Smellie,&rdquo; replied the
boy. &ldquo;We did come to play with the dear little Haddock&mdash;like one
plays with a football or a frog. I didn&rsquo;t say we came for Haddock&rsquo;s
<i>good</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We needed the Haddock, you see, Miss Smellie,&rdquo; confirmed Lucille.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How many times am I to remind you that Haddon Berners&rsquo; name
<i>is</i> Haddon, Lucille,&rdquo; inquired Miss Smellie. &ldquo;Why must you
always prefer vulgarity? One expects vulgarity from a boy&mdash;but a girl
should try to appear a Young Lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With an eye on Dam, Lucille protruded a very red tongue at surprising length,
turned one eye far inward toward her nose, wrinkled that member incredibly,
corrugated her forehead grievously, and elongated her mouth disastrously. The
resultant expression of countenance admirably expressed the general juvenile
view of Miss Smellie and all her works.
</p>

<p>
Spurred to honourable emulation, the boy strove to excel. Using both hands for
the elongation of his eyes, the extension of his mouth, and the depression of
his ears, he turned upon the Haddock so horrible a mask that the stricken child
burst into a howl, if not into actual tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Haddon?&rdquo; demanded Miss Smellie, looking
up with quick suspicion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dam made a <i>fathe</i> at me,&rdquo; whimpered the smitten one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say &lsquo;made a grimace&rsquo; not &lsquo;made a face,&rsquo;&rdquo;
corrected Miss Smellie. &ldquo;Only God can make <i>faces</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam exploded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At what are you laughing, Damocles?&rdquo; she asked sternly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, Miss Smellie. What you said sounded rather funny and a little
irrevilent or is it irrembrant?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damocles! Should <i>I</i> be likely to say anything Irreverent? Should
<i>I</i> ever dream of Irreverence? What <i>can</i> you mean? And never let me
see you make faces again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t let you see me, Miss Smellie, and only God can make
faces&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Leave the room at once, Sir, I shall report your impudence to your
great-uncle,&rdquo; hissed Miss Smellie, rising in wrath&mdash;and the bad
abandoned boy had attained his object. Detention in the nursery for a Sunday
afternoon was no part of his programme.
</p>

<p>
Most unobtrusively Lucille faded away also.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> she a hopeless beast,&rdquo; murmured she as the door
closed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Utter rotter,&rdquo; admitted the boy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s slope out into
the garden and dig some worms for bait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Lucille, and added, &ldquo;Parse
<i>Smellie,</i>&rdquo; whereupon, with one voice and heart and purpose the
twain broke into a paean, not of praise&mdash;a kind of tribal lay, and
chanted:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Smellie</i>&mdash;Very common noun, absurd person, singular back
number, tutor gender, objectionable case governed by the word <i>I</i>,&rdquo;
and so <i>da capo</i>.
</p>

<p>
And yet the poor lady strove to do her duty in that station of life in which it
had pleased Providence (or a drunken father) to place her&mdash;and to make the
children &ldquo;genteel&rdquo;. Had she striven to win their love instead, her
ministrations might have had some effect (other than infinite irritation and
bitter dislike).
</p>

<p>
She was the Compleat Governess, on paper, and all that a person entrusted with
the training of young children should not be, in reality. She had innumerable
and admirable testimonials from various employers of what she termed
&ldquo;aristocratic standing&rdquo;; endless certificates that testified unto
her successful struggles in Music, Drawing, Needlework, German, French,
Calisthenics, Caligraphy, and other mysteries, including the more decorous
Sciences (against Physiology, Anatomy, Zoology, Biology, and Hygiene she set
her face as subjects apt to be, at times, improper), and an appearance and
manner themselves irrefragible proofs of the highest moral virtue.
</p>

<p>
She also had the warm and unanimous witness of the children at Monksmead that
she was a Beast.
</p>

<p>
To those who frankly realize with open eyes that the student of life must
occasionally encounter indelicacies upon the pleasant path of research, it may
be revealed, in confidence, that they alluded to Miss Smellie as
&ldquo;Sniffy&rdquo; when not, under extreme provocation, as
&ldquo;Stinker&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
She taught them many things and, prominently, Deceit, Hate, and an utter
dislike of her God and her Religion&mdash;a most disastrous pair.
</p>

<p>
Poor old &ldquo;Grumper&rdquo;; advertising, he got her, paid her highly, and
gave her almost absolute control of the minds, souls, and bodies of his young
wards and &ldquo;grandchildren&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The best of everything&rdquo; for them&mdash;and they, at the average
age of eight, a band of depressed, resentful babes, had &ldquo;hanged, drawed,
and quartered&rdquo; her in effigy, within a month of coming beneath her stony
ministrations.
</p>

<p>
In appearance Miss Smellie was tall, thin, and flat. Most exceedingly and
incredibly flat. Impossibly flat. Her figure, teeth, voice, hair, manner, hats,
clothes, and whole life and conduct were flat as Euclid&rsquo;s plane-surface
or yesterday&rsquo;s champagne.
</p>

<p>
To counter-balance the possession, perhaps, of so many virtues, gifts,
testimonials, and certificates she had no chin, no eyebrows, and no eyelashes.
Her eyes were weak and watery; her spectacles strong and thick; her nose
indeterminate, wavering, erratic; her ears large, her teeth irregular and
protrusive, her mouth unfortunate and not guaranteed to close.
</p>

<p>
An ugly female face is said to be the index and expression of an ugly mind. It
certainly was so in the case of Miss Smellie. Not that she had an evil or
vicious mind in any way&mdash;far from it, for she was a narrowly pious and
dully conscientious woman. Her mind was ugly as a useful building may be very
ugly&mdash;or as a room devoid of beautiful furniture or over-crowded with
cheap furniture may be ugly.
</p>

<p>
And her mind was devoid of beautiful thought-furniture, and over-crowded with
cheap and ugly furniture of text-book facts. She was an utterly loveless woman,
living unloving, and unloved&mdash;a terrible condition.
</p>

<p>
One <i>could not</i> like her.
</p>

<p>
Deadly dull, narrow, pedantic, petty, uninspiring, Miss Smellie&rsquo;s ideals,
standards, and aims were incredibly low.
</p>

<p>
She lived, and taught others to live, for appearances.
</p>

<p>
The children were so to behave that they might appear &ldquo;genteel&rdquo;. If
they were to do this or that, no one would think they were young ladies or
young gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If we were out at tea and you did that, I <i>should</i> be
ashamed,&rdquo; she would cry when some healthy little human licked its jarnmy
fingers, and &ldquo;<i>Do</i> you wish to be considered vulgar or a little
gentleman, Damocles?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Damocles was profoundly indifferent on the point and said so plainly.
</p>

<p>
They were not to be clean of hand for hygienic reasons&mdash;but for fear of
what people might &ldquo;think&rdquo;; they were not to be honourable, gentle,
brave and truthful because these things are fine&mdash;but because of what the
World might dole out in reward; they were not to eat slowly and masticate well
for their health&rsquo;s sake&mdash;but by reason of &ldquo;good
manners&rdquo;; they were not to study that they might develop their powers of
reasoning, store their minds, and enlarge their horizons&mdash;but that they
might pass some infernal examination or other, <i>ad majorem Smelliae
gloriam</i>; they were not to practise the musical art that they might have a
soul-developing aesthetic training, a means of solace, delight, and
self-expression&mdash;but that they might &ldquo;play their piece&rdquo; to the
casual visitor to the school-room with priggish pride, expectant of praise;
they were not to be Christian for any other reason than that it was the
recommended way to Eternal Bliss and a Good Time Hereafter&mdash;the whole duty
of canny and respectable man being to &ldquo;save his soul&rdquo; therefore.
</p>

<p>
Her charges were skilfully, if unintentionally, trained in hypocrisy and mean
motive, to look for low reward and strive for paltry ends&mdash;to do what
looked well, say what sounded well, to be false, veneered, ungenuine.
</p>

<p>
And Miss Smellie was giving them the commonly accepted &ldquo;education&rdquo;
of their class and kind.
</p>

<p>
The prize product of the Smellie system was the Haddock whose whole life was a
pose, a lie, a refusal to see the actual. Perhaps she influenced him more
strongly than the others because he was caught younger and was of weaker fibre.
Anyhow he grew up the perfect and heartless snob, and by the time he left
Oxford, he would sooner have been seen in a Black Maria with Lord Snooker than
in a heavenly chariot with a prophet of unmodish garment and vulgar ancestry.
</p>

<p>
To the finished Haddock, a tie was more than a character, and the cut of a coat
more than the cutting of a loving heart.
</p>

<p>
To him a &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; was a person who had the current accent and
waistcoat, a competence, the entree here and there&mdash;a goer unto the
correct places with the correct people. Manners infinitely more than conduct;
externals everything; let the whitening be white and the sepulchre mattered
not.
</p>

<p>
The Haddock had no bloodful vice, but he was unstable as water and could not
excel, a moral coward and weakling, a liar, a borrower of what he never
intended to return, undeniably and incurably mean, the complete parasite.
</p>

<p>
From the first he feared and blindly obeyed Miss Smellie, propitiated while
loathing her; accepted her statements, standards, and beliefs; curried favour
and became her spy and informer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s about the record cricket-ball throw, Dam?&rdquo; inquired
Lucille, as they strolled down the path to the orchard and kitchen-garden,
hot-houses, stream and stables, to seek the coy, reluctant worm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; replied the boy, &ldquo;but a hundred yards wants a lot of
doing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wonder if <i>I</i> could do it,&rdquo; mused Lucille, picking up a
tempting egg-shaped pebble, nearly as big as her fist, and throwing it with
remarkably neat action (for a girl) at the first pear-tree over the bridge that
spanned the trout-stream.
</p>

<p>
<i>At</i>, but not into.
</p>

<p>
With that extraordinary magnetic attraction which glass has for the missile of
the juvenile thrower, the orchid-house, on the opposite side of the path from
the pear-tree, drew the errant stone to its hospitable shelter.
</p>

<p>
Through the biggest pane of glass it crashed, neatly decapitated a rare, choice
exotic, the pride of Mr. Alastair Kenneth MacIlwraith, head gardener, released
from its hold a hanging basket, struck a large pot (perched high in a state of
unstable equilibrium), and passed out on the other side with something
accomplished, something done, to earn a long repose.
</p>

<p>
So much for the stone.
</p>

<p>
The descending pot lit upon the edge of one side of the big glass aquarium,
smashed it, and continued its career, precipitating an avalanche of lesser pots
and their priceless contents.
</p>

<p>
The hanging basket, now an unhung and travelling basket, heavy, iron-ribbed,
anciently mossy, oozy of slime, fell with neat exactitude upon the bald, bare
cranium of Mr. Alastair Kenneth MacIlwraith, head gardener, and dour, irascible
child and woman hater.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo; commented Dam&mdash;always terse when not
composing fairy-tales.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Crikey!&rdquo; shrieked Lucille. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s done it,&rdquo; and
fled straightway to her room and violent earnest prayer, not for forgiveness
but for salvation, from consequences. (What&rsquo;s the good of Saying your
Prayers if you can&rsquo;t look for Help in Time of Trouble such as this?)
</p>

<p>
The face of Mr. Alastair Kenneth MacIlwraith was not pleasant to see as he
pranced forth from the orchid-house, brandishing an implement of his trade.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be needing a wash the day, Mon Sandy, and the Sawbath but
fower days syne,&rdquo; opined Dam, critically observing the moss-and-mud
streaked head, face and neck of the raving, incoherent victim of
Lucille&rsquo;s effort.
</p>

<p>
When at all lucid and comprehensible Mr. MacIlwraith was understood to say
he&rsquo;d give his place (and he twanty-twa years in it) to have the personal
trouncing of Dam, that Limb, that Deevil, that predestined and fore-doomed
Child of Sin, that&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Dam pocketed his hands and said but:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Havers</i>, Mon Sandy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; the hide fra y&rsquo;r bones yet, ye feckless,
impident&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam shook a disapproving head and said but:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Clavers</i>, Mon Sandy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>see</i> ye skelped onny-how&mdash;or lose ma job,
ye&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
More in sorrow than in anger Dam sighed and said but:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Hoots</i>, Mon Sandy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go straight to y&rsquo;r Grandfer the noo, and if ye&rsquo;r
not flayed alive! Aye! I&rsquo;ll gang the noo to Himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Wi&rsquo; fower an twanty men, an&rsquo; five an&rsquo; thairrty
pipers</i>,&rdquo; suggested Dam in tuneful song.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alastair Kenneth MacIlwraith did what he rarely did&mdash;swore violently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Do you think at your age it is right</i>?&rdquo; quoted the wicked
boy â€¦ the exceedingly bad and reprehensible boy.
</p>

<p>
The maddened gardener turned and strode to the house with all his imperfections
on his head and face and neck.
</p>

<p>
Taking no denial from Butterson, he forced his way into the presence of his
master and clamoured for instant retributive justice&mdash;or the acceptance of
his resignation forthwith, and him twanty-twa years in the ane place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; roused from slumber, gouty, liverish, ferociously
angry, sent for Dam, Sergeant Havlan, and Sergeant Havlan&rsquo;s cane.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this, Sir,&rdquo; he roared as Dam, cool,
smiling, friendly ever, entered the Sanctum. &ldquo;What the Devil d&rsquo;ye
mean by it, eh? Wreckin&rsquo; my orchid-houses, assaultin&rsquo; my servants,
waking me up, annoying M<small>E</small>! Seven days C.B.<a href="#fn15" name="fnref15" id="fnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
and bread and water, on each count. What d&rsquo;ye mean by it, ye young hound?
Eh? Answer me before I have ye flogged to death to teach ye better manners!
Guilty or Not Guilty? and I&rsquo;ll take your word for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn15" id="fn15"></a> <a href="#fnref15">[15]</a>
Confined to barracks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The missile, describing a parabola, struck its subjective with fearful
impact, Sir,&rdquo; replied the bad boy imperturbably, misquoting from his
latest fiction (and calling it a &ldquo;parry-bowler,&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;s&rdquo; considerable and very natural mystification).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; roared that gentleman, sitting bolt upright in
astonishment and wrath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s _ob_jective,&rdquo; corrected Dam. &ldquo;Yes. With
fearful impact. Fearful also were the words of the Mon Sandy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo; flushed and smiled a little wryly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d favour <i>me</i> with pleasantries too, would you?
I&rsquo;ll reciprocate to the best of my poor ability,&rdquo; he remarked
silkily, and his mouth set in the unpleasant Stukeley grimness, while a little
muscular pulse beat beneath his cheek-bone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A dozen of the very best, if you please, Sergeant,&rdquo; he added,
turning to Sergeant Havlan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Coat off, Sir,&rdquo; remarked that worthy, nothing loath, to the boy
who could touch him almost as he would with the foil.
</p>

<p>
Dam removed his Eton jacket, folded his arms, turned his back to the smiter and
assumed a scientific arrangement of the shoulders with tense muscles and coyly
withdrawn bones. He had been there beforeâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
The dozen were indeed of the Sergeant&rsquo;s best and he was a master. The boy
turned not a hair, though he turned a little paleâ€¦. His mouth grew
extraordinarily like that of his grandfather and a little muscular pulse beat
beneath his cheek-bone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what do you think of <i>my</i> pleasantries, my young friend?&rdquo;
inquired Grandfather. &ldquo;Feeling at all witty <i>now</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Havlan is failing a bit, Sir,&rdquo; was the cool reply. &ldquo;I have
noticed it at fencing too&mdash;Getting old&mdash;or beer perhaps. I scarcely
felt him and so did not see or feel the point of your joke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;s&rdquo; flush deepened and his smile broadened
crookedly. &ldquo;Try and do yourself justice, Havlan,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Nother dozen. &rsquo;Tother way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Havlan changed sides and endeavoured to surpass himself. It was a
remarkably sound dozen.
</p>

<p>
He mopped his brow.
</p>

<p>
The bad boy did not move, gave no sign, but retained his rigid, slightly
hunched attitude, as though he had not counted the second dozen and expected
another stroke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let that be a lesson to you to curb your damned tongue,&rdquo; said
&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; his anger evaporating, his pride in the
stiff-necked, defiant young rogue increasing.
</p>

<p>
The boy changed not the rigid, slightly hunched attitude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be pleased to wreck no more of my orchid-houses and to exercise your
great wit on your equals and juniors,&rdquo; he added.
</p>

<p>
Dam budged not an inch and relaxed not a muscle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo;â€¦.
&ldquo;Well&mdash;what are you waiting for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was waiting for Sergeant Havlan to <i>begin</i>,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;I thought I was to have a second dozen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With blazing eyes, bristling moustache, swollen veins and bared teeth,
&ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo; rose from his chair. Resting on one stick he struck
and struck and struck at the boy with the other, passion feeding on its own
passionate acts, and growing to madness&mdash;until, as the head gardener and
Sergeant rushed forward to intervene, Dam fell to the ground, stunned by an
unintentional blow on the head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grandfather&rdquo; stood tremblingâ€¦. &ldquo;<i>Quite</i> a
Stukeley,&rdquo; observed he. &ldquo;Oblige me by flinging his carcase down the
stairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Angry Stookly&rsquo;s mad Stookly&rsquo; is about right, mate,
wot?&rdquo; observed the Sergeant to the gardener, quoting an ancient local
saying, as they carried Dam to his room after dispatching a groom for Dr. Jones
of Monksmead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dammy Darling,&rdquo; whispered a broken and tear-stained voice outside
Dam&rsquo;s locked and keyless door the next morning, &ldquo;are you dead
yet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nit,&rdquo; was the prompt reply, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m starving to
death, fast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; was the sobbed answer, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve got
some flat food to push under the door.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shove it under,&rdquo; said Dam. &ldquo;Good little beast!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anything about the fearful fracass until
tea-time,&rdquo; continued Lucille, &ldquo;and then I went straight to Grumper
and confessed, and he sent me to bed on an empty stummick and I laid upon it,
the bed I mean, and howled all night, or part of it anyhow. I howled for your
sake, not for the empty stummick. I thought my howls would break or at least
soften his hard heart, but I don&rsquo;t think he heard them. I&rsquo;m sure he
didn&rsquo;t, in fact, or I should not have been allowed to howl so loud and
longâ€¦. Did he blame you with anger as well as injustice?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With a stick,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;What about that grub?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told him you were an innocent unborn babe and that Justice had had a
mis-carriage, but he only grinned and said you had got C.B. and dry bread for
insilence in the Orderly Room. What is &lsquo;insilence&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pulling Havlan&rsquo;s leg, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; opined Dam.
&ldquo;What about that <i>grub</i>? There comes a time when you are too hungry
to eat and then you die. I&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; squealed Lucille, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go and die after
all my trouble. I&rsquo;ve got some thin ice-wafer biscuits, sulphur tablets,
thin cheese, a slit-up apple and three sardines. They&rsquo;ll all come under
the door&mdash;though the sardines may get a bit out of shape. I&rsquo;ll come
after lessons and suck some brandy-balls here and breathe through the key-hole
to comfort you. I could blow them through the key-hole when they are small
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; acknowledged Dam gratefully, &ldquo;and if you could tie
some up and a sausage and a tart or two and some bread-and-jam and some chicken
and cake and toffee and things in a handkerchief, and climb on to the porch
with Grumper&rsquo;s longest fishing-rod, you might be able to relieve the
besieged garrison a lot. If the silly Haddock were any good he could fire
sweets up with a catapult.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try that too,&rdquo; announced Lucille, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d
break the windows. I feel I shall never have the heart to throw a stone or
anything again. My heart is broken,&rdquo; and the penitent sinner groaned in
deep travail of soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you eaten everything, Darling? How do you feel?&rdquo; she suddenly
asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Hungrier than ever,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I like sulphur
tablets with sardines. Wonder when they&rsquo;ll bring that beastly dry
bread?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a sulphur tablet left I could eat one myself,&rdquo;
said Lucille. &ldquo;They are good for the inside and I have wept mine
sore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; answered Dam. &ldquo;Pinch some more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They were the last,&rdquo; was the sad rejoinder. &ldquo;They were for
Rover&rsquo;s coat, I think. Perhaps they will make your coat hairy, Dam. I
mean your skin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whiskers to-morrow,&rdquo; said Dam.
</p>

<p>
After a pregnant silence the young lady announced:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wish I could hug and kiss you, Darling. Don&rsquo;t you?â€¦ I&rsquo;ll
write a kiss on a piece of paper and push it under the door to you. Better than
spitting it through the key-hole.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put it on a piece of <i>ham</i>,&mdash;more sense,&rdquo; answered Dam.
</p>

<p>
The quarter-inch rasher that, later, made its difficult entry, pulled fore and
pushed aft, was probably the only one in the whole history of Ham that was the
medium of a kiss&mdash;located and indicated by means of a copying-ink pencil
and a little saliva.
</p>

<p>
Before being sent away to school at Wellingborough Dam had a very curious
illness, one which greatly puzzled Dr. Jones of Monksmead village, annoyed Miss
Smellie, offended Grumper, and worried Lucille.
</p>

<p>
Sitting in solitary grandeur at his lunch one Sabbath, sipping his old
Chambertin, Grumper was vexed and scandalized by a series of blood-curdling
shrieks from the floor above his breakfast-room. Butterson, dispatched in haste
to see &ldquo;who the Devil was being killed in that noisy fashion,&rdquo;
returned to state deferentially as how Master Damocles was in a sort of
heppipletic fit, and foaming at the mouth. They had found him in the
General&rsquo;s study where he had been reading a book, apparently; a big
Natural History book.
</p>

<p>
A groom was galloping for Dr. Jones and Mrs. Pont was doin&rsquo; her possible.
</p>

<p>
No. Nothing appeared to have hurt or frightened the young gentleman&mdash;but
he was distinctly &rsquo;eard to shout: &ldquo;<i>It is under my foot. It is
moving&mdash;moving&mdash;moving out</i>â€¦.&rdquo; before he became unconscious.
</p>

<p>
No, Sir. Absolutely nothing under the young gentleman&rsquo;s foot.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Jones could shed no light and General Sir Gerald Seymour Stukeley hoped to
God that the boy was not going to grow up a wretched epileptic. Miss Smellie
appeared to think the seizure a judgment upon an impudent and deceitful boy who
stole into his elders&rsquo; rooms in their absence and looked at their books.
</p>

<p>
Lucille was troubled in soul for, to her, Damocles confessed the ghastly,
terrible, damning truth that he was a Coward. He said that he had hidden the
fearful fact for all these years within his guilty bosom and that now it had
emerged and convicted him. He lived in subconscious terror of the Snake, and in
its presence&mdash;nay even in that of its counterfeit presentment&mdash;he was
a gibbering, lunatic coward. Such, at least, was her dimly realized conception
resultant upon the boy&rsquo;s bald, stammering confession.
</p>

<p>
But how could her dear Dammy be a <i>coward</i>&mdash;the vilest thing on
earth! He who was willing to fight anyone, ride anything, go anywhere, act
anyhow. Dammy the boxer, fencer, rider, swimmer. Absurd! Think of the day
&ldquo;the Cads&rdquo; had tried to steal their boat from them when they were
sailing it on the pond at Revelmead. There had been five of them, two big and
three medium. Dam had closed the eye of one of them, cut the lip of another,
and knocked one of the smaller three weeping into the dust.
</p>

<p>
They had soon cleared off and flung stones until Dam had started running for
them and then they had fled altogether.
</p>

<p>
Think of the time when she set fire to the curtains. Why, he feared no bull, no
dog, no tramp in England.
</p>

<p>
A coward! Piffle.
</p>

<p>
And yet he had screamed and kicked and cried&mdash;yes <i>cried</i>&mdash;as he
had shouted that it was under his foot and moving out. Rum! <i>Very</i> rum!
</p>

<p>
On the day that Dam left Monksmead for school Lucille wept till she could weep
no more. Life for the next few years was one of intermittent streaks of
delirious joy and gloomy grief, vacation time when he was at Monksmead and term
time when he was at school. All the rest of the world weighed as a grain of
dust against her hero, Dam.

<h2><a name="chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br/>
THE SNAKE&rsquo;S &ldquo;MYRMIDON&rdquo;.</h2>

<p>
For a couple of years and more, in the lower School at Wellingborough, Damocles
de Warrenne, like certain States, was happy in that he had no history. In games
rather above the average, and in lessons rather below it, he was very popular
among his fellow &ldquo;squeakers&rdquo; for his good temper, modesty, generous
disposition, and prowess at football and cricket.
</p>

<p>
Then, later, dawned the day when from this comfortable high estate a common
adder, preserved in spirits of wine, was the cause of his downfall and Bully
Harberth the means of his reinstatementâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon Mr. Steynker, the Science Master, for some reason and without
preliminary mention of his intent, produced a bottled specimen of a snake. He
entered the room with the thing under his arm and partly concealed by the
sleeve of his gown. Watching him as he approached the master&rsquo;s desk and
spoke with Mr. Colfe, the form-master, Dam noted that he had what appeared to
be a long oblong glass box of which the side turned towards him was white and
opaque.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Steynker stepped on to the dais, as Mr. Colfe took up his books and
departed, he placed the thing on the desk with the other side to the classâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
And there before Dam&rsquo;s starting, staring eyes, fastened to the white back
of the tall glass box, and immersed in colourless liquid was the Terror.
</p>

<p>
He rose, gibbering, to his feet, pale as the dead, and pointed, mopping and
mowing like an idiot.
</p>

<p>
How should a glass box restrain the Fiend that had made his life a Hell upon
earth? What did Steynker and Colfe and these others&mdash;all gaping at him
open-mouthed&mdash;know of the Devil with whom he had wrestled deep beneath the
Pit itself for ten thousand centuries of horror&mdash;centuries whose every
moment was an aeon?
</p>

<p>
What could these innocent men and boys know of the living Damnation that made
him pray to die&mdash;provided only that he could be <i>really</i> dead and
finished, beyond all consciousness and fear. The fools!â€¦ to think that it was a
harmless, concrete thing. It would emerge in a moment like the
Fisherman&rsquo;s Geni from the Brass Bottle and grow as big as the world. He
felt he was going mad again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he suddenly shrieked. &ldquo;<i>It is under my foot. It is
moving â€¦ moving â€¦ moving out</i>.&rdquo; He sprang to his astounded friend,
Delorme, and screamed to him for help&mdash;and then realizing that there was
<i>no</i> help, that neither man nor God could save him, he fled from the room
screaming like a wounded horse.
</p>

<p>
Rushing madly down the corridor, falling head-long down the stone stairs,
bolting blindly across the entrance-hall, he fled until (unaware of his portly
presence up to the moment when he rebounded from him as a cricket-ball from a
net) he violently encountered the Head.
</p>

<p>
Scrambling beneath his gown the demented boy flung his arms around the massy
pillar of the Doctor&rsquo;s leg, and prayed aloud to him for help, between
heart-rending screams.
</p>

<p>
Now it is undeniable that no elderly gentleman, of whatsoever position or
condition, loves to be butted violently upon a generous lunch as he makes his
placid way to his arm-chair, cigar, book, and ultimate pleasant doze. If he be
pompous by profession, precise by practice, dignified as a duty, a monument of
most stately correctness and, to small boys and common men, a great and
distant, if tiny, God&mdash;he may be expected to resent it.
</p>

<p>
The Doctor did. Almost before he knew what he was doing, he struck the sobbing,
gasping child twice, and then endeavoured to remove him by the ungentle
application of the untrammelled foot, from the leg to which, limpet-like, he
clung.
</p>

<p>
To Dam the blows were welcome, soothing, reassuring. Let a hundred Heads flog
him with two hundred birch-rods, so they could keep him from the Snake. What
are mere blows?
</p>

<p>
Realizing quickly that something very unusual was in the air, the worthy Doctor
repented him of his haste and, with what dignity he might, inquired between a
bleat and a bellow:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter, my boy? Hush! Hush!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Snake! The Snake!&rdquo; shrieked Dam. &ldquo;Save me! Save me!
<i>It is under my foot! It is moving â€¦ moving â€¦ moving out</i>,&rdquo; and
clung the tighter.
</p>

<p>
The good Doctor also moved with alacrity&mdash;but saw no snake. He was
exceedingly perturbed, between a hypothetical snake and an all too actual
lunatic boy.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, &ldquo;Stout&rdquo; (so called because he was Porter), passing the
big doors without, was attracted by the screams.
</p>

<p>
Entering, he hastened to the side of the agitated Head, and, with some
difficulty, untied from that gentleman&rsquo;s leg, a small boy&mdash;but not
until the small boy had faintedâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
When Dam regained consciousness he had a fit, recovered, and found himself in
the Head&rsquo;s study, and the object of the interested regard of the Head,
Messrs. Colfe and Steynker, the school medico, and the porter.
</p>

<p>
It was agreed (while the boy fought for his sanity, bit his hand for the
reassuring pleasure of physical pain, and prayed for help to the God in whom he
had no reason to believe) that the case was &ldquo;very unusual, very curious,
v-e-r-y interesting indeed&rdquo;. Being healthier and stronger than at the
time of previous attacks, Dam more or less recovered before night and was not
sent home. But he had fallen from his place, and in the little republics of the
dormitory and class-room, he was a thing to shun, an outcast, a disgrace to the
noble race of Boy.
</p>

<p>
Not a mere liar, a common thief, a paltry murderer or vulgar
parricide&mdash;but a COWARD, a blubberer, a baby. Even Delorme, more in sorrow
than in anger, shunned his erstwhile bosom-pal, and went about as one betrayed.
</p>

<p>
The name of &ldquo;Funky Warren&rdquo; was considered appropriate, and even the
Haddock, his own flesh and blood, and most junior of &ldquo;squeakers,&rdquo;
dared to apply it!â€¦.
</p>

<p>
The infamy of the Coward spread abroad, was talked of in other Houses, and
fellows made special excursions to see the cry-baby, who funked a dead snake, a
blooming bottled, potted, dead snake, and who had blubbed aloud in his terror.
</p>

<p>
And Bully Harberth of the Fifth, learning of these matters, revolved in his
breast the thought that he who fears dead serpents must, even more, fear living
bullies, put Dam upon his list as a safe and pliant client, and thereby
(strange instrument of grace!) gave him the chance to rehabilitate himself,
clear the cloud of infamy from about his head, and live a bearable life for the
rest of his school careerâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
One wet Wednesday afternoon, as Dam, a wretched, forlorn Ishmael, sat alone in
a noisy crowd, reading a &ldquo;penny horrible&rdquo; (admirable, stimulating
books crammed with brave deeds and noble sentiments if not with faultless
English) the Haddock entered the form-room, followed by Bully Harberth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, Harberth, by the window, reading a penny blood,&rdquo;
said the Haddock, and went and stood afar off to see the fun.
</p>

<p>
Harberth, a big clumsy boy, a little inclined to fat, with small eyes, heavy
low forehead, thick lips, and amorphous nose, lurched over to where Dam
endeavoured to read himself into a better and brighter world inhabited by
Deadwood Dick, Texas Joe, and Red Indians of no manners and nasty customs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you, Funky Warren. I&rsquo;m going to torture you,&rdquo; he
announced with a truculent scowl and a suggestive licking of blubber lips.
</p>

<p>
Dam surveyed him coolly.
</p>

<p>
Of thick build, the bully was of thicker wit and certainly of no proven
courage. Four years older than Dam and quite four inches taller, he had never
dreamed of molesting him before. Innumerable as were the stories of his
brutalities to the smallest &ldquo;squeakers&rdquo; and of his cruel practical
jokes on new boys, there were no stories of his fighting, such as there were
about Ormond Delorme, of Dam&rsquo;s form, whose habit it was to implore bigger
boys of their courtesy to fight him, and to trail his coat where there were
&ldquo;chaws&rdquo; about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to torture you, Funky. Every day you must come to me and
<i>beg</i> me to do it. If you don&rsquo;t come and pray for it I&rsquo;ll come
to <i>you</i> and you&rsquo;ll get it double and treble. If you sneak
you&rsquo;ll get it quadru&mdash;er&mdash;quadrupedal&mdash;and also be known
as Sneaky as well as Funky. See?&rdquo; he continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How will you torture me, Harberth, please?&rdquo; asked Dam meekly, as
he measured the other with his eye, noted his puffiness, short reach, and
inward tendency of knee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! lots of ways,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Dry shaves, tweaks,
scalpers, twisters, choko, tappers, digs, benders, shinners, windos, all
sorts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what they are,&rdquo; moaned Dam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Kid!&rdquo; sympathized the bully, &ldquo;you soon will, though.
Dry shaves are beautiful. You die dotty in about five minutes if I don&rsquo;t
see fit to stop. Twisters break your wrists and you yell the roof off&mdash;or
would do if I didn&rsquo;t gag you first with a cake of soap and a towel.
Tappers are very amusing, too, for me that is&mdash;not for you. They are done
on the side of your knee with a cricket stump. Wonderful how kids howl when you
understand knee-treatment. Choko is good too. Makes you black in the face and
your eyes goggle out awful funny. Done with a silk handkerchief and a stick.
Windos and benders go together and really want two fellows to do it properly. I
hit you in the wind and you double up, and the other fellow un-doubles you from
behind&mdash;with a cane&mdash;so that I can double you up again. Laugh! I
nearly died over young Berners. Shinners, scalpers, and tweaks are good
too&mdash;jolly good!â€¦ but of course all this comes after lamming and tundingâ€¦.
Come along with meâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nit,&rdquo; was Dam&rsquo;s firm but gentle reply, and a little pulse
began to beat beneath his cheek bone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Ho!&rdquo; smiled Master Harberth, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll
<i>begin</i> here, and when you&rsquo;re broke and blubbing you&rsquo;ll come
with me&mdash;and get just double for a start.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam&rsquo;s spirits rose and he felt almost happy&mdash;certainly far better
than he had done since the hapless encounter with the bottled adder and his
fall from grace. It was a positive, <i>joy</i> to have an enemy he could
tackle, a real flesh-and-blood foe and tormentor that came upon him in broad
daylight and in mere human form.
</p>

<p>
After countless thousands of centuries of awful nightmare struggling&mdash;in
which he was bound hand-and-foot and doomed to failure and torture from the
outset, the sport, plaything, and victim of a fearful, intangible
Horror&mdash;this would be sheer amusement and recreation. What could mere man
do to <i>him</i>, much less mere boy! Why, the most awful torture-chamber of
the Holy Inquisition of old was a pleasant recreation-room compared with
<i>any</i> place where the Snake could enter.
</p>

<p>
Oh, if the Snake could only be met and fought in the open with free hands and
untrammelled limbs, as Bully Harberth could!
</p>

<p>
Oh, if it could only inflict mere physical pain instead of such agonies of
terror as made the idea of any bodily injury&mdash;mere cutting, burning,
beating, blinding&mdash;a trifling nothing-at-all. Anyhow, he could
<i>imagine</i> that Bully Harberth was the Snake or Its emissary and, since he
was indirectly brought upon him by the Snake, regard him as a
myrmidon&mdash;and deal with him accordinglyâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you like this?&rdquo; inquired that young gentleman as he
suddenly seized the seated and unsuspecting Dam by the head, crushed him down
with his superior weight and dug cruelly into the sides of his neck, below the
ears, with his powerful thumb and fingers. &ldquo;It is called
&lsquo;grippers&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll begin to enjoy it in a minute.&rdquo; â€¦ In
a few seconds the pain became acute and after a couple of minutes,
excruciating.
</p>

<p>
Dam kept absolutely still and perfectly silent.
</p>

<p>
To Harberth this was disappointing and after a time he grew tired. Releasing
his impassive victim he arose preparatory to introducing the next item of his
programme of tortures.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you like <i>this</i>?&rdquo; inquired Dam rising also&mdash;and
he smote his tormentor with all his strength beneath the point of his chin.
Rage, pain, rebellion, and undying hatred (of the Snake) lent such force to the
skilful blow&mdash;behind which was the weight and upward spring of his
body&mdash;that Bully Harberth went down like a nine-pin, his big head striking
the sharp edge of a desk with great violence.
</p>

<p>
He lay still and white with closed eyes. &ldquo;Golly,&rdquo; shrilled the
Haddock, &ldquo;Funky Warren has murdered Bully Harberth. Hooray!
Hooray!&rdquo; and he capered with joy.
</p>

<p>
A small crowd quickly collected, and, it being learned from credible
eye-witnesses that the smaller boy had neither stabbed the bully in the back
nor clubbed him from behind, but had well and truly smitten him on the jaw with
his fist, he went at one bound from despised outcast coward to belauded,
admired hero.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be hung, of course, Warren,&rdquo; said Delorme.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And a jolly good job,&rdquo; replied Dam, fervently and sincerely.
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, Harberth twitched, moved his arms and legs, and opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Sitting up, he blinked owl-like and inquired as to what was up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are down is what&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; replied Delorme.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;he&rsquo;s not dead,&rdquo; squeaked the Haddock, and there was
a piteous break in his voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Harberth again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Funky&mdash;that is to say, Warren&mdash;knocked you out, and
you&rsquo;ve got to give him best and ask for <i>pax</i>, or else fight
him,&rdquo; said Delorme, adding hopefully, &ldquo;but of course you&rsquo;ll
fight him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Harberth arose and walked to the nearest seat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He hit me a &lsquo;coward&rsquo;s poke&rsquo; when I wasn&rsquo;t
looking,&rdquo; quoth he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well known he is a coward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a liar, Bully Harberth,&rdquo; observed Delorme. &ldquo;He hit
you fair, and anyhow he&rsquo;s not afraid of <i>you</i>. If you don&rsquo;t
fight him you become Funky Harberth <i>vice</i>. Funky Warren&mdash;no longer
Funky. So you&rsquo;d better fight. See?&rdquo; The Harberth bubble was
evidently pricked, for the sentiment was applauded to the echo.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fight cowards,&rdquo; mumbled Harberth, holding his
jaw&mdash;and, at this meanness, Dam was moved to go up to Harberth and slap
him right hard upon his plump, inviting cheek, a good resounding blow that made
his hand tingle with pain and his heart with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
He still identified him somehow with the Snake, and had a glorious, if passing,
sensation of successful revolt and some revenge.
</p>

<p>
He felt as the lashed galley-slave must have felt when, during a lower-deck
mutiny, he broke from his oar and sprang at the throat of the cruel overseer,
the embodiment and source of the agony, starvation, toil, brutality, and
hopeless woe that had thrust him below the level of the beasts (fortunate
beasts) that perish.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to fight him, of course,&rdquo; said
Delorme, and fled to spread the glad tidings far and wide.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t feel well now,&rdquo; mumbled Harberth.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight him when I&rsquo;m better,&rdquo; and shambled away,
outraged, puzzled, disgusted. What was the world coming to? The little brute!
He had a punch like the kick of a horse. The little cad&mdash;to <i>dare</i>!
Well, he&rsquo;d show him something if he had the face to stand up to his
betters and olders and biggers in the ringâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
News of the affair spread like wild-fire, and the incredible conduct of the
extraordinary Funky Warren&mdash;said to be no longer Funky&mdash;became the
topic of the hour.
</p>

<p>
At tea, Dam was solemnly asked if it were true that he had cast Harberth from a
lofty window and brought him to death&rsquo;s door, or that of the hospital;
whether he had strangled him with the result that he had a permanent squint; if
he had so kicked him as to break both his thigh bones; if he had offered to
fight him with one hand.
</p>

<p>
Even certain more or less grave and reverend seniors of the upper school took a
well-disguised interest in the matter and pretended that the affair should be
allowed to go on, as it would do Harberth a lot of good if de Warrenne could
lick him, and do the latter a lot of good to reinstate himself by showing that
he was not really a coward in essentials. Of course they took no interest in
the fight as a fight. Certainly not (but it was observed that Flaherty of the
Sixth stopped the fight most angrily and peremptorily when it was over, and
that no sign of anger or peremptoriness escaped him until it was over&mdash;and
he happened to pass behind the gymnasium, curiously enough, just as it
started)â€¦.
</p>

<p>
Good advice was showered upon Dam from all sides. He was counselled to live on
meat, to be a vegetarian, to rise at 4 a.m. and swim, to avoid all brain-fag,
to run twenty miles a day, to rest until the fight, to get up in the night and
swing heavy dumb-bells, to eat no pudding, to drink no tea, to give up sugar,
avoid ices, and deny himself all &ldquo;tuck&rdquo; and everything else that
makes life worth living.
</p>

<p>
He did none of these things&mdash;but simply went on as usual, save in one
respect.
</p>

<p>
For the first time since the adder episode, he was really happy. Why, he did
not know, save that he was about to &ldquo;get some of his own back,&rdquo; to
strike a blow against the cruel coward Incubus (for he persisted in identifying
Harberth with the Snake and in regarding him as a materialization of the
life-long Enemy), and possibly to enjoy a brief triumph over what had so long
triumphed over him.
</p>

<p>
If he were at this time a little mad the wonder is that he was still on the
right side of the Lunatic Asylum gates.
</p>

<p>
Mad or not, he was happy&mdash;and the one thing wanting was the presence of
Lucille at the fight. How he would have loved to show her that he was not
really a coward&mdash;given a fair chance and a tangible foe.
</p>

<p>
If only Lucille could be there&mdash;dancing from one foot to the other, and
squealing. (Strictly <i>between</i>, and not during, the rounds, of course.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Buck up, Dammy! Ginger for pluck! Never say croak!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A very large and very informal committee took charge of the business of the
fight, and what was alluded to as &ldquo;a friendly boxing contest between
Bully Harberth of the Fifth and de Warrenne&mdash;late Funky&mdash;&rdquo; was
arranged for the following Saturday afternoon. On being asked by a delegate of
the said large and informal committee as to whether he would be trained by then
or whether he would prefer a more distant date, Dam replied that he would be
glad to fight Harberth that very moment&mdash;and thus gained the reputation of
a fierce and determined fellow (though erstwhile &ldquo;funky&rdquo;&mdash;the
queer creature).
</p>

<p>
Those who had been loudest in dubbing him Funky Warrenne were quickest in
finding explanations of his curious conduct and explained it well away.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that Dam&rsquo;s heart went wholly and finally out to
Ormonde Delorme who roundly stated that his father, a bemedalled heroic Colonel
of Gurkhas, was &ldquo;in a blind perishing funk&rdquo; during a thunderstorm
and always sought shelter in the wine cellar when one was in progress in his
vicinity.
</p>

<p>
Dam presented Delorme with his knife and a tiger&rsquo;s tooth forthwith.
Saturday came and Dam almost regretted its advent, for, though a child in
years, he was sufficiently old, weary, and cynical in spirit to know that all
life&rsquo;s fruit contains dust and ashes, that the joys of anticipation
exceed those of realization, and that with possession dies desire.
</p>

<p>
With the fight would end the glorious feeling of successful revolt, and if he
overcame one emissary of the Snake there would be a million more to take his
place.
</p>

<p>
And if Providence should be, as usual, on the side of the &ldquo;big
battalions,&rdquo; and the older, taller, stronger, heavier boy should win?
Why&mdash;then he would bully the loser to his heart&rsquo;s content and the
limit of his ingenuity.
</p>

<p>
Good! Let him! He would fight him every day with the greatest pleasure. A
chance to fight the Snake on fair terms was all he askedâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Time and place had been well chosen and there was little likelihood of
interference.
</p>

<p>
Some experienced youth, probably Cokeson himself, had made arrangements as to
seconds, time-keeper, judges, and referee; and, though there was no ring of
ropes and stakes, a twenty-four-foot square had been marked out and inclosed by
forms and benches. Seating was provided for the &ldquo;officials&rdquo; and
seniors, and two stools for the principals. A couple of bowls of water,
sponges, and towels lent a business-like air to the scene.
</p>

<p>
To his delight, Dam discovered that Delorme was to be his second&mdash;a person
of sound advice, useful ministrations, and very present help in time of
troubleâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Delorme led him to his stool in an angle of the square of benches, bade him
spread wide his arms and legs and breathe deeply &ldquo;for all he was worth,
with his eyes closed and his thoughts fixed on jolly things&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Feeling himself the cynosure of neighbouring eyes and able to hear the comments
of the crowd, the last part of his second&rsquo;s instructions was a little
difficult of strict observation. However, he continued to think of licking
Harberth&mdash;the &ldquo;jolliest&rdquo; thing he could conceive, until his
mind wandered home to Lucille, and he enhanced the imaginary jollity by
conceiving her presentâ€¦. &ldquo;Sturdy little brute,&rdquo; observed a big
Fifth Form boy seated with a couple of friends on the bench beside him,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d lay two to one in sovs. (if I had &rsquo;em) that he
doesn&rsquo;t last a single round with Harberth&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Disgrace to Harberth if he doesn&rsquo;t eat the kid alive,&rdquo;
responded the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Got a good jaw and mouth, though,&rdquo; said the third. &ldquo;Going to
die hard, you&rsquo;ll see. Good little kid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy funking a bottled frog or something and fighting a chap who can
give him about four years, four inches, and four stone,&rdquo; observed the
first speaker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Queer little beast. He knocked Harberth clean out, they say.
Perhaps his father has had him properly taught and he can really box. Ever seen
him play footer? Nippiest little devil <i>I</i> ever saw. Staunch too. Rum
go,&rdquo; commented his friend.
</p>

<p>
Dam thought of Sergeant Havlan and his son, the punching-ball, and the fighting
days at Monksmead. Perhaps he could &ldquo;really&rdquo; box, after all. Anyhow
he knew enough to hit straight and put his weight into it, to guard chin and
mark, to use his feet, duck, dodge, and side step. Suppose Harberth knew as
much? Well&mdash;since he was far stronger, taller, and heavier, the only hope
of success lay in the fact that he was connected with the Snake&mdash;from whom
mere blows in the open would be welcome.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow he would die or win.
</p>

<p>
The positive joy of fighting <i>It</i> in the glorious day and open air,
instead of in the Bottomless Pit&mdash;bound, stifled, mad with Fear&mdash;none
could realizeâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Bully Harberth entered the ring accompanied by Shanner, who looked like a Sixth
Form boy and was in the Shell.
</p>

<p>
Harberth wore a thick sweater and looked very strong and heavy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If the little kid lasts three rounds with <i>that</i>&rdquo; observed
Cokeson to Coxe Major, &ldquo;he ought to be chaired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam was disposed to agree with him in his heart, but he had no fear. The
feeling that <i>his</i> brief innings had come&mdash;after the Snake had had
Its will of him for a dozen years&mdash;swallowed up all other feelings.
</p>

<p>
Coxe Major stepped into the ring. &ldquo;I announce a friendly boxing contest
between Harberth of the Fifth, nine stone seven, and Funky Warren (said to be
no longer Funky) of Barton&rsquo;s House, weight not worth mentioning,&rdquo;
he declaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are the gloves all right,&rdquo; called Cokeson (whose father owned
racehorses, was a pillar of the National Sporting Club, and deeply interested
in the welfare of a certain sporting newspaper).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No fault can be found with Warren&rsquo;s gloves,&rdquo; said Shanner,
coming over to Dam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the gloves here,&rdquo; added Delorme,
after visiting Harberth&rsquo;s corner.
</p>

<p>
This was the less remarkable in that there were no gloves whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Presumably the fiction of a &ldquo;friendly boxing contest&rdquo; was to be
stoutly maintained. The crowd of delighted boys laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then come here, both of you,&rdquo; said Cokeson.
</p>

<p>
The combatants complied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hold and hit. Don&rsquo;t butt nor trip. Don&rsquo;t clinch.
Don&rsquo;t use knee, elbow, nor shoulder. When I call &lsquo;Break
away,&rsquo; break without hitting. If you do any of these things you will be
jolly well disqualified. Fight fair and God have mercy on your souls.&rdquo; To
Dam it seemed that the advice was superfluous&mdash;and of God&rsquo;s mercy on
his soul he had had experience.
</p>

<p>
Returning to their corners, the two stripped to the waist and sat ready,
arrayed in shorts and gymnasium shoes.
</p>

<p>
Seen thus, they looked most unevenly matched, Harberth looking still bigger for
undressing and Dam even smaller. But, as the knowing Coxe Major observed, what
there was of Dam was in the right place&mdash;and was muscle. Certainly he was
finely made.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seconds out of the ring. <i>Time!</i>&rdquo; called the time-keeper and
Dam sprang to his feet and ran at Harberth who swung a mighty round-arm blow at
his face as Dam ducked and smote him hard and true just below the breast-bone
and fairly on the &ldquo;mark &ldquo;.
</p>

<p>
The bully&rsquo;s grunt of anguish was drowned in howls of &ldquo;Shake
hands!&rdquo; &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t shaken hands!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop! Stop the fight,&rdquo; shouted Cokeson, and as they backed from
each other he inquired with anger and reproach in his voice:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this a friendly boxing-contest or a vulgar fight?&rdquo; adding,
&ldquo;Get to your corners and when <i>Time</i> is called, shake hands and then
begin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Turning to the audience he continued in a lordly and injured manner: &ldquo;And
there is only <i>one</i> Referee, gentlemen, please. Keep silence or I shall
stop the fight&mdash;I mean&mdash;the friendly boxing contest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Dam sat down Delorme whispered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Splendid! _In_fighting is your tip. Duck and go for the body every time.
He knows nothing of boxing I should say. Tire him&mdash;and remember that if he
gets you with a swing like that you&rsquo;re out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seconds out of the ring. <i>Time!</i>&rdquo; called the time-keeper and
Dam walked towards Harberth with outstretched hand, met him in the middle of
the ring and shook hands with great repugnance. As Harberth&rsquo;s hand left
Dam&rsquo;s it rose swiftly to Dam&rsquo;s face and knocked him down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shame! Foul poke! Coward,&rdquo; were some of the indignant cries that
arose from the spectators.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; roared the referee. &ldquo;<i>Will</i> you shut up and
be quiet. Perfectly legitimate&mdash;if not very sporting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam sprang to his feet, absolutely unhurt, and, if possible, more determined
than ever. It was only because he had been standing with feet together that he
had been knocked down at all. Had he been given time to get into sparring
position the blow would not have moved him. Nor was Harberth himself in an
attitude to put much weight behind the blow and it was more a cuff than a
punch.
</p>

<p>
Circling round his enemy, Dam sparred for an opening and watched his style and
methods.
</p>

<p>
Evidently the bully expected to make short work of him, and he carried his
right fist as though it were a weapon and not a part of his body.
</p>

<p>
As he advanced with his right extended, quivering, menacing, and poised for a
knock-out blow, his left did not appear in the matter at all.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he aimed his fist at Dam like a stone and with great force. Dam
side-stepped and it brushed his ear; with his right he smote with all his force
upon Harberth&rsquo;s ribs and with his left he drove at his eye as he came up.
Both blows were well and truly laid and with good sounding thuds that seemed to
delight the audience.
</p>

<p>
Bully Harberth changed his tactics and advanced upon his elusive opponent with
his left in the position of guard and his right drawn back to the arm-pit.
Evidently he was going to hold him off with the one and smash him with the
other. Not waiting for him to develop his attack, but striking the
bully&rsquo;s left arm down with his own left, Dam hit over it with his right
and reached his nose and&mdash;so curious are the workings of the human
mind&mdash;thought of Moses striking the rock and bringing forth water.
</p>

<p>
The sight of blood seemed to distress Harberth and, leaping in as the latter
drew his hand across his mouth, Dam drove with all his strength at his mark and
with such success that Harberth doubled up and fetched his breath with deep
groans. Dam stood clear and waited.
</p>

<p>
Delorme called out, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a right to finish him,&rdquo; and was
sternly reproved by the referee.
</p>

<p>
As Harberth straightened up, Dam stepped towards him, but the bully turned and
ran to his stool. As he reached it amid roars of execration the time-keeper
arose and cried &ldquo;<i>Time!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had him, you little ass,&rdquo; said Delorme, as he squeezed a
sponge of water on Dam&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Why on earth didn&rsquo;t you go in
and finish him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem decent when he was doubled up,&rdquo; replied Dam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did it seem decent his hitting you while you shook hands?&rdquo;
returned the other, beginning to fan his principal with a towel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anyhow he&rsquo;s yours if you go on like this. Keep your head and
don&rsquo;t worry about his. Stick to his body till you have a clear chance at
the point of his jaw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seconds out of the ring. <i>Time!</i>&rdquo; cried the time-keeper.
</p>

<p>
This round was less fortunate for the smaller boy. Harberth&rsquo;s second had
apparently given him some good advice, for he kept his mark covered and used
his left both to guard and to hit.
</p>

<p>
Also he had learned something from Dam, and, on one occasion as the latter went
at his face with a straight left, he dropped the top of his head towards him
and made a fierce hooking punch at Dam&rsquo;s body. Luckily it was a little
high, but it winded him for a moment, and had his opponent rushed him then, Dam
could have done nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
Just as &ldquo;Time&rdquo; was called, Harberth swung a great round-arm blow at
Dam which would have knocked him head over heels had not he let his knees go
just in time and ducked under it, hitting his foe once again on the mark with
all his strength.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you feel?&rdquo; asked Delorme as Dam went to his stool.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Happy,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk piffle,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;How do you feel?
Wind all right? Groggy at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Dam. &ldquo;I am enjoying it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so he was. Hitherto the Snake had had him bound and helpless. As it pursued
him in nightmares, his knees had turned to water, great chains had bound his
arms, devilish gags had throttled him, he could not breathe, and he had not had
a chance to escape nor to fight. He could not even scream for help. He could
only cling to a shelf. <i>Now</i> he had a chance. His limbs were free, his
eyes were open, he could breathe, think, act, defend himself and <i>attack</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seconds out of the ring. <i>Time!</i>&rdquo; called the time-keeper and
Delorme ceased fanning with the towel, splashed a spongeful of water in
Dam&rsquo;s face and backed away with his stool.
</p>

<p>
Harberth seemed determined to make an end.
</p>

<p>
He rushed at his opponent whirling his arms, breathing stertorously, and
scowling savagely.
</p>

<p>
Guarding hurt Dam&rsquo;s arms, he had no time to hit, and in ducking he was
slow and got a blow (aimed at his chin) in the middle of his forehead. Down he
went like a nine-pin, but was up as quickly, and ready for Harberth who had
rushed at him in the act of rising, while the referee shouted &ldquo;Stand
clear&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
As he came on, Dam fell on one knee and drove at his mark again.
</p>

<p>
Harberth grunted and placed his hands on the smitten spot.
</p>

<p>
Judging time and distance well, Dam hit with all his force at the bully&rsquo;s
chin and he went down like a log.
</p>

<p>
Rising majestically, the time-keeper lifted up his voice and counted:
&ldquo;<i>One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&rdquo;</i>&mdash;and
Harberth opened his eyes, sat up,
&ldquo;<i>seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and lay down again; and
just as Dam was about to leap for joy and the audience to roar their
approval&mdash;instead of the fatal &ldquo;<i>OUT</i>&rdquo; the time-keeper
called &ldquo;<i>Time</i>&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Had Dam struck the blow a second sooner, the fight would have been over and he
would have won. As it was, Harberth had the whole interval in which to recover.
Dam&rsquo;s own luck! (But Miss Smellie had always said there is no such thing
as Luck!) Well&mdash;so much the better. <i>Fighting</i> the Snake was the real
joy, and victory would end it. So would defeat and he must not get cock-a-hoop
and careless.
</p>

<p>
Delorme filled his mouth with water and ejected it in a fine spray over
Dam&rsquo;s head and chest. He was very proud of this feat, but, though most
refreshing, Dam could have preferred that the water had come from a sprayer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seconds out of the ring, <i>Time!</i>&rdquo; called the referee.
</p>

<p>
Harberth appeared quite recovered, but he was of a curious colour and seemed
tired.
</p>

<p>
Acting on his second&rsquo;s advice, Dam gave his whole attention to getting at
his opponent&rsquo;s body again, and overdid it. As Harberth struck at him with
his left, he ducked, and as he was aiming at Harberth&rsquo;s mark, he was
suddenly knocked from day into night, from light into darkness, from life into
deathâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Years passed and Dam strove to explain that the mainspring had broken and that
he had heard it click&mdash;when suddenly a great black drop-curtain rolled up,
while some one snapped back some slides that had covered his ears, and had
completely deafened him.
</p>

<p>
Then he saw Harberth and heard the voice of the time-keeper saying:
&ldquo;<i>five&mdash;six&mdash;seven</i>&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
He scrambled to his knees, &ldquo;<i>eight</i>&rdquo; swayed and staggered to
his feet, collapsed, rose, &ldquo;<i>nine</i>&rdquo; and was knocked down by
Harberth.
</p>

<p>
The time-keeper again stood up and counted,
&ldquo;<i>One&mdash;two&mdash;three</i>&rdquo;. But this blow actually helped
him.
</p>

<p>
He lay collecting his strength and wits, breathing deeply and taking nine
seconds&rsquo; rest.
</p>

<p>
On the word <i>&ldquo;nine&rdquo;</i> he sprang to his feet and as Harberth
rushed in, side-stepped, and, as that youth instinctively covered his
much-smitten &ldquo;mark,&rdquo; Dam drove at his chin and sent him staggering.
As he went after him he saw that Harberth was breathing hard, trembling, and
swaying on his feet. Springing in, he rained short-arm blows until Harberth
fell and then he stepped well back.
</p>

<p>
Harberth sat shaking his head, looking piteous, and, in the middle of the
time-keeper&rsquo;s counting, he arose remarking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
enough&rdquo;&mdash;and walked to his chair.
</p>

<p>
Bully Harberth was beaten&mdash;and Dam felt that the Snake was farther from
him than ever it had been since he could remember.

<p>
&ldquo;De Warrenne wins,&rdquo; said Cokeson, and then Flaherty of the Sixth
stepped into the ring and stopped the fight with much show of wrath and
indignation.
</p>

<p>
Dam was wildly cheered and chaired and thence-forth was as popular and as
admired as he had been shunned and despised.
</p>

<p>
Nor did he have another Snake seizure by day (though countless terrible
nightmares in what must be called his sleep) till some time after he had left
school.
</p>

<p>
When he did, it had a most momentous influence upon his career.

<h2><a name="chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br/>
LOVE&mdash;AND THE SNAKE.</h2>

<p>
Damocles de Warrenne, gentleman-cadet, on the eve of returning from Monksmead
to the Military Academy of Sandhurst, appeared to have something on his mind as
he sat on the broad coping of the terrace balustrade and idly kicked his heels.
Every time he had returned to Monksmead from Wellingborough and Sandhurst, he
had found Lucille yet more charming, delightful, and lovable. As her skirts and
hair lengthened she became more and more the real companion, the pal, the
adviser, without becoming any less the sportsman.
</p>

<p>
He had always loved her quaint terms of endearment, slang, and epithets, but as
she grew into a beautiful and refined and dignified girl, it was still more
piquant to be addressed in the highly unladylike (or un-Smelliean) terms that
she affected.
</p>

<p>
Dam never quite knew when she began to make his heart beat quicker, and when
her presence began to act upon him as sunshine and her absence as dull cloud;
but there came a time when (whether she were riding to hounds in her neat
habit, rowing with him in sweater and white skirt, swinging along the lanes in
thick boots and tailor-made costume, sitting at the piano after dinner in
simple white dinner-gown, or waltzing at some ball&mdash;always the belle
thereof for him) he <i>did</i> know that Lucille was more to him than a jolly
pal, a sound adviser, an audience, a confidant, and ally. Perhaps the day she
put her hair up marked an epoch in the tale of his affections. He found that he
began to hate to see other fellows dancing, skating, or playing golf or tennis
with her. He did not like to see men speaking to her at meets or taking her in
to dinner. He wanted the blood of a certain neighbouring spring-Captain, a
hunter of &ldquo;flappers&rdquo; and molester of parlour-maids, home on
furlough, who made eyes at her at the Hunt Ball and followed her about all
Cricket Week and said something to her which, as Dam heard, provoked her coolly
to request him &ldquo;not to be such a priceless ass&rdquo;. What it was she
would not tell Dam, and he, magnifying it, called, like the silly raw boy he
was, upon the spring-Captain, and gently requested him to &ldquo;let my cousin
alone, Sir, if you don&rsquo;t mind, or&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;ll jolly well
make you&rdquo;. Dam knew things about the gentleman, and considered him wholly
unfit to come within a mile of Lucille. The spring-Captain was obviously much
amused and inwardly much annoyed&mdash;but he ceased his scarce-begun pursuit
of the hoydenish-queenly girl, for Damocles de Warrenne had a reputation for
the cool prosecution of his undertakings and the complete fulfilment of his
promises. Likewise he had a reputation for Herculean strength and uncanny
skill. Yet the gay Captain had been strongly attracted by the beauty and grace
of the unspoilt, unsophisticated, budding woman, with her sweet freshness and
dignity (so quaintly enhanced by lapses into the slangy, unfettered schoolgirl
â€¦). Not that he was a marrying man at all, of courseâ€¦. Yes&mdash;Dam had it
weightily on his mind that he might come down from Sandhurst at any time and
find Lucille engaged to some other fellow. Girls did get engagedâ€¦. It was the
natural and obvious thing for them to do. She&rsquo;d get engaged to some
brainy clever chap worth a dozen of his own mediocre selfâ€¦. Of course she liked
him dearly as a pal and all that, an ancient crony and chum&mdash;but how
should he hope to compete with the brilliant fellers she&rsquo;d meet as she
went about more, and knew them. She was going to have a season in London next
year. Think of the kind of chaps she&rsquo;d run across in Town in the season.
Intellectual birds, artists, poets, authors, travellers, distinguished coves,
rising statesmen, under-secretaries, soldiers, swells, all sorts. Not much show
for him against that lot!
</p>

<p>
Gad! What a rotten look-out! What a rotten world to be sure! Fancy losing
Lucille!â€¦ Should he put his fortunes to the touch, risk all, and propose to
her. Fellows did these things in such circumstancesâ€¦. No&mdash;hardly fair to
try to catch her like that before she had had at least one season, and knew
what was what and who was whoâ€¦. Hardly the clean potato&mdash;to take advantage
of their long intimacy and try to trap her while she was a country mouse.
</p>

<p>
It was not as though he were clever and could hope for a great career and the
power to offer her the position for which she was fitted. Why, he was nearly
bottom of his year at Sandhurst&mdash;not a bit brilliant and brainy. Suppose
she married him in her inexperience, and then met the right sort of
intellectual, clever feller too late. No, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the straight
thing and decent at all, to propose to her now. How would Grumper view such a
step? What had he to offer her? What was he? Just a penniless orphan. Apart
from Grumper&rsquo;s generosity he owned a single five-pound note in money.
Never won a scholarship or exam-prize in his life. Mere Public Schools boxing
and fencing champion, and best man-at-arms at Sandhurst, with a score or so of
pots for running, jumping, sculling, swimming, shooting, boxing, fencing,
steeple-chasing and so forth. His total patrimony encashed would barely pay for
his Army outfit. But for Grumper&rsquo;s kindness he couldn&rsquo;t go into the
Army at all. And Grumper, the splendid old chap, couldn&rsquo;t last very much
longer. Why&mdash;for many a long year he would not earn more than enough to
pay his mess-bills and feed his horses. Not in England certainlyâ€¦. Was he to
ask Lucille to leave her luxurious home in a splendid mansion and live in a
subaltern&rsquo;s four-roomed hut in the plains in India? (Even if he could
scrape into the Indian army so as to live on his pay&mdash;more or less.)
Grumper, her guardian, and executor of the late Bishop&rsquo;s will, might have
very different views for her. Why, she might even be his heiress&mdash;he was
very fond of her, the daughter of his lifelong friend and kinsman. Fancy a
pauper making up to a very rich girl&mdash;if it came to her being that, which
he devoutly hoped it would not. It would remove her so hopelessly beyond his
reach. By the time he could make a position, and an income visible to the naked
eye, he would be grey-haired. Money was not made in the army. Rather was it
becoming no place for a poor gentleman but the paradise of rich bounders,
brainy little squits of swotters, and commission-without-training
nondescripts&mdash;thanks to the growing insecurity of things among the army
class and gentry generally. If she were really penniless he might&mdash;as a
Captain&mdash;ask her to share his poverty&mdash;but was it likely shed be a
spinster ten years hence&mdash;even if he were a Captain so soon? Promotion is
not violently rapid in the Cavalryâ€¦. And yet he simply hated the bare thought
of life without Lucille. Better to be a gardener at Monksmead, and see her
every day, than be the Colonel of a Cavalry Corps and know her to be married to
somebody elseâ€¦. Yes&mdash;he would come home one of these times from Sandburst
or his Regiment and find her engaged to some other fellow. And what then?
Well&mdash;nothing&mdash;only life would be of no further interest. It was
bound to happen. Everybody turned to look at her. Even women gave generous
praise of her beauty, grace, and sweetness. Men raved about her, and every male
creature who came near her was obviously dpris in five minutes. The curate,
plump &ldquo;Holy Bill,&rdquo; was well known to be fading away, slowly and
beautifully, but quite surely, on her account. Grumper&rsquo;s old pal, General
Harringport, had confided to Dam himself in the smoking-room, one very late
night, that since he was fifty years too old for hope of success in that
direction he&rsquo;d go solitary to his lonely grave (here a very wee hiccup),
damn his eyes, so he would, unwed, unloved, uneverything. Very trag(h)ic, but
such was life, the General had declared, the one alleviation being the fact
that he might die any night now, and ought to have done so a decade ago.
</p>

<p>
Why, even the little useless snob and tuft-hunter, the Haddock, that
tailor&rsquo;s dummy and parody of a man, cast sheep&rsquo;s eyes and made what
he called &ldquo;love&rdquo; to her when down from Oxford (and was duly snubbed
for it and for his wretched fopperies, snobberies, and folly). He&rsquo;d have
to put the Haddock across his knee one of these days.
</p>

<p>
Then there was his old school pal and Sandhurst senior, Ormonde Delorme, who
frequently stayed at, and had just left, Monksmead &mdash;fairly dotty about
her. She certainly liked Delorme&mdash;and no wonder, so handsome, clever,
accomplished, and so fine a gentleman. Rich, too. Better Ormonde than
another&mdash;but, God! what pain even to think of itâ€¦. Why had he cleared off
so suddenly, by the way, and obviously in trouble, though he would not admit
it?â€¦
</p>

<p>
Lucille emerged from a French window and came swinging across the terrace. The
young man, his face aglow, radiant, rose to meet her. It was a fine
face&mdash;with that look on it. Ordinarily it was somewhat marred by a
slightly cynical grimness of the mouth and a hint of trouble in the
eyes&mdash;a face a little too old for its age.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have a game at tennis before tea, young Piggy-wig?&rdquo; asked Lucille
as she linked her arm in his.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, young Piggy-wee,&rdquo; replied Dam. &ldquo;Gettin&rsquo; old
an&rsquo; fat. Joints stiffenin&rsquo;. Come an&rsquo; sit down and hear the
words of wisdom of your old Uncle Dammiculs, the Wise Man of Monksmead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come off it, Dammy. Lazy little beast. Fat little brute,&rdquo;
commented the lady.
</p>

<p>
As Damocles de Warrenne was six feet two inches high, and twelve stone of
iron-hard muscle, the insults fell but lightly upon him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will, though,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t have the
opportunity of hearing many more of your words of wisdom for a time, as you go
back on Monday. And you&rsquo;ll be the panting prey of a gang of giggling
girls at the garden party and dance to-morrowâ€¦. Why on earth must we muck up
your last week-day with rotten &lsquo;functions&rsquo;. You don&rsquo;t want to
dance and you don&rsquo;t want to garden-part in the least.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nit,&rdquo; interrupted Dam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo; â€¦ Grumper means it most kindly but â€¦ we want you to ourselves the last
day or two â€¦ anyhowâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you want me to yourself, Piggy-wee?&rdquo; asked Dam, trying to
speak lightly and off-handedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I do, you Ass. Shan&rsquo;t see you for centuries and months.
Nothing to do but weep salt tears till Christmas. Go into a decline or a red
nose very likely. Mind you write to me twice a week at the very least,&rdquo;
replied Lucille, and added:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bet you that silly cat Amelia Harringport is in your pocket all
to-morrow afternoon and evening. <i>All</i> the Harringport crowd are coming
from Folkestone, you know. If you run the clock-golf she&rsquo;ll <i>adore</i>
clock-golf, and if you play tennis she&rsquo;ll <i>adore</i> tennisâ€¦.
Can&rsquo;t think what she sees in youâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cattish, Lusilly,&rdquo; urged the young man.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Melier&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s you she comes to see, of
course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To which, it is regrettable to have to relate, Lucille replied
&ldquo;Rodents&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Talk languished between the young people. Both seemed unwontedly ill at ease
and nervous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you get long between leaving Sandhurst and joining the Corps
you&rsquo;re going to distinguish, Dammy?&rdquo; asked the girl after an uneasy
and pregnant silence, during which they had furtively watched each other, and
smiled a little uncomfortably and consciously when they had caught each other
doing so.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dunno. Sure not to. It&rsquo;s a rotten world,&rdquo; replied Dam
gloomily. &ldquo;I expect I shall come back and find you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll come back and find me! What do you mean,
Dam?&rdquo; said the girl. She flushed curiously as she interrupted him. Before
he could reply she continued:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be likely to have to go abroad directly you join your
Regiment, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall try for the Indian Army or else for a British Regiment in
India,&rdquo; was the somewhat sullen answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dam! What ever for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More money and less expenses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dam! You mercenary little toad! You grasping, greedy hog!â€¦ Why! I
thoughtâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucille gazed straight and searchingly at her life-long friend for a full
minute and then rose to her feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come to tea,&rdquo; she said quietly, and led the way to the big lawn
where, beneath an ancient cedar of Lebanon, the pompous Butterton and his
solemn satellite were setting forth the tea &ldquo;things&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Yvette presided at the tea-table and talked bravely to two woolly-witted
dames from the Vicarage who had called to consult her anent the covering of a
foot-stool &ldquo;that had belonged to their dear Grandmamma&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
(&ldquo;&lsquo;Time somebody shot it,&rdquo; murmured Dam to Lucille as he
handed her cup.)
</p>

<p>
Anon Grumper bore down upon the shady spot; queer old Grumper, very stiff,
red-faced, dapper, and extremely savage.
</p>

<p>
Having greeted the guests hospitably and kindly he confined his subsequent
conversation to two grunts and a growl.
</p>

<p>
Lucille and Damocles could not be said to have left the cane-chaired group
about the rustic tables and cake-stands at any given moment. Independently they
evaporated, after the manner of the Cheshire Cat it would appear, really
getting farther and farther from the circle by such infinitely small degrees
and imperceptible distances as would have appealed to the moral author of
&ldquo;Little by Little&rdquo;. At length the intervening shrubbery seemed to
indicate that they were scarcely in the intimate bosom of the tea-party, if
they had never really left it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come for a long walk, Liggy,&rdquo; remarked Dam as they met, using an
ancient pet-name.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right-O, my son,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But we must start off
mildly. I have a lovely feeling of too much cake. Too good to waste. Wait here
while I put on my clod-hoppers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The next hour was <i>the</i> Hour of the lives of Damocles de Warrenne and
Lucille Gavestone&mdash;the great, glorious, and wonderful hour that comes but
once in a lifetime and is the progenitor of countless happy hours&mdash;or
hours of poignant pain. The Hour that can come only to those who are worthy of
it, and which, whatever may follow, is an unspeakably precious blessing,
confuting the cynic, shaming the pessimist, confounding the atheist, rewarding
the pure in heart, revealing God to Man.
</p>

<p>
Heaven help the poor souls to whom that Hour never comes, with its memories
that nothing can wholly destroy, its brightness that nothing can ever wholly
darken. Heaven especially help the poor purblind soul that can sneer at it, the
greatest and noblest of mankind&rsquo;s gifts, the countervail of all his cruel
woes and curses.
</p>

<p>
As they walked down the long sweep of the elm-avenue, the pair encountered the
vicar coming to gather up his wife and sister for the evening drive, and the
sight of the two fine young people gladdened the good man&rsquo;s heart. He
beheld a tall, broad-shouldered, narrow-hipped young man, with a frank handsome
face, steady blue eyes, fair hair and determined jaw, a picture of the
clean-bred, clean-living, out-door Englishman, athletic, healthy-minded,
straight-dealing; and a slender, beautiful girl, with a strong sweet face,
hazel-eyed, brown-haired, upright and active of carriage, redolent of sanity,
directness, and all moral and physical health.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A well-matched pair,&rdquo; he smiled to himself as they passed him with
a cheery greeting.
</p>

<p>
For a mile or two both thought much and spoke little, the man thinking of the
brilliant, hated Unknown who would steal away his Lucille; the woman thinking
of the coming separation from the friend, without whom life was very empty,
dull, and poor. Crossing a field, they reached a fence and a beautiful view of
half the county. Stopping by mutual consent, they gazed at the peaceful,
familiar scene, so ennobled and etherealized by the moon&rsquo;s soft radiance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall think of this walk, somehow, whenever I see the full
moon,&rdquo; said Dam, breaking a long silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; replied Lucille.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hate going away this time, somehow, more than usual,&rdquo; he blurted
out after another spell of silence. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help wondering whether
you&rsquo;ll be&mdash;the same&mdash;when I come back at Christmas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why&mdash;how should I be different, Dammy?&rdquo; asked the girl,
turning her gaze upon his troubled face, which seemed to twitch and work as
though in pain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How?â€¦ Why, you might be&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Might be what, dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might be&mdash;engaged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl saw that in the man&rsquo;s eyes to which his tongue could not, or
would not, give utterance. As he spoke the word, with a catch in his breath,
she suddenly flung her arms round his neck, pressed her lips to his white face,
and, with a little sob, whispered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not unless to you, Dam, darling&mdash;there is no other man in the world
but you,&rdquo; and their lips met in their first lover&rsquo;s kissâ€¦. Oh, the
wonderful, glorious world!â€¦ The grand, beautiful old world! Place of delight,
joy, wonder, beauty, gratitude. How the kind little stars sang to them and the
benign old moon looked down and said: &ldquo;Never despair, never despond,
never fear, God has given you Love. What matters else?&rdquo; How the man swore
to himself that he would be worthy of her, strive for her, live for her; if
need be&mdash;die for her. How the woman vowed to herself that she would be
worthy of her splendid, noble lover, help him, cheer him, watch over him. Oh,
if he might only need her some day and depend on her for something in spite of
his strength and manhood. How she yearned to do something for him, to give, to
give, to give. Their hour lasted for countless ages, and passed in a flash. The
world intruded, spoiling itself as always.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Home to dinner, darling,&rdquo; said the girl at last. &ldquo;Hardly
time to dress if we hurry. Grumper will simply rampage and roar. He gets worse
every day.&rdquo; She disengaged herself from the boy&rsquo;s arms and her
terribly beautiful, painfully exquisite, trance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me one more kiss, tell me once more that you love me and only me,
for ever, and let us goâ€¦. God bless this place. I thank God. I love
God&mdash;now â€¦&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Dam could not speak at all.
</p>

<p>
They walked away, hand in hand, incredulous, tremulous, bewildered by the
beauty and wonder and glory of Life.
</p>

<p>
Alas!
</p>

<p>
As they passed the Lodge and entered the dark avenue, Dam found his tongue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Must tell Grumper,&rdquo; he said. Nothing mattered since Lucille loved
him like that. She&rsquo;d be happier in the subaltern&rsquo;s hut in the
plains of India than in a palace. If Grumper didn&rsquo;t like it, he must lump
it. Her happiness was more important than Grumper&rsquo;s pleasure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acquiesced Lucille, &ldquo;but tell him on Monday morning
when you go. Let&rsquo;s have this all to ourselves, darling, just for a few
hours. I believe he&rsquo;ll be jolly glad. Dear old bear, isn&rsquo;t
he&mdash;really.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the avenue Lucille stopped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dammy, my son,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;tell me the absolute, bare, bald
truth. Much depends upon it and it&rsquo;ll spoil everything if you
aren&rsquo;t perfectly, painfully honest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right-O,&rdquo; responded Dam. &ldquo;Go it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I the very very loveliest woman that ever lived?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Dam, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t have a line of your
face changed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I the cleverest woman in the world?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. But you&rsquo;re quite clever enough for me. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
you any cleverer. God forbid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I absolutely perfect and without flaw&mdash;in character.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. But I love your faults.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you wish to enshrine me in a golden jewel-studded temple and worship
me night and day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I want to put you in a house and live with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hurrah,&rdquo; cried the surprising young woman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
<i>love</i>, Dam. It&rsquo;s not rotten idealizing and sentimentalizing that
dies away as soon as facts are seen as such. You&rsquo;re a man, Dam, and
I&rsquo;m going to be a woman. I loathe that bleating, glorified nonsense that
the Reverend Bill and Captain Luniac and poor old Ormonde and people talk when
they&rsquo;re &lsquo;in love&rsquo;. <i>Love!</i> It&rsquo;s just sentimental
idealizing and the worship of what does not exist and therefore cannot last.
You love <i>me</i>, don&rsquo;t you, Dammy, not an impossible figment of a
heated imagination? This will last, dearâ€¦. If you&rsquo;d idealized me into
something unearthly and impossible you&rsquo;d have tired of me in six months
or less. You&rsquo;d have hated me when you saw the reality, and found yourself
tied to it for life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make a speech, Daughter,&rdquo; replied Damocles. &ldquo;Get on a stump
and make a blooming speech.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both were a little unstrung.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must wire this news to Delorme,&rdquo; said he suddenly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be delighted.&rdquo; Lucillemade no reply.
</p>

<p>
As they neared the end of the drive and came within sight of the house, the
girl whispered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My own pal, Dammy, for always. And you thought I could be engaged to
anyone but <i>you</i>. There <i>is</i> no one but you in the world, dear. It
would be quite empty if you left it. Don&rsquo;t worry about ways and means and
things, Dam, I shall enjoy waiting for <i>you</i>&mdash;twenty years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought of that, later.
</p>

<p>
On the morrow of that incredible day, Damocles de Warrenne sprang from his bed
at sunrise and sought the dew-washed garden below the big south terrace.
</p>

<p>
The world contained no happier man. Sunrise in a glorious English summer and a
grand old English garden, on the day after the Day of Days. He trod on air as
he lived over again every second of that wonderful over-night scene, and
scarcely realized the impossible truth.
</p>

<p>
Lucille loved him, as a lover! Lucille the <i>alter ego</i>, the understanding,
splendid friend; companion in play and work, in idle gaiety and serious
consideration; the <i>bon camarade</i>, the real chum and pal.
</p>

<p>
Life was a Song, the world a Paradise, the future a long-drawn Glory.
</p>

<p>
He would like to go and hold the Sword in his hand for a minute,
and&mdash;something seemed to stir beneath his foot, and a shudder ran through
his powerful frame.
</p>

<p>
The brightness of the morning was dimmed, and then Lucille came towards him
blushing, radiant, changed, and all was well with the world, and God in high
heaven.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
After breakfast they again walked in the garden, the truly enchanted garden,
and talked soberly with but few endearments though with over-full hearts, and
with constant pauses to eye the face of the other with wondering rapture. They
came of a class and a race not given to excessive demonstrativeness, but each
knew that the other loved&mdash;for life.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon, guests began to arrive soon after lunch, duties usurped the
place of pleasures, and the lovers met as mere friends in the crowd. There was
meaning in the passing glances, however, and an occasional hand-touch in the
giving of tennis-ball, or tea-cup.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Half the County&rdquo; was present, and while the younger fry played
tennis, croquet, clock-golf, and bowls, indulged in &ldquo;mixed
cricket,&rdquo; or attempted victory at archery or miniature-rifle shooting,
the sedate elders strolled o&rsquo;er velvet lawns beneath immemorial elms, sat
in groups, or took tea by carpet-spread marquees.
</p>

<p>
Miss Amelia Harringport, seeing Dam with a croquet-mallet in his hand, observed
that she <i>adored</i> croquet. Dam stated in reply that Haddon Berners was a
fearful dog at it, considered there should be a croquet Blue in fact, and would
doubtless be charmed to make up a set with her and the curate, the Reverend
William Williamson Williams (Holy Bill), and Another. Dam himself was cut off
from the bliss of being the Other&mdash;did not know the game at all.
</p>

<p>
Miss Amelia quickly tired of her croquet with the Haddock, Holy Bill and the
Vicar&rsquo;s Wife&rsquo;s Sister, who looked straitly after Holy Bill on this
and all other occasions. Seeing Dam shepherding a flock of elders to the
beautifully-mown putting-tracks radiating from the central circle of
&ldquo;holes&rdquo; for the putting competition, she informed him that she
<i>adored</i> putting, so much so that she wanted lessons from him, the local
amateur golf-champion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I just want a little <i>personal tuition</i> from the Champion and I
shall be quite a classy putter,&rdquo; she gurgled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will personally tuit,&rdquo; replied Dam, &ldquo;and when you are
tuited we will proceed to win the prize.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Carefully posing the maiden aspirant for putting excellence at the end of the
yard-wide velvety strip leading to the green and &ldquo;hole,&rdquo; Dam gave
his best advice, bade her smite with restraint, and then proceeded to the
&ldquo;hole&rdquo; to retrieve the ball for his own turn. Other couples did
&ldquo;preliminary canters&rdquo; somewhat similarly on the remaining spokes of
the great wheel of the putting &ldquo;clock&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The canny and practised Amelia, who had designs upon the handsome silver prize
as well as upon the handsome Damocles, smote straight and true with admirable
judgment, and the ball sped steadily down the track direct for the
&ldquo;hole,&rdquo; a somewhat large and deep one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! Magnificent!&rdquo; cried Dam, with quick and generous
appreciation of the really splendid putt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hole out in one
this time, anyhow.&rdquo; As the slowing ball approached the &ldquo;hole&rdquo;
he inserted his hand therein, laughing gaily, to anticipate the ball which with
its last grain of momentum would surely reach it and topple in.
</p>

<p>
Then the thing happened!
</p>

<p>
As he put his hand to the grass-encircled goal of the maiden&rsquo;s hopes and
ball, its gloomy depths appeared to move, swirl round, rise up, as a small
green snake uncoiled in haste and darted beneath Dam&rsquo;s approaching
upturned hand, and swiftly undulated across the lawn.
</p>

<p>
With a shriek that momentarily paralysed the gay throng, turned all eyes in his
direction, and brought the more cool and helpful running to the spot, Dam fell
writhing, struggling, and screaming to the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The SNAKE! The SNAKE!&rdquo; he howled, while tears gushed from his eyes
and he strove to dig his way into the ground for safety.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There it goes!&rdquo; squealed the fair Amelia pointing tragically.
Ladies duly squeaked, bunched their skirts tightly, jumped on chairs or sought
protection by the side of stalwart admirers.
</p>

<p>
Men cried &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; and gathered for battle. One sporting character
emitted an appalling &ldquo;View Halloo&rdquo; and there were a few
&ldquo;Yoicks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gone Aways&rdquo; to support his little
solecism. Lucille, rushing to Dam, encountered the fleeing reptile and with a
neat stroke of her putter ended its career.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, old chap,&rdquo; sneered Haddon Berners, as the
mad, convulsed, and foaming Dam screamed: &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s under my foot.
It&rsquo;s moving, moving, moving out</i>,&rdquo; and doubled up into a knot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Lucille has killed
it. Nothing to be terrified aboutâ€¦. Oh, chuck it, man! Get up and blow your
noseâ€¦.&rdquo; He was sent sprawling on his back as Lucille dropped by
Dam&rsquo;s side and strove to raise his face from the grass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come off it, Dam! You&rsquo;re very funny, we know,&rdquo; adjured the
sporting character, rather ashamed and discomfortable at seeing a brother man
behaving so. There are limits to acting the goat&mdash;especially with wimmin
about. Why couldn&rsquo;t Dam drop it?â€¦
</p>

<p>
Lucille was shocked and horrified to the innermost fibres of her being. Her
dignified, splendid Dam rolling on the ground, shrieking, sobbing, writhingâ€¦.
Ill or well, joke or seizure, it was horrible, unseemlyâ€¦. Why couldn&rsquo;t
the gaping fools be obliterated?â€¦
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dam, dear,&rdquo; she whispered in his ear, as she knelt over the
shuddering, gasping, sobbing man. &ldquo;What is it, Dam? Are you ill? Dam,
it&rsquo;s Lucilleâ€¦. The snake is quite dead, dear. I killed it. Are you
joking? Dam! <i>Dam</i>!&rdquo; â€¦
</p>

<p>
The stricken wretch screamed like a terrified child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t somebody fetch Dr. Jones if he&rsquo;s not here
yet,&rdquo; she wailed, turning to the mystified crowd of guests. &ldquo;Get
some water quickly, somebody, salts, brandy, anything! Oh, <i>do</i> go
away,&rdquo; and she deftly unfastened the collar of the spasm-wracked
sufferer. &ldquo;Haddon,&rdquo; she cried, looking up and seeing the grinning
Haddock, &ldquo;go straight for Dr. Jones. Cycle if you&rsquo;re afraid of
spoiling your clothes by riding. Quick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute,&rdquo; drawled the Haddock,
who did not relish a stiff ride along dusty roads in his choicest confection.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s playing the fool, I believe&mdash;or a bit scared at the
ferocious serpent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucille gave the youth a look that he never forgot, and turned to the sporting
person.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know the stables, Mr. Fellerton,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Would you
tell Pattern or somebody to send a man for Dr. Jones? Tell him to beat the
record.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sporting one sprinted toward the shrubbery which lay between the grounds
and the kitchen-gardens, beyond which were the stables.
</p>

<p>
Most people, with the better sort of mind, withdrew and made efforts to
recommence the interrupted games or to group themselves once more about the
lawns and marquees.
</p>

<p>
Others remained to make fatuous suggestions, to wonder, or merely to look on
with feelings approaching awe and fascination. There was something uncanny
here&mdash;a soldier and athlete weeping and screaming and going into fits at
the sight of a harmless grass-snake, probably a mere blind worm! Was he a
hysterical, neurotic coward, after all&mdash;a wretched decadent?
</p>

<p>
Poor Lucille suffered doubly&mdash;every pang, spasm, and contortion that shook
and wrung the body of her beloved, racked her own frame, and her mind was
tortured by fear, doubts, and agony. &ldquo;Oh, please go away, dear
people,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;It is a touch of sun. He is a little subject
to slight fits&mdash;very rarely and at long intervals, you know. He may never
have another.&rdquo; A few of the remaining onlookers backed away a little
shamefacedly. Others offered condolences while inwardly scoffing at the
&ldquo;sun&rdquo; explanation. Did not de Warrenne bowl, bat, or field,
bare-headed, throughout the summer&rsquo;s day without thinking of the sun? Who
had heard of the &ldquo;fits&rdquo; before? Why had they not transpired during
the last dozen years or so? &ldquo;Help me carry him indoors, somebody,&rdquo;
said the miserable, horrified Lucille. That would get rid of the silly staring
&ldquo;helpers&rdquo; anyhow&mdash;even if it brought matters to the notice of
Grumper, who frankly despised and detested any kind of sick person or invalid.
</p>

<p>
What would he say and do? What had happened to the glowing, glorious world that
five minutes ago was fairy-land and paradise? Was her Dam a wretched coward,
afraid of things, screaming like a girl at the sight of a common snake,
actually terrified into a fit? Better be a pick-pocket than aâ€¦. Into the
thinning, whispering circle came General Sir Gerald Seymour Stukeley,
apoplectically angry. Some silly fool, he understood, had fainted or
something&mdash;probably a puling tight-laced fool of a woman who starved
herself to keep slim. People who wanted to faint should stay and do it at
home&mdash;not come creating disturbances and interruptions at Monksmead
garden-partiesâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
And then he saw a couple of young men and Lucille striving to raise the
recumbent body of a man. The General snorted as snorts the wart-hog in love and
war, or the graceful hippopotamus in the river.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the Devil&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Some poor
fella fainted with the exertions of putting?&rdquo; A most bitter old
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Lucille turned to him and his fierce gaze fell upon the pale, contorted, and
tear-stained face of Dam.
</p>

<p>
The General flushed an even deeper purple, and the stick he held
perpendicularly slowly rose to horizontal, though he did not raise his hand.
</p>

<p>
He made a loud but wholly inarticulate sound.
</p>

<p>
Haddon Berners, enjoying himself hugely, volunteered the information.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He saw a little grass-snake and yelled out. Then he wept and fainted.
Coming round now. Got the funks, poor chap.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucille&rsquo;s hands closed (the thumbs correctly on the knuckles of the
second fingers), and, for a moment, it was in her heart to smite the Haddock on
the lying mouth with the straight-from-the-shoulder drive learned in days of
yore from Dam, and practised on the punching-ball with great assiduity.
Apparently the Haddock realized the fact for he skipped backward with agility.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is ill, Grumper dear,&rdquo; she said instead. &ldquo;He has had a
kind of fit. Perhaps he had sunstroke in India, and it has just affected him
now in the sunâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Grumper achieved the snort of his life.
</p>

<p>
It may have penetrated Dam&rsquo;s comatose brain, indeed, for at that moment,
with a moan and a shudder, he struggled to a sitting posture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Snake,&rdquo; he groaned, and collapsed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the Devil!&rdquo; roared the General. &ldquo;Get up, you miserable,
whining cur! Get indoors, you bottle-fed squalling workhouse brat! Get out of
it, you decayed gentlewoman!&rdquo; â€¦ The General bade fair to have a fit of
his own.
</p>

<p>
Lucille flung herself at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see he&rsquo;s very ill, Grumper? Have you no heart at
all? Don&rsquo;t be so cruel â€¦ and â€¦ stupid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The General gaspedâ€¦. Insults!â€¦ From a chit of a girl!â€¦ &ldquo;Ill!&rdquo; he
roared. &ldquo;What the Devil does he want to be ill for now, here, to-day? I
never â€¦&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam struggled to his feet with heroic efforts at self-mastery, and stood
swaying, twitching, trembling in every limb, and obviously in an agony of
terror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Snake!&rdquo; he said again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; barked General Stukeley. &ldquo;Been fighting forty
boa-constrictors, what? Just had a fearful struggle with five thousand fearful
pythons, what? There&rsquo;ll be another Victoria Cross in your family soon, if
you&rsquo;re not careful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are an unjust and cruel old man,&rdquo; stormed Lucille, stamping
her foot at the hitherto dread Grumper. &ldquo;He is ill, I tell you!
You&rsquo;ll be ill yourself someday. He had a fit. He&rsquo;ll be all right in
a minute. Let him go in and lie down. It wasn&rsquo;t the snake at all. There
wasn&rsquo;t any snake&mdash;where he was. He is just ill. He has been working
too hard. Let him go in and lie down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him go to the Devil,&rdquo; growled the infuriated General, and
turned to such few of the guests as had not displayed sufficient good sense and
good taste to go elsewhere and resume their interrupted games, tea, or scandal,
to remark:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really apologize most sincerely and earnestly for this ridiculous
scene. The boy should be in petticoats, apparently. I hope he won&rsquo;t
encounter a mouse or a beetle to-night. Let&rsquo;s all&mdash;er&mdash;come and
have a drink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lucille led her shaking and incoherent lover indoors and established him on a
sofa, had a fire lit for him as he appeared to be deathly cold, and sat holding
his clammy hand until the arrival of Dr. Jones.
</p>

<p>
As well as his chattering teeth and white frozen lips would allow, he begged
for forgiveness, for understanding. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t really wholly a
coward in essentials.&rdquo; â€¦
</p>

<p>
The girl kissed the contorted face and white lips passionately. Dr. Jones
prescribed bed and &ldquo;complete mental and bodily rest&rdquo;. He said he
would &ldquo;send something,&rdquo; and in a cloud of wise words disguised the
fact that he did not in the least know what to do. It was not in his experience
that a healthy young Hercules, sound as a bell, without spot or blemish, should
behave like an anaemic, neurotic girlâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Dam passed the night in the unnameable, ghastly hell of agony that he knew so
well and that he wondered to survive.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he received a note from Sir Gerald Seymour Stukeley. It was
brief and clear:&mdash;&ldquo;Sandhurst is scarcely the place for a squealing
coward, still less the Army. Nor is there room for one at Monksmead. I shall
not have the pleasure of seeing you before you catch the 11.15 train; I might
say things better left unsaid. I thank God you do not bear our name though you
have some of our blood. This will be the one grain of comfort when I think that
the whole County is gibing and jeering. No&mdash;your name is no more Seymour
Stukeley than is your nature. If you will favour my Solicitors with your
address, they will furnish you with an account of your patrimony and such
balance thereof as may remain&mdash;if any. But I believe you came to England
worth about fifty pounds&mdash;which you have probably spent as pocket-money. I
beg of you to communicate with me or my household in no way whatsoever.
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;G.S.S.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hastily dressing, Dam fled from the house on foot, empty handed and with no
money but a five-pound note legitimately his own private property. On his
dressing-table he left the cheque given to him by his &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo;
for ensuing Sandhurst expenses. Hiding in the station waiting-room, he awaited
the next train to London&mdash;with thoughts of recruiting-sergeants and the
Guards. From force of habit he travelled first-class, materially lessening his
five pounds. In the carriage, which he had to himself, he sat stunned. He was
rather angry than dismayed and appalled. He was like the soldier, cut down by a
sabre-slash or struck by a bullet, who, for a second, stares dully at the red
gash or blue hole&mdash;waiting for the blood to flow and the pain to commence.
</p>

<p>
He was numbed, emotionally dead, waiting the terrible awakening to the
realization that he had <i>lost Lucille</i>. What mattered the loss of home,
career, friends, honour&mdash;mere anti-climax to glance at it.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday!â€¦ To-day!
</p>

<p>
What was Lucille thinking? What would she do and say? Would she grow to hate
the coward who had dared to make love to her, dared to win her love!
</p>

<p>
Would she continue to love him in spite of all?
</p>

<p>
<i>I shall enjoy waiting twenty years for you</i>, she had said yesterday, and
<i>The world would be quite empty if you left it</i>. What would it be while he
remained in it a publicly disgraced coward? A coward ridiculed by the
effeminate, degenerate Haddock, who had no soul above club-ribbons, and no body
above a Piccadilly crawl!
</p>

<p>
Could she love him in spite of all? She was great-hearted enough for anything.
Perhaps for anything but that. To her, cowardice must be the last lowest depths
of degradation. Anyhow he had done the straight thing by Grumper, in leaving
the house without any attempt to let her know, to say farewell, to ask her to
believe in him for a while. If there had been any question as to the propriety
of his trying to become engaged to her when he was the penniless
gentleman-cadet, was there any question about it when he was the disgraced
out-cast, the publicly exposed coward?
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the London terminus he sought a recruiting-sergeant and, of course,
could not find one.
</p>

<p>
However, Canterbury and Cavalry were indissolubly connected in his mind, and it
had occurred to him that, in the Guards, he would run more risk of coming face
to face with people whom he knew than in any other corps. He would go for the
regiment he had known and loved in India (as he had been informed) and about
which he had heard much all his life. It was due for foreign service in a year
or two, and, so far as he knew, none of its officers had ever heard of him.
Ormonde Delorme was mad about it, but could not afford its expensive mess. Dam
had himself thought how jolly it would be if Grumper &ldquo;came down&rdquo;
sufficiently handsomely for him to be able to join it on leaving Sandhurst.
He&rsquo;d join it <i>now</i>!
</p>

<p>
He hailed a hansom and proceeded to Charing Cross, whence he booked for the
noble and ancient city of Canterbury.
</p>

<p>
Realizing that only one or two sovereigns would remain to him otherwise, he
travelled in a third-class carriage for the first time in his hitherto
luxurious life. Its bare discomfort and unpleasant occupants (one was a very
malodorous person indeed, and one a smoker of what smelt like old hats and
chair-stuffing in a rank clay pipe) brought home to him more clearly than
anything had done, the fact that he was a homeless, destitute person about to
sell his carcase for a shilling, and seek the last refuge of the out-of-work,
the wanted-by-the-police, the disgraced, and the runaway.
</p>

<p>
That carriage and its occupants showed him, in a blinding flash, that his whole
position, condition, outlook, future, and life were utterly and completely
changed.
</p>

<p>
He was Going Under. Had anybody else ever done it so quickly?â€¦
</p>

<p>
He went Under, and his entrance to the Underworld was through the great
main-gates of the depot of the Queen&rsquo;s Own (2nd) Regiment of Heavy
Cavalry, familiarly known as the Queen&rsquo;s Greys.

<h2><a name="chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
TROOPERS OF THE QUEEN.</h2>

<p class="center">
GLIMPSES OF CERTAIN &ldquo;POOR DEVILS&rdquo; AND THE HELL THEY
INHABITED.
</p>

<p>
The Queen&rsquo;s Own (2nd) Regiment of Heavy Cavalry (The Queen&rsquo;s Greys)
were under orders for India and the influence of great joy. That some of its
members were also under the influence of potent waters is perhaps a
platitudinous corollary.
</p>

<p>
â€¦ &ldquo;And phwat the Divvle&rsquo;s begone of me ould pal Patsy Flannigan, at
all, at all?&rdquo; inquired Trooper Phelim O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, entering the
barrack-room of E Troop of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys, lying at Shorncliffe Camp.
&ldquo;Divvle a shmell of the baste can I see, and me back from furlough-leaf
for minnuts. Has the schamer done the two-shtep widout anny flure, as
Oi&rsquo;ve always foretould? Is ut atin&rsquo; his vegetables by the roots he
now is in the bone-orchard, and me owing the poor bhoy foive shillin&rsquo;?
Where is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In &rsquo;orsepittle,&rdquo; laconically replied Trooper Henry Hawker,
late of Whitechapel, without looking up from the jack-boot he was polishing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Phwat wid?&rdquo; anxiously inquired the bereaved Phelim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot wiv&rsquo;? Wiv&rsquo; callin&rsquo; &lsquo;Threes abaht&rsquo;
after one o&rsquo; the Young Jocks,&rdquo;<a href="#fn16" name="fnref16" id="fnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
was the literal reply.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn16" id="fn16"></a> <a href="#fnref16">[16]</a>
A famous Hussar regiment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Begob that same must be a good hand wid his fisties&mdash;or was it a
shillaleigh?&rdquo; mused the Irishman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Eld the Helliot belt in Hinjer last year, they say,&rdquo;
continued the Cockney. &ldquo;<i>Good?</i> Not&rsquo;arf. I wouldn&rsquo;t go
an&rsquo; hinsult the bloke for the price of a pot. No. &rsquo;Erbert
&rsquo;Awker would not. (Chuck us yore button-stick, young &rsquo;Enery Bone.)
<i>Good?</i> &rsquo;E&rsquo;s a &rsquo;Oly Terror&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know
as there&rsquo;s a man in the Queen&rsquo;s Greys as could put &rsquo;im to
sleep&mdash;not unless it&rsquo;s Matthewson,&rdquo; and here Trooper Herbert
Hawker jerked his head in the direction of Trooper Damocles de Warrenne
(<i>alias</i> D. Matthewson) who, seated on his truckle-bed, was engaged in
breathing hard, and rubbing harder, upon a brass helmet from which he had
unscrewed a black horse-hair plume.
</p>

<p>
Dam, arrayed in hob-nailed boots, turned-up overalls &ldquo;authorized for
grooming,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;grey-back&rdquo; shirt, looked indefinably a
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Herbert Hawker, in unlaced gymnasium shoes, &ldquo;leathers,&rdquo; and
a brown sweater (warranted not to show the dirt), looked quite definably what
he was, a Commercial Road ruffian; and his foreheadless face, greasy cow-lick
&ldquo;quiff&rdquo; (or fringe), and truculent expression, inspired more
disgust than confidence in the beholder.
</p>

<p>
His reference to Dam as the only likely champion of the Heavy Cavalry against
the Hussar was a tribute to the tremendous thrashing he had received from
&ldquo;Trooper D. Matthewson&rdquo; when the same had become necessary after a
long course of unresented petty annoyance. Hawker was that very rare creature,
a boaster, who made good, a bully of great courage and determination, and a
loud talker, who was a very active doer; and the battle had been a terrible
one.
</p>

<p>
The weary old joke of having a heavy valise pulled down on to one&rsquo;s
upturned face from the shelf above, by means of a string, as one sleeps, Dam
had taken in good part. Being sent to the Rough-Riding Sergeant-Major for the
&ldquo;Key of the Half Passage&rdquo; by this senior recruit, he did not mind
in the least (though he could have kicked himself for his gullibility when he
learned that the &ldquo;Half Passage&rdquo; is not a place, but a Riding-School
manoeuvre, and escaped from the bitter tongue of the incensed
autocrat&mdash;called untimely from his tea! How the man had <i>bristled</i>.
Hair, eyebrows, moustache, buttons even&mdash;the Rough-Riding Sergeant-Major
had been rough indeed, and had done his riding rough-shod over the wretched
lad).
</p>

<p>
Being instructed to &ldquo;go and get measured for his hoof-picker&rdquo; Dam
had not resented, though he had considered it something of an insult to his
intelligence that Hawker should expect to &ldquo;have&rdquo; him so easily as
that. He had taken in good part the arrangement of his bed in such a way that
it collapsed and brought a pannikin of water down with it, and on to it, in the
middle of a cold night. He had received with good humour, and then with silent
contempt, the names of &ldquo;Gussie the Bank Clurk,&rdquo; references to
&ldquo;broken-dahn torfs&rdquo; and &ldquo;tailor&rsquo;s bleedn&rsquo;
dummies,&rdquo; queries as to the amount of &ldquo;time&rdquo; he had got for
the offence that made him a &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Hard Bargain,&rdquo; and
various the other pleasantries whereby Herbert showed his distaste for people
whose accent differed from his own, and whose tastes were unaccountable.
</p>

<p>
Dam had borne these things because he was certain he could thrash the silly
animal when the time came, and because he had a wholesome dread of the
all-too-inevitable military &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; (one of which fighting
is&mdash;as subversive of good order and military discipline).
</p>

<p>
It had come, however, and for Dam this exotic of the Ratcliffe Highway had
thereafter developed a vast admiration and an embarrassing affection. It was a
most difficult matter to avoid his companionship when &ldquo;walking-out&rdquo;
and also to avoid hurting his feelings.
</p>

<p>
It was a humiliating and chastening experience to the man, who had supported
himself by boxing in booths at fairs and show-grounds, to find this
&ldquo;bloomin&rsquo; dook of a &lsquo;Percy,&rsquo;&rdquo; this
&ldquo;lah-de-dar &lsquo;Reggie&rsquo;&rdquo; who looked askance at good
bread-and-dripping, this finnicky &ldquo;Clarence&rdquo; without a
&ldquo;bloody&rdquo; to his conversation, this &ldquo;blasted, up-the-pole<a href="#fn17" name="fnref17" id="fnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
&lsquo;Cecil&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;a man with a quicker guard, a harder punch, a
smarter ring-craft, a better wind, and a tougher appetite for
&ldquo;gruel&rdquo; than himself.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn17" id="fn17"></a> <a href="#fnref17">[17]</a>
Teetotal.
</p>

<p>
The occasion was furnished by a sad little experience.
</p>

<p>
Poor drunken Trooper Bear (once the Honourable MacMahon FitzUrse), kindliest,
weakest, gentlest of gentlemen, had lurched one bitter soaking night (or early
morning) into the barrack-room, singing in a beautiful tenor:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Menez-moi&rdquo; dit la belle,<br/>
&ldquo;A la rive fidÃ¨le<br/>
OÃ¹ l&rsquo;on aime toujours.&rdquo;<br/>
â€¦&mdash;&ldquo;Cette rive ma chÃ¨re<br/>
On ne la connait guÃ¨re<br/>
Au pays des amours.&rdquo;â€¦.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Herbert Hawker had no appreciation for Theophile Gautier&mdash;or
perhaps none for being awakened from his warm slumbers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere! stow that blarsted catawaulin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he roared, with
a choice selection from the Whitechapel tongue, in which he requested the
adjectived noun to be adverbially &ldquo;quick about it, too&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
With a beatific smile upon his weak handsome face, Trooper Bear staggered
toward the speaker, blew him a kiss, and, in a vain endeavour to seat himself
upon the cot, collapsed upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re aâ€¦.&rdquo; (adverbially adjectived noun) shouted Hawker.
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a man, you&rsquo;re aâ€¦.&rdquo; &ldquo;
&#963;&#954;&#953;&#8118;&#962; &#8004;&#957;&#945;&#961;
&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;&rdquo; â€¦ &ldquo;Man is the
dream of a shadow,&rdquo; suggested Bear dreamily with a hiccupâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;yer know where you <i>are</i>, you â€¦&rdquo; roared Hawker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Heart, I am in hell,&rdquo; replied the recumbent one, &ldquo;but
by the Mercy of God I&rsquo;m splendidly drunk. Yes, hell. &lsquo;<i>Lasciate
ogni speranza,</i>&rsquo; sweet Amaryllis. I am Morag of the Misty Way.
<i>Mos&rsquo;</i> misty. Milky Way. Yesh. Milk Punchy Way.&rdquo; â€¦
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you all the <i>punch</i> you&rsquo;ll want, in abaht two
ticks if you don&rsquo;t chuck it&mdash;you blarsted edjucated flea,&rdquo;
warned Hawker, half rising.
</p>

<p>
Dam got up and pulled on his cloak preparatory to helping the o&rsquo;er-taken
one to bed, as a well-aimed ammunition boot took the latter nearly on the ear.
</p>

<p>
Struggling to his feet with the announcement that he was &ldquo;the
King&rsquo;s fair daughter, weighed in the balance and found&mdash;devilish
heavy and very drunk,&rdquo; the unhappy youth lurched and fell upon the
outraged Hawker&mdash;who struck him a cruel blow in the face.
</p>

<p>
At the sound of the blow and heavy fall, Dam turned, saw the blood&mdash;and
went Stukeley-mad. Springing like a tiger upon Hawker he dragged him from his
cot and knocked him across it. In less than a minute he had twice sent him to
the boards, and it took half-a-dozen men on either side to separate the
combatants and get them to postpone the finish till the morning. That night Dam
dreamed his dream and, on the morrow, behind the Riding-School, and in fifteen
rounds, became, by common consent, champion bruiser of the Queen&rsquo;s
Greys&mdash;by no ambition of his own.
</p>

<p>
And so&mdash;as has been said&mdash;Trooper Henry Hawker ungrudgingly referred
Trooper Phelim O&rsquo;Shaughnessy to him in the matter of reducing the pride
of the Young Jock who had dared to &ldquo;desthroy&rdquo; a dragoon.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Phelim O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&mdash;in perfect-fitting glove-tight scarlet
stable-jacket (that never went near a stable, being in fact the smart
shell-jacket, shaped like an Eton coat, sacred to &ldquo;walking-out&rdquo;
purposes), dark blue overalls with broad white stripe, strapped over
half-wellington boots adorned with glittering swan-neck spurs, a pill-box cap
with white band and button, perched jauntily on three hairs&mdash;also looked
what he was, the ideal heavy-cavalry man, the swaggering, swashbuckling
trooper, <i>beau sabreur</i>, good all round and all throughâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
The room in which these worthies and various others (varying also in dress,
from shirt and shorts to full review-order for Guard) had their being,
expressed the top note and last cry&mdash;or the lowest note and deepest
groan&mdash;of bleak, stark utilitarianism. Nowhere was there hint or sign of
grace and ornament. Bare deal-plank floor, bare white-washed walls, plank and
iron truckle beds, rough plank and iron trestle tables, rough plank and iron
benches, rough plank and iron boxes clamped to bedsteads, all bore the same
uniform impression of useful ugliness, ugly utility. The apologist in search of
a solitary encomium might have called it clean&mdash;save around the hideous
closed stove where muddy boots, coal-dust, pipe-dottels, and the bitter-end of
five-a-penny &ldquo;gaspers&rdquo;<a href="#fn18" name="fnref18" id="fnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> rebuked his rashness.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn18" id="fn18"></a> <a href="#fnref18">[18]</a>
Cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
A less inviting, less inspiring, less home-like room for human habitation could
scarce be found outside a jail. Perhaps this was the less inappropriate in that
a jail it was, to a small party of its occupants&mdash;born and bred to better
things.
</p>

<p>
The eye was grateful even for the note of cheer supplied by the red cylindrical
valise on the shelf above each cot, and by the occasional scarlet tunic and
stable-jacket. But for these it had been, to the educated eye, an even more
grim, grey, depressing, beauty-and-joy-forsaken place than it wasâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Dam (<i>alias</i> Trooper D. Matthewson) placed the gleaming helmet upon his
callous straw-stuffed pillow, carefully rubbed the place where his hand had
last touched it, and then took from a peg his scarlet tunic with its white
collar, shoulder-straps and facings. Having satisfied himself that to burnish
further its glittering buttons would be to gild refined gold, he commenced a
vigorous brushing&mdash;for it was now his high ambition to &ldquo;get the
stick&rdquo;&mdash;in other words to be dismissed from guard-duty as reward for
being the best-turned-out man on paradeâ€¦. As he reached up to his shelf for his
gauntlets and pipe-clay box, Trooper Phelim O&rsquo;Shaughnessy swaggered over
with much jingle of spur and playfully smote him, netherly, with his cutting
whip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What-ho, me bhoy,&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;and how&rsquo;s me natty
Matty&mdash;the natest foightin&rsquo; man in E Troop, which is sayin&rsquo; in
all the Dhraghoons, which is sayin&rsquo; in all the Arrmy! How&rsquo;s
Matty?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Extant,&rdquo; replied Dam. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Shocky, the biggest liar
in the same?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he extended his hand it was noticeable that it was much smaller than the
hand of the smaller man to whom it was offered. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have to plug
and desthroy the schamin&rsquo; divvle that strook poor Patsy Flannigan,
Matty,&rdquo; said the Irishman. &ldquo;Ye must bate the sowl out of the baste
before we go to furrin&rsquo; parts. Loife is uncertain an&rsquo; ye moight
never come back to do ut, which the Holy Saints forbid&mdash;an&rsquo; the
Hussars troiumphin&rsquo; upon our prosprit coorpses. For the hanner an&rsquo;
glory av all Dhraghoons, of the Ould Seconds, and of me pore bed-ridden frind,
Patsy Flannigan, ye must go an&rsquo; plug the wicked scutt, Matty
darlint.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was Flannigan&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; replied Dam, daubing pipe-clay on
the huge cuff of a gauntlet which he had drawn on to a weird-looking wooden
hand, sacred to the purposes of glove-drying. &ldquo;He got beastly drunk and
insulted a better man than himself by insulting his Corps&mdash;or trying to.
He called a silly lie after a total stranger and got what he deserved. He
shouldn&rsquo;t seek sorrow if he doesn&rsquo;t want to find it, and he
shouldn&rsquo;t drink liquor he can&rsquo;t carry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the Young Jock beat Patsy when drunk, did he?&rdquo; murmured
O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, in tones of awed wonder. &ldquo;I riverince the man, for
there&rsquo;s few can beat him sober. Knocked Patsy into hospital an&rsquo; him
foightin&rsquo; dhrunk! Faith, he must be another Oirish gintleman himself,
indade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Scotchman and was middle-weight champion of India last
year,&rdquo; rejoined Dam, and moistened his block of pipe-clay again in the
most obvious, if least genteel, way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Annyhow he&rsquo;s a mere Hussar and must be rimonsthrated wid for
darin&rsquo; to assault and batther a Dhraghoon&mdash;an&rsquo; him dhrunk,
poor bhoy. Say the wurrud, Matty. We&rsquo;ll lay for the spalpeen, the whole
of E Troop, at the <i>Ring o&rsquo; Bells</i>, an&rsquo; whin he shwaggers in
like he was a Dhraghoon an&rsquo; a sodger, ye&rsquo;ll up an&rsquo; say
<i>&lsquo;Threes about&rsquo;</i> an&rsquo; act accordin&rsquo; subsequint,
an&rsquo; learn the baste not to desthroy an&rsquo; insult his betthers of the
Ould Second. Thread on the tail of his coat, Mattyâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I had anything to do with it at all I&rsquo;d tread on
Flannigan&rsquo;s coat, and you can tell him so, for disgracing the Corpsâ€¦.
Take off your jacket and help with my boots, Shocky. I&rsquo;m for
Guard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oi&rsquo;d clane the boots of no man that ud demane himself to ax
it,&rdquo; was the haughty reply of the disappointed warrior. &ldquo;Not for
less than a quart at laste,&rdquo; he amended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A quart it is,&rdquo; answered Dam, and O&rsquo;Shaughnessy speedily
divested himself of his stable-jacket, incidentally revealing the fact that he
had pawned his shirt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have got your teeth ready, then?&rdquo; observed Dam, noting the
underlying bareness&mdash;and thereby alluded to O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s
habit of pawning his false teeth after medical inspection and redeeming them in
time for the next, at the cost of his underclothing&mdash;itself redeemed in
turn by means of the teeth. Having been compelled to provide himself with a
&ldquo;plate&rdquo; he invariably removed the detested contrivance and placed
it beside him when sitting down to meals (on those rare occasions when he and
not his &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; was the arbiter of its destinies)â€¦.
</p>

<p>
A young and important Lance-Corporal, a shocking tyrant and bully, strode into
the room, his sword clanking. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy arose and respectfully drew
him aside, offering him a &ldquo;gasper&rdquo;. They were joined by a lean
hawk-faced individual answering to the name of Fish, who said he had been in
the American navy until buried alive at sea for smiling within sight of the
quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; he was heard to say to some statement of
O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hatch a five-bunch frame-up to
put the eternal kibosh on the tuberous spotty&mdash;souled skunklet. Some.
We&rsquo;ll make him wise to whether a tippy, chew-the-mop, bandy-legged,
moke-monkey can come square-pushing, and with his legs out, down <i>this</i>
side-walk, before we ante out. Some.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Yus,&rdquo; agreed the Lance-Corporal. &ldquo;Damned if I
wouldn&rsquo;t chawnce me arm<a href="#fn19" name="fnref19" id="fnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
and go fer &rsquo;im meself before we leave&mdash;on&rsquo;y I&rsquo;m
expectin&rsquo; furver permotion afore long. But fer that I&rsquo;d take it up
meself&rdquo;&mdash;and he glanced at Dam.
</p>

When a non-commissioned officer does anything to risk losing his stripes he
says he &ldquo;chances his arm&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ketch the little swine at it,&rdquo; remarked Trooper Herbert Hawker, as
loudly as he dared, to his &ldquo;towny,&rdquo; Trooper Henry Bone.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Chawnst &rsquo;is arm!&rsquo; It&rsquo;s &rsquo;is bloomin&rsquo;
life &rsquo;e&rsquo;d chawnce if that Young Jock got settin&rsquo; abaht
&rsquo;im. Not &rsquo;arf!&rdquo; and the exotic of the Ratcliffe Highway added
most luridly expressed improprieties anent the origins of the Lance-Corporal,
his erstwhile enemy and, now, superior officer, in addition.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Dam shortly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yep. Quit those low-browed sounds, guttermut, or I&rsquo;ll get mad all
over,&rdquo; agreed Fish, whose marvellous vocabulary included no foul words.
There was no need for them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hi halso was abaht ter request you not to talk beastial, Mr.
&rsquo;Erbert &rsquo;Awker,&rdquo; chimed in Trooper &ldquo;Henery&rdquo; Bone,
anxious to be on the side of the saints. &ldquo;Oo&rsquo;d taike you to be the
Missin&rsquo; Hair of a noble &rsquo;ouse when you do
such&mdash;&lsquo;Missin&rsquo; Hair!&rsquo; <i>Missin&rsquo; Link</i> more
like,&rdquo; he added with spurious indignation.
</p>

<p>
The allusion was to the oft-expressed belief of Trooper Herbert Hawker, a
belief that became a certainty and subject for bloodshed and battle after the
third quart or so, that there was a mystery about his birth.
</p>

<p>
There was, according to his reputed papaâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
The plotters plotted, and Dam completed the burnishing of his arms, spurs,
buckles, and other glittering metal impedimenta (the quantity of which earned
the Corps its barrack-room soubriquet of &ldquo;the Polish Its&rdquo;),
finished the flicking of spots of pipe-clay from his uniform, and dressed for
Guard.
</p>

<p>
Being ready some time before he had to parade, he sat musing on his
truckle-bed.
</p>

<p>
What a life! What associates (outside the tiny band of gentlemen-rankers). What
cruel awful <i>publicity</i> of existence&mdash;that was the worst of all. Oh,
for a private room and a private coat, and a meal in solitude! Some place of
one&rsquo;s own, where one could express one&rsquo;s own individuality in the
choice and arrangement of property, and impress it upon one&rsquo;s
environment.
</p>

<p>
One could not even think in private here.
</p>

<p>
And he was called a <i>private</i> soldier! A grim joke indeed, when the crying
need of one&rsquo;s soul was a little privacy.
</p>

<p>
A <i>private</i> soldier!
</p>

<p>
Well&mdash;and what of the theory of Compensations, that all men get the same
sum-total of good and bad, that position is really immaterial to happiness?
What of the theory that more honour means also more responsibility and worry,
that more pay also means more expenses and a more difficult position, that more
seniority also means less youth and joy&mdash;that Fate only robs Peter to pay
Paul, and, when bestowing a blessing with one hand, invariably bestows a curse
with the other?
</p>

<p>
Too thin.
</p>

<p>
Excellent philosophy for the butterfly upon the road, preaching contentment to
the toad, who, beneath the harrow, knows exactly where each tooth-point goes.
Let the butterfly come and try it.
</p>

<p>
<i>What</i> a life!
</p>

<p>
Not so bad at first, perhaps, for a stout-hearted, hefty sportsman, during
recruit days when everything is novel, there is something to learn, time is
fully occupied, and one is too busy to think, too busy evading strange
pit-falls, and the just or (more often) unjust wrath of the Room Corporal, the
Squadron Orderly Sergeant, the Rough-Riding Corporal, the Squadron
Sergeant-Major, the Rough-Riding Sergeant-Major, the Regimental Sergeant-Major,
the Riding-Master.
</p>

<p>
But when, to the passed &ldquo;dismissed soldier,&rdquo; everything is familiar
and easy, weary, flat, stale and unprofitable?
</p>

<p>
The (to one gently nurtured) ghastly food, companions, environment,
monotony&mdash;the ghastly ambitions!
</p>

<p>
Fancy an educated gentleman&rsquo;s ambitions and horizon narrowed to a
good-conduct &ldquo;ring,&rdquo; a stripe in the far future (and to be a
Lance-Corporal with far more duty and no more pay, in the hope of becoming a
Corporal&mdash;that comfortable rank with the same duty and much more pay, and
little of the costly gold-lace to mount, and heavy expenses to assume that,
while putting the gilt on, takes it off, the position of Sergeant); and, for
the present, to &ldquo;keep off the peg,&rdquo; not to be &ldquo;for it,&rdquo;
to &ldquo;get the stick,&rdquo; for smartest turn-out, to avoid the
Red-Caps,<a href="#fn20" name="fnref20" id="fnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> to
achieve an early place in the scrimmage at the corn-bin and to get the correct
amount of two-hundred pounds in the corn-sack when drawing forage and corn; to
placate Troop Sergeants, the Troop Sergeant-Major and Squadron Sergeant-Major;
to have a suit of mufti at some safe place outside and to escape from the
branding searing scarlet occasionally; possibly even the terrible ambition to
become an Officer&rsquo;s servant so as to have a suit of mufti as a right, and
a chance of becoming Mess-Sergeant and then Quarter-Master, and perhaps of
getting an Honorary Commission without doing a single parade or guard after
leaving the troop!â€¦

<p>
What a life for a man of breeding and refinement!â€¦ Fancy having to remember the
sacred and immeasurable superiority of a foul-mouthed Lance-Corporal who might
well have been your own stable-boy, a being who can show you a deeper depth of
hell in Hell, wreak his dislike of you in unfair &ldquo;fatigues,&rdquo; and
keep you at the detested job of coal-drawing on Wednesdays; who can achieve a
&ldquo;canter past the beak&rdquo;<a href="#fn21" name="fnref21" id="fnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
for you on a trumped-up charge and land you in the &ldquo;digger,&rdquo;<a href="#fn22" name="fnref22" id="fnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
who can bring it home to you in a thousand ways that you are indeed the toad
beneath the harrow. Fancy having to remember, night and day, that a Sergeant,
who can perhaps just spell and cypher, is a monarch to be approached in
respectful spirit; that the Regimental Sergeant-Major, perhaps coarse, rough,
and ignorant, is an emperor to be approached with fear and trembling; that a
Subaltern, perhaps at school with you, is a god not to be approached at all.
Fancy looking forward to being &ldquo;branded with a blasted worsted
spur,&rdquo; and, as a Rough-Riding Corporal, receiving a forfeit tip from each
young officer who knocks off his cap with his lance in Riding-Schoolâ€¦.

Well! One takes the rough with the smooth&mdash;but perceives with great
clearness that the (very) rough predominates, and that one does not recommend a
gentleman to enlist, save when a Distinguished Relative with Influence has an
early Commission ready in his pocket for him.
</p>

<p>
Lacking the Relative, the gently-nurtured man, whether he win to a Commission
eventually or not, can only do one thing more rash than enlist in the British
Army, and that is enlist in the French Foreign Legion.
</p>

<p>
Discipline for soul and body? The finest thing in all the world&mdash;in
reason. But the discipline of the tram-horse, of the blinded bullock at the
wheel, of the well-camel, of the galley-slave&mdash;meticulous, puerile,
unending, unchanging, impossible â€¦? Necessary perhaps, once upon a
time&mdash;but hard on the man of brains, sensibility, heart, and
individuality.
</p>

<p>
Soul and body? Deadly for the soul&mdash;and fairly dangerous for the body in
the Cavalry Regiment whose riding-master prefers the abominable stripped-saddle
training to the bare-backedâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Dam yawned and looked at the tin clock on the shelf above the cot of the Room
Corporal. Half an hour yetâ€¦. Did time drag more heavily anywhere in the world?â€¦
</p>

<p>
His mind roamed back over his brief, age-long life in the Queen&rsquo;s Greys
and passed it in review.
</p>

<p>
The interview with the Doctor, the Regimental Sergeant-Major, the Adjutant, the
Colonel&mdash;the Oath on the Bible before that dread Supermanâ€¦. How well he
remembered his brief exordium&mdash;&ldquo;Obey your Superiors blindly; serve
your Queen, Country, and Regiment to the best of your ability; keep clean,
don&rsquo;t drink, fear God, and&mdash;most important of all&mdash;take care of
your horse. <i>Take care of your horse</i>, d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Also the drawled remark of the Adjutant afterwards,
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;what&mdash;ah&mdash;University?&rdquo;&mdash;his own prompt
reply of &ldquo;Whitechapel, sir,&rdquo; and the Adjutant&rsquo;s approving
&ldquo;Exactlyâ€¦. You&rsquo;ll get on here by good conduct, good riding, and
good drill&mdash;not by&mdash;ah&mdash;good accent or anything else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
How well he remembered the strange depolarized feeling consequent upon
realizing that his whole worldly possessions consisted in three
&ldquo;grey-back&rdquo; shirts, two pairs of cotton pants, two pairs of woollen
socks, a towel; a hold-all containing razor, shaving-brush, spoon, knife and
fork, and a button-stick; a cylindrical valise with hair-brush, clothes-brush,
brass-brush, and boot-brushes; a whip, burnisher, and dandy-brush (all three,
for some reason, to be paid for as part of a &ldquo;free&rdquo; kit);
jack-boots and jack-spurs, wellington-boots and swan-neck box-spurs, ammunition
boots; a tin of blacking and another of plate powder; blue, white-striped
riding-breeches, blue, white-striped overalls, drill-suit of blue serge,
scarlet tunic, scarlet stable-jacket, scarlet drill &ldquo;frock,&rdquo; a pair
of trousers of lamentable cut &ldquo;authorized for grooming,&rdquo; brass
helmet with black horse-hair plume, blue pill-box cap with white stripe and
button, gauntlets and gloves, sword-belt and pouch-belt, a carbine and a sword.
Also of a daily income of one loaf, butter, tea, and a pound of meat (often
uneatable), and the sum of one shilling and twopence subject to a deduction of
threepence a day &ldquo;mess-fund,&rdquo; fourpence a month for delft, and
divers others for library, washing, hair-cutting, barrack-damages, etc.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it had given one a strange feeling of nakedness, and yet of a freedom from
the tyranny of things, to find oneself so meagrely and yet so sufficiently
endowed.
</p>

<p>
Then, the strange, lost, homeless feeling that Home is nothing but a cot and a
box in a big bare barrack-room, that the whole of God&rsquo;s wide Universe
contains no private and enclosed spot that is one&rsquo;s own peculiar place
wherein to be alone&mdash;at first a truly terrible feeling.
</p>

<p>
How one envied the Rough-Riding Sergeant-Major his Staff Quarters&mdash;without
going so far as to envy the great Riding-Master his real separate and detached
house!
</p>

<p>
No privacy&mdash;and a scarlet coat that encarnadined the world and made its
wearer feel, as he so often thought, like a live coal glowing bright in Hell.
</p>

<p>
Surely the greatest of all an officer&rsquo;s privileges was his right of
mufti, his daily escape from the burning cloth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why does not the British officer wear his uniform always?&rdquo; writes
the perennial gratuitous ass to the Press, periodically in the Silly Seasonâ€¦.
Dam could tell him.
</p>

<p>
Memories â€¦!
</p>

<p>
Being jerked violently from uneasy slumber and broken, vivid dreams at 5 a.m.,
by the thunderous banging of the Troop Sergeant&rsquo;s whip on the table, and
his raucous roar of &ldquo;Tumble out, you lazy swine, before you get
sunstroke! Rise and shine! Rise and shine, you tripe-hounds!&rdquo; â€¦ Broken
dreams on a smelly, straw-stuffed pillow and lumpy straw-stuffed pallet, dreams
of &ldquo;<i>Circle and cha-a-a-a-a-a-a-nge&rdquo; &ldquo;On the Fore-hand,
Right About&rdquo; &ldquo;Right Pass, Shoulder Out&rdquo;
&ldquo;Serpentine&rdquo; &ldquo;Order Lance&rdquo; &ldquo;Trail Lance&rdquo;
&ldquo;Right Front Thrust&rdquo;</i> (for the front rank of the Queen&rsquo;s
Greys carry lances); dreams of riding wild mad horses to unfathomable
precipices and at unsurmountable barriersâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Memories â€¦!
</p>

<p>
His first experience of &ldquo;mucking out&rdquo; stables at five-thirty on a
chilly morning&mdash;doing horrible work, horribly clad, feeling horribly sick.
Wheeling away intentionally and maliciously over-piled barrows to the
muck-pits, upsetting them, and being cursed.
</p>

<p>
Being set to water a notoriously wild and vicious horse, and being pulled about
like a little dog at the end of the chain, burning into frozen fingers.
</p>

<p>
Not much of the glamour and glow and glory left!
</p>

<p>
Better were the interesting and amusing experiences of the Riding-School where
his trained and perfected hands and seat gave him a tremendous advantage, an
early dismissal, and some amelioration of the roughness of one of the very
roughest experiences in a very rough life.
</p>

<p>
Even he, though, knew what it was to have serge breeches sticking to abraided
bleeding knees, to grip a stripped saddle with twin suppurating sores, and to
burrow face-first in filthy tan <i>via</i> the back of a stripped-saddled
buck-jumper. How he had pitied some of the other recruits, making their first
acquaintance with the Trooper&rsquo;s &ldquo;long-faced chum&rdquo; under the
auspices of a pitiless, bitter-tongued Rough-Riding Sergeant-Major!
<i>Rough!</i> What a character the fellow was! Never an oath, never a foul
word, but what a vocabulary and gift of invective, sarcasm and cruel stinging
reproof! A well-educated man if not a gentleman. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dismount
again, Muggins&mdash;or is it Juggins?&mdash;without permission&rdquo; when
some poor fellow comes on his head as his horse (bare of saddle and bridle)
refuses at a jump. &ldquo;Get up (and SIT BACK) you&mdash;you&mdash;hen, you
pierrot, you <i>Aard Vark,</i> you after-thought, you refined entertainer, you
pimple, you performing water-rat, you mistake, you <i>byle</i>, you drip, you
worm-powderâ€¦. What? You think your leg&rsquo;s broken?
Well&mdash;<i>you&rsquo;ve got another</i>, haven&rsquo;t you? Get up and break
that. Keep your neck till you get a stripped saddle and no reinsâ€¦. Don&rsquo;t
embrace the horse like that, you pawn-shop, I can hear it blushingâ€¦. Send for
the key and get inside itâ€¦. Keep those fine feet forward. Keep them
<i>forward</i> (and SIT BACK), Juggins or Muggins, or else take them into the
Infantry&mdash;what they were meant for by the look of them. Now
then&mdash;over you go without falling if I have to keep you here all nightâ€¦.
Look at <i>that</i>&rdquo; (as the poor fellow is thrown across the jump by the
cunning brute that knows its rider has neither whip, spurs, saddle nor reins).
&ldquo;What? The <i>horse</i> refuse? One of <i>my</i> horses <i>refuse? If the
man&rsquo;ll jump, the horse&rsquo;ll jump.</i> (All of you repeat that after
me and don&rsquo;t forget it.) No. It&rsquo;s the <i>man</i> refuses, not the
poor horse. Don&rsquo;t you know the ancient proverb &lsquo;Faint heart
ne&rsquo;er took fair jump&rsquo;â€¦.? What&rsquo;s the good of coming here if
your heart&rsquo;s the size of your eye-ball instead of being the size of your
fist? <i>Refuse?</i> Put him over it, man. <i>Put</i> him over&mdash;SIT BACK
and lift him, and <i>put</i> him over. I&rsquo;ll give you a thousand pounds if
he refuses <i>me</i>â€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then the day when poor bullied, baited, nervous Muggins had reached his limit
and come to the end of his tether&mdash;or thought he had. Bumped, banged,
bucketed, thrown, sore from head to foot, raw-kneed, laughed at, lashed by the
Rough-Riding Sergeant-Major&rsquo;s cruel tongue, blind and sick with dust and
pain and rage, he had at last turned his horse inward from his place in the
ride to the centre of the School, and dismounted.
</p>

<p>
How quaintly the tyrant&rsquo;s jaw had dropped in sheer astonishment, and how
his face had purpled with rage when he realized that his eyes had not deceived
him and that the worm had literally turned&mdash;without orders.
</p>

<p>
Indian, African, and Egyptian service, disappointment, and a bad wife had left
Rough-Riding Sergeant-Major Blount with a dangerous temper.
</p>

<p>
Poor silly Muggins. He had been Juggins indeed on that occasion, and, as the
&ldquo;ride&rdquo; halted of its own accord in awed amazement, Dam had longed
to tell him so and beg him to return to his place ere worse befellâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad enough, you bull-&rsquo;eaded brute,&rdquo; shouted
poor Muggins, leaving his horse and advancing menacingly upon his
(incalculably) superior officer, &ldquo;an&rsquo; fer two damns I&rsquo;d break
yer b&mdash;&mdash; jaw, I would. You â€¦&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Even as the Rough-Riding Corporal and two other men were dragging the
struggling, raving recruit to the door, <i>en route</i> for the Guard-room,
entered the great remote, dread Riding-Master himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; inquired Hon. Captain Style, Riding-Master of
the Queen&rsquo;s Greys, strict, kind-hearted martinet.
</p>

<p>
Salute, and explanations from the Rough-Riding Sergeant-Major.
</p>

<p>
Torrent of accusation and incoherent complaint and threat from the baited
Muggins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mount that horse,&rdquo; says the Riding-Master.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Clink first,&rdquo; gasps Muggins. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
to &rsquo;Ell first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. <i>Afterwards,</i>&rdquo; replies the Riding-Master and sends the
Rough-Riding Corporal for the backboard&mdash;dread instrument of equestrian
persuasion.
</p>

<p>
Muggins is forcibly mounted, put in the lunging ring and sent round and round
till he throws himself off at full gallop and lies crying and sobbing like a
child&mdash;utterly broken.
</p>

<p>
Riding-Master smiles, allows Muggins to grow calmer, accepts his apologies and
promises, shows him he has had his Hell <i>after</i>, as promised, and that it
is a better punishment than one that leaves him with a serious
&ldquo;crime&rdquo; entry on his Defaulter&rsquo;s Sheet for lifeâ€¦. That vile
and damning sheet that records the youthful peccadilloes and keeps it a
life-long punishment after its own severe punishmentâ€¦. To the Rough-Riding
Sergeant-Major he quietly remarks: &ldquo;No good non-com <i>makes</i> crimes â€¦
and don&rsquo;t forget that the day of riding-school brutality is passing. You
can carry a man further than you can kick him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the interrupted lesson continues.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit <i>back</i> and you can&rsquo;t come off. Nobody falls off
backwards.&rdquo; â€¦
</p>

<p>
Poor &ldquo;Old Sit-Back&rdquo;! (as he was called from his constant
cry)&mdash;after giving that order and guarantee daily for countless
days&mdash;was killed in the riding-school by coming off backwards from the
stripped saddle of a rearing horse&mdash;(which promptly fell upon him and
crushed his chest)&mdash;that had never reared before and would not have reared
then, it was said, but for the mysterious introduction, under its saddle, of a
remarkably &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; body.
</p>

<p>
Memories â€¦!
</p>

<p>
How certain old &ldquo;Sit-Back&rdquo; had been that Dam was a worthless
&ldquo;back-to-the-Army-again&rdquo; when he found him a finished horseman, an
extraordinarily expert swordsman, and a master of the lance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t old enough for a &lsquo;time-expired,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
mused, &ldquo;nor for a cashiered officer. One of the professional
&lsquo;enlist-desert-and-sell-me-kit,&rsquo; I suppose. Anyhow you&rsquo;ll do
time for one of the three if <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t approve of yeâ€¦. You&rsquo;ve
been in the Cavalry before. Lancer regiment, too. Don&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>
lies â€¦ but see to it that I&rsquo;m satisfied with your conduct.
Gentlemen-rankers are better in their proper place&mdash;<i>Jail</i>.&rdquo; â€¦
</p>

<p>
None the less it had given Dam a thrill of pride when, on being dismissed
recruit-drills and drafted from the reserve troop to a squadron, the Adjutant
had posted him to E Troop, wherein were congregated the seven other undoubted
gentlemen-rankers of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys (one of whom would one day become
a peer of the realm and, meantime, followed what he called &ldquo;the only
profession in the world&rdquo; in discomfort for a space, the while his
Commission ripened).
</p>

<p>
To this small band of &ldquo;rankers&rdquo; the accession of the finest boxer,
swordsman, and horseman in the corps, was invaluable, and helped them notably
in their endeavour to show that there are exceptions to all rules, and that a
gentleman <i>can</i> make a first-class trooper. At least so
&ldquo;Peerson&rdquo; had said, and Dam had been made almost happy for a day.
</p>

<p>
Memories â€¦!
</p>

<p>
His first walk abroad from barracks, clad in the &ldquo;walking-out&rdquo;
finery of shell-jacket and overalls, with the jingle of spurs and effort at the
true Cavalry swagger, or rather the first attempt at a walk abroad, for the
expedition had ended disastrously ere well begun. Unable to shake off his
admirer, Trooper Herbert Hawker, Dam had just passed the Main Guard and main
gates in the company of Herbert, and the two recruits had encountered the
Adjutant and saluted with the utmost smartness and respectâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the Purple Hell&rsquo;s that thing?&rdquo; had drawled the Adjutant
thereupon&mdash;pointing his whip at Trooper Henry Hawker, whose trap-like
mouth incontinent fell open with astonishment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got up in an
imitation of the uniform of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys, I do believe!â€¦ It&rsquo;s
not a rag doll eitherâ€¦. It&rsquo;s a God-forsaken undertaker&rsquo;s mute in a
red and black shroud with a cake-tin at the back of its turnip head and a pair
of chemises on its ugly handsâ€¦. Sergeant of the Guard!â€¦ Here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; and a salute of incredible precision from the Sergeant of
the Guard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the name of the Devil&rsquo;s old Aunt is <i>this</i> thing? What
are you on Guard for? To write hymns and scare crows&mdash;or to allow decayed
charwomen to stroll out of barracks in a dem parody of your uniform? Look at
her! Could turn round in the jacket without taking it off. Room for both legs
in one of the overalls. Cap on his beastly neck. Gloves like a pair of â€¦ <i>Get
inside you</i>!â€¦ Take the thing in with a pair of tongs and bury it where it
won&rsquo;t contaminate the dung-pits. Burn it! Shoot it! Drown it! D&rsquo;ye
hear?â€¦ And then I&rsquo;ll put you under arrest for letting it passâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It had been a wondrously deflated and chapfallen Herbert that had slunk back to
the room of the reserve troop, and perhaps his reputation as a mighty bruiser
had never stood him in so good stead as when it transpired that an Order had
been promulgated that no recruit should leave barracks during the first three
months of his service, and that the names of all such embryos should be posted
in the Main Guard for the information of the Sergeantâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Memories â€¦!
</p>

<p>
His first march behind the Band to Churchâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
The first Review and March Pastâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
His first introduction to bread-and-lardâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
His wicked carelessness in forgetting&mdash;or attempting to
disregard&mdash;the law of the drinking-troughs. &ldquo;So long as one horse
has his head down no horse is to go.&rdquo; There had been over a score
drinking and he had moved off while one dipsomaniac was having a last suck.
</p>

<p>
His criminal carelessness in not removing his sword and leaving it in the
Guard-room, when going on sentry after guard-mounting&mdash;&ldquo;getting the
good Sergeant into trouble, too, and making it appear that <i>he</i> had been
equally criminally careless &ldquo;.
</p>

<p>
The desperate quarrel between Hawker and Bone as to whether the 10th Hussars
were called the &ldquo;Shiny Tenth&rdquo; because of their general material and
spiritual brilliance, or the &ldquo;Chainy Tenth&rdquo; because their Officers
wore pouch-belts of gold chain-mailâ€¦. The similar one between Buttle and Smith
as to the reason of a brother regiment being known as &ldquo;The Virgin
Mary&rsquo;s Body-guard,&rdquo; and their reluctant acceptance of Dam&rsquo;s
dictum that they were both wrong, it having been earned by them in the service
of a certain Maria Theresa, a lady unknown to Messrs. Buttle and Smithâ€¦. Dam
had found himself developing into a positive bully in his determination to
prevent senseless quarrelling, senseless misconduct, senseless humourless
foulness, senseless humourless blasphemy, and all that unnecessary, avoidable
ugliness that so richly augmented the unavoidableâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Memories â€¦!
</p>

<p>
Sitting throughout compulsory church, cursing and mutinous of heart, because
after spending several hours of the Day of Rest in burnishing and pipe-claying,
blacking and shining (&ldquo;Sunday spit an&rsquo; polish&rdquo;), he was under
orders for sharp punishment&mdash;because at the last moment his tunic had been
fouled by a passing pigeon! When would the Authorities realize that soldiers
are still men, still Englishmen (even if they have, by becoming soldiers, lost
their birthright of appeal to the Law of the Land, though not their amenability
to its authority), and cease to make the Blessed Sabbath a curse, the worst day
of the week, and to herd angry, resentful soldiers into church to blaspheme
with politely pious faces? Oh, British, British, Pharisees and
Humbugs&mdash;make Sunday a curse, and drive the soldier into church to do his
cursing&mdash;make it the chief day of dress &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; and
punishments, as well as the busiest day, and force the soldier into church to
Return Thanksâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
The only man in the world flung into church as though into jail for punishment!
Shout it in the Soldier&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;<i>You are not a Man, you are a
Slave</i>,&rdquo; on Sundays also, on Sundays louder than usualâ€¦. And when he
has spent his Sunday morning in extra hard labour, in suffering the indignity
of being compulsorily marched to church, and very frequently of having been
punished because it is a good day on which a Sergeant may decide that he is not
sufficiently cleanly shaved or his boots of minor effulgence&mdash;then let him
sit and watch his hot Sunday dinner grow stone cold before the Colonel stalks
through the room, asks a perfunctory question, and he is free to fall to.
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;O Day of Rest and Gladness,<br/>
Â O Day of Joy most Brightâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>Yah!</i>
</p>

<p>
A pity some of the energy that went to making the annual 20,000 military
&ldquo;criminals&rdquo; out of honest, law-abiding, well-intending men could
not go to harassing the Canteen instead of the soldier (whom the Canteen
swindles right and left, and whence <i>he</i> gets salt-watery beer, and an
&ldquo;ounce&rdquo; of tobacco that will go straight into his pipe in one
&ldquo;fill&rdquo;&mdash;no need to wrap it up, thank you) and discovering how
handsome fortunes, as well as substantial &ldquo;illegal gratifications,&rdquo;
are made out of his much-stoppaged one-and-tuppence-a-week.
</p>

<p>
Did the Authorities really yearn to _dis_courage enlistment and to _en_courage
desertion and &ldquo;crime&rdquo;? When would they realize that making
&ldquo;crimes,&rdquo; and manufacturing &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; from honest
men, is <i>not</i> discipline, is <i>not</i> making soldiers, is <i>not</i>
improving the Army&mdash;is <i>not</i> common ordinary sanity and sense? When
would they break their dull, unimaginative, hide-bound&mdash;no,
tape-bound&mdash;souls from the ideas that prevailed before (and murdered) the
Crimean Armyâ€¦. The Army is not now the sweepings of the jails, and more in need
of the wild-beast tamer than of the kind firm teacher, as once it was. How long
will they continue to suppose that you make a fine fighting-man, and a
self-reliant, intelligent soldier, by treating him as a depraved child, as a
rightless slave, as a mindless automaton, and by encouraging the public (whom
he protects) to regard him as a low criminal ruffian to be classed with the
broad-arrowed convict, and to be excluded from places where any loafing rotten
lout may goâ€¦. When would a lawyer-ridden Army Council realize that there is a
trifle of significance in the fact that there are four times as many soldier
suicides as there are civilian, and that the finest advertisement for the
dwindling Army <i>is the soldier</i>. To think that sober men should, with one
hand spend vast sums in lying advertisements for the Army, and with the other
maintain a system that makes the soldier on furlough reply to the question
&ldquo;Shall I enlist, mate?&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;Not while you got a
razor to cut yer throat&rdquo;â€¦. Ah, well, common sense would reach even the
Army some day, and the soldier be treated and disciplined as a man and a
citizen&mdash;and perhaps, when it did, and the soldier gave a better
description of his life, the other citizen, the smug knave who despises him
while he shelters behind him, will become less averse from having his own round
shoulders straightened, his back flattened and his muscles developed as he
takes his part in the first fundamental elementary duty of a
citizen&mdash;preparation for the defence of hearth and homeâ€¦. Lucille! Well â€¦
Thank God she could not see him and know his life. If <i>she</i> had any
kindness left for him she would suffer to watch him eating well-nigh uneatable
food, grooming a horse, sweeping a stable, polishing trestle-legs with
blacklead, scrubbing floors, sleeping on damp straw, carrying coals, doing
scullion-work for uneducated roughs, being brow-beaten, bullied, and cursed by
them in tight-lipped silence&mdash;not that these things troubled him
personally&mdash;the less idle leisure for thought the better, and no real man
minds physical hardship&mdash;there is no indignity in labour <i>per se</i> any
more than there is dignityâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, Maffewson, you bone-idle, moonin&rsquo; waster,&rdquo;
bawled the raucous voice of Lance-Corporal Prag, and Dam&rsquo;s soaring spirit
fell to earth.
</p>

<p>
The first officer to whom Trooper Matthewson gave his smart respectful salute
as he stood on sentry-duty was the Major, the Second-in-Command of the
Queen&rsquo;s Greys, newly rejoined from furlough,&mdash;a belted Earl, famous
for his sporting habit of riding always and everywhere without a
saddle&mdash;who, as a merry subaltern, had been Lieutenant Lord Ochterlonie
and Adjutant of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys at Bimariabad in India. There, he had,
almost daily, taken upon his knee, shoulder, saddle, or dog-cart, the chubby
son of his polo and pig-sticking exemplar, Colonel Matthew Devon de Warrenne.
</p>

<p>
The sentry had a dim idea that he had seen the Major somewhere before.

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap09"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br/>
A SNAKE AVENGES A HADDOCK AND LUCILLE BEHAVES IN AN UN-SMELLIEAN MANNER.</h2>

<p>
Finding himself free for the afternoon, and the proud possessor of several
shillings, &ldquo;Trooper Matthewson&rdquo; decided to walk to Folkestone,
attend an attractively advertised concert on the pier, and then indulge in an
absolutely private meal in some small tea-room or confectioner&rsquo;s shop.
</p>

<p>
Arrayed in scarlet shell-jacket, white-striped overalls, and pill-box cap, he
started forth, carrying himself as though exceeding proud to be what he was,
and wondering whether a swim in the sea, which should end somewhere between
Shorncliffe and Dieppe (and end his troubles too), would not be a better
pastime.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the Folkestone pier, Dam approached the ticket office at the
entrance and tendered his shilling to the oily-curled, curly-nosed young Jew
who sat at the receipt of custom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Clear out o&rsquo; this,&rdquo; said Levi Solomonson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want a ticket for the concert,&rdquo; said Dam, not understanding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like a row o&rsquo; stalls to sprawl your dirty carcase on?â€¦
Outside, I tell yer, Tommy Atkins, this ain&rsquo;t a music-&rsquo;all nor yet
a pub. Soldiers <i>not</i> &lsquo;&rsquo;alf-price to cheap seats&rsquo; nor
yet full-price&mdash;nor yet for ten pound a time. Out yer go, lobster.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The powerful hand of Damocles de Warrenne approached the window and, for a
second, Mr. Levi Solomonson was in danger&mdash;but only for a second. Dam was
being well-broken-in, and quickly realized that he was no longer a free British
citizen entitled to the rights of such so long as he behaved as a citizen
should, but a mere horrible defender of those of his countrymen, who were
averse from the toils and possible dangers of self-defence. It was brought home
to him, then and there, with some clearness, that the noble Britons who
(perhaps) &ldquo;never never will be slaves,&rdquo; have a fine and high
contempt for those whose life-work is to save them from that distressing
position; that the noble Briton, while stoutly (and truly Britishly) refusing
to hear of universal service and the doing by each man of his first duty to the
State, is informed with a bitter loathing of those who, for wretched hire and
under wretched conditions, perform those duties for him. Dam did not mind,
though he did not enjoy, doing housemaid&rsquo;s work in the barrack-room,
scrubbing floors, blackleading iron table-legs and grates, sweeping, dusting,
and certain other more unpleasant menial tasks; he did not mind, though he did
not like, &ldquo;mucking-out&rdquo; stables and scavenging; he could take at
their proper value the insults of ignorant boors set in authority over him; he
could stand, if not enjoy, the hardships of the soldier&rsquo;s life&mdash;but
he did <i>not</i> see why his doing his duty in that particular sphere&mdash;an
arduous, difficult, and frequently dangerous sphere&mdash;should earn him the
united insult of the united public! Why should an educated and cultured man, a
gentleman in point of fact, be absolutely prohibited from hearing a
&ldquo;classical&rdquo; concert because he wore the Queen&rsquo;s uniform and
did that most important and necessary work which the noble Briton is too
slack-baked, too hypocritically genteel, too degenerate, to perform, each man
for himself?
</p>

<p>
In a somewhat bitter frame of mind the unfortunate young man strolled along the
Leas and seated himself on a public bench, honestly wondering as he did so,
whether he were sufficiently a member of the great and glorious public to have
a right to do it while wearing the disgraceful and disgracing garb of a Trooper
of the Queenâ€¦. Members of that great and glorious public passed him by in rapid
succession. Narrow-chested youths of all classes, and all crying aloud in
slack-lipped silence for the drill-sergeant to teach them how to stand and
walk; for the gymnasium-instructor to make them, what they would never be,
<i>men</i>; for some one to give them an aim and an ideal beyond cigarettes,
socks, and giggling &ldquo;gels&rdquo; or &ldquo;gals&rdquo; or
&ldquo;garls&rdquo; or &ldquo;gyurls&rdquo; or &ldquo;gurrls&rdquo; according
to their social sphere. Vast-stomached middle-aged men of all classes, and all
crying aloud in fat-lipped silence of indulgence, physical sloth, physical
decay before physical prime should have been reached, of mental, moral, and
physical decadence from the great Past incredible, and who would one and all,
if asked, congratulate themselves on living in these glorious modern times of
&rsquo;igh civilization and not in the dark, ignorant days of old.
</p>

<p>
(Decidedly a bitter young man, this.)
</p>

<p>
Place Mister Albert Pringle, Insurance Agent; Mister Peter Snagget, Grocer;
Mister Alphonso Pumper, Rate Collector; Mister Bill &rsquo;Iggins, Publican;
Mister Walter Weed, Clerk; Mister Jeremiah Ramsmouth, Local Preacher; Mr.
&rsquo;Ookey Snagg, Loafer; Mister William Guppy, Potman&mdash;place them
beside Hybrias, Goat-herd; Damon, Shepherd; Phydias, Writer; Nicarchus,
Ploughman; Balbus, Bricklayer; Glaucus, Potter; Caius, Carter; Marcus, Weaver;
Aeneas, Bronze-worker; Antonius, Corn-seller; Canidius, Charioteer&mdash;and
then talk of the glorious modern times of high civilization and the dark
ignorant days of old!â€¦
</p>

<p>
And as he sat musing thus foolishly and pessimistically, who should loom upon
his horizon but&mdash;of all people in the world&mdash;the Haddock, the fishy,
flabby, stale, unprofitable Haddock! Most certainly Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like this. A beautiful confection of pearly-grey,
pearl-buttoned flannel draped his droopy form, a pearly-grey silk tie,
pearl-pinned, encircled his lofty collar, pearly-grey silk socks spanned the
divorcing gap &rsquo;twixt beautiful grey kid shoes and correctest trousers, a
pearly-grey silk handkerchief peeped knowingly from the cuff of his pearly-grey
silk shirt by his pearly-grey kid glove, and his little cane was of grey
lacquer, and of pearl handle. One could almost have sworn that a pearl-grey
smile adorned the scarce-shut mouth of the beautiful modern product of
education and civilization, to carry on the so well-devised colour-scheme to
the pearly-grey grey-ribboned soft hat.
</p>

<p>
The Haddock&rsquo;s mind wandered not in empty places, but wrestled sternly
with the problem&mdash;<i>would</i> it not have been better, after all,
perhaps, to have worn the pearly-grey spats (with the pearl buttons) instead of
relying on the pearly-grey socks alone? When one sat down and modestly
protruded an elegant foot as one crossed one&rsquo;s legs and gently drew up
one&rsquo;s trouser (lest a baggy knee bring black shame), one could display
both&mdash;the spat itself, <i>and</i>, above it, the sock. Of course! To the
passer-by, awe-inspired, admiring, stimulated, would then have been
administered the double shock and edification. While gratefully observing the
so-harmonizing grey spat and grey shoe he would have noted the Ossa of grey
silk sock piled upon that Pelion of ultra-fashionable foot-joy! Yes. He had
acted hastily and had erred and strayed from the Perfect Way&mdash;and a cloud,
at first no bigger than a continent or two, arose and darkened his mental sky.
</p>

<p>
But what of the cloud that settled upon him, black as that of the night&rsquo;s
Plutonian shore, a cloud much bigger than the Universe, when a beastly, awful,
ghastly, common private soldier arose from a seat&mdash;a common seat for which
you do not pay a penny and show your selectitude&mdash;arose, I say, from a
beastly common seat and SEIZED HIM BY THE ARM and remarked in horrible,
affected, mocking tones:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s the charming little Haddock, the fourpenny, common
breakfast Haddock?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yes, in full sight of the Leas of Folkestone, and the nobility, gentry,
shopmen, nurse-girls, suburban yachtsmen, nuts, noisettes, bath-chairmen and
all the world of rank and fashion, a common soldier took the pearly-grey arm of
<i>the</i> Haddon Berners as he took the air and walked abroad to give the
public a treat. And proved to be his shameful, shameless, disgraced,
disgraceful, cowardly relative, Damocles de Warrenne!
</p>

<p>
The Haddock reeled, but did not fall.
</p>

<p>
On catching sight of the beautiful young man, Dam&rsquo;s first impulse was to
spring up and flee, his second to complete the work of Mr. Levi Solomonson of
the pier concert and see for himself, once again, how he was regarded by the
eyes of all right-minded and respectable members of society, including those of
a kinsman with whom he had grown up.
</p>

<p>
Yes, in his bitterness of soul, and foolish youthful revolt against Fate, he
was attracted by the idea of claiming acquaintance with the superb Haddock in
his triumphant progress, take him by the arm, and solemnly march him the whole
length of the Leas! He would, by Jove! <i>He did</i>.
</p>

<p>
Confronting the resplendent languid loafer, he silkily observed, as he placed
his cutting-whip beneath his left arm and extended his white cotton-gloved
right hand:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s the charming little Haddock, the fourpenny, common
breakfast Haddock?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Had it been Ormonde Delorme, any friend of Monksmead days, any school or
Sandhurst acquaintance, had it been any other relative, had it been Lucille, he
would have fled for his life, he would have seen his hand paralysed ere he
would have extended it, he would have been struck dumb rather than speak, he
would have died before he would have inflicted upon them the indignity of being
seen in the company of a common soldier. But the Haddock! &rsquo;twould do the
Haddock a world of good; the Haddock who had mocked him as he fought for sanity
and life on the lawn at Monksmead&mdash;the Haddock who &ldquo;made love&rdquo;
to Lucille.
</p>

<p>
The Haddock affected not to see the hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;ah&mdash;know you, surely, do
I?&rdquo; he managed to mumble as he backed away and turned to escape.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Probably not, dear Haddock,&rdquo; replied the embittered desperate Dam,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;re going to. We&rsquo;re going for a walk together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you&mdash;ah&mdash;dwunk, fellow? Do you suppose I walk
with&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>soldiers</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, my Fish, but you&rsquo;re going to now&mdash;if I have to
carry you. And if I have to do that I&rsquo;ll slap you well, when I put you
down!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call a policeman and give you in charge if you dare molest
me. What do you&mdash;ah&mdash;desire? Money?â€¦ If you come to my hotel this
evening&mdash;&rdquo; and the hapless young man was swung round, his limp thin
arm tucked beneath a powerful and mighty one, and he was whirled along at five
miles an hour in the direction of the pier, gasping, feebly struggling, and a
sight to move the High Gods to pity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To the pier, my Haddock, and then back to the turnpike gate, and if you
let a yell, or signal a policeman, I&rsquo;ll twist your little neck. Fancy our
Haddock in a vulgar street row with a common soldier and in the Police Court!
Step it out, you worm!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then the agonized Haddock dropped pretence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Dam, I&rsquo;m awf&rsquo;ly sorry. I apologize, old chap. <i>Let
up</i>&mdash;I say&mdash;this is <i>awful</i>â€¦. Good God, here&rsquo;s Lady
Plonk, the Mayor&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall introduce me, Lovely One&mdash;but no, we mustn&rsquo;t annoy
ladies. You must <i>not</i> go trying to introduce your low
companions&mdash;nay, relations&mdash;to Lady Plonkses. Step out&mdash;and look
happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dam&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, let me go! I didn&rsquo;t know you, old
chap. I swear I didn&rsquo;t. The disgrace will kill me. I&rsquo;ll give
you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, wee Fish, you offer me money again and
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll undress you and run away with your clothes. I will,
upon my soul.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall call to this policeman,&rdquo; gasped the Haddock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And appear with your low-class <i>relation</i> in Court? Not you,
Haddock. I&rsquo;d swear you were my twin brother, and that you wouldn&rsquo;t
pay me the four pence you borrowed of me last week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the cruel penance was inflicted to the last inch. Near the end the Haddock
groaned: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Amelia Harringport&mdash;Oh! my God,&rdquo; and
Dam quickly turned his face unto the South and gazed at the fair land of
France. He remembered that General Harringport dwelt in these parts.
</p>

<p>
At the toll-gate Dam released the perspiration-soaked wretch, who had suffered
the torments of the damned, and who seemed to have met every man and woman whom
he knew in the world as he paraded the promenade hanging lovingly to the arm of
a common soldier! He thought of suicide and shuddered at the bare idea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m awf&rsquo;ly sorry to have to run away and leave you
now, dear Haddock. I might have taken you to all the pubs in Folkestone if
I&rsquo;d had time. I might have come to your hotel and dined with you. You
<i>will</i> excuse me, won&rsquo;t you? I <i>must</i> go now. I&rsquo;ve got to
wash up the tea things and clean the Sergeant&rsquo;s boots,&rdquo; said Dam,
cruelly wringing the Haddock&rsquo;s agonized soft hand, and, with a complete
and disconcerting change, added, &ldquo;And if you breathe a word about having
seen me, at Monksmead, or tell Lucille, <i>I&rsquo;ll seek you out, my
Haddock</i>, and&mdash;we will hold converse with thee&rdquo;. Then he strode
away, cursing himself for a fool, a cad, and a deteriorated, demoralized
ruffian. Anyhow, the Haddock would not mention the appalling incident and give
him away.
</p>

<p>
Nemesis followed him.
</p>

<p>
Seeking a quiet shop in a back street where he could have the long-desired meal
in private, he came to a small taxidermist&rsquo;s, glanced in as he passed,
and beheld the pride and joy of the taxidermist&rsquo;s heart&mdash;a
magnificent and really well-mounted boa-constrictor, and fell shrieking,
struggling, and screaming in the gutter.
</p>

<p>
That night Damocles de Warrenne, ill, incoherent, and delirious, passed in a
cell, on a charge of drunk and disorderly and disgracing the Queen&rsquo;s
uniform.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Levi Solomonson had not disgraced it, of course.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If we were not eating this excellent bread-and-dripping and drinking
this vile tea, what would you like to be eating and drinking,
Matthewson?&rdquo; asked Trooper Nemo (formerly Aubrey Roussac d&rsquo;Aubigny
of Harrow and Trinity).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, â€¦ a little real turtle,&rdquo; said Dam, &ldquo;just a lamina of
<i>sole frite</i>, a trifle of <i>vol an vent Ã  la financiÃ¨re</i>, a breast of
partridge, a mite of <i>patÃ© de fois gras</i>, a peach <i>Ã  la Melba</i>, the
roe of a bloater, and a few fat grapes&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould do. &rsquo;Twould pass,&rdquo; sighed Trooper Burke, and
added, &ldquo;I would suggest a certain Moselle I used to get at the Byculla
Club in Bombay, and a wondrous fine claret that spread a ruby haze of charm
o&rsquo;er my lunch at the Yacht Club of the same fair city. A &lsquo;<i>Mouton
Rothschild</i> something,&rsquo; which was cheap at nine rupees a small bottle
on the morrow of a good day on the Mahaluxmi Racecourse.&rdquo; (It was
strongly suspected that Trooper Burke had worn a star on his shoulder-strap in
those Indian days.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful shame we can&rsquo;t all emerge from the depths and
run up to Town to breathe the sweet original atmosphere for just one night
before we leave old England,&rdquo; put in Trooper Punch Peerson (son of a
noble lord) who would at that moment have been in the Officers&rsquo; Mess but
for a congenital weakness in spelling and a dislike of mathematics. &ldquo;Pity
we can&rsquo;t get &lsquo;leaf,&rsquo; and do ourselves glorious at the
Carlton, and &lsquo;afterwards&rsquo;. We could change at my Governor&rsquo;s
place into borrowed, stolen, and hired evening-kit, paint the village as
scarlet as Sin or a trooper&rsquo;s jacket, and then come home, like the
Blackbird, to tea. I am going, and if I can&rsquo;t get &lsquo;leaf&rsquo; I
shall return under the bread in the rations-cart. Money&rsquo;s the root of all
(successful) evil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Trooper Punch Peerson was a born leader of men, a splendid horseman and
soldier, and he had the Army in his ardent, gallant blood and bones; but how
shall a man head a cavalry charge or win the love and enthusiastic obedience of
men and horses when he is weak in spelling and has a dislike of mathematics?
</p>

<p>
However, he was determined to follow in the footsteps of his ancestors, to
serve his country in spite of her, and his Commission was certain and near.
Meanwhile he endeavoured to be a first-class trooper, had his uniform made of
officers&rsquo; materials in Bond Street by his father&rsquo;s famous tailor,
and &ldquo;got the stick&rdquo; with ease and frequency.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not all gilded popinjays (nor poppin&rsquo; bottles),&rdquo;
observed a young giant who called himself Adam Goate, and had certainly been
one in the days when he was Eugene Featherstonthwaite. &ldquo;All very well for
you to come to the surface and breathe, seeing that you&rsquo;ll be out of it
soon. You&rsquo;re having nothing but a valuable experience and a hardening.
You&rsquo;re going through the mill. We&rsquo;ve got to <i>live</i> in it.
What&rsquo;s the good of our stirring everything up again? Dam-silly of a
skinned eel to grow another skin, to be skinned againâ€¦. No, &lsquo;my co-mates
and brothers in exile,&rsquo; what I say is&mdash;you can get just as drunk on
&lsquo;four-&rsquo;arf&rsquo; as on champagne, and a lot cheaper. Ask my
honourable friend, Bear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
(Trooper Bear gave a realistic, but musical hiccup.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Also, to the Philosopher, bread-and-dripping is as interesting and
desirable prog as the voluble-varied heterogeny of the menu at the Carlton or
the Ritz&mdash;&rsquo;specially when you&rsquo;ve no choice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; put in Dam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Goatey ol&rsquo; Goate!&rdquo; said Trooper Bear with impressive
solemnity. &ldquo;Give me your hand, Philossiler. I adore dripping. I&rsquo;ss
a (hic) mystery. (No, I don&rsquo; want both hands,&rdquo; as Goate offered his
right to Bear&rsquo;s warm embrace.) I&rsquo;m a colliseur of Dripping. I
understan&rsquo; it. I write odes to it. Yesh. A basin of dripping is like a
Woman. &rsquo;Strornarillily. You never know what&rsquo;s beneath fair
surfaceâ€¦. Below a placid, level, unrevealing surface there may be&mdash;nothing
â€¦ and there may be a rich deposit of glorious, stimulating, piquant
<i>essence</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, shut up, Bear, and don&rsquo;t be an Ass,&rdquo; implored Trooper
Burke (formerly Desmond Villiers FitzGerald) â€¦ &ldquo;but I admit, all the
same, there&rsquo;s lots of worse prog in the Officers&rsquo; Mess than a crisp
crust generously bedaubed with the rich jellified gravy that (occasionally)
lurks like rubies beneath the fatty soil of dripping.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sound plan to think so, anyway,&rdquo; agreed Trooper Little (<i>ci
devant</i> Man About Town and the Honourable Bertie Le Grand). &ldquo;Reminds
me of a proverb I used to hear in Alt Heidelberg, <i>&lsquo;What I have in my
hand is best&rsquo;</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Qui&rsquo; sho,&rdquo; murmured Trooper Bear with a seraphic smile,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; wha&rsquo; I have in my &lsquo;place of departed
<i>spirits</i>,&rsquo; my tummy, is better. Glor&rsquo;us mixshure. Earned an
honest penny sheven sheparate times cleaning the &rsquo;coutrements of better
men â€¦ <i>&lsquo;an look at me for shevenpence&rsquo;</i> â€¦&rdquo; and he slept
happily on Dam&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
In liquor, Trooper Bear was, if possible, gentler, kinder, and of sweeter
disposition than when sober; wittier, more hopelessly lovable and disarming.
These eight men&mdash;the &ldquo;gentlemen-rankers&rdquo; of the Queen&rsquo;s
Greys, made it a point of honour to out-Tommy &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; as troopers,
and, when in his company, to show a heavier cavalry-swagger, a broader accent,
a quiffier &ldquo;quiff,&rdquo; a cuttier cutty-pipe, a smarter smartness; to
groom a horse better, to muck out a stall better, to scrub a floor better, to
spring more smartly to attention or to a disagreeable &ldquo;fatigue,&rdquo;
and to set an example of Tomminess from turning out on an Inspection Parade to
waxing a moustache.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Bear professed to specialize as a model in the carrying of liquor
&ldquo;like a man and a soldier&rdquo;. When by themselves, they made it a
point of honour to behave and speak as though in the clubs to which they once
belonged, to eat with washen hands and ordered attire, to behave at table and
elsewhere with that truest of consideration that offends no man willingly by
mannerism, appearance, word or act, and which is the whole Art of Gentility.
</p>

<p>
They carefully avoided any appearance of exclusiveness, but sought every
legitimate opportunity of united companionship, and formed a &ldquo;mess&rdquo;
of eight at a table which just held that number, and on a couple of benches
each of which exactly fulfilled the slang expression &ldquo;room for four
Dragoons on a form&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
It was their great ambition to avoid the reproach of earning the soubriquet
&ldquo;gentleman-ranker,&rdquo; a term that too often, and too justly, stinks
in the nostrils of officer, non-commissioned officer, and man (for, as a rule,
the &ldquo;gentleman-ranker&rdquo; is a complete failure as a gentleman and a
completer one as a ranker).
</p>

<p>
To prove a rule by a remarkably fine exception, these eight were among the very
smartest and best troopers of one of the smartest and best Corps in the
world&mdash;and to Damocles de Warrenne, their &ldquo;Society of the Knights of
the dirty Square Table&rdquo; was a Rock and a Salvation in the midst of a
howling sea of misery&mdash;a cool pool in a searing branding Hell.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Bear&rsquo;s brief nap appeared to have revived him wonderfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us, like the Hosts of Midian, prowl around this happy Sabbeth eve,
my dear,&rdquo; quoth he to Dam, &ldquo;and, like wise virgins, up and smite
them, when we meet the Red-Capsâ€¦. No, I&rsquo;m getting confused. It&rsquo;s
they up and smite us, when we&rsquo;ve nothing to tip themâ€¦. I feel I could be
virtuous in your company&mdash;since you never offer beer to the (more or less)
fatherless and widowed&mdash;and since I&rsquo;m stony. How <i>did</i> you work
that colossal drunk, Matty, when you came home on a stretcher and the Red-Caps
said you <i>&lsquo;was the first-classest delirious-trimmings as ever was,
aseein&rsquo; snakes somethink &rsquo;orrible,&rsquo;</i> and in no wise to be
persuaded <i>&lsquo;as &rsquo;ow there wasn&rsquo;t one underyer bloomin&rsquo;
foot the &rsquo;ole time&rsquo;</i>. Oh you teetotallers!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam shuddered and paled. &ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s go for as long a walk as we
can manage, and get as far from this cursed place as time allows,&rdquo; he
replied.
</p>

<p>
His hair was still short and horribly hacked from the prison-crop he had had as
a preliminary to &ldquo;168 hours cells,&rdquo; for &ldquo;drunk and
disorderly&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come too,&rdquo; announced the Honourable Bertie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Trooper Adam Goate, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go and
gladden the eyes, if not the hearts of the nurse-maids of Folkestone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless their nurse-maidenly hearts,&rdquo; murmured Trooper Bear.
&ldquo;One made honourable proposals of marriage to me, quite recently, in
return for my catching the runaway hat of her young chargeâ€¦. Come on.&rdquo;
And in due course the four derelicts set forth with a uniformity of step and
action that corresponded with their uniformity of dress.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the Lower Road,&rdquo; said Dam, as they reached the
western limit of the front at Folkestone. &ldquo;I fear we rather contaminate
the pure social air of the Upper Road and the fashionable promenade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where every prospect pleases and only man, in the Queen&rsquo;s uniform,
is vile,&rdquo; observed Trooper Bear.
</p>

<p>
Dam remembered afterwards that it was he who sought the quiet Lower
Road&mdash;and he had good reason to remember it. For suddenly, a fashionably
dressed and beautiful young girl, sitting alone in a passing private victoria,
stood up, called &ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; to the coachman, and ere the
carriage well came to a standstill, sprang out, rushed up to the double file of
soldiers, and flung her arms around the neck of the outside one of the front
rank.
</p>

<p>
With a cry of &ldquo;Oh, <i>Dam</i>! Oh, <i>Dammy</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;a cry that
mightily scandalized a serious-minded policeman who stood monumentally at the
corner&mdash;she kissed him again and again!
</p>

<p>
Troopers Bear, Goate, and Little, halting not in their stride, glancing not
unto the right hand nor unto the left hand, speaking no word, and giving no
sign of surprise, marched on in perfect silence, until Trooper Bear observed to
the world in general &ldquo;The lady was <i>not</i> swearing. His <i>name</i>
must be Dam&mdash;short for Damon or Pythias or Iphigenia or something which we
may proceed to forgetâ€¦. Poor old chappie&mdash;no wonder he&rsquo;s taking to
secret drinking. <i>I</i> should drink, myself. <i>Poor</i> chap!&rdquo; and
Trooper Goate, heaving a sympathetic sigh, murmured also &ldquo;Poor
chap!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Trooper Little, once the Hon. Bertie Le Grand, thought &ldquo;Poor
<i>lady</i>!&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The heart of Damocles de Warrenne bounded within him, stood still, and then
seemed like to burst.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>Lucille</i>! Oh, darling!&rdquo; he groaned, as he kissed her
fiercely and then endeavoured to thrust her from him. &ldquo;Jump into your
carriage quickly. <i>Lucille</i>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t â€¦ <i>Here</i> â€¦! Not
<i>here</i>â€¦. People are looking â€¦ <i>You â€¦!</i> A common soldierâ€¦. Let me go.
Quickâ€¦. Your carriageâ€¦. Some one may&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let you <i>go</i>, darling â€¦! Now I have found youâ€¦. If you say another
word I&rsquo;ll serve you as you served the Haddock. I&rsquo;ll hang on to your
arm right along the Leas. I&rsquo;ll hang round your neck and scream if you try
to run away. This is poetic justice, darling. Now you know how our Haddock
felt. <i>No</i>&mdash;I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> leave go of your sleeve. Where shall
we go, dearest darling Dammy. Dare you drive up and down the Front with me in
Amelia Harringport&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s young man&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s
victoria? oh, my <i>darling</i> Damâ€¦.&rdquo; and Lucille burst into happy
tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go up that winding path and I&rsquo;ll follow in a minute. There will be
secluded seats.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll bolt directly I leave go of you?â€¦ I&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, darling, God knows I should if I were a man, but I can&rsquo;t, <i>I
can&rsquo;t</i>. Oh, Lucille!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; cried the utterly fearless, unashamed girl to the
unspeakably astounded coachman of the mother of the minor Canon who had the
felicity of being Amelia Harringport&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s young man, and she
strode up the pathway that wound, tree-shaded, along the front of the gently
sloping cliff.
</p>

<p>
In the utter privacy of a small seat-enclosing, bush-hidden half-cave, Damocles
de Warrenne crushed Lucille to his breast as she again flung her arms around
his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Lucille, how <i>could</i> you expose yourself to scandal like that;
I ought to be hung for not taking to my heels as you came, but I could not
believe my eyes, I thought I was going mad again,&rdquo; and he shivered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What should I have cared if every soul in the world who knows me had
arranged himself and herself in rows and ranks to get a good view? I&rsquo;d
have done the same if Grumper had been beside me in the carriage. What is the
rest of the World to me, beside <i>you</i>, darling?â€¦ Oh, your <i>poor</i>
hair, and what is that horrid scar, my dearest? And you are a &lsquo;2
Q.G.&rsquo; are you, and how soon may you marry? I&rsquo;m going to disappear
from Monksmead, now, just like you did, darling, and I&rsquo;m coming here and
I&rsquo;m going to be a soldier&rsquo;s wife. Can I live with you in your house
in barracks, Dammy, or must I live outside, and you come home directly your
drill and things are finished?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam groaned aloud in hopeless bitterness of soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucille&mdash;listen,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I earn one-and tuppence a
day. I may not marry. If you were a factory-girl or a coster-woman I would not
drag you down so. Apart from that, I am unfit to marry any decent woman. I
am&mdash;what you know I amâ€¦. I have&mdash;fits. I am
not&mdash;sound&mdash;normal&mdash;I may go mâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a pure priceless Ass, darling. You are my own splendid
hero&mdash;and I am going to marry you, if I have to <i>be</i> a factory-girl
or a coster-woman, and I am going to live either with you or near you. You want
looking after, my own boy. I shall have some money, though, when I am of age.
When may I run away from Monksmead, darling?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucille,&rdquo; groaned the miserable man. &ldquo;Do you think that the
sight of you in the mire in which I wallow would make me happier? Can&rsquo;t
you realize that I&rsquo;m ruined and done&mdash;disgraced and smashed?
Lucille, I am not sane at timesâ€¦. The S<small>NAKE</small> â€¦ <i>Do</i> you love
me, Lucille? Then if so, I beg and implore you to forget me, to leave me alone,
to wait awhile and then marry Delorme or some sane, wholesome
<i>man</i>&mdash;who is neither a coward nor a lunatic nor an epileptic.
Lucille, you double and treble my misery. I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> bear it if I see
you. Oh, why didn&rsquo;t you forget me and do the right and proper thing? I am
unfit to touch you! I am a damned scoundrel to be here now,&rdquo; and leaping
up he fled like a maddened horse, bounded down the slope, sprang into the road,
nor ceased to run till he fell exhausted, miles away from the spot whereon he
had suffered as he believed few men had done before.
</p>

<p class="poem">
And thus and thus we women live!<br/>
With none to question, none to give<br/>
The Nay or Aye, the Aye or Nay<br/>
That might smoothe half our cares away.<br/>
O, strange indeed! And sad to know<br/>

<h2><a name="chap10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br/>
MUCH ADO ABOUT ALMOST NOTHING&mdash;A TROOPER.</h2>

<p>
Mr. Ormonde Delorme, Second Lieutenant of the 34th Lancers, sat in his quarters
at Aldershot, reading and re-reading with mingled feelings a letter from the
woman he loved.
</p>

<p>
It is one thing to extract a promise from The Woman that she will turn to you
for help if ever your help should be needed (knowing that there could be no
greater joy than to serve her at any cost whatsoever, though it led to death or
ruin), but it is quite another thing when that help is invited for the benefit
of the successful rival!
</p>

<p>
To go to the world&rsquo;s end for Lucille were a very small matter to Ormonde
Delorme&mdash;but to go across the road for the man who had won her away, was
not.
</p>

<p>
For Dam <i>had</i> won her away from him, Delorme considered, inasmuch as he
had brought him to Monksmead, time after time, had seen him falling in love
with Lucille, had received his confidences, and spoken no warning word. Had he
said but &ldquo;No poaching, Delorme,&rdquo; nothing more would have been
necessary; he would have kept away thenceforth, and smothered the flame ere it
became a raging and consuming fire. No, de Warrenne had served him badly in not
telling him plainly that there was an understanding between him and his cousin,
in letting him sink more and more deeply over head and ears in love, in letting
him go on until he proposed to Lucille and learnt from her that while she liked
him better than any man in the world but one&mdash;she did not love him, and
that, frankly, yes, she <i>did</i> love somebody else, and it was hopeless for
him to hopeâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
He read the letter again:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;M<small>Y DEAR</small> O<small>RMONDE</small>,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a begging letter, and I should loathe to write it, under the
circumstances, to any man but such a one as you. For I am going to ask a great
deal of you and to appeal to that nobleness of character for which I have
always admired you and which made you poor Dam&rsquo;s hero from Lower School
days at Wellingborough until you left Sandhurst (and, alas! quarrelled with
him&mdash;or rather with his memory&mdash;about me). That was a sad blow to me,
and I tell you again as I told you before, Dam had not the faintest notion that
<i>I</i> cared for <i>him</i> and would not have told me that he cared for me
had I not shown it. Your belief that he didn&rsquo;t trouble to warn you
because he had me safe is utterly wrong, absurd, and unjust.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you did me the great honour and paid me the undeserved and
tremendous compliment of asking me to marry you, and I told you that I could
not, and <i>why</i> I could not, I never dreamed that Dam could care for me in
that way, and I knew that I should never marry any one at all unless he did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And on the same occasion, Ormonde, you begged me to promise that if ever
you could serve me in any way, I would ask for your help. You were a dear
romantic boy then, Ormonde, and I loved you in a different way, and cried all
night that you and I could not be friends without thought of love, and I most
solemnly promised that I would turn to you if I ever needed help that you could
give. (Alas, I thought to myself then that nobody in the world could do
anything for me that Dam could not do, and that I should never need help from
others while he lived.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want your help, Ormonde, and I want it for Dam&mdash;and me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have, of course, heard some garbled scandal about his being driven
away from home and cut off from Sandhurst by grandfather. I need not ask if you
have believed ill of him and I need not say he is absolutely innocent of any
wrong or failure whatever. He is <i>not</i> an effeminate coward, he is as
brave as a lion. He is a splendid hero, Ormonde, and I want you to simply
strangle and kill any man who says a word to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When he left home, he enlisted, and Haddon Berners saw him in uniform at
Folkestone where he had gone from Canterbury (cricket week) to see Amelia
Harringport&rsquo;s gang. Amelia whose sister is to be the Reverend Mrs. Canon
Mellifle at Folkestone, you know, met the wretched Haddon being rushed along
the front by a soldier and nearly died at the sight&mdash;she declares he was
weeping!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Directly she told me I guessed at once that he had met Dam and either
insulted or cut him, and that poor Dam, in his bitter humour and self-loathing
had used his own presence as a punishment and had made the Haddock walk with
him! Imagine the company of Damocles de Warrenne being anything but an
ennobling condescension! Fancy Dam&rsquo;s society a horrible injury and
disgrace! To a thing like Haddon Berners!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I simply haunted Folkestone after that, and developed a love for
Amelia Harringport and her brothers that surprised them&mdash;hypocrite that I
am! (but I was punished when they talked slightingly of Dam and she sneered at
the man whom she had shamelessly pursued when all was well with him. She
&lsquo;admires&rsquo; Haddon now.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At last I met him on one of my week-end visits&mdash;on a Sunday evening
it was&mdash;and I simply flew at him in the sight of all respectable,
prayer-book-displaying, before-Church-parading, well-behaved Folkestone, and
kissed him nearly to deathâ€¦. And can you believe a woman could be such a
<i>fool</i>, Ormonde&mdash;while carefully noting the &lsquo;2 Q.G.&rsquo; on
his shoulder-straps, I never thought to find out his <i>alias</i>&mdash;for of
course he hides his identity, thinking as he does, poor darling boy, that he
has brought eternal disgrace on an honoured name&mdash;a name that appears
twice on the rolls of the V.C. records.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ormonde, were it not that it would <i>increase</i> his misery and agony
of mind I would run away from Monksmead, take a room near the Queen&rsquo;s
Greys barracks, and haunt the main gates until I saw him again. He should then
tell me how to communicate with him, or I would hang about there till he did.
I&rsquo;d marry him &lsquo;off the strength&rsquo; and live (till I am
&lsquo;of age&rsquo;) by needlework if he would have me. But, of course,
he&rsquo;d <i>never</i> understand that I&rsquo;d be happier, and a better
woman, in a Shorncliffe lodging, as a soldier&rsquo;s wife, than ever I shall
be here in this dreary Monksmead&mdash;until he is restored and re-habilitated
(is that the word? I mean&mdash;comes into his own as a brave and noble
gentleman who never did a mean or cowardly action in his life).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he is <i>so</i> thin and unhappy looking, Ormonde, and his poor
hands are in such a state and his beautiful hair is all hacked about and done
like a soldier&rsquo;s, all short except for a long piece brushed down his
forehead and round to his cap&mdash;oh, dreadful â€¦ and he has a scar on his
face! No wonder Amelia never recognized him. Oh, <i>do</i> help me, Ormonde. I
<i>must</i> find out how to address him. I dare not let them know there is a
<i>D. de Warrenne</i> in the regiment&mdash;and he&rsquo;d never get it
either&mdash;he&rsquo;s probably Smith or Jones or Robinson now. If some horrid
Sergeant called out &lsquo;Trooper D. de Warrenne,&rsquo; when distributing
letters, Dam would never answer to the name he thinks he has eternally
disgraced, and disgrace it further by dragging it in the mire of the ranks. How
<i>can</i> people be such snobs? Isn&rsquo;t a good private a better man than a
bad officer? Why should there be any &lsquo;taint&rsquo; about serving your
country in any capacity?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How <i>can</i> I find him, Ormonde, unless you help me? I could pay a
servant to hang about the barracks until he recognized Dam&mdash;but that would
be horrible for the poor boy. He&rsquo;d deny it and say the man was mad, I
expect&mdash;and it would be most unpleasant and unfair to Dam to set some one
to find out from his comrades what he calls himself. If he chooses to hide from
what he thinks is the chance of further disgracing his people, and suffers what
he does in order to remain hidden, shall <i>I</i> be the one to do anything to
show him up and cause him worse suffering&mdash;expose him to a servant?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How <i>can</i> I get him a letter that shall not have his name on it? If
I wrote to his Colonel or the Adjutant and enclosed a letter with just
&lsquo;Dam&rsquo; on it they&rsquo;d not know for whom it was meant&mdash;and I
dare not tell them his real name.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Could you get a letter to him, Ormonde, without letting him know that
you know he is a private soldier, and without letting a soul know his real
name?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do apologize for the length of this interminable letter, but if you
only knew the <i>relief</i> it is to me to be doing something that may help
him, and to be talking, or rather writing about him, you would forgive me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His name must not be mentioned here. Think of it!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if it only would not make him <i>more</i> unhappy, I would go to him
this minute, and refuse ever to leave him again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does that sound unmaidenly, Ormonde? I don&rsquo;t care whether it does
or not, nor whether it <i>is</i> or not. I love him, and he loves me. I am his
<i>friend</i>. Could I stay here in luxury if it would make him happier to
marry me? Am I a terribly abandoned female? I told Auntie Yvette just what I
had done, and though it simply saved her life to know he had not committed
suicide (I believe she <i>worshipped</i> father)&mdash;she seemed mortally
shocked at me for behaving so. I am not a bit ashamed though. Dam is more
important than good form, and I had to show him in the strongest possible way
that he was dearer to me than ever. If it <i>was</i> &lsquo;behaving like a
servant-girl&rsquo;&mdash;all honour to servant-girls, I think â€¦ considering
the circumstances. You should have seen his face before he caught sight of me.
Yes&mdash;<i>and</i> after, too. Though really I think he suffered more from my
kissing him&mdash;in uniform, in the street&mdash;than if I had cut him. It
would be only for the minute though â€¦ it <i>must</i> comfort him <i>now</i>,
and always, to think that I love him so (since he loves <i>me</i>&mdash;and
always has done). But what I must know before I can sleep peacefully again is
the name by which he goes in the &lsquo;2 Q.G&rsquo;s.,&rsquo; so that I can
write and comfort him regularly, send him things, and make him buy himself out
when he sees he has been foolish and wicked in supposing that he has publicly
disgraced himself and his name and us. And I&rsquo;m going to make
Grandfather&rsquo;s life a misery, and go about skinny and ragged and weeping,
and say: &lsquo;<i>This</i> is how you treat the daughter of your dead friend,
you wicked, cruel, unjust old man,&rsquo; until he relents and sends for Dam
and gets him into the Army properlyâ€¦. But I am afraid Dam will think it his
silly duty to flee from me and all my works, and hide himself where the names
of de Warrenne and Stukeley are unknown and cannot be disgraced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I rely on you, Ormonde,
</p>

</p>

<p>
Second Lieutenant Delorme rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bradshaw,&rdquo; he said, as his soldier-servant appeared. &ldquo;And
get me a telegraph form.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yussir,&rdquo; said Private Billings, and marched to the Mess ante-room
purposefully, with hope in his heart that Mr. Delorme &rsquo;ad nothink less
than a &rsquo;alf dollar for the telegram and would forgit to arx for the
chainge, as was his occasional praiseworthy procedure.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Delorme, alas, proved to have a mean and vulgar shilling, the which he
handed to Private Billings with a form containing the message:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can do. So cheer up. Writing his adjutant, pal of mine. Coming over
Saturday if get leave. Going Shorncliffe if necessary. Leave due. Dam all
right. Will blow over. Thanks for letting me help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid they don&rsquo; give no tick at the Telegraft Orfis,
Sir,&rdquo; observed Private Billings, who, as quondam &ldquo;trained
observer&rdquo; of his troop, had noted the length of the telegram and the
shortness of the allowance therefor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the deuceâ€¦?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is more like a &rsquo;alf-dollar job, Sir,&rdquo; he groaned,
waving the paper, &ldquo;wot wiv&rsquo; the haddress an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes, bit thick for a bob, perhaps; here&rsquo;s half a
sovâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> more like &lsquo;<i>&rsquo;Eres to yer</i>,&rsquo;
Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; remarked the good man&mdash;outside the door.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t yer werry about trifles o&rsquo; chainge. Be a
gent!&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Lucille read and re-read the telegram in many ways.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can do so. Cheer up. Writing his adjutant. Pal of mine coming over
Saturday. If get leave going Shorncliffe if necessary leave due Dam. All right
will blow over thanks.&rdquo; No, <i>that</i> wouldn&rsquo;t do.
</p>

<p>
(What a pity people <i>would</i> not remember when writing telegrams that the
stops and capitals they put are ignored by the operators.)
</p>

<p>
At last, the wish being father to the thought, she decided it to be &ldquo;Can
do&rdquo; (she knew that to be a navy expression). &ldquo;So cheer up. Writing.
His adjutant a pal of mine. Coming over Saturday if I get leave. Going
Shorncliffe if necessary. Leave due. Dam all right. Will blow over. Thanks for
letting me help.&rdquo; Which was not far wrong.
</p>

<p>
Dear old Ormonde! She knew he would not fail her&mdash;although he had been
terribly cut up by her rejection of his suit and by his belief that Dam had let
him haunt her in the knowledge that she was his own private property, secured
to him.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Having dispatched his telegram and interviewed his Adjutant, Captain, and
Colonel, Mr. Delorme sat him down and wrote to Lieutenant the Honourable
Reginald Montague Despencer, Adjutant of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;M<small>Y DEAR</small> M<small>ONTY</small>,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the Rag. the other day, respectfully dining with my respected parent,
I encountered, respectfully dining with his respected parent, your embryo
Strawberry Leaf, old &lsquo;Punch Peerson&rsquo;. (Do you remember his standing
on his head on the engine at Blackwater Station when he was too
&lsquo;merry&rsquo; to be able to stand steady on his feet?) I learnt that he
is still with you and I want him to do something for me. He&rsquo;ll be serious
about it if <i>you</i> speak to him about it&mdash;and I am writing to him
direct. I&rsquo;m going to send you a letter (under my cover), and on it will
be one word &lsquo;Dam&rsquo; (on the envelope, of course). I want you to give
this to Punch and order him to show it privately to the
<i>gentlemen-rankers</i> of the corps till one says he recognizes the force of
the word (pretty forceful, too, what!) and the writing. To this chap he is to
give it. Be good to your poor &lsquo;rankers,&rsquo; Monty, I know one damned
hard case among them. No fault of <i>his</i>, poor chap. I could say a
lot&mdash;surprise you&mdash;but I mustn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s awfully good of
you, old chap. I know you&rsquo;ll see it through. It concerns as fine a
gentleman as ever stepped and <i>the</i> finest woman!
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;Ever thine,Â Â Â Â <br/>
&ldquo;O. D<small>ELORME</small>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, my lambs&mdash;or rather, Black Sheep,&rdquo; quoth Trooper
Punch Peerson one tea-time to Troopers Bear, Little, Goate, Nemo, Burke, Jones,
and Matthewson, &ldquo;I suppose none of you answers to the name of
&lsquo;<i>Dam</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No man answered, and Trooper Peerson looked at the face of no man, nor any one
at any other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I thought not. Well, I have a letter addressed in that objurgatory
term, and I am going to place it beneath my pillow before I go out to-night. If
it is there when I come in I&rsquo;ll destroy it unopened. &lsquo;Nuff
said,&rsquo; as the lady remarked when she put the mop in her husband&rsquo;s
mouth. Origin of the phrase &lsquo;don&rsquo;t chew the mop,&rsquo; I should
think,&rdquo; and he babbled on, having let his unfortunate friends know that
for one of them he had a letter which might be received by the addressed
without the least loss of his anonymity.
</p>

<p>
Dam&rsquo;s heart beat hard and seemed to swell to bursting. He felt
suffocated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quaint superscription,&rdquo; he managed to observe. &ldquo;How did you
come by it?&rdquo; and then wished he had not spokenâ€¦. Who but the recipient
could be interested in its method of delivery? If anyone suspected him of being
&ldquo;Dam&rdquo; would they not at once connect him with the notorious
Damocles de Warrenne, ex-Sandhurst cadet, proclaimed coward and wretched
neurotic decadent before the pained, disgusted eyes of his county, kicked out
by his guardian â€¦ a disgrace to two honoured names. â€¦ &ldquo;The Adjer handed
it over. Thought <i>I</i> was the biggest Damn here, I suppose,&rdquo; Trooper
Peerson replied without looking up from his plate. &ldquo;Practical silly joke
I should think. No one here with such a l_oath_some, name as <i>Dam</i>, of
course,&rdquo; but Trooper Punch Peerson had his philosophic
&ldquo;doots&rdquo;. He, like others of that set, had heard of a big chap who
was a marvel at Sandhurst with the gloves, sword, horse, and other things, and
who had suddenly and marvellously disappeared into thin air leaving no trace
behind him, after some public scandal or otherâ€¦. But that was no concern of
Trooper Punch Peerson, gentlemanâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
With a wary eye on Peerson, Dam lay on his bed, affecting to read a stale and
dirty news-sheet. He saw him slip something beneath his pillow and swagger out
of the barrack-room. Anon no member of the little band of gentleman-rankers was
left. Later, the room was empty, save for a heavily snoring drunkard and a busy
polisher who, at the shelf-table at the far end of the room, laboured on his
jack-boots, hissing the while, like a groom with a dandy-brush.
</p>

<p>
Going to Peerson&rsquo;s bed, Dam snatched the letter, returned to his own, and
flung himself down again&mdash;his heart pumping as though he had just finished
a mile race. <i>Lucille had got a letter to him somehow</i>. Lucille was not
going to drop him yet&mdash;in spite of having seen him a red-handed,
crop-haired, &ldquo;quiff&rdquo;-wearing, coarse-looking soldierâ€¦. Was there
another woman in the world like Lucille? Would any other girl have so risen
superior to her breeding, and the teachings of Miss Smellie, as to do what she
thought right, regardless of public scandalâ€¦? But he must not give her the
opportunity of being seen talking to a soldier again&mdash;much less kissing
one. Not that she would want to kiss him again like that. That was the kiss of
welcome, of encouragement, of proof that she was unchanged to him&mdash;her
first sight of him after the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i>. It was the unchecked impulse of a
noble heart&mdash;and the action showed that Miss Smellie had been unable to do
it much harm with her miserable artificialities and stiflings of all that is
natural and human and rightâ€¦. Should he read the letter at once or treasure it
up and keep it as a treat in store? He would hold it in his hand unopened and
imagine its contents. He would spin out the glorious pleasure of possession of
an unopened letter from Lucille. He could, of course, read it hundreds of
times&mdash;but he would then soon know it by heart, and although its charm and
value would be no less, it would merge with his other memories and become a
memory itself. He did not want it to become a memory too soon.
</p>

<p>
The longer it remained an anticipation, the more distant the day when it became
a memoryâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
With a groan of &ldquo;Oh, my brain&rsquo;s softening and I&rsquo;m becoming a
sentimentalist,&rdquo; he opened the letter and read Lucille&rsquo;s loving,
cheering&mdash;yet agonizing, maddening&mdash;words:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;M<small>Y OWN DARLING</small> D<small>AM</small>,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If this letter reaches you safely you are to sit down at once and write
to me to tell me how to address you by post in the ordinary way. If you
don&rsquo;t I shall come and haunt the entrance to the Lines and waylay you.
People will think I am a poor soul whom you have married and deserted, or whom
you won&rsquo;t marry. <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> show up your wicked cruelty to a poor
girl! How would you like your comrades to say &lsquo;Look out, Bill, your pore
wife&rsquo;s &rsquo;anging about the gates&rsquo; and to have to lie
low&mdash;and send out scouts to see if the coast was clear later on?
Don&rsquo;t you go playing fast and loose with <i>me</i>, master Dam, winning
my young affections, making love to me, kissing me&mdash;and then refusing to
marry me after it all! I don&rsquo;t want to be too hard on you (and I am
reasonable enough to admit that one-and-two a day puts things on a smaller
scale than I have been accustomed to in the home of my fathers&mdash;or rather
uncles, or perhaps uncles-in-law), and like the kind Tailor whom the Haddock
advertises (and like the unkind Judge before whom he&rsquo;ll some day come for
something) I will &lsquo;give you time&rsquo;. But it&rsquo;s only a respite,
Mr. de Warrenne. You are not going to trifle with my young feelings and escape
altogether. I have my eye on you&mdash;and if I respect your one-and-twopence a
day <i>now</i>, it is on the clear understanding that you share my Little All
on the day I come of age. I will trust you once more, although you <i>have</i>
treated me so&mdash;bolting and hiding from your confiding fiancÃ©e.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So write and tell me what you call yourself, so that I can write to you
regularly and satisfy myself that you are not escaping me again. How
<i>could</i> you treat a poor trusting female so&mdash;and then when she had
found you again, and was showing her delight and begging to be married and
settled in life&mdash;to rush away from her, leaving her and her modest
matrimonial proposals scorned and rejected! For shame, Sir! I&rsquo;ve a good
mind to come and complain to your Colonel and ask him to make you keep your
solemn promises and marry meâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now look here, darling, nonsense aside&mdash;I solemnly swear that if
you don&rsquo;t buy yourself out of the army on the day I come of age (or
before, if you will, and can) I will really come and make you marry me and I
will live with you as a soldier&rsquo;s wife. If you persist in your
wrong-headed notion of being a &lsquo;disgrace&rsquo; (<i>you</i>!) then
we&rsquo;ll just adopt the army as a career, and we&rsquo;ll go through all the
phases till you get a Commission. I hope you won&rsquo;t take this
course&mdash;but if you do, you&rsquo;ll be a second Hector Macdonald and
retire as Lieutenant-General Sir Damocles de Warrenne (K.C.B., K.C.M.G.,
K.C.S.I., D.S.O., and, of course, V.C.), having confessed to an <i>alias</i>.
It will be a long time before we should be in really congenial society, that
way, darling, but I&rsquo;m sure I should enjoy every hour of it with you, so
long as I felt I was a comfort and happiness to you. And when you got your
Commission I should not be a social drag upon you as sometimes happens. Nor
before it should I be a nuisance and hindrance to you and make you wish you
were &lsquo;shut of the curse of a soldier&rsquo;. I could &lsquo;rough
it&rsquo; as well as you and, besides, there would <i>be</i> no &lsquo;roughing
it&rsquo; where you were, for me. It is <i>here</i> that I am &lsquo;roughing
it,&rsquo; sitting impotent and wondering what is happening to you, and whether
that terrible illness ever seizes you, and whether you are properly looked
after when it does.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, just realize, dearest Dam&mdash;I said I would wait twenty years
for you, if necessary. I would and I will, but don&rsquo;t make me do it,
darling. Realize how happy I should be if I could only come and sew and cook
and scrub and work for you. Can you understand that life is only measurable in
terms of happiness and that <i>my</i> happiness can only be where <i>you,</i>
are? If you weren&rsquo;t liable to these seizures I could bear to wait, but as
it is, I can&rsquo;t. I beg and beseech you not to make me wait till I am of
age, Dam. There&rsquo;s no telling what may happen to you and I just
can&rsquo;t bear it. <i>I&rsquo;m coming</i>, if I don&rsquo;t hear from you,
and I can easily do something to compel you to marry me, if I come. You are
<i>not</i> going to bear this alone, darling, so don&rsquo;t imagine it.
We&rsquo;re not going to keep separate shops after all these years, just
because you&rsquo;re ill with a trouble of some kind that fools can&rsquo;t
understand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now write to me at once and put me in a position to write to you in the
ordinary way&mdash;or look out for me! I&rsquo;m all ready to run away, all
sorts of useful things packed&mdash;ready to come and be a soldier&rsquo;s
girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know that I <i>do</i> what I think I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;you spoke of
my &lsquo;steel-straight directness and sweet brave will&rsquo; in the poem you
were making about me, you poor funny old boy, when you vanished, and which I
found in your room when I went there to cry, (Oh, <i>how</i> I cried when I
found your odds and ends of verse about me there&mdash;I really did think my
heart was &lsquo;broken&rsquo; in actual fact.) Don&rsquo;t make me suffer any
more, darling. I&rsquo;m sure your Colonel will be sweet about it and give us a
nice little house all to ourselves, now he has seen what a splendid soldier you
are. If you stick to your folly about &lsquo;disgrace&rsquo; I need not tell
him our names and Grumper couldn&rsquo;t take me away from you, even if he ever
found out where we were.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could go on writing all night, darling, but I&rsquo;ll only just say
again <i>I am going to marry you and take care of you, Dam, in the army or out
of it.</i>
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;Your fiancee and friend,Â Â Â Â <br/>
&ldquo;L<small>UCILLE</small> G<small>AVESTONE</small>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam groaned aloud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Four o&rsquo; rum &rsquo;ot, is wot <i>you</i> want, mate, for
that,&rdquo; said the industrious self-improver at the shelf-table. &ldquo;Got
a chill on yer stummick on sentry-go in the fog an&rsquo; rine las&rsquo;
nightâ€¦. I&rsquo;d give a &rsquo;ogs&rsquo;ead to see the bloke who wrote in the
bloomin&rsquo; Reggilashuns <i>&lsquo;nor must bloomin&rsquo; sentries stand in
their blasted sentry-boxes in good or even in moderate-weather&rsquo;</i> a
doin&rsquo; of it &rsquo;isself in &rsquo;is bloomin&rsquo; &lsquo;moderate
weather&rsquo; with water a runnin&rsquo; down &rsquo;is back, an&rsquo;
&rsquo;is feet froze into a puddle, an&rsquo; the fog a chokin&rsquo; of
&rsquo;im, an&rsquo; &rsquo;is blighted carbine feelin&rsquo; like a yard
o&rsquo; bad ice&mdash;an&rsquo; then find the bloomin&rsquo; winder above
&rsquo;is bed been opened by some kind bloke an&rsquo; &rsquo;is bed a blasted
swampâ€¦ Yus&mdash;you &rsquo;ave four o&rsquo; rum &rsquo;ot and you&rsquo;ll
feel like the bloomin&rsquo; &rsquo;Ouse o&rsquo; Lords. Then &rsquo;ave a
Livin&rsquo;stone Rouser.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, shut up,&rdquo; said Dam, cursing
the Bathos of Things and returning to the beginning of Lucille&rsquo;s letter.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
In his somewhat incoherent reply, Dam assured Lucille that he was in the rudest
health and spirits, and the particular pet of his Colonel who inquired after
his health almost daily with tender solicitude; that he had exaggerated his
feeling on That Evening when he had kissed Lucille as a lover, and begged
forgiveness; that marriage would seriously hamper a most promising military
career; that he had had no recurrence of the &ldquo;fit&rdquo; (a mere touch of
sun); that it would be unkind and unfair of Lucille to bring scandal and
disgrace upon a rising young soldier by hanging about the Lines and making
inquiries about him with a view to forcing him into marriage, making him keep
to a bargain made in a rash, unguarded moment of sentimentality; that, in any
case, soldiers could not marry until they had a certain income and status, and,
if they did so, it was no marriage and they were sent to jail; that his worst
enemy would not do anything to drag him out once again into the light of
publicity, and disgrace his family further, now that he had effectually
disappeared and was being forgotten; and that he announced that he was known as
Trooper Matthewson (E Troop, The Queen&rsquo;s Greys, Cavalry Lines,
Shorncliffe) to prevent Lucille from keeping her most unladylike promise of
persecuting him.
</p>

<p>
Lucille&rsquo;s next letter was shorter than the first.
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;M<small>Y DARLING</small> D<small>AM</small>,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a <i>priceless</i> Ass. Come off it.
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;Your ownÂ Â Â Â <br/>
&ldquo;L<small>UCILLE</small>.
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Write to me properly at once&mdash;or expect me on
Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He obeyed, poured out his whole heart in love and thanks and blessings, and
persuaded her that the one thing that could increase his misery would be her
presence, and swore that he would strain every nerve to appear before her at
the earliest possible moment a free man with redeemed name&mdash;provided he
could persuade himself he was not <i>a congenital lunatic, an epileptic, a
decadent&mdash;could cure himself of his mental diseaseâ€¦.</i>

<h2><a name="chap11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br/>
MORE MYRMIDONS.</h2>

<p>
The truly busy man cannot be actively and consciously unhappy. The truly
miserable and despondent person is never continuously and actively employed.
Fits of deep depression there may be for the worker when work is impossible,
but, unless there be mental and physical illness, sleep is the other
anaesthetic, refuge&mdash;and reward.
</p>

<p>
The Wise thank God for Work and for Sleep&mdash;and pay large premia of the
former as Insurance in the latter.
</p>

<p>
To Damocles de Warrenne&mdash;to whom the name &ldquo;Trooper Matthewson&rdquo;
now seemed the only one he had ever had&mdash;the craved necessity of life and
sanity was <i>work</i>, occupation, mental and physical labour. He would have
blessed the man who sentenced him to commence the digging of a trench ten miles
long and a yard deep for morning and evening labour, and to take over all the
accounts of each squadron, for employment in the heat of the day. There was no
man in the regiment so indefatigable, so energetic, so persevering, so
insatiable of &ldquo;fatigues,&rdquo; so willing and anxious to do other
people&rsquo;s duty as well as his own, so restless, so untiring as Trooper
Matthewson of E Troop. For Damocles de Warrenne was in the Land of the Serpent
and lived in fear. He lived in fear and feared to live; he thought of Fear and
feared to think. He turned to work as, but for the memory of Lucille, he would
have turned to drink: he laboured to earn deep dreamless sleep and he dreaded
sleep. Awake, he could drug himself with work; asleep, he was the
prey&mdash;the bound, gagged helpless, abject prey&mdash;of the Snake. The
greediest glutton for work in the best working regiment in the world was
Trooper Matthewson&mdash;but for him was no promotion. He was, alas,
&ldquo;unreliable&rdquo;&mdash;apt to be &ldquo;drunk and disorderly,&rdquo;
drunk to the point of &ldquo;seeing snakes&rdquo; and becoming a weeping,
screaming lunatic&mdash;a disgusting spectacle. And, when brought up for
sentence, would solemnly assure the Colonel that he was <i>a total
abstainer</i>, and stick to it when &ldquo;told-off&rdquo; for adding impudent
lying to shameful indulgence and sickening behaviour. No promotion for that
type of waster while Colonel the Earl of A&mdash;&mdash; commanded the
Queen&rsquo;s Greys, nor while Captain Daunt commanded the squadron the trooper
occasionally disgraced.
</p>

<p>
But he had his points, mark you, and it was a thousand pities that so fine a
soldier was undeniably subject to attacks of <i>delirium tremens</i> and
unmistakeably a secret drinker who might at any time have a violent outburst,
finishing in screams, sobs, and tears. A <i>most</i> remarkable case! Who ever
heard of a magnificent athlete&mdash;regimental champion boxer and swordsman,
admittedly as fine and bold a horseman and horse-master as the Rough-Riding
Sergeant-Major or the Riding-Master himself&mdash;being a sufficiently
industrious secret-drinker to get &ldquo;goes&rdquo; of &ldquo;d.t.,&rdquo; to
drink till he behaved like some God-and-man-forsaken wretch that lives on cheap
gin in a chronic state of alcoholism. He had his points, and if the Brigadier
had ever happened to say to the Colonel: &ldquo;Send me your smartest, most
intelligent, and keenest man to gallop for me at the manoeuvres,&rdquo; or the
Inspector of Army Gymnasia had asked for the regiment&rsquo;s finest specimen,
or if one representative private soldier had to be sent somewhere to uphold the
credit and honour of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys, undoubtedly Trooper Matthewson
would have been chosen.
</p>

<p>
What a splendid squadron-sergeant major, regimental sergeant-major, yea, what a
fine officer he would have made, had he been reliable. But there, you
can&rsquo;t have an officer, nor a non-com., either, who lies shrieking and
blubbering on the floor <i>coram publico</i>, and screams to God and man to
save him from the snakes that exist only in his own drink-deranged mind. For of
course it can only be Drink that produces &ldquo;Snakes&rdquo;! Yes, it is only
through the ghastly alcohol-tinted glasses that you can &ldquo;see
snakes&rdquo;&mdash;any fool knows <i>that</i>.
</p>

<p>
And the fools of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys knew it, and hoped to God that
Matthewson would &ldquo;keep off it&rdquo; till after the Divisional Boxing
Tournament and Assault-at-Arms, for, if he did, the Queen&rsquo;s Greys would
certainly have the Best Man-at-Arms in the Division and have a mighty good shot
at having the Heavy-Weight All-India Champion, since Matthewson had challenged
the Holder and held an absolutely unbroken record of victories in the various
regimental and inter-regimental boxing tournaments in which he had taken part
since joining the regiment. And he had been &ldquo;up against some useful
lads&rdquo; as Captain Chevalier, the president and Maecenas of the
Queen&rsquo;s Greys&rsquo; boxing-club, expressed it. Yes, Matthewson had his
points and the man who brought the Regiment the kudos of having best
Man-at-Arms and Heavy-Weight Champion of India would be forgiven a lot.
</p>

<p>
And Damocles de Warrenne blessed the Divisional Boxing Tournament,
Assault-at-Arms, and, particularly, the All-India Heavy-Weight Championship.
</p>

<p>
Occupation, labour, anodyneâ€¦. Work and deep Sleep. Fighting to keep the Snake
at bay. No, fighting to get away from it&mdash;there was no keeping it at
bay&mdash;nothing but shrieking collapse when It cameâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
From parade ground to gymnasium, from gymnasium to swimming-bath, from
swimming-bath to running-track, from running-track to boxing-ring, from
boxing-ring to gymnasium again. Work, occupation, forgetfulness. Forget the
Snake for a little while&mdash;even though it is surely lurking
near&mdash;waiting, waiting, waiting; nay, even beneath his very foot and
<i>moving</i>â€¦.
</p>

<p>
Well, a man can struggle with himself until the Thing actually appears in the
concrete, and he goes mad&mdash;but Night! Oh, God grant deep sleep at
night&mdash;or wide wakefulness <i>and a light</i>. Neither Nightmare nor
wakefulness <i>in the dark</i>, oh, Merciful God.
</p>

<p>
Yes, things were getting worse. <i>He was going mad. MAD</i>. Desert&mdash;and
get out of India somehow?
</p>

<p>
Never! No gentleman &ldquo;deserts&rdquo; anything or anybody.
</p>

<p>
Suicide&mdash;and face God unafraid and unashamed?
</p>

<p>
Never! The worst and meanest form of &ldquo;deserting&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
No. Stick it. And live to work&mdash;work to live. And strive and strive and
strive to obliterate the image of Lucille&mdash;that sorrow&rsquo;s crown of
sorrow.
</p>

<p>
And so Trooper Matthewson&rsquo;s course of training was a severe one and he
appeared to fear rest and relaxation as some people fear work and employment.
</p>

<p>
His favourite occupation was to get the ten best boxers of the regiment to
jointly engage in a ten-round contest with him, one round each. He would
frequently finish fresher than the tenth man. Coming of notedly powerful stock
on both sides, and having been physically <i>educated</i> from babyhood, Dam,
with clean living and constant training, was a very uncommon specimen. There
may have been one or two other men in the regiment as well developed, or nearly
so; but when poise, rapidity, and skill were taken into account there was no
one near him. Captain Chevalier said he was infinitely the quickest
heavy-weight boxer he had ever seen&mdash;and Captain Chevalier was a pillar of
the National Sporting Club and always knew the current professionals personally
when he was in England. In fact, with the enormous strength of the best
heavy-weight, Dam combined the lightning rapidity and mobility of the best
feather-weight.
</p>

<p>
His own doubt as to the result of his contest with the heavy-weight Champion of
India arose from the fact that the latter was a person of much lower nervous
development, a creature far less sensitive to shock, a denser and more
elementary organism altogether, and possessed of a far thicker skull, shorter
jaw, and thicker neck. Dam summed him up thus with no sense of contemptuous
superiority, but with a plain recognition of the facts that the Champion was a
fighting machine, a dull, foreheadless, brutal gladiator who owed his
championship very largely to the fact that he was barely sensible to pain, and
impervious to padded blows. It was said that he had never been knocked out in
all his boxing-career, that the kick of a horse on his chin would not knock him
out, that his head was solid bone, and that the shortness of his jaw and
thickness of his neck absolutely prevented sufficient leverage between the
point of the jaw and the spinal cord for the administration of the shock to the
<i>medulla oblongata</i> that causes the necessary ten-seconds&rsquo;
unconsciousness of the &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
He was known as the Gorilla by reason of his long arms, incredible strength,
beauty, and pleasing habits, and he bore the reputation of a merciless and
unchivalrous opponent and one who needed the strictest and most experienced
refereeing. It would be a real terrific fight, and that was the main thing to
Dam, though he would do his very utmost to win, for the credit of the
Queen&rsquo;s Greys, and would leave no stone unturned to that end. He
regretted that he could not get leave and go to Pultanpur to see the Champion
box, and learn something of his style and methods when easily defending his
title in the Pultanpur tournament. And when the Tournament and Assault-at-Arms
were over he must find something else to occupy him by day and tire him before
night. Meanwhile life was bearable, with the fight to come&mdash;except for
sentry-go work. That was awful, unspeakable, and each time was worse than the
last. Sitting up all night in the guard-room under the big lamp, and perhaps
with some other wakeful wretch to talk to, was nothing. That was well
enough&mdash;but to be on a lonely post on a dark night â€¦ well&mdash;he
couldn&rsquo;t do it much longer.
</p>

<p>
Darkness and the Snake that was always coming and never came! To prowl round
and round some magazine, store, or boundary-stone with his carbine at the
&ldquo;support,&rdquo; or to tramp up and down by the horse-lines, armed only
with his cutting-whip; to stand in a sentry-box while the rain fell in sheets
and there was no telling what the next flash of lightning might
reveal&mdash;that was what would send him to a lunatic&rsquo;s padded cell.
</p>

<p>
To see the Snake by day would give him a cruel, terrible fit&mdash;but to be
aware of it in the dark would be final&mdash;and fatal to his reason (which was
none too firmly enthroned). No, he had the dreadful feeling that his reason was
none too solidly based and fixed. He had horrible experiences, apart from the
snake-nightmares, nowadays. One night when he awoke and lay staring up at his
mosquito-curtain in the blessed light of the big room-lamp (always provided in
India on account of rifle thieves) he had suddenly felt an overwhelming surge
of fear. He sat up. God!&mdash;he was in a marble box! These white walls and
roof were not mosquito-netting, they were solid marble! He was in a tomb. He
was buried alive. The air was growing foul. His screams would be absolutely
inaudible. He screamed, and struck wildly at the cold cruel marble, and found
it was soft, yielding netting after all. But it was a worse horror to find that
he had thought it marble than if he had found it to be marble. He sprang from
his cot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am going mad,&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Goin&rsquo;?â€¦ <i>Gorn</i>, more like,&rdquo; observed the disrobing
room-corporal. &ldquo;Why donchew keep orf the booze, Maffewson? You silly
gapin&rsquo; goat. Git inter bed and shut yer &rsquo;ead&mdash;or I&rsquo;ll
get yew a night in clink, me lad&mdash;and wiv&rsquo;out a light, see?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Corporal Prag knew his victim&rsquo;s little weakness and grinned maliciously
as Dam sprang into bed without a word.
</p>

<p>
The Stone Jug without a gleam of light! Could a man choke himself with his own
fingers if the worst came to the worst? The Digger and Stygian
darkness&mdash;now&mdash;<i>when he was going mad</i>! Men could not be so
cruelâ€¦. But they&rsquo;d say he was drunk. He would lie still and cling with
all his strength and heart and soul to sanity. He would think of That Evening
with Lucille&mdash;and of her kisses. He would recite the Odes of Horace, the
Aeneid, the Odyssey as far as he could remember them, and then fall back on
Shakespeare and other English poets. Probably he knew a lot more Greek and
Latin poetry (little as it was) than he did of Englishâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Corporal Prag improved the occasion as he unlaced his boots.
&ldquo;Bloomin&rsquo; biby! Afraid o&rsquo; the dark! See wot boozin&rsquo;
brings yer to. Look at yer! An&rsquo; look at <i>me</i>.
Non-c&rsquo;misshn&rsquo;d orficer in free an&rsquo; a &rsquo;arf years from
j&rsquo;inin&rsquo;. Never tasted alc&rsquo;ol in me life, an&rsquo; if any man
offud me a glarse, d&rsquo;ye know what I&rsquo;d <i>dew</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Corporal, I&rsquo;d like to hear,&rdquo; replied Dam. (Must keep the
animal talking as long as possible for the sake of human company. He&rsquo;d go
mad at once, perhaps, when the Corporal went to bed.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d frow it strite in &rsquo;is faice, I would,&rdquo; announced
the virtuous youth. A big boot flopped heavily on the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay you come of good old teetotal stock,&rdquo; observed Dam, to
make conversation. Perhaps the fellow would pause in his assault upon the other
boot and reply&mdash;so lengthening out the precious minutes of diversion.
Every minute was a minute nearer dawnâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Do</i> yer? Well, you&rsquo;re bloomin&rsquo; well wrong, Maffewson,
me lad. My farver &rsquo;ad a bout every Saturday arternoon and kep&rsquo; it
up all day a Sund&rsquo;y, &rsquo;e did&mdash;an&rsquo; in the werry las&rsquo;
bout &rsquo;e ever &rsquo;ad &rsquo;e bashed &rsquo;is ole woman&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ead in wiv&rsquo; a bottle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And was hanged?&rdquo; inquired Dam politely and innocently, but most
tactlessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mind yer own b&mdash;&mdash; business,&rdquo; roared Corporal Prag.
&ldquo;Other people&rsquo;s farvers wasn&rsquo;t gallows-birds if yourn was.
&rsquo;Ow&rsquo;d you look if I come and punched you on the nose, eh? Wot
&rsquo;ud you do if I come an&rsquo; set abaht yer, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Break your neck,&rdquo; replied Dam tersely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ho, yus. <i>And</i> wot &rsquo;ud yew say when I calls the guard and
they frows you into clink? Without no light, Trooper Maffewson!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dam shuddered.
</p>

<p>
Corporal Prag yet further improved the occasion, earning Dam&rsquo;s heartfelt
blessing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fergit it, Trooper Maffewson. I&rsquo;m yore sooperier
orficer. You <i>may</i> be better&rsquo;n me in the Ring, praps, or with the
sword (Dam could have killed him in five minutes, with or without weapons), but
if I &rsquo;olds up my little finger <i>you</i> comes to &rsquo;eel&mdash;or
other&rsquo;ow you goes ter clink. &rsquo;Ung indeed! You look after yer own
farver an&rsquo; don&rsquo; pass remarks on yer betters. Why! You boozin&rsquo;

bloomin&rsquo; discharged private wiv an &rsquo;undred

C&rsquo;missh&rsquo;ns&mdash;an&rsquo; don&rsquo; you fergit it! Farver
&rsquo;ung indeed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awf&rsquo;ly sorry, Corporal, really,&rdquo; apologized Dam.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t thinkâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, me lad,&rdquo; returned the unmollified superior, as he stooped to
the other boot, &ldquo;if you was to think more an&rsquo; booze less
you&rsquo;d do betterâ€¦. &rsquo;Ow an&rsquo; where you gets &rsquo;old of it,
beats me. I&rsquo;ve seed you in delirium trimmings but I ain&rsquo;t never

&rsquo;ed an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t chew the mop so much. Let me get some sleep.
<i>I</i> &rsquo;as respontsibillaties <i>I</i> doâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A crossing outside a Club! More likely a padded cell in a troopship and
hospital until an asylum claimed him.
</p>

<p>
In the finals, &ldquo;Sword versus Sword Dismounted,&rdquo; Dam had a foeman
worthy of his steel.
</p>

<p>
A glorious chilly morning, sunrise on a wide high open <i>maidan</i>, rows of
tents for the spectators at the great evening final, and crowds of officers and
men in uniform or gymnasium kit. On a group of chairs sat the Divisional
General, his Colonel on the Staff, and Aide-de-Camp; the Brigadier-General, his
Brigade-Major, and a few ladies, wives of regimental colonels, officers, and
leading Civilians.
</p>

<p>
Semi-finals of Tent-pegging, Sword v. Sword Mounted, Bayonet-fighting,
Tug-of-War, Fencing, and other officers&rsquo; and men&rsquo;s events had been,
or were being, contested.
</p>

<p>
The finals of the British Troops&rsquo; Sword <i>v.</i> Sword Dismounted, was
being reserved for the last, as of supreme interest to the experts present, but
not sufficiently spectacular to be kept for the evening final
&ldquo;show,&rdquo; when the whole of Society would assemble to be thrilled by
the final Jumping, Driving, Tent-pegging, Sword <i>v.</i> Sword Mounted,
Bayonet-fighting, Sword <i>v.</i> Lance, Tug-of-War, and other events for
British and Indian officers and men of all arms.
</p>

<p>
It was rumoured that there was a Sergeant of Hussars who would give Trooper
Matthewson a warm time with the sabre. As the crowd of competitors and
spectators gathered round the sabres-ring, and chairs were carried up for the
Generals, ladies, and staff, to witness the last and most exciting contest of
the morning&rsquo;s meeting, a Corporal-official of the Assault-at-Arms
Executive Committee called aloud, &ldquo;Sergeant O&rsquo;Malley, 14th Hussars,
get ready,&rdquo; and another fastened a red band to the Sergeant&rsquo;s arm
as he stepped forward, clad in leather jacket and leg-guards and carrying the
heavy iron-and-leather head-guard necessary in sabre combats, and the
blunt-edged, blunt-pointed sabre.
</p>

<p>
Dam approached him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let my point rest on your hilt, Sergeant,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; inquired the surprised and suspicious
Sergeant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My little trick. I thrust rather than cut, you know,&rdquo; said Dam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch it, me lad,&rdquo; returned Sergeant O&rsquo;Malley,
wondering whether Dam were fool or knave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Trooper Matthewson, get ready,&rdquo; called the Corporal, and Dam
stepped into the ring, saluted, and faced the Sergeant.
</p>

<p>
A brief direction and caution, the usual preliminary, and the word&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On guard&mdash;<i>Play</i>&rdquo; and Dam was parrying a series of the
quickest cuts he had ever met. The Sergeant&rsquo;s sword flickered like the
tongue of a&mdash;<i>Snake</i>. Yes&mdash;of a <i>Snake</i>! and even as
Dam&rsquo;s hand dropped limp and nerveless, the Sergeant&rsquo;s sword fell
with a dull heavy thud on his head-guard. The stroke would have split
Dam&rsquo;s head right neatly, in actual fighting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; shouted the referee. &ldquo;Point to Red.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On guard&mdash;<i>Play</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But if the Sergeant&rsquo;s sword flickered like the tongue of a
snake&mdash;why then Dam must be fighting the Snake. <i>Fighting the Snake</i>
and in another second the referee again cried &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; And added,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fight savage, White, or I&rsquo;ll disqualify you&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awf&rsquo;ly sorry,&rdquo; said Dam, &ldquo;I thought I was
fighting the Sn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue, and don&rsquo;t argue,&rdquo; replied the referee
sternly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On Guard&mdash;<i>Play</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ere the Sergeant could move his sword from its upward-inclined position
Dam&rsquo;s blade dropped to its hilt, shot in over it, and as the Sergeant
raised his forearm in guard, flashed beneath it and bent on his breast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; cried the referee. &ldquo;Point to White.
Double&rdquo;&mdash;two marks being then awarded for the thrust hit, and one
for the cut.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On guard&mdash;<i>Play</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Absolutely the same thing happened again within the next half-second, and Dam
had won the British Troops&rsquo; Sword <i>v</i>. Sword Dismounted, in addition
to being in for the finals in Tent-pegging, Sword <i>v</i>. Sword Mounted,
Jumping (Individual and By Sections), Sword <i>v</i>. Lance, and Tug-of-War.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now jest keep orf it, Matthewson, and sweep the bloomin&rsquo;
board,&rdquo; urged Troop-Sergeant-Major Scoles as Dam removed his
fencing-jacket, preparatory to returning to barracks. &ldquo;You be Best
Man-at-arms in the Division and win everythink that&rsquo;s open to British
Troops Mounted, and git the &rsquo;Eavy-Weight Championship from the
Gorilla&mdash;an&rsquo; there&rsquo;ll be some talk about promotion for yer, me
lad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Sergeant,&rdquo; replied Dam. &ldquo;I am a total
abstainer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yah! <i>Chuck</i> it,&rdquo; observed the Sergeant-Major.
</p>

<p>
<i>Of no interest to Women nor modern civilized Men</i>.
</p>

<p>
The long-anticipated hour had struck, the great moment had arrived, and
(literally) thousands of British soldiers sat in a state of expectant thrill
and excited interest, awaiting the appearance of the Gorilla (Corporal Dowdall
of the 111th Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery&mdash;fourteen stone twelve) and
Trooper Matthewson (Queen&rsquo;s Greys&mdash;fourteen stone) who were to fight
for the Elliott Belt, the Motipur Cup, and the Heavy-Weight Championship of
India.
</p>

<p>
The Boxing Tournament had lasted for a week and had been a huge success. Now
came the <i>piÃ¨ce de resistance, the</i> fight of the Meeting, the event for
which special trains had brought hundreds of civilians and soldiers from
neighbouring and distant cantonments. Bombay herself sent a crowded train-load,
and it was said that a, by no means small, contingent had come from Madras.
Certainly more than one sporting patron of the Great Sport, the Noble Art, the
Manly Game, had travelled from far Calcutta. So well-established was the fame
of the great Gorilla, and so widely published the rumour that the Queen&rsquo;s
Greys had a prodigy who&rsquo;d lower his flag in ten rounds&mdash;or less.
</p>

<p>
A great square of the grassy plain above Motipur had been enclosed by a high
canvas wall, and around a twenty-four foot raised &ldquo;ring&rdquo; (which was
square) seating accommodation for four thousand spectators had been provided.
The front rows consisted of arm-chairs, sofas, and drawing-room settees (from
the wonderful stock of Mr. Dadabhoy Pochajee Furniturewallah of the Sudder
Bazaar) for the officers and leading civilians of Motipur, and such other
visitors as chose to purchase the highly priced reserved-seat tickets.
</p>

<p>
Not only was every seat in the vast enclosure occupied, but every square inch
of standing-room, by the time the combatants entered the arena.
</p>

<p>
A few dark faces were to be seen (Native Officers of the pultans<a href="#fn23" name="fnref23" id="fnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
and rissal<a href="#fn24" name="fnref24" id="fnref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> of
the Motipur Brigade), and the idea occurred to not a few that it was a pity the
proceedings could not be witnessed by every Indian in India. It would do them
good in more ways than one.
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p>
Although a large number of the enormously preponderating military spectators
were in the khaki kit so admirable for work (and so depressing, unswanksome and
anti-enlistment for play, or rather for walking-out and leisure), the
experienced eye could see that almost every corps in India furnished
contingents to the gathering. Lancers, dragoons, hussars, artillery, riflemen,
Highlanders, supply and transport, infantry of a score of regiments, and, rare
sight away from the Ports, a small party of Man-o&rsquo;-War&rsquo;s-men in
white duck, blue collars, and straw hats (huge, solemn-faced men who jested
with grimmest seriousness of mien and insulted each other outrageously).
Officers in scarlet, in dark blue, in black and cherry colour, in fawn and
cherry colour, in pale blue and silver, in almost every combination of colours,
showed that the commissioned ranks of the British and Indian Services were well
represented, horse, foot, guns, engineers, doctors, and veterinary
surgeons&mdash;every rank and every branch. On two sides of the roped ring,
with its padded posts, sat the judges, boxing Captains both, who had won
distinction at Aldershot and in many a local tournament. On another side sat
the referee, <i>ex</i>-Public-Schools Champion, Aldershot Light-Weight
Champion, and, admittedly, the best boxer of his weight among the officers of
the British Army. Beside him sat the time-keeper. Overhead a circle of large
incandescent lamps made the scene as bright as day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, d&rsquo;you take it?&rdquo; asked Seaman Jones of Seaman Smith.
&ldquo;Better strike while the grog&rsquo;s &rsquo;ot. A double-prick o&rsquo;
baccy and a gallon o&rsquo; four-&rsquo;arf, evens, on the Griller. I
ain&rsquo;t never &rsquo;eard o&rsquo; the Griller till we come &rsquo;ere, and
I never &rsquo;eard o&rsquo; t&rsquo;other bloke neether&mdash;but I
&rsquo;olds by the Griller, cos of &rsquo;is name and I backs me fancy afore I
sees &rsquo;em.&mdash;Loser to &rsquo;elp the winner with the gallon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Done, Bill,&rdquo; replied the challenged promptly, on hearing the last
condition. (He could drink as fast as Bill if he lost, and he could borrer on
the baccy till it was wore out.) &ldquo;Got that bloomin&rsquo;
&rsquo;igh-falutin&rsquo; lar-de-dar giddy baccy-pouch and yaller baccy you
inwested in at Bombay?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yus, &rsquo;Enery,&rdquo;
replied William, diving deeply for it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then push it &rsquo;ere, an&rsquo; likewise them bloomin&rsquo;
&rsquo;igh-falutin&rsquo; lar-de-dar giddy fag-papers you fumble wiv&rsquo;.
Blimey! ain&rsquo;t a honest clay good enough for yer now? I knows wots the
matter wiv <i>you</i>, Billy Jones! You&rsquo;ve got a weather-heye on the
Quarter Deck you &rsquo;ave. You fink you&rsquo;re agoin&rsquo; to be a
blighted perishin&rsquo; orficer you do! Yus, you flat-footed matlot&mdash;not
even a blasted tiffy you ain&rsquo;t, and you buys a blighted baccy-pouch and
yaller baccy and fag-pipers, like a Snottie, an&rsquo; reckons you&rsquo;s on
the &rsquo;igh road to be a bloomin&rsquo; Winnie Lloyd Gorgeous Orficer.
&rsquo;And &rsquo;em &rsquo;ere&mdash;fore I&rsquo;m sick.
Lootenant,&mdash;Gunnery Jack,&mdash;Number One,&mdash;Commerdore!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Parding me, &rsquo;Enery Smiff,&rdquo; returned William Jones with quiet
dignity. &ldquo;In consequents o&rsquo; wot you said, an&rsquo; more in
consequents o&rsquo; yore clumsy fat fingers not been used to
&rsquo;andlin&rsquo; dellikit objex, and most in consequents o&rsquo; yore been

&rsquo;ighly competent so fer to do. Not but wot a fag&rsquo;ll look most outer
place in <i>your</i> silly great ugly faice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The other sailor watched the speaker in cold contempt as he prepared a
distinctly exiguous, ill-fed cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Harthur Handrews,&rdquo; he said, turning to his other neighbour,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave yew &rsquo;appened to see the Master Sail-maker or any of
&rsquo;is mermydiuns &rsquo;ere-abahts, by any chawnst?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nope. &rsquo;An don&rsquo; want. Don&rsquo; wan&rsquo; see nothink to

</p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Willyerm Jones is amakin&rsquo; a needle for &rsquo;im.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As &rsquo;ow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wiv a fag-paper an&rsquo; a thread o&rsquo; yaller baccy.
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; a bloomin&rsquo; needle,&rdquo; and with a sudden
grab he possessed himself of the pouch, papers, and finished product of Seaman
Jones&rsquo;s labours and generosity.
</p>

<p>
Having pricked himself severely and painfully with the alleged cigarette, he
howled with pain, cast it from him, proceeded to stick two papers together and
to make an uncommonly stout, well-nourished, and bounteous cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I &rsquo;fought I offered you to make yourself a cigarette,
&rsquo;Enery,&rdquo; observed the astounded owner of the <i>materia
nicotina</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I grabbed for to make myself a cigarette, Willyerm,&rdquo; was the
pedantically correct restatement of Henry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why go for to try an&rsquo; mannyfacter a bloomin&rsquo;
banana?&rdquo; asked the indignant victim, whose further remarks were drowned
in the roars of applause which greeted the appearance from the dressing-tents
of the Champion and the Challenger.
</p>

<p>
Dam and Corporal Dowdall entered the ring from opposite corners, seated
themselves in the chairs provided for them, and submitted themselves to the
ministrations of their respective seconds.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Herbert Hawker violently chafed Dam&rsquo;s legs, Trooper Bear his arms
and chest, while Trooper Goate struggled to force a pair of new boxing-gloves
upon his hands, which were scientifically bandaged around knuckles, back, and
wrist, against untimely dislocations and sprains.
</p>

<p>
Clean water was poured into the bowls which stood behind each chair, and fresh
resin was sprinkled over the canvas-covered boards of the Ring.
</p>

<p>
Men whose favourite &ldquo;carried their money&rdquo; (and each carried a good
deal) anxiously studied that favourite&rsquo;s opponent.
</p>

<p>
The Queen&rsquo;s Greys beheld a gorilla indeed, a vast, square, long-armed
hairy monster, with the true pugilist face and head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot a werry ugly bloke,&rdquo; observed Seaman Arthur Andrews to Seaman
Henry Smith. &ldquo;&rsquo;E reminds me o&rsquo; Hadmiral Sir Percy
&rsquo;Opkinton, so &rsquo;e do. P&rsquo;raps &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a pore
relation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yus,&rdquo; agreed Seaman Smith. &ldquo;A crost between our beloved
&rsquo;Oppy an&rsquo; ole Bill Jones &rsquo;ere. Bill was reported to
&rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad a twin brother&mdash;but it was allus serposed Bill ate
&rsquo;im when &rsquo;e wasn&rsquo; lookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The backers of Corporal Dowdall were encouraged at seeing a man who looked like
a gentleman and bore none of the traditional marks of the prize-fighter. His
head was not cropped to the point of bristly baldness, his nose was unbroken,
his eyes well opened and unblackened, his ears unthickened, his body
untattooed. He had the white skin, small trim moustache, high-bred features,
small extremities, and general appearance and bearing of an officer.
</p>

<p>
Ho, G&rsquo;rilla Dowdall would make short work of <i>that</i> tippy young
toff. Why, look at him!
</p>

<p>
And indeed it made you shudder to think of that enormous ferocity, that dynamic
truculence, doing its best to destroy you in a space twenty-four feet square.
</p>

<p>
Let the challenger wait till G&rsquo;rilla put his fighting face on&mdash;fair
terrifyin&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
Not an Artilleryman but felt sure that the garrison-gunner would successfully
defend the title and &ldquo;give the swankin&rsquo; Queen&rsquo;s Greys
something to keep them <i>choop</i><a href="#fn25" name="fnref25" id="fnref25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
for a bit. Gettin&rsquo; above &rsquo;emselves they was, becos&rsquo; this
bloke of theirs had won Best Man-at-Arms and had the nerve to challenge
G&rsquo;rilla Dowdall, R.G.A.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn25" id="fn25"></a> <a href="#fnref25">[25]</a>
Silent.
</p>

<p>
Even the R.H.A. admitted the R.G.A. to terms of perfect equality on that great
occasion.
</p>

<p>
But a few observant and experienced officers, gymnasium instructors, and
ancient followers of the Noble Art were not so sure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put steel-and-whalebone against granite and I back the former,&rdquo;
said Major Decoulis to Colonel Hanking; &ldquo;other things being equal of
course&mdash;skill and ring-craft. And I hear that No. 2&mdash;the
Queen&rsquo;s Greys&rsquo; man&mdash;is unusually fast for a
heavy-weight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him win,&rdquo; admitted the Colonel. &ldquo;The
man looks a gentleman. <i>Doesn&rsquo;t</i> the other look a Bill Sykes, by
Jove!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Staff Sergeant Instructor of the Motipur Gymnasium stepped into the ring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Silence, please,&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;Fifteen-round contest between
Corporal Dowdall, 111th Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery, Heavy-Weight
Champion of Hindia, fourteen twelve (Number 1&mdash;on my right &rsquo;and) and
Trooper Matthewson, Queen&rsquo;s Greys, fourteen stun (Number 2&mdash;on my
left &rsquo;and). Please keep silence durin&rsquo; the rounds. The winner is
Heavy-Weight Champion of Hindia, winner of the Motipur Cup and &rsquo;older of
the Elliott Belt. All ready there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both combatants were ready.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come here, both of you,&rdquo; said the referee.
</p>

<p>
As he arose to obey, Dam was irresistibly reminded of his fight with Bully
Harberth and smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nervous sort o&rsquo; grin on the figger-&rsquo;ead o&rsquo; the smaller
wessel, don&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; observed Seaman Smith.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be no grin on <i>your</i> fat face at all,&rdquo;
returned Seaman Jones. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be there. You&rsquo;d be
full-steam-ahead, bearings &rsquo;eated, and showin&rsquo; no lights, for them
tents&mdash;when you see wot you was up against.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The referee felt Dam&rsquo;s gloves to see that they contained no foreign
bodies in the shape of plummets of lead or other illegal gratifications. (He
had known a man fill the stuffing-compartments of his gloves with plaster of
Paris, that by the third or fourth round he might be striking with a kind of
stone cestus as the plaster moulded with sweat and water, and hardened to the
shape of the fist.)
</p>

<p>
As he stepped back, Dam looked for the first time at his opponent, conned his
bruiser face and Herculean body, and, with a gasp and shudder, was aware that a
huge tattooed serpent reared its head in the centre of his vast chest while
smaller ones encircled the mighty biceps of his arms. He clutched the rope and
leant trembling against the post as the referee satisfied himself (with very
great care in this case) of the innocence of the Gorilla&rsquo;s gloves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know you of old, Dowdall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I shall only
caution you once mind. Second offence&mdash;and out you go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Corporal Dowdall grinned sheepishly. He appeared to think that a delicate and
gentlemanly compliment had been paid to his general downiness, flyness, and
ring-craft,&mdash;the last of which, for Corporal Dowdall, included every form
of foul that a weak referee would pass, an inexperienced one misunderstand, or
a lazy one miss. Major O&rsquo;Halloran, first-class bruiser himself, was in
the habit of doing his refereeing inside the ring and within a foot or two of
the principals, where he expected foul play.
</p>

<p>
As the Major cautioned the Gorilla, Dam passed his hand wearily across his
face, swallowed once or twice and groaned aloud.
</p>

<p>
It was <i>not</i> fair. Why should the Snake be allowed to humiliate him before
thousands of spectators? Why should It be brought here to shame him in the
utmost publicity, to make him fail his comrades, disgrace his regiment, make
the Queen&rsquo;s Greys a laughing-stock?
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;he had fought an emissary of the Snake before&mdash;and he had won.
This villainous-looking pugilist was perhaps <i>the Snake Itself in human
form</i>&mdash;and, see, he was free, he was in God&rsquo;s open air, no chains
bound him, he was not gagged, this place was not a pit dug beneath the Pit
itself! This was all tangible and real. He would have fair play and be able to
defend himself. This was not a blue room with a mud floor. Nay, he would be
able to attack&mdash;to fight, fight like a wounded pantheress for her cubs.
This accursed Snake in Human Form would only be able to use puny fists. Mere
trivial human fists and human strength. Everything would be on the human plane.
It would be unable to wrap him in its awful coils and crush and crush the soul
and life and manhood out of him, as it did at night before burrowing its way
ten million miles below the floor of Hell with him, and immuring him in a
molten incandescent tomb where he could not even scream or writhe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get to your corners,&rdquo; said the referee, and Dam returned to his
place with a cruel smile upon his compressed lips. By the Merciful Living God
he had the Snake Itself delivered unto him in human form&mdash;to do with as he
could. Oh, that It might last out the fifteen times of facing him in his wrath,
his pent-up vengeful wrath at a ruined life, a dishonoured name and <i>a lost
Lucille!</i>
</p>

<p>
When would they give the word for him to spring upon it and batter it lifeless
to the ground?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grind yer silly teeth like that,&rdquo; whispered Hawker,
his grim ugly face white with anxiety and suspense (for he loved Damocles de
Warrenne as the faithfullest of hounds loves the best of masters).
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awastin&rsquo; henergy all the time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God! if they don&rsquo;t give the word in a minute I shall be unable to
hold off It,&rdquo; replied Dam wildly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sperrit, Cocky,&rdquo; approved Hawker, &ldquo;but
donchew fergit you gotter larst fifteen bloomin&rsquo; rahnds. &rsquo;Taint no
kindergarters. &rsquo;<i>E</i>&rsquo;ll stick it orlrite, an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll avter win on <i>points</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seconds out of the Ring,&rdquo; cried the time-keeper, staring at his
watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get knocked out, dear boy,&rdquo; implored Trooper Bear.
&ldquo;Fight to win on points. You <i>can&rsquo;t</i> knock him out. I&rsquo;m
going to pray like hell through the rounds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Time&rdquo;</i> barked the time-keeper, and, catching up the chair as
Dam rose, Trooper Bear dropped down from the boards of the ring to the turf,
where already crouched Hawker and Goate, looking like men about to be hanged.
</p>

<p>
The large assembly drew a deep breath as the combatants approached each other
with extended right hands&mdash;Dam clad in a pair of blue silk shorts, silk
socks and high, thin, rubber-soled boots, the Gorilla in an exiguous
bathing-garment and a pair of gymnasium shoes.
</p>

<p>
Dam a picture of the Perfect Man, was the taller, and the Gorilla, a perfect
Caliban, was the broader and had the longer reach. Their right hands touched in
perfunctory shake, Dam drew back to allow the Snake to assume sparring
attitude, and, as he saw the huge shoulders hunch, the great biceps rise, and
the clenched gloves come to position, he assumed the American
&ldquo;crouch&rdquo; attitude and sprang like a tiger upon the incarnation of
the utter Damnation and Ruin that had cursed his life to living death.
</p>

<p>
The Gorilla was shocked and pained! The tippy pink-and-white blasted rookie was
&ldquo;all over him&rdquo; and he was sent staggering with such a rain of
smashing blows as he had never, never felt, nor seen others receive. The whole
assembly of soldiers, saving the Garrison Artillerymen, raised a wild yell,
regardless of the referee&rsquo;s ferocious expostulations (in dumb-show) and
even the ranks of the Horse-Gunners could scarce forbear to cheer. The
Queen&rsquo;s Greys howled like fiends and Hawker, unknown to himself, punched
the boards before him with terrific violence. Never had anything like it been
seen. Matthewson was a human whirlwind, and Dowdall had not had a chance to
return a blow. More than half the tremendous punches, hooks and in-fighting
jabs delivered by his opponent had got home, and he was &ldquo;rattled&rdquo;.
A fair hook to the chin might send him down and out at any moment.
</p>

<p>
Surely never had human being aimed such an unceasing, unending, rain of blows
in the space of two minutes as had Trooper Matthewson. His arms had worked like
the piston rods of an express engine&mdash;as fast and as untiringly. He had
taken the Gorilla by surprise, had rushed him, and had never given him a
fraction of time in which to attack. Beneath the rain of sledge-hammer blows
the Gorilla had shrunk, guarding for dear life. Driven into a corner, he
cowered down, crouched beneath his raised arms, and allowed his face to sink
forward. Like a whirling piece of machinery Dam&rsquo;s arm flew round to
administer the <i>coup-de-grace</i>, the upper cut, that would lay the Snake
twitching and unconscious on the boards.
</p>

<p>
The Gorilla was expecting it.
</p>

<p>
As it came, his bullet head was jerked aside, and as the first swung harmlessly
up, he arose like a flash, and, as he did so, his mighty right shot up, took
Dam on the chin and laid him flat and senseless in the middle of the ring.
</p>

<p>
The Gorilla breathed heavily and made the most of the respite. He knew it must
be about &ldquo;Time,&rdquo; and that he had not won. If it wasn&rsquo;t
&ldquo;Time,&rdquo; and the cub arose he&rsquo;d knock him to glory as he did
so. Yes, the moment the most liberal-minded critic could say he was just about
on his feet, he&rsquo;d give him a finisher that he&rsquo;d bear the mark of.
The bloomin&rsquo; young swine had nearly &ldquo;had&rdquo; him&mdash;him, the
great G&rsquo;rilla Dowdall, about to buy himself out with his prize-money, and
take to pugilism as a profession.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four,</i>&rdquo; counted the
timekeeper amid the most deathly silence, and, as he added,
<i>&ldquo;five&mdash;six&mdash;Time,&rdquo;</i> a shout arose that was heard
for miles.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Matthewson was saved&mdash;if his seconds could pull him round in time.
</p>

<p>
At sound of the word &ldquo;Time,&rdquo; the seconds leapt into the ring.
Hawker and Bear rushed to the prostrate Dam, hauled him to his feet, and
dragged him to the chair which Goate had placed ready. As he was dropped into
it, a spongeful of icy water from Goate&rsquo;s big sponge brought Dam to
consciousness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Breave for all y&rsquo;r worf,&rdquo; grunted Hawker, as he mightily
swung a big bath-towel in swift eddies, to drive refreshing air upon the
heaving, panting body of his principal.
</p>

<p>
Bear and Goate applied massaging hands with skilled violence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, I thought you had him,&rdquo; panted Goate as he kneaded
triceps and biceps. &ldquo;And then I thought he had you. It&rsquo;s
anybody&rsquo;s fight, Matty&mdash;but <i>don&rsquo;t</i> try and knock him
out. You couldn&rsquo;t do it with an axe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Bear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to keep on your feet and
win on points.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to kill <i>the Snake</i>,&rdquo; hissed Dam, and his
seconds glanced at each other anxiously.
</p>

<p>
He felt that nothing could keep him from victory. He was regaining his faith in
a just Heaven, now that the Snake had been compelled to face him in the puny
form of a wretched pugilist. Some one had said something about an axe. It would
be but fair if he had an axe, seeing that hitherto the Snake had had him
utterly defenceless while exercising its own immeasurable and supernatural
powers, when torturing him to its heart&rsquo;s content for endless aeons.
But&mdash;no&mdash;since it was here in human form and without weapons,
<i>he</i> would use none, and would observe the strictest fairness in fight,
just as he would to a real human enemy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Abaht that there little bet, &rsquo;Enery,&rdquo; observed Seaman Jones,
&ldquo;I fink we&rsquo;ll alter of it. I don&rsquo;t wish to give no moral
support to this &rsquo;ere Griller. T&rsquo;other bloke&rsquo;s only jus&rsquo;
fresh from the Novice Class, I reckon, jedgin&rsquo; by &rsquo;is innercent
young faice, an&rsquo; e&rsquo;s aputtin&rsquo; up the werry best fight as ever
I see. We&rsquo;ll chainge it like this &rsquo;ere. We backs the
&rsquo;orse-soldier to win, and, if he <i>do</i>, we drinks a gallon between
us. If &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t, we drinks <i>two</i> fer to console &rsquo;im,
an&rsquo; drahn sorrer, wot?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it are, Will&rsquo;m,&rdquo; agreed Henery. &ldquo;Then we wins
<i>either</i> way! <i>You</i> got a &rsquo;ead fer logger-rhythms. Oughter been
a bloomin&rsquo; bookie. They &rsquo;as to be big an&rsquo;
ugly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seconds out of the Ring,&rdquo; called the referee, and a hush fell upon
the excited throng.
</p>

<p>
Bear and Goate dropped to the ground, Hawker splashed water all over
Dam&rsquo;s body and, as he rose on the word &ldquo;<i>Time</i>&rdquo; snatched
away the chair and joined his colleagues, who crouched with faces on a level
with the boards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, buck him up, good Lord, and put ginger in his short-arm work, and O
Lord, take care of his chin and mark,&rdquo; prayed Trooper Bear, with deep and
serious devoutness.
</p>

<p>
No need to shake hands this bout&mdash;not again till the fifteenth, noted Dam,
as he arose and literally leapt at his opponent with a smashing drive of his
right and a feint of his left which drew the Gorilla&rsquo;s guard and left his
face exposed. The Gorilla received Dam&rsquo;s full weight and full strength,
and, but for the ropes, would have been knocked among the spectators.
</p>

<p>
A tremendous yell went up, led by the Queen&rsquo;s Greys.
</p>

<p>
As the tautening of the ropes swayed the Gorilla inward again, Dam delivered a
brace of lightning strokes that, though they did not find the chin, staggered
and partly stunned him, and, ere he could pull himself together, Dam was inside
his guard, almost breast to breast with him, and raining terrific blows, just
above the belt. Left, right, left, right, and no chance for the Gorilla to get
his own hands up for a couple of seconds, and, when he could, and drove an
appalling blow at Dam&rsquo;s chin, it was dodged and he received a
cross-counter that shook him. He must sham weariness and demoralization, lead
the tippy rookie on to over-confidence and then land him clean over the ropes.
A sullen rage grew in the Gorilla&rsquo;s heart. He wasn&rsquo;t doing himself
justice. He wasn&rsquo;t having a fair show. This blasted half-set pink and
white recruit hadn&rsquo;t given him time to settle down. A fifteen-round
contest shouldn&rsquo;t be bustled like <i>this!</i> The bloke was more like a
wild-cat than a sober heavyweight boxer.
</p>

<p>
He received a heavy blow in the face and, as he shook his head with an evil
grin, according to his custom when well struck, he found it followed
practically instantaneously by another. The swab was about the quickest thing
that ever got into a ring. He was like one of these bloomin&rsquo;, tricky,
jack-in-the-box featherweights, instead of a steady lumbering
&ldquo;heavy&rdquo;. And the Gorilla allowed himself to be driven to a corner
again, and let his head sink forward, that the incautious youth might again put
all his strength into an upper-cut, miss as the other dodged, and be at the
mercy of the Gorilla as the errant fist completed its over-driven swing.
</p>

<p>
But Damocles de Warrenne fought with his brain as well as his strength and
skill. He had learnt a lesson, and no dull-witted oaf of a Gorilla was going to
have him like that twice. As the Gorilla cowered and crouched in simulated
defeat and placed his face to tempt the <i>coup de grace</i> which he would see
swinging up, and easily dodge, Dam swiftly side-stepped and summoning every
ounce of strength, rage, and mad protesting frenzy against the life-long
torturing tyrant, he delivered a Homeric blow at the champion&rsquo;s head,
beside and behind the ear. (Since he was indestructible by the ordinary
point-of-the-chin knock-out, let him make the best of that fearful blow upon
the base of the brain and spinal cord, direct.)
</p>

<p>
Experienced men said it was the heaviest blow they had ever seen struck with
the human fist. It was delivered slightly downward, coolly, at measured
distance, with change from left foot to right in the act of delivery, and with
the uttermost strength of a most powerful athlete in perfect training&mdash;and
Hate Incarnate lent the strength of madness to the strength of training and
skill.
</p>

<p>
THUD!&mdash;and the Gorilla dropped like a log.
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;&rdquo;</i>
counted the time-keeper, as men scarcely breathed in the dead silence into
which the voice cut sharply&mdash;<i>&ldquo;eight&mdash;&rdquo;</i> and, in
perfect silence, every man of those thousands slowly rose to his
feet&mdash;<i>&ldquo;nine&mdash;OUT!&rdquo;</i> and such a roar arose as bade
fair to rend the skies. <i>&ldquo;Outed&rdquo; in two rounds!</i> Men howled
like lunatics, and the Queen&rsquo;s Greys behaved like very dangerous
lunatics. Hawker flung his arms round Dam and endeavoured to raise him on his
shoulders and chair him unaided. Bear and Goate got each a hand and proceeded
to do their best to crush it.
</p>

<p>
Seamen Jones and Smith exchanged a chaste kiss.
</p>

<p>
Damocles de Warrenne was the hero of the Queen&rsquo;s Greys. Best Man-at-Arms
in the Division, winner in Sword v. Sword Mounted and Dismounted, Tent-pegging,
Sword v. Lance, and Individual Jumping, and in the winning teams for
Tug-of-War, Section Jumping, and Section Tent-pegging!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give him a trial as Corporal then, from the first of next month, sir, if
there&rsquo;s no sign of anything wrong during the week,&rdquo; agreed Captain
Daunt, talking him over with the Colonel, after receiving through
Troop-Sergeant-Major Scoles a petition to promote the man.
</p>

<p>
Within twenty-four hours of his fight with the Gorilla, Dam found himself on
sentry-go over what was known in the Regiment as &ldquo;the Dead
&rsquo;Ole&rdquo;&mdash;which was the mortuary, situated in a lonely, isolated
spot beyond a nullah some half-furlong from the Hospital, and cut off from view
of human habitation by a belt of trees.
</p>

<p>
On mounting guard that evening, the Sergeant of the Guard had been informed
that a corpse lay in the mortuary, a young soldier having been taken ill and
having died within a few hours, of some disease of a distinctly choleraic
nature.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell <i>you</i> orf for that post, Matthewson,&rdquo; said
the Sergeant. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ll see ghosties there, for a
change,&rdquo; for it was customary to mount a sentry over &ldquo;the Dead
&rsquo;Ole&rdquo; when it contained an occupant, and one of the sentry&rsquo;s
pleasing duties was to rap loudly and frequently upon the door throughout the
night to scare away those vermin which are no respecters of persons when the
persons happen to be dead and the vermin ravenous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of ghosts, Sergeant,&rdquo; replied
Dam&mdash;though his heart sank within him at the thought of the long lonely
vigil in the dark, when he would be so utterly at the mercy of the
Snake&mdash;the Snake over whom he had just won a signal victory, and who would
be all the more vindictive and terrible in consequence. Could he keep sane
through the lonely darkness of those dreadful hours? Perhaps&mdash;if he kept
himself in some severe physical agony. He would put a spur beneath his
tight-drawn belt and next to his skin, he would strike his knee frequently with
the &ldquo;toe of the butt&rdquo; of his carbine, he would put pebbles in his
boots, and he would cause cramp in his limbs, one after the other. Any kind of
pain would help.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
It must be quarter of an hour since he had rapped on the mortuary door and sent
his messages of prohibition to mouse, rat, bandicoot, civet-cat, wild-cat or
other vermin intruder through the roof-ventilation holes. He would knock again.
A strange thing this&mdash;knocking at a dead man&rsquo;s door in the middle of
the night. Suppose the dead man called &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; It would be
intensely interesting, but in no wise terrifying or horrible. Presumably poor
young Trooper Priddell was no more dangerous or dreadful in the spirit than he
had been in the fleshâ€¦. Fortunate young man! Were he only on sentry-go outside
the peaceful mortuary and Damocles de Warrenne stretched on the bier within, to
await the morrow and its pomp and ceremony, when the carcass of the dead
soldier would receive honours never paid to the living, sentient man, be he
never so worthy, heroic, virtuous and deserving. Oh, to be lying in there at
rest, to be on the other side of that closed door at peace!â€¦
</p>

<p>
To-morrow that poor dead yokel&rsquo;s body would receive a &ldquo;Present
Arms&rdquo; (as though he were an armed party commanded by an Officer) from the
Guard, which the sentry would turn out as the coffin passed the Guard-room. For
the first and last time in his life, he would get a &ldquo;<i>Present
Arms</i>&rdquo;. It wouldn&rsquo;t be in his <i>life</i> though. For the first
and last time in his death? That didn&rsquo;t sound right either. Anyhow he
would get it, and lots of strange, inexplicable, origin-forgotten rites would
be observed over this piece of clay&mdash;hitherto so cheaply held and roughly
treated.
</p>

<p>
Queer! As &ldquo;Trooper Priddell&rdquo; he was of no account. As a piece of
fast-decaying carrion he would be the centre of a piece of elaborate
ceremonial! His troop would parade in full dress and (save for a firing-party
of twelve who would carry carbines) without arms. A special black horse would
be decked out with a pall of black velvet and black plumes. Across this horse
the spurred jackboots of the dead man would be slung with toes pointing to the
rear. Two men, wearing black cloaks, would lead the horse by means of new
handkerchiefs passed through the bridoon rings of its bridle, handkerchiefs
which would become their perquisites and <i>memento mori</i>.
</p>

<p>
With crape-draped drums, the band, in silence, would lead the troop to the
mortuary where would await it a gun-carriage with its six horses and
coffin-supporting attachment. Here the troop would break ranks, file into the
mortuary and bare-headed take, each man, his last look at the face of the dead
as he lay in his coffin. The lid would then be screwed on, the troop would form
a double line, facing inward, the firing-party would &ldquo;present
arms,&rdquo; and six of the dead man&rsquo;s more particular pals, or of his
&ldquo;townies,&rdquo; would bear the coffin out and place it upon the
gun-carriage. It would then be covered with a Union Jack and on it would be
placed the helmet, sword, and carbine of the deceased trooper, the firing-party
standing meanwhile, leaning on their reversed carbines, with bowed heads.
</p>

<p>
As the melancholy procession formed up for its march to the graveyard, the
smallest and junior men would take front place, the bigger and senior men
behind them, non-commissioned officers would follow, and subalterns and captain
last of all. In stepping off from the halt, all would step off with the right
foot instead of with the left. Apparently the object was to reverse ordinary
procedure to the uttermost&mdash;which would but be in keeping with the great
reversal of showing honour to such an unhonoured thing as a private
soldier&mdash;one of the despised and rejected band that enable the
respectable, wealthy, and smug to remain so; one of the &ldquo;licentious
soldiery&rdquo; that have made, and that keep, the Empire of which the
respectable wealthy and smug are so proud.
</p>

<p>
At the &ldquo;slow march,&rdquo; and in perfect silence until beyond hearing by
the inmates of the Hospital, the cortege would proceed. Anon the band would
call heaven and earth to mourn with the sonorous dreadful strains of the Dead
March; whereafter the ordinary &ldquo;quick march&rdquo; would bring the
funeral party to the cemetery, in sight of which the &ldquo;slow march&rdquo;
would be resumed, and the Chaplain, surpliced, book-bearing, come forth to put
himself at its head, leading the way to the grave-side where, with uncovered
heads, the mourners would listen to the impressive words with feelings varying
as their education, religion, temperament, and&mdash;digestion&mdash;impelled.
</p>

<p>
At the close of the service, the firing-party in their places, six on either
side of the grave, would fire three volleys into the air, while the band
breathed a solemn dirge.
</p>

<p>
And&mdash;perhaps most impressively tragic touch of all&mdash;the party would
march briskly off to the strains of the liveliest air in the whole repertoire
of the band.
</p>

<p>
<i>Why</i> should John Humphreyville Priddell&mdash;doubtless scion of the
great Norman houses of Humphreyville and Paradelle, who shared much of
Dorsetshire between them from Domesday Book to Stuart downfall&mdash;have been
born in a tiny village of the Vale of Froom in &ldquo;Dorset Dear,&rdquo; to
die of cholera in vile Motipur? Was some maid, in barton, byre, or dairy,
thinking of him but now&mdash;with an ill-writ letter in her bosom, a letter
beginning with &ldquo;<i>I now take up my pen to right you these few lines
hopping they find you the same which they now leave me at present</i>&rdquo;
according to right tradition and proper custom, and continuing to speak of
homesick longings, dreams of furlough, promotion, marrying &ldquo;on the
strength,&rdquo; and retirement to green fair Dorset Dear on a
Sergeant-Major&rsquo;s pension?
</p>

<p>
What was the meaning of it all? Was it pure chance and accident&mdash;or had a
Living, Scheming, Purposeful Deity a great wise object in this that John
Humphreyville Priddell should have been born and bred and nurtured in the Vale
of Froom to be struck from lusty life to a death of agony in a few hours at
Motipur in the cruel accursed blighted land of Ind?
</p>

<p>
Well, well!&mdash;high time to rap again upon the door, the last door, of John
Humphreyville Priddell, Trooper, ex-dairyhand, decaying carrion,&mdash;and
scare from his carcass such over-early visitants as anticipatedâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
How hollowly the blows re-echoed. Did they strike muffled but murderous upon
the heart of the thousand-league distant dairymaid, or of the old
cottage-mother whose evenings were spent in spelling out her boy&rsquo;s loving
letters&mdash;that so oft covered a portion of his exiguous pay?â€¦
</p>

<p>
Was that a scuttling within? Quite probably. It might be&mdash;rats, it might
be a bandicoot; it could hardly be a jackal; it might be a SNAKE,&mdash;and
Trooper Matthewson&rsquo;s carbine clattered to the ground and his knees smote
together as he thought the word. Pulling himself together he hastily snatched
up his carbine with a flush of shame at the slovenly unsoldierly
&ldquo;crime&rdquo; of dropping it. He&rsquo;d be dropping his arms on parade
next! But it <i>might be a snake</i>&mdash;for he had certainly heard the sound
of a movement of some sort. The strong man felt faint and leant against the
mortuary wall for a moment.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that the wretched carbine were a sword! A man could feel a <i>man</i> with
a sword in his hand. He could almost face the Snake, even in Snake form, if he
had a sword â€¦ but what is a carbine, even a loaded Martini-Henry carbine with
its good soft man-stopping slug? There are no traditions to a
carbine&mdash;nothing of the Spirit of one&rsquo;s Ancestors in one&mdash;a
vile mechanic thing of villainous saltpetre. How should the Snake fear that?
Now a sword was different. It stood for human war and human courage and human
deeds from the mistiest past, and behind it must be a weight of human wrath,
feats, and tradition that must make even the Snake pause. Oh, for his
sword&mdash;if the Snake came upon him when he had but this wretched carbine he
would probably desert his post, fling the useless toy from him, and flee till
he fell blind and fainting on the groundâ€¦. And what would the Trooper of the
Queen get who deserted his sentry-post, threw away his arms and fled&mdash;and
explained in defence that he had seen a snake? Probably a court-martial would
give him a spell of Military Prison. Yes&mdash;<i>Jail</i>â€¦. What proportion of
truth could there be in the firmly-held belief of the men that
&ldquo;crimes&rdquo; are made so numerous and so inevitable, to the
best-meaning and most careful, because there exist a great Military Prison
System and a great Military Prison personnel&mdash;and that
&ldquo;criminals&rdquo; are essential to the respective proper inhabitation and
<i>raison d&rsquo;Ãªtre</i> thereof&mdash;that unless a good supply of military
&ldquo;criminals&rdquo; were forthcoming there might have to be reductions and
curtailments&mdash;loss of snug billetsâ€¦. Certainly soldiers got years of
imprisonment for &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; for which civilians would get reprimands
or nominal fines, and, moreover, when a man became a soldier he certainly lost
the elementary fundamental rights guaranteed to Englishmen by Magna
Charta&mdash;among them the right of trial by his peersâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Would poor Priddell mind if he did not knock again? If it were the Snake it
could do Priddell no harm now&mdash;he being happily dead&mdash;whereas, if
disturbed, it might emerge to the utter undoing&mdash;mind, body, and
soul&mdash;of Trooper Matthewson. It would certainly send him to Jail or
Lunatic Asylum&mdash;probably to both in due succession, for he was daily
getting worse in the matter of the Snake.
</p>

<p>
No&mdash;it was part of his orders, on this sentry-post, to knock at the door,
and he would do his duty, Snake or not. He had always tried to do his duty
faithfully and he would continueâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Once more to knock at a dead man&rsquo;s doorâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bump, Bump: Bump, Bump: Bump, Bump</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon be at rest, Priddell, old chap&mdash;and I wish I
could join you,&rdquo; called Dam, and it seemed to his excited brain that <i>a
deep hollow groan replied</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! He&rsquo;s not dead,&rdquo; coolly remarked the man who would
have fled shrieking from a harmless blind-worm, and, going round to the back of
the building, he placed his carbine against the wall and sprang up at a kind of
window-ledge that formed the base of a grated aperture made for purposes of
ventilation. Slowly raising his body till his face was above the ledge, he
peered into the dimly moonlit cell and then dropped to the ground and, catching
up his carbine, sprinted in the direction of the Hospital Guard-room.
</p>

<p>
There arrived, he shouted for the Corporal of the Guard and was quickly
confronted by Corporal Prag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wot the devil you deserted yore&rdquo;â€¦. he began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get the key of the mortuary, send for the Surgeon, and come at
once,&rdquo; gasped Dam as soon as he could speak. &ldquo;<i>Priddell&rsquo;s
not dead</i>. Must be some kind of catalepsy. Quick, man&rdquo;â€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Catter wot? You drunken &rsquo;og,&rdquo; drawled the Corporal.
&ldquo;Catter_waulin&rsquo;<i> more like it. Under arrest you goes, my lad. Now
you </i>&rsquo;ave_ done it. &rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;Awker, run down an&rsquo; call
up the Sergeant o&rsquo; the Guard an&rsquo; tell &rsquo;im Maffewson&rsquo;s
left &rsquo;is post. &rsquo;E&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to plant annuvver sentry.
Maffewson goes ter clink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but send for the Surgeon and the key of the mortuary
too,&rdquo; begged Dam. &ldquo;I give you fair warning that Priddell is alive
and groaning and off the bier&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pity <i>you</i> ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;off the beer&rsquo; too,&rdquo; said
the Corporal with a yawn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;there are witnesses that I brought the report to you. If
Priddell is found dead on the ground to-morrow you&rsquo;ll have to answer for
manslaughter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, <i>chuck</i> it you snaike-seeing delirying trimmer,
<i>will</i> yer! Give anyone the &rsquo;orrers to listen to yer! When Priddell
is wrote off as &lsquo;Dead&rsquo; &rsquo;e <i>is</i> dead, whether &rsquo;e
likes it or no,&rdquo; and he turned to give orders to the listening guard to
arrest Trooper Matthewson.
</p>

<p>
The Sergeant of the Guard arrived at the &ldquo;double,&rdquo; followed by
Trooper Bear carrying a hurricane-lamp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; panted the Sergeant. &ldquo;Matthewson on
the booze agin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I report that there is a living man in the mortuary, Sergeant,&rdquo;
replied Dam. &ldquo;Priddell is not dead. I heard him groan, and I scrambled up
to the grating and saw him lying on the ground by the door.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see yerself groanin&rsquo; an&rsquo; lyin&rsquo; on
the ground in the Digger, now,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant, and, as much in
sorrow as in anger, he added, &ldquo;An&rsquo; <i>you</i>&rsquo;re the bloke I
signed a petition for his permotion are yer? At it agin a&rsquo;ready!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, good Heavens, man, can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m as sober as you
are, and much less excited? Can&rsquo;t you send for the key of the mortuary
and call the doctor? The poor chap may die for your stupidity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You call <i>me</i> a &lsquo;man&rsquo; again, my lad, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll show you what a Sergeant can do fer them as &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t
like! As fer &lsquo;sober&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad enough o&rsquo; you
&lsquo;sober&rsquo;. W&rsquo;y, in two ticks you may be on the ground
&rsquo;owlin&rsquo; and bellerin&rsquo; and squealin&rsquo; like a Berkshire
pig over the blood-tub. <i>Sober</i>! Yus&mdash;I seen you at it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth can&rsquo;t you come and <i>prove</i> I&rsquo;m drunk or
mad,&rdquo; besought Dam. &ldquo;Open the mortuary and prove I&rsquo;m
wrong&mdash;and then put me under arrest. Call the Surgeon and say the sentry
over the mortuary reports the inmate to be alive&mdash;<i>he</i> has heard of
catalepsy and comatose collapse simulating death if <i>you</i>
haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo; use sech &rsquo;orrible languidge,&rdquo; besought the
respectable Corporal Prag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ho, yus! <i>I</i>&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; to see meself whipt on the peg
fer turnin&rsquo; out the Surgin from &rsquo;is little bed in the middle
o&rsquo; the night&mdash;to come an&rsquo; &rsquo;ave a look at the dead corpse
&rsquo;e put in orders fer the Dead &rsquo;Ole, ain&rsquo;t I? Jest becos the
champion snaike-seer o&rsquo; E Troop&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em agin, wot?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Corporal Prag laughed merrily at the wit of his superior.
</p>

<p>
Turning to Bear, whom he knew to be as well educated as himself, Dam
remarked:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor chap has rallied from the cholera collapse and could probably be
saved by stimulants and warmth. This suspended animation is common enough in
cholera. Why, the Brahmins have a regular ritual for dealing with cases of
recovery on the funeral pyre&mdash;purification after defilement by the
corpse-washers or something of the sort. These stupid oafs are letting poor
Priddell die&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! you drunken talkin&rsquo; parrot,&rdquo; roared the incensed
Sergeant. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, sling &rsquo;is drunken rotten
carkis&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row here?&rdquo; cut in a quiet curt voice.
&ldquo;Noise enough for a gang of crows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Surgeon-Captain Blake of the Royal Army Medical Corps had just left the
Hospital, having been sent for by the night Nursing Sister. The men sprang to
attention and the Sergeant saluted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drunk sentry left &rsquo;is post, Sir,&rdquo; he gabbled.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Spose the Dead &rsquo;Ole&mdash;er&mdash;Morshuerry, that is,
Sir, got on &rsquo;is nerves. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s given to secret boozin&rsquo;,
Sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me, Sir,&rdquo; broke in Dam, daring to address an Officer
unbidden, since a life was at stake, &ldquo;I am a total abstainer and Trooper
Priddell is not dead. It must have been cataleptic trance. I heard him groan
and I climbed up and saw him lying on the ground.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This man&rsquo;s not drunk,&rdquo; said Captain Blake, and added to
himself, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s an educated man, and a cultured, poor
devil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s how &rsquo;e goes on, Sir, sober as a judge you&rsquo;d
say, an&rsquo; then nex&rsquo; minnit &rsquo;e&rsquo;s on the floor
aseein&rsquo; blue devils an&rsquo; pink serpients&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s dying while we talk, Sir,&rdquo; put in Dam, whose wrath
was rising. (If these dull-witted ignorant louts could not tell a drunken man
from a sober, nor realize that a certified dead man may <i>not</i> be dead,
surely the doctor could.)
</p>

<p>
The Sergeant and the Corporal ventured on a respectful snigger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring me that lamp,&rdquo; said Captain Blake, and Trooper Bear raised
it to his extended hand. Lifting it so that its light shone straight in
Dam&rsquo;s face the doctor scanned the latter and examined his eyes. This was
not the face of a drunkard nor was the man in any way under the influence of
liquor now. Absurd! Had he fever? Was he of deranged intellect? But, alas, the
light that shone upon Dam&rsquo;s face also shone upon Captain Blake&rsquo;s
collar and upon the badge of his Corps which adorned it&mdash;and that badge is
a serpent entwining a rod.
</p>

<p>
It was the last straw! Dam had passed through a most disturbing night; he had
kept guard in the lonely Snake-haunted darkness, guard over a mortuary in which
lay a corpse; he had had to keep knocking at the corpse&rsquo;s door, his mind
had run on funerals, he had thought he heard the dead man groan, he believed he
had seen the dead man moving, he had wrestled with thick intelligences who held
him drunk or mad while precious moments passed, and he had had the Snake before
his mental vision throughout this terrible time&mdash;and here was another of
its emissaries <i>wearing its badge</i>, an emissary of high rank, an
Officer-Emissary!â€¦ Well, he was in the open air, thank God, and could put up a
fight as before.
</p>

<p>
Like a panther he sprang upon the unfortunate officer and bore him to the
ground, with his powerful hands enclosing the astounded gentleman&rsquo;s neck,
and upon the couple sprang the Sergeant, the Corporal, and the Hospital Guard,
all save the sentry, who (disciplined, well-drilled man!) brought his carbine
to the &ldquo;order&rdquo; and stood stiffly at &ldquo;attention&rdquo; in a
position favourable for a good view of the proceedings though strictly on his
beat.
</p>

<p>
Trooper Bear, ejaculating &ldquo;Why do the heathen rage furiously
together,&rdquo; took a running jump and landed in sitting posture on the heap,
rolled off, and proceeded to seize every opportunity of violently smiting his
superior officers, in his apparent zeal to help to secure the dangerous
criminal-lunatic. Thoughts of having just <i>one</i> punch at a real Officer
(if only a non-combatant still a genuine Commissioned Officer) flashed across
his depraved mind.
</p>

<p>
It was a Homeric struggle. Captain Blake was himself an old Guy&rsquo;s Rugger
three-quarter and no mean boxer, and the Sergeant, Corporal, and Guard, were
all powerful men, while Dam was a Samson further endowed with the strength of
undeniable madness. When at length he was dragged from Captain Blake&rsquo;s
recumbent form, his hands torn from that officer&rsquo;s throat, and the group
stood for a second panting, Dam suddenly felled Corporal Prag with such a blow
as had been the undoing of the Gorilla, sent Sergeant Wotting head over heels
and, ere the Guard could again close with him, drove his fist into the face of
the supposed myrmidon of the Snake and sprang upon his body once moreâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before seven strong men could pinion him and carry him on a
stretcher to the Guard-room, and, of those seven strong men, only Trooper Bear
bore no mark of serious damage. (Trooper Bear had struck two non-commissioned
officers with great violence, in his misdirected zeal, and one Commissioned
Officer&mdash;though only playfully and for the satisfaction of being able to
say that he had done so.) That night, half dead, wholly mad, bruised and
bleeding, Damocles de Warrenne lay in the dark cell awaiting trial on a charge
of assaulting an Officer, striking his superior officers, resisting the Guard,
deserting his sentry-post, and being drunk and disorderly.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll he get, d&rsquo;you think?&rdquo; sadly asked Trooper
Goate of Trooper Hawker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Two stretch &rsquo;ard laiber and discharged from the Army wiv&rsquo;
iggernerminny,&rdquo; groaned Trooper Hawker. &ldquo;Lucky fer &rsquo;im
floggin&rsquo;s erbolished in the British Army.&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
When the mortuary door was unlocked next morning a little force was required to
open it, some obstacle apparently retarding its inward movement. The obstacle
proved to be the body, now certainly the dead body, of Trooper Priddell who had
died with his fingers thrust under the said door.<a href="#fn26" name="fnref26" id="fnref26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>

VULTURES AND LUCK&mdash;GOOD AND BAD.</h2>

<p>
To the strongest and sanest mind there is something a small trifle disturbing,
perhaps, in riding silently hour after hour on a soft-footed camel over soft
sand in a silent empty land through the moonlit silent night, beside an
overland-telegraph wire on every individual post of which sits a huge vulture!â€¦
Just as the sun set, a fiery red ball, behind the distant mountains, Damocles
de Warrenne, gentleman-at-large, had caught sight of what he had sought in the
desert for some days, the said overland telegraph, and thereby saved himself
from the highly unpleasant death that follows prolonged deprivation of water.
He had also saved his camel from a little earlier death, inasmuch as he had
decided to probe for the faithful creature&rsquo;s jugular vein and carotid
artery during the torturing heats of the morrow and prolong his life at its
expense. (Had he not promised Lucille to do his best for himself?)
</p>

<p>
The overland telegraph pointed absolutely straight to the border city of Kot
Ghazi and, better still, to a river-bed which would contain pools of water,
thirty miles this side of it, at a spot a few miles from which stood a lost
lone dak-bungalow on Indian soil&mdash;a dak-bungalow whereat would be waiting
a <i>shikarri</i> retainer, and such things as tea, fuel, potted foods,
possibly fresh meat, and luxury of luxuries, a hot bathâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
And, with a sigh of relief, he had wheeled his camel under the telegraph wires
after a glance at the stars and brief calculation as to whether he should turn
to left or right. (He did not want to proceed until he collapsed under the
realization that he was making for the troubled land of Persia.)
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, without knowing where he was, he knew he was on the road to water,
food, human companionship (imagine Abdul Ghani a human companion!&mdash;but he
had not seen a human face for three weeks, nor heard nor uttered a word), and
safety, after suffering the unpleasant experience of wandering in circles, lost
in the most inhospitable desert on the earth. Vultures! He had not realized
there were so many in the world. Hour after hour, a post at every few yards,
and on every post a vulture&mdash;a vulture that opened its eyes as he
approached, regarded him from its own point of view&mdash;that of the Eater
whose life is an unending search for Meat&mdash;calculatingly, and closed them
again with a sigh at his remaining vigorousness.
</p>

<p>
He must have passed hundreds, thousands,&mdash;had he died of thirst in actual
fact and was he doomed to follow this line through this desert for evermore as
a punishment for his sins? No&mdash;much too mild a punishment for the God of
Love to inflict, according to the Chaplain. This would be Eternal Bliss
compared with the Eternal Fire. He must be still alive â€¦ Was he mad, then, and
<i>imagining</i> these unending bird-capped posts? If not mad, he soon would
be. Why couldn&rsquo;t they say something&mdash;mannerless brutes! Should he
swerve off and leave the telegraph line? No, he had starved and suffered the
agonies of thirst for nearly a week&mdash;and, if he could hang on all night,
he might reach water tomorrow and be saved. Food was a minor consideration and
if he could drink a few gallons of water, soak his clothes in it, lie in
it,&mdash;he could carry on for another day or two. Nearly as easy to sprawl
face-downward on a camel-saddle as on the ground&mdash;and he had tied himself
on. The camel would rub along all right for days with camel-thorn and similar
daintiesâ€¦. No, better not leave the line. Halt and camp within sight of it till
the morning, when the brutes would fly away in search of food? No â€¦ might find
it impossible to get going again, if once man and beast lay down now â€¦ Ride as
far as possible from the line, keeping it in sight? No â€¦ if he fell asleep the
camel would go round in a circle again, and he&rsquo;d wake up a dozen miles
from the line, with no idea of direction and position. Best to carry straight
on. The camel would stick to the line so long as he was left exactly on it â€¦
think it a road â€¦ He could sleep without danger thus. He would shut his eyes
and not see the vultures, for if he saw a dozen more he knew that he would go
raving mad, halt the camel and address an impassioned appeal to them to
<i>say</i> something&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake to <i>say something</i>.
Didn&rsquo;t they know that he had been in solitary confinement in a desert for
three weeks or three centuries (what is time?) without hearing a sound or
seeing a living thing&mdash;expecting the SNAKE night and day, and, moreover,
that he was starving, dying of thirst, and light-headed, and that he was in the
awful position of choosing between murdering the camel that had stood by
him&mdash;no, under him&mdash;all that fearful time, and breaking his word to
Lucille&mdash;cheating and deceiving Lucille. Then why couldn&rsquo;t they
<i>say</i> something instead of sitting there in their endless millions, mile
after billions of miles, post after billions of trillions of
posts&mdash;menacing, watchful, silent, silent as the awful desert, silent as
the SNAKEâ€¦. This would not do â€¦ he must think hard of Lucille, of the Sword, of
his Dream, his Dream that came so seldom now. He would repeat Lucille&rsquo;s
last letter, word for word:&mdash;
</p>

<h5>&ldquo;MY DARLING,</h5>

<p>
&ldquo;It is over, thank God&mdash;Oh, thank God&mdash;and you can leave the
army at once and become a &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo; in position as well as in
fact. Poor old Grumper died on Saturday (as I cabled) and before he died he
became quite another man&mdash;weak, gentle and anxious to make any amends he
could to anybody. For nearly a week he was like this, and it was a most
wonderful and pathetic thing. He spent most of the time in telling me, General
Harringport, Auntie Yvette or the Vicar, about wicked things he had done,
cruelties, meannesses, follies&mdash;it was most distressing, for really he has
been simply a strong character with all the faults of one&mdash;including, as
we know too well, lack of sympathy, hardness, and sometimes savage cruelty,
which, after all, was only the natural result of the lack of sympathy and
understanding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As he grew weaker he grew more sympathetic with illness and suffering, I
suppose, for he sent for me in the middle of the night to say that he had
suddenly remembered Major Decies&rsquo; story about your probably being subject
to fits and seizures in certain circumstances, and that he was coming to the
conclusion that he had been hasty and unjust and had unmercifully punished you
for no fault whatever. He said &lsquo;I have punished him for being punished. I
have added my injustice to that of Fate. Write to him that I ask his pardon and
confess my fault. Tell him I&rsquo;ll make such reparation as I can,&rsquo; and
oh, Dam&mdash;he leaves <i>you</i> Monksmead, and <i>me</i> his money, on the
understanding that we marry as soon as any physician, now living in Harley
Street, says that you are fit to marry (I must write it I suppose) without fear
of our children being epileptic, insane, or in any way tainted. If none of them
will do this, I am to inherit Monksmead and part of the money and you are to
have a part of the money. If we marry <i>then</i>, we lose everything and it
goes to Haddon Berners. Mr. Wyllis, who has been his lawyer and agent for
thirty years, is to take you to Harley Street (presumably to prevent your
bribing and corrupting the whole of the profession there residing).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come at once, Darling. If the silly old physicians won&rsquo;t certify,
why&mdash;what <i>does</i> it matter? I am going to let lodgings at Monksmead
to a Respectable Single Man (with board) and Auntie Yvette will see that he
behaves himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cable what boat you start by and I&rsquo;ll meet you at Port Said. I
don&rsquo;t know how I keep myself sitting in this chair. I could turn head
over heels for joy! (And poor Grumper only just buried and his Will read!) He
didn&rsquo;t lose quite all his grim humour in that wonderful week of
softening, relenting and humanizing. What do you think he solemnly gave and
bequeathed to the poor Haddock? His <i>wardrobe</i>!!! And nothing else, but if
the Haddock wears only Grumper&rsquo;s clothes, including his boots, shirts,
ties, collars and everything else, for one full and complete year, and wears
absolutely nothing else, he is to have five thousand pounds at the end of
it&mdash;and he is to begin on the day after the funeral! And even at the last
poor Grumper was a foot taller and a foot broader (not to mention
<i>thicker</i>) than the Haddock! It appears that he systematically tried to
poison Grumper&rsquo;s mind against you&mdash;presumably with an eye on this
same last Will and Testament. He hasn&rsquo;t been seen since the funeral. I
wonder if he is going to try to win the money by remaining in bed for a year in
Grumper&rsquo;s pyjamas!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I not developing &lsquo;self-control and balance&rsquo;? Here I sit
writing news to you while my heart is screaming aloud with joy, crying
&lsquo;Dam is coming home. Dam&rsquo;s troubles are over. Dam is saved!&rsquo;
Because if you are ever so &lsquo;ill,&rsquo; Darling, there is nothing on
earth to prevent your coming to your old home at once&mdash;and if we
can&rsquo;t marry we can be pals for evermore in the dear old place of our
childhood. But of <i>course</i> we can marry. Hurry home, and if any Harley
Street doctor gives you even a doubtful look, throw him up his own stairs to
show how feeble you are, or tie his poker round his neck in a neat bow, and
refuse to undo it until he apologizes. I&rsquo;m sure you could!
&lsquo;<i>Ill</i>&rsquo; indeed! If you can&rsquo;t have a little fit, on the
rare occasions when you see a snake, without fools saying you are ill or dotty
or something, it is a pity! Anyhow there is one small woman who understands,
and if she can&rsquo;t marry you she can at any rate be your inseparable
pal&mdash;and if the Piffling Little World likes to talk scandal, in spite of
Auntie Yvette&rsquo;s presence&mdash;why it will be amusing. Cable, Darling! I
am just bursting with excitement and joy&mdash;and fear (that something may go
wrong at the last moment). If it saved a single day I should start for Motipur
myself at once. If we passed in mid-ocean I should jump overboard and swim to
your ship. Then you&rsquo;d do the same, and we should &lsquo;get left,&rsquo;
and look sillyâ€¦. Oh, what nonsense I am talking&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t think I
shall talk anything else again&mdash;for sheer joy!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t write me a lot of bosh <i>now</i> about &lsquo;spoiling
my life&rsquo; and how you&rsquo;d be ten times more miserable if I were your
wife. Fancy&mdash;a soldier to-day and a &lsquo;landed proprietor&rsquo;
to-morrow! How I wish you were a <i>landed</i> traveller, and were in the train
from Plymouth&mdash;no, from Dover and London, because of course you&rsquo;d
come the quickest way. Did my cable surprise you very much?
</p>

<p>
Yes, a long letter, but he could almost say it backwards. He couldn&rsquo;t be
anything like mad while he could do that?â€¦ How had she received his
answer&mdash;in which he tried to show her the impossibility of any decent man
compromising a girl in the way she proposed in her sweet innocence and
ignorance. Of course <i>he</i>, a half-mad, epileptic, fiend-ridden
monomaniac&mdash;nay, dangerous lunatic,&mdash;could not <i>marry</i>. Why, he
might murder his own wife under some such circumstances as those under which he
attacked Captain Blake. (Splendid fellow Blake! Not every man after such a
handling as that would make it his business to prove that his assailant was
neither drunk, mad, nor criminal&mdash;merely under a hallucination. But for
Blake he would now be in jail, or lunatic asylum, to a certainty. The Colonel
would have had him court-martialled as a criminal, or else have had him out of
the regiment as a lunatic. Nor, as a dangerous lunatic, would he have been
allowed to buy himself out when Lucille&rsquo;s letter and his money arrived.
Blake had got him into the position of a perfectly sober and sane person whose
mind had been temporarily upset by a night of horror&mdash;in which a
coffin-quitting corpse had figured, and so he had been able to steer between
the cruel rocks of Jail and Asylum to the blessed harbour of Freedom.)
</p>

<p>
Yes&mdash;in spite of Blake&rsquo;s noble goodness and help, Dam knew that he
was <i>not</i> normal, that he <i>was</i> dangerous, that he spent long periods
on the very border-line of insanity, that he stood fascinated on that
border-line and gazed far into the awful country beyond&mdash;the Realms of the
Madâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Marry! Not Lucille, while he had the sanity left to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;!
</p>

<p>
As for going to live at Monksmead with her and Auntie Yvette&mdash;it would be
an even bigger crime. Was it for <i>him</i> to make <i>Lucille</i> a
&ldquo;problem&rdquo; girl, a girl who was &ldquo;talked about,&rdquo; a
by-word for those vile old women of both sexes whose favourite pastime is the
invention and dissemination of lies where they dare, and of even more damaging
head-shakes, lip-pursings, gasps and innuendoes where they do not?
</p>

<p>
Was it for <i>him</i> to get <i>Lucille</i> called &ldquo;The Woman Who
Did,&rdquo; by those scum of the leisured classes, and &ldquo;That peculiar
young woman,&rdquo; by the better sort of matron, dowager and
chaperone,&mdash;make her the kind of person from whose company careful mothers
keep their innocent daughters (that their market price may never be in danger
of the faintest depreciation when they are for sale in the matrimonial market),
the kind of woman for whom men have a slightly and subtly different manner at
meet, hunt-ball, dinner or theatre-box? Get Lucille &ldquo;talked about&rdquo;?
</p>

<p>
No&mdash;setting aside the question of the possibility of living under the same
roof with her and conquering the longing to marry.
</p>

<p>
No&mdash;he had some decency left, tainted as he doubtless was by his
barrack-room life.
</p>

<p>
Tainted of courseâ€¦. What was it he had heard the senior soldierly-looking man,
whom the other addressed as &ldquo;General,&rdquo; say concerning some mutual
acquaintance, at breakfast in the dining-car going up to Kot Ghazi?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, poor chap, was in the ranks&mdash;and no man can escape the
barrack-room taint when he has once lived in it. Take me into any
Officers&rsquo; Mess you like&mdash;say &lsquo;There is a promoted
gentleman-ranker here,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll lay a thousand to one I spot him.
Don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s the son of a Dook&mdash;nor yet if he&rsquo;s
Royal, you can spot him alrightâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Pleasant hearing for the &ldquo;landed proprietor,&rdquo; whom a beautiful,
wealthy and high-bred girl proposed to marry!
</p>

<p>
Tainted or not, in that way&mdash;he was <i>mentally</i> tainted, a fact beside
which the other, if as true as Truth, paled into utterest insignificance.
</p>

<p>
No&mdash;he had taken the right line in replying to Lucille that he was getting
worse mentally, that no doctor would dream of &ldquo;vetting&rdquo; him
&ldquo;sound,&rdquo; that he was not scoundrel enough to come and cause scandal
and &ldquo;talk&rdquo; at Monksmead, and that he was going to disappear
completely from the ken of man, wrestle with himself, and come to her and beg
her to marry him directly he was better&mdash;sufficiently better to
&ldquo;pass the doctor,&rdquo; that is. If, meanwhile, she met and loved a man
worthy of her, such a man as Ormonde Delorme, he implored her to marry him and
to forget the wholly unworthy and undesirable person who had merely loomed
large upon her horizon through the accident of propinquity â€¦
</p>

<p>
(He could always disappear again and blow out such brains as he possessed, if
that came to pass, he told himself.)
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile letters to the Bank of Bombay would be sent for, at least once a
year&mdash;but she was not to write&mdash;she was to forget him. As to
searching for him&mdash;he had not quite decided whether he would walk from
Rangoon to Pekin or from Quetta to Constantinople&mdash;perhaps neither, but
from Peshawur to Irkutsk. Anyhow, he was going to hide himself pretty
effectually, and put himself beyond the temptation of coming and spoiling her
life. Sooner or later he would be mad, dead, or cured. If the last&mdash;why he
would make for the nearest place where he could get news of her&mdash;and if
she were then happily married to somebody else&mdash;why&mdash;why&mdash;she
<i>would</i> be happy, and that would make him quite happy â€¦
</p>

<p>
Had the letter been quite sane and coherent&mdash;or had he been in a queer
mental state when he wrote it?â€¦
</p>

<p>
He opened his eyes, saw a vulture within a few yards of him, closed them again,
and, soon after, fell into an uneasy slumber as the camel padded on at a steady
seven miles an hour unurged&mdash;save by the <i>smell</i> of pure clear water
which was still a score of miles distantâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
When Damocles de Warrenne awoke, he was within a few hundred yards of the
nearly dry River Helnuddi, where, failing occasional pools, the traveller can
always procure water by digging and patiently awaiting the slow formation of a
little puddle at the bottom of the hole.
</p>

<p>
For a minute he halted. Should he dig while he had strength, or should he turn
to the left and follow the river-bed until he came to a pool&mdash;or could go
no farther? Perhaps he would be too weak to dig, though, by that timeâ€¦.
Remarkable how eager to turn to the left and get on, the camel
was&mdash;considering how tired he must be&mdash;perhaps he could smell distant
water or knew of a permanent pool hereabouts. Well, let that decide itâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
An hour later, as the camel topped a rise in the river-bank, a considerable
pool came into view, tree-shaded, heron-haunted, too incredibly beautiful and
alluring for belief. Was it a mirage?â€¦
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, Damocles de Warrenne and his camel were drinking, and a
few hours later entered the dreary featureless compound of a wretched hovel,
which, to the man at least, was a palatial and magnificent asylum (no, not
<i>asylum</i>&mdash;of all words)&mdash;refuge and home&mdash;the more so that
a camel knelt chewing in the shade of the building, and a man, Abdul Ghani
himself, lay slumbering in the verandahâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You understand, then,&rdquo; said Dam in the vernacular, to the
malodorous, hideous, avaricious Abdul who reappeared from Kot Ghazi a few days
later, &ldquo;you return here again, one week from to-day, bringing the things
written down on this paper, from the shop of Rustomji at Kot Ghazi. Here you
wait until I come. If I find there is truth in your <i>khubbar</i><a href="#fn27" name="fnref27" id="fnref27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
of ibex you will be rewarded â€¦ Why don&rsquo;t I take you? Because I want to be
alone. Set out now for Kot Ghazi. I may return.&rdquo; A stone fell and
clattered. Dam shrank, cringed, and shut his eyes&mdash;as one expecting a
heavy blow. <i>Ah-h-h-h-h</i>&mdash;had the beast bolted? With the slowness of
an hour-hand he raised his head above the bank of the watercourse until his eye
cleared the edge. <i>No</i>&mdash;still there. After a painful crawl that
seemed to last for hours, he reached the point where the low ridge ran off at
right-angles, crept behind it, and lay flat on his face, to rest and recover
breath. He was soaked in perspiration from head to foot, giddy with sun and
unnatural posture, very sore as to elbows and knees, out of breath,
trembling&mdash;and entirely happy. The half-mile crawl, with the greater part
of his body on the burning ground, and the rifle to shuffle steadily along
without noise or damage, was the equivalent of a hard day&rsquo;s work to a
strong man. At the end of it he lay gasping and sick, aching in every limb,
almost blind with glare and over-exertion, weary to death&mdash;and entirely
happy. Thank God he would be able to stand up in a moment and rest behind a big
cactus. Then he would have a spell of foot-work for a change, and, though
crouching double, would not be doing any crawling until he had crossed the
plateau and reached the bushes.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn27" id="fn27"></a> <a href="#fnref27">[27]</a>
News, information.
</p>

<p>
The upward climb was successfully accomplished with frequent halts for breath,
behind boulders. On the plateau all that was required was silence. The ibex
could not see him up there. In his rubber-soled khaki-coloured shoes he could
almost run, but it was a question whether a drink of cold water would not be
worth more than all the ibexes in the world.
</p>

<p>
He tip-toed rapidly across the level hill-top, reached the belt of low bushes,
dropped, and lay to recover breath before resuming the painful and laborious
crawling part of his journey. Was it possible to tap one&rsquo;s tongue against
one&rsquo;s teeth and hear the noise of it as though it were made of wood? It
seemed so. Was this giddiness and dimness of vision sunstroke? What would he
give to have that fly (that had followed him for hundreds of thousands of miles
that morning) between his fingers?
</p>

<p>
Last lap! There was the rock, and below it must be the quarry&mdash;if it had
not fled. He must keep that rock between himself and his prey and he must get
to it without a sound. It would be easy enough without the rifle. Could he
stick it through his belt and along his back, or trail it behind him? What
nonsense! He must be getting a touch of sun. Would these stones leave marks of
burns on his clothes? Surely he could smell himself singeing. Enough to explode
the rifle â€¦ The big rock at last! A rest and then a peep, with infinite
precaution. Dam held his breath and edged his face to the corner of the great
boulder. Moving imperceptibly, he peeped â€¦ <i>No ibex!</i> â€¦ He was about to
spring up with a hearty malediction on his luck when he perceived a peculiar
projection on a large stone some distance down the hill. It moved&mdash;and Dam
dropped back. It must be the top of the curve of one of the horns of the ibex
and the animal must be lying downâ€¦. What to do? It might lie for hours and he
himself might go to sleep. It might get up and depart at any moment without
coming into the line of fire&mdash;without being seen indeed. Better continue
the stalk and hope to get a standing shot, or, failing that, a running one.
</p>

<p>
It looked a nasty descent, since silence was essential&mdash;steep, slippery,
and strewn with round stones. Anyhow, he could go down on his feet, which was
something to be thankful for, as it was agony to put a knee or elbow to the
ground. He crept on.
</p>

<p>
Surely his luck was changing, for here he was, within fifty yards of a stone
behind which lay an unsuspecting ibex with a world&rsquo;s-record head. Hullo!
a nasty little precipice! With a nastily sloping shelf at the bottom too, eight
feet away&mdash;and then another little precipice and another sloping shelf at
its base.
</p>

<p>
Better lay the rifle on the edge, slip over, hang by the hands, grab it with
one, and then drop the intervening few inches. Rubber soles would play their
part here! Damn this giddiness&mdash;touch of sun, no doubt. Damocles de
Warrenne knelt on the edge of the eight-foot drop, turned round, swayed, fell,
struck the sloping ledge, rolled off it, fell, struck the next sloping ledge,
fell thirty feet&mdash;arousing an astounded ibex <i>en route</i>&mdash;and
landed in a queer heap on a third shelf, with a few broken ribs, a dislocated
shoulder, broken ankles, and a fractured thigh.
</p>

<p>
A vulture, who had been interested in his proceedings for some time, dropped a
few thousand feet and had a look. What he saw decided him to come to earth. He
perched on a rock and waited patiently. He knew the symptoms and he knew the
folly of taking risks. A friend or two joined him&mdash;each, as he left his
place in the sky, being observed and followed by a brother who was himself in
turn observed and followed by another who brought othersâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
One of the hideous band had drawn quite near and was meditating rewarding his
own boldness with a succulent eye, when Dam groaned and moved. The pretty birds
also moved and probably groaned in spirit&mdash;but they didn&rsquo;t move far.
</p>

<p>
What was that Miss Smellie had been so fond of saying? &ldquo;There is no such
thing as &lsquo;luck,&rsquo; Damocles. All is ordered for the best by an
all-seeing and merciful Providence.&rdquo; Yes. No doubt.
</p>

<p>
What was that remark of his old friend, &ldquo;Holy Bill&rdquo;?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;luck,&rsquo; Damocles? All that happens is
ordained by God in His infinite mercy.&rdquo; Yes.
</p>

<p>
Holy Bill had never done a day&rsquo;s work in his life nor missed a
meal&mdash;save when bilious from overeatingâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
A pity the infinite mercy didn&rsquo;t run to a little water! It would have
been easy for the all-seeing and merciful Providence to move him to retain his
water-bottle when starting the stalk&mdash;if it were necessary to the schemes
of the Deity to have him smashed like a dropped eggâ€¦. What agony a human being
could endure!â€¦
</p>

<p>
Not even his rifle at hand with its means of speedy death. He might live for
days and then be torn alive by those accursed vultures. One mighty effort to
turn on his back and he would breathe easier&mdash;but that would bring his
eyes to the sun&mdash;and the vulturesâ€¦. Had he slept or fainted? How long had
he lain there?â€¦ Chance of being found? Absolutely none. Shikarri would have
visited the dak-bungalow a week ago. Camel left below on the plain&mdash;and it
would wander miles from where he left it when it grew hungry. Even if Abdul and
an organized search-party were after him <i>now</i> they might as well be
searching for a needle in a hay-stack. No one knew which of the thousand
gullies he had ascended and no one could track camel-pads or flat rubber soles
over bare solid rock, even if given the starting-point. No&mdash;he had got to
die of thirst, starvation, and vultures, barring miracles of luck&mdash;and he
had <i>never</i> had any good luck&mdash;for luck existed, undoubtedly, in
spite of mealy-mouthed platitude-makers and twaddle about everything being
pre-arranged and ordained with care and deliberation by a kind paternal
Providence.
</p>

<p>
And what luck he had had&mdash;all his life! Born fated!
</p>

<p>
Had he fainted again or slept? And could he hear the tinkle of ice against the
sides of a tall thin tumbler of lemonade, or was it the sound of a waterfall of
clear, cold water close by? Were the servants asleep, or was the drink he had
ordered being prepared?â€¦ No&mdash;he was dying in agony on a red-hot rock,
surrounded by vultures and probably watched by foxes, jackals and hyenas. And a
few yards away were the rifle that would have put him out of his misery, and
the water-bottle that would have alleviated his pain&mdash;to the extent, at
any rate, of enabling him to think clearly and perhaps scribble a few words in
blood or something, somehow, for Lucille â€¦ Lucille! Would the All-Merciful let
him see her once again for a moment in return for an extra thousand years of
Hell or whatever it was that unhappy mortals got as a continuation of the joys
of this gay world? Could he possibly induce the vultures to carry him
home&mdash;if he pledged himself to feed them and support their progeny? They
could each have a house in the compound. It would pay them far better than
eating him now. Did they understand Pushtoo or was it Persian? Certainly not
Hindustani and Urdu. People who came shooting alone in the desert and
mountains, where vultures abounded, should learn to talk Vulture and pass the
Higher Standard in that tongue. But even if they understood him they might be
unwilling to serve a coward. <i>Was</i> he a coward? Anyhow he lay glued with
his own blood to the spot he would never leave&mdash;unless the vultures could
be bribed. Useless to hope anything of the jackals. He had hunted too many
foxes to begin now to ask favours. Besides they could only drag, and he had
been dragged once by a horse. Quite enough for one lifetime. But he had never
injured a vulture. Pity he had no copy of Grimm or Anderson with him&mdash;they
contained much useful information about talking foxes, obliging birds, and
other matters germane to the occasion. If he could only get them to apply it, a
working-party of vultures and jackals certainly had the strength to transport
him a considerable distance&mdash;alternately carrying and dragging him. The
big bird, stalking nearer, was probably the <i>macuddam</i> or foreman. Would
it be at all possible for vultures to bring water? He would be very willing to
offer his right hand in return for a little water. The bird would be welcome to
eat it off his body if it would give him a drink first. Did not ravens bring
meat to the prophet Elijah? Intelligent and obliging birds. Probably cooked it,
too. But water was more difficult to carry, if easier to procure.
</p>

<p>
How close they were coming and how they watched with their horrible
eyes&mdash;and pretended not to watch!â€¦
</p>

<p>
Oh, the awful, unspeakable agony! Why was he alive again? Was his chest full of
terribly rusty machinery that would go on when it ought to stop for want of
oil?â€¦ If pain is punishment for sin, as placid stall-fed Holy Bill held (never
having suffered any), then Damocles de Warrenne must have been the prince of
sinners. Oh God! a little drop of water! Rivers of it flowing not many miles
away!
</p>

<p>
Monsoons of it falling recently! A water-bottle full a few yards
distant&mdash;and he must die for want of a drop â€¦ What a complete circle the
vultures made on the rocks and stunted trees of the sloping hill-side. Oh, for
a revolver! A man ought to carry one on shikar expeditions. One would give him
a chance of life when under a tiger or panther&mdash;and a chance of decent
death in a position such as this. Where had he read that vultures begin on the
eyes of their prey? Without awaiting its death either, so long as it could not
defend itself. There were other depraved gustatory preferences, too, if he
remembered rightly-He would have an opportunity of testing the accuracy of the
statement&mdash;though not of assuring its author as to its correctness.
</p>

<p>
Water â€¦ Water â€¦ Water â€¦
</p>

<p>
Had he fainted again, that the vultures were so much nearer?â€¦ Why should he be
a second Prometheus? Had he not had suffering enough in his life, without
having more in his death?â€¦ If the sending of a little water were too obvious a
miracle, was it too much to ask that his next fainting and collapse might last
long enough for the vultures to get to work, make a beginning, and an end?
</p>

<p>
Surely that would not be too great a miracle, since he had lain for years on a
red-hot rock with blood in his mouth and his body wrecked like a smashed egg.
He must be practically dead. Perhaps if he held his laboured breath and closed
his eyes they <i>would</i> begin, and he would have the strength to keep still
when they did so. That would be the quickest way. Once they started, it would
not be long before his bones were cleaned. No possible ghost of a chance of
being saved. Probably no human foot had been on these particular rocks since
human feet existed. Nor would he ever again have the strength to drag his
shattered body to where the rifle lay. Only a few yards away lay speedy happy
release.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No such thing as luck, Damocles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the vultures thought otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Colonel John Decies, still of Bimariabad, but long retired on pension from the
Indian Medical Service, was showing his mental and physical unfitness for the
service of the Government that had ordered his retirement, by devoting himself
at the age of fifty-nine to aviation&mdash;aviation in the interests of the
wounded on the battlefield. What he wanted to live to see was a flying
stretcher-service of the Royal Army Medical Corps that should flash to and fro
at the rate of a hundred miles an hour between the rear of the firing-line and
the field hospital and base hospital in aeroplanes built especially for the
accommodation of wounded men&mdash;an officer of the Corps accompanying each in
the dual capacity of surgeon and potential pilot. When he allowed his practical
mind to wander among the vast possibilities of the distant future, he dreamed
of bigger and bigger aeroplanes until they became fully equipped flying
hospitals themselves, and removed the wounded from the danger zone to the
nearest salubrious spot for their convalescence. Meanwhile, he saw no reason
why the more powerful biplanes should not carry an operating-table and all
surgical accessories, a surgeon, and two or three wounded men who could not be
made sitting-up cases.
</p>

<p>
To Colonel John Decies it seemed that if soldiers schemed to adapt the
flying-machine to purposes of death and destruction, doctors might do the same
to purposes of life and salvation. Think of the difference between being jolted
for hours in a bullock-cart in the dust and heat and being borne through the
air without jerk or jar. Think of the hundreds of men who, in the course of one
campaign, would be saved from the ghastly fate of lying unfound, unseen by the
stretcher-bearers, to starve to death, to lie weltering in their blood, to live
through days of agonyâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
He was making quite a name for himself by his experiments at the Kot Ghazi
flying-school and by his articles and speeches on the formation and training of
a R.A.M.C. flying branch. Small beginnings would content him (provided they
were intended to lead to great developments)&mdash;an aeroplane at first, that
could carry one or two special cases to which the ordinary means of transport
would be fatal, and that could scour the ground, especially in the case of very
broken terrain and hill-country, for overlooked cases, wounded men unable to
move or call, and undiscovered by the searchers.
</p>

<p>
He was hard at work on the invention of a strong collapsible operating-table
(that could readily be brought into use in the field and also be used in aerial
transport) and a case for the concentration of equipment&mdash;operation
instruments, rubber gloves, surgical gauntlets, saline infusion apparatus,
sterilizer, aseptic towels, chloroform, bandages, gauze, wool, sponges,
drainage-tubing, inhaler, silk skeins, syringes, field tourniquets, waterproof
cloth, stethoscope&mdash;everything, and the whole outfit, table and all,
weighing forty pounds. This would be an improvement on the system of having to
open half a dozen medical and surgical cases when operating on the line of
march, cases requiring the most expert repacking after use â€¦
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Perhaps it was a sign of advancing years and weakening mind that this fine
specimen of a fine service felt that, when flying some thousands of feet above
the earth, he was nearer to Lenore in Heaven. All his science and sad
experience had failed to deprive him of a sub-conscious belief in an actual
place &ldquo;above,&rdquo; a material Hereafter beyond the sky, and, when
clouds cut him off from sight of the earth, he had a quaint, half-realized
feeling of being in the ante-room of the Great House of many mansions, wherein
dwelt Lenore.
</p>

<p>
Yes, when flying, Colonel John Decies felt that he was nearer to the woman he
had lost nearly a quarter of a century before. In one sense he may have been
so, for he was a very reckless airman, and never in greater danger than when
engaged in what he called &ldquo;ground-scouring&rdquo; among the air-current
haunted, mist-haunted mountains of the Border. He anticipated an early
Border-war and realized that here would be a great opportunity for a
keen-sighted and iron-nerved medical airman to locate, if not to pick up,
overlooked wounded. Here, too, would be a double need of such service in a
country where &ldquo;the women come out to cut up what remains&rdquo;! Imagine,
too, cavalry reconnaissances and bad casualties a score of miles from medical
help â€¦
</p>

<p>
Whether it brought him nearer in any sense to Lenore de Warrenne, it brought
him nearer to her son, on one of those hundred-mile circular
&ldquo;scours&rdquo; which he practised when opportunity offered, generally
accompanied by a like-minded officer of the R.A.M.C., to which Corps he had
become a kind of unofficial and honorary instructor in &ldquo;First- Aid
Flying&rdquo; at the Kot Ghazi flying-school, situate in the plains at the foot
of the &ldquo;Roof of the World&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Colonel John Decies to himself&mdash;&ldquo;vultures!
I suppose they might be referred to in my manual as a likely guide to the
wounded. Good idea. &lsquo;The flying casualty-scout should always take note of
the conduct of vultures, noting the direction of flight if any are seen
dropping to earth. These birds may prove invaluable guides. A collection of
them on the ground may indicate a wounded man who may be alive.&rsquo; â€¦&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Colonel was thinking of his <i>magnum opus</i>, &ldquo;The Aeroplane and
the Surgeon, in War,&rdquo; wherewith he lived laborious days at Bimariabad in
the intervals of testing, developing, and demonstrating his theories at Kot
Ghazi.
</p>

<p>
Turning his head, he shouted to Surgeon-Captain Digby-Soames, R.A.M.C., his
passenger and pupil:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Vultures on the left-front or starboard bow. &lsquo;Invariable
battle-field sign of wounded man. Note spot if unable to land and rescue. Call
up stretcher-party by signal&mdash;<i>Vide</i> page 100 of Decies&rsquo; great
work,&rsquo; what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, it is a wounded man,&rdquo; replied Captain Digby-Soames, who
was using field-glasses. &ldquo;Damned if it isn&rsquo;t a Sahib, too! Out
shikarring and sprained his ankle, I suppose. Dead, I&rsquo;m afraid. Poor
devil!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Vultures aren&rsquo;t <i>at work</i>, anyhow,&rdquo; commented Colonel
Decies. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t land anywhere hereabouts, and I&rsquo;m afraid
&lsquo;calling up the stretcher party&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t in the game
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing nearer than Kot Ghazi and that&rsquo;s a good thirty
miles,&rdquo; replied Captain Digby-Soames as the aeroplane hovered and slowly
sank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see all we can and then find the nearest landing-place.
Search all round for any sign of a tent or encampment. There may be a
dak-bungalow somewhere down in the plains, too. The river-bed down on the right
there, marks the border.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Captain Digby-Soames &ldquo;scoured&rdquo; earnestly with his glasses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Camel on the port-bow, at the foot of the hills,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;What may be a dak-bungalow several miles away â€¦ a white square dot,
anyhow â€¦ Camel saddled up, kneeling â€¦ His, no doubt. Wonder where his shikarri
is&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the aeroplane approached, the disappointed vultures departed, misliking the
size, shape and sounds of the strange fowl. As it passed over him, and the
Major shouted, Dam opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
This must be pretty well the end&mdash;when he heard the voice of some one he
knew well, and saw a flying-machine just above him. He would see blocks of ice
and cascades of cold water in a moment, doubtless, and hear Lucille calling.
</p>

<p>
A flying-machine in Ghazistan! The voice of an old, old friend to whom he could
not, for the moment, give a name â€¦ Why couldn&rsquo;t the cowardly brutes of
vultures begin their business, and end his? What was that familiar voice
calling:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on a bit, we&rsquo;ll soon be with you! Don&rsquo;t give up. We
can&rsquo;t land just here. If we drop anything can you crawl and get
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He opened his eyes,&rdquo; said Captain Digby-Soames, &ldquo;but I doubt
if he&rsquo;s conscious. He must have come a frightful cropper. You can see
there&rsquo;s a compound fracture of the right femur from here, and one of his
feet is fairly pointing backwards. Blood from the mouth, too. Anyhow he&rsquo;s
alive. Better shoot him if we can&rsquo;t shift him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll <i>get</i> him all right. This is a Heaven-sent
&lsquo;problem&rsquo; and we&rsquo;ll solve it&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll quote it in
my &lsquo;manual&rsquo;. Quite war-conditions. Very badly wounded
man&mdash;inaccessible position&mdash;stretcher-parties all out of
sight&mdash;aeroplane can&rsquo;t land for any first-aid nor to pick up the
casualty&mdash;<i>excellent</i> problem and demonstration. That oont<a href="#fn28" name="fnref28" id="fnref28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
will simplify it, though. Look here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drop down and land you by
it, and then come here again and hover. You bring the beast
up&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be able to ride most of the way if you zig-zag, and lead
him most of the rest. Then you&rsquo;ll have to carry the casualty to the oont
and bring him down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn28" id="fn28"></a> <a href="#fnref28">[28]</a>
Camel.
</p>

<p>
The aeroplane swooped down and grounded gently within a hundred yards of the
kneeling camel, who eyed it with the cold and supercilious disdain of his kind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said Colonel Decies, &ldquo;when I get up there
again, have a good squint and see if you think you can locate the spot for
yourself from below. If you can, I&rsquo;ll come down again and we&rsquo;ll
both go up on the oont. Bring the poor beggar down much better if one of us can
hold him while the other drives the camel. It&rsquo;s no Grand Trunk Road, by
Jove.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right-O,&rdquo; acquiesced Captain Digby-Soames. &ldquo;If I can get a
clear bearing to a point immediately below where you hover, I&rsquo;ll lie flat
on the ground as an affirmative signal. If there&rsquo;s no good landmark
I&rsquo;ll stay perpendicular, what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Colonel Decies, and, with a swift run and
throbbing whirr, the aeroplane soared from the ground and rose to where, a
thousand feet from the plain, lay the mangled &ldquo;problem&rdquo;. As it came
to a halt and hovered<a href="#fn29" name="fnref29" id="fnref29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
(like a gigantic dragon-fly poised on its invisibly-rapid wings above a pool),
the junior officer&rsquo;s practised eye noted a practicable gully that
debouched on a level with, and not far from, the ledge over which the aeroplane
hung, and that a stunted thorn-tree stood below the shelf and two large cactus
bushes on its immediate left. Having taken careful note of other landmarks and
glanced at the sun, he lay on the ground at full length for a minute and then
arose and approached the camel, who greeted him with a bubbling snarl. On its
great double saddle were a gun-cover and a long cane, while from it dangled a
haversack, camera, cartridge-case, satchel, canvas water-bag, and a cord-net
holdall of odds and ends.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn29" id="fn29"></a> <a href="#fnref29">[29]</a>
By means of its &ldquo;Decies Horizontal Screw Stabilizer,&rdquo; which enabled
it to &ldquo;hover&rdquo; with only a very slight rise and fall.
</p>

<p>
Obviously the &ldquo;problem&rsquo;s&rdquo; shikar-camel. Apparently he was out
without any shikarri, orderly, or servant&mdash;a foolish thing to do when
stalking in country in which a sprained ankle is more than a possibility, and a
long-range bullet in the back a probability anywhere on that side of the
border.
</p>

<p>
The aeroplane returned to earth and grounded near by. Stopping the engine
Colonel Decies climbed out and swung himself into the rear seat of the camel
saddle. Captain Digby-Soames sprang into the front one and the camel lurched to
its feet, and was driven to the mouth of the gully which the Captain had noted
as running up to the scene of the tragedy.
</p>

<p>
To and fro, in and out of the gully, winding, zig-zagging, often travelling a
hundred yards to make a dozen, the sure-footed and well-trained beast made its
way upward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Coming down will be joy,&rdquo; observed the Colonel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
sooner be on a broken aeroplane in a cyclone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better hop off here, I should think,&rdquo; said Captain Digby-Soames
anon. &ldquo;We can lead him a good way yet, though. Case of divided we stand,
united we fall. Let him fall by himself if he wants to,&rdquo; and at the next
reasonably level spot the camel was made to kneel, that his riders might
descend. Slithering down from a standing camel is not a sport to practise on a
steep hillside, if indulged in at all.
</p>

<p>
Another winding, scrambling climb and the head of the nullah was reached.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have to get the beast kneeling when we climb down to him with the
casualty,&rdquo; opined the Colonel. &ldquo;Better get him down here, I think.
Doesn&rsquo;t seem any decent place farther on,&rdquo; and the camel was
brought to an anchor and left to his own devices.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, the poor beggar <i>has</i> come a purler,&rdquo; said Captain
Digby-Soames, as the two bent over the apparently unconscious man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ever seen him at Kot Ghazi or Bimariabad?&rdquo; inquired Colonel
Decies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;never seen him anywhere.
Why&mdash;have you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly seen him somewhere&mdash;trying to remember where. I thought
perhaps it might have been at the flying-school or at one of the messes.
Can&rsquo;t place him at all, but I&rsquo;ll swear I&rsquo;ve met him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Manoeuvres, perhaps,&rdquo; suggested the other, &ldquo;or &rsquo;board
ship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Extraordinary thing is that I feel I <i>ought</i> to know him well.
Something most familiar about the face. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a bit too
late to&mdash;Broken ribs&mdash;fractured thigh&mdash;broken
ankles&mdash;broken arm&mdash;perforated lungs&mdash;not much good trying to
get him down, I&rsquo;m afraid. He might linger for days, though, if we decided
to stand by, up here. A really first-class problem for
solution&mdash;we&rsquo;re in luck,&rdquo; mused Colonel Decies, making his
rapid and skilful examination. &ldquo;Yes, we must get him down, of
course&mdash;after a bit of splinting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then the real &lsquo;problem&rsquo; will commence, I suppose,&rdquo;
observed Captain Digby-Soames. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t put him into my seat
and fly him to Kot Ghazi while I dossed down with the camel and waited for you
to come for me. And it wouldn&rsquo;t do to camel him to that building which
looks like a dak-bungalow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I think you&rsquo;ll have to stand by while I fly to Kot Ghazi and
bring the necessary things for a temporary job, and then return and try to
guide an ambulance waggon here. Oh, for an aeroplane-ambulance! This job brings
it home to you pretty clearly, doesn&rsquo;t it? Or I might first go and have a
look at the alleged dak-bungalow and see if we could possibly run him over
there on a charpoy<a href="#fn30" name="fnref30" id="fnref30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
or an improvised camel-stretcher. It&rsquo;ll be a ghastly job getting down. I
don&rsquo;t know that you hadn&rsquo;t better stick to him up here while I go
straight back for proper splints and bandages and so forth, and bring another
chap too â€¦ Where the devil have I seen him before? I shall forget my own name
next.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn30" id="fn30"></a> <a href="#fnref30">[30]</a>
Native bed-frame.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel pondered a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;This case is urgent enough to
justify a risky experiment. He&rsquo;s been here a devil of a time and if
he&rsquo;s not in a <i>pukka</i> hospital within the next few hours it&rsquo;s
all up with him. He&rsquo;s going to have the distinction of being the first
casualty removed to hospital by flying-machine. I&rsquo;ll tie him on
somewhere. We&rsquo;ll splint him up as well as possible, and then make him
into a blooming cocoon with the cord, and whisk him away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pity we haven&rsquo;t a few planks,&rdquo; observed Captain
Digby-Soames. &ldquo;We could make one big splint of his whole body and sling
him, planks and all, underneath the aeroplane.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you start splinting that right leg on to the left and stiffen the
knees with something (you&rsquo;ll probably be able to get a decent stick or
two off that small tree), and shove the arm inside his leather legging.
We&rsquo;ve two pairs of putties you can bandage with, and there are
<i>puggries</i> on all three <i>topis</i>. Probably his gun&rsquo;s somewhere
about, for another leg-splint, too. I&rsquo;ll get down to the machine for the
cord and then I&rsquo;ll skirmish around for anything in the nature of poles or
planks. I can get over to that hut and back before you&rsquo;ve done.
It&rsquo;ll be the camelling that&rsquo;ll kill him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At the distant building the Colonel found an abandoned broken-wheeled
bullock-cart, from which he looted the bottom-boards, which were planks six
feet long, laid upon, but not fastened to, the framework of the body of the
cart. From the compound of the place (an ancient and rarely-visited
dak-bungalow, probably the most outlying and deserted in India) he procured a
bamboo pole that had once supported a lamp, the long leg-rests of an old chair,
and two or three sticks, more or less serviceable for his purpose.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the camel, he ascended to where his passenger and pupil awaited
him. Over his shoulder he bore the planks, pole and sticks that the
contemptuous but invaluable camel had borne to a point a few yards below the
scene of the tragedy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good egg,&rdquo; observed the younger man. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do him up
in those like a mummy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the Colonel, &ldquo;then carry him to the oont and
bind him along one side of the saddle, and then lead the beast down. Easily
sling him on to the machine, and there we are. Lucky we&rsquo;ve got the coil
of cord. Fine demonstration for the Kot Ghazi fellers! Show that the thing can
be done, even without the proper kind of &rsquo;plane and surgical outfit. What
luck we spotted him&mdash;or that he fell just in our return track!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doubtless he was born to that end,&rdquo; observed the Captain, who was
apt to get a little peevish when hungry and tired.
</p>

<p>
And when the Army Aeroplane <i>Hawk</i> returned from its
&ldquo;ground-scouring for casualties&rdquo; trip, lo, it bore, beneath and
beside the pilot and passenger, a real casualty slung in a kind of crude
coffin-cradle of planks and poles, a casualty in whose recovery the Colonel
took the very deepest interest, for was he not a heaven-sent case, born to the
end that he might be smashed to demonstrate the Colonel&rsquo;s theories? But
no credit was given to the vultures, without whom the &ldquo;casualty&rdquo;
would never have been found.

<h2><a name="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br/>
FOUND.</h2>

<p>
Colonel John Decies, I.M.S. (retired), visiting the Kot Ghazi Station Hospital,
whereof his friend and pupil, Captain Digby-Soames, was Commandant, scanned the
temperature chart of the unknown, the desperately injured &ldquo;case,&rdquo;
retrieved by his beloved flying-machine, who, judging by his utterances in
delirium, appeared to be even worse damaged in spirit than he was in body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very high again last night,&rdquo; he observed to Miss Norah
O&rsquo;Neill of the Queen Alexandra Military Nursing Sisterhood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and very violent,&rdquo; replied Miss O&rsquo;Neill. &ldquo;I had
to call two orderlies and they could hardly hold him. He appeared to think he
was fighting a huge snake or fleeing from one. He also repeatedly screamed:
&lsquo;It is under my foot! It is moving, moving, moving
<i>out</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Got it</i>, by God!&rdquo; cried the Colonel, suddenly smiting his
forehead with violence. &ldquo;<i>Of course!</i> Fool! Fool that I am! Merciful
God in Heaven&mdash;<i>it&rsquo;s her boy</i>&mdash;and <i>I</i> have saved
him! <i>Her boy!</i> And I&rsquo;ve been cudgelling my failing addled brains
for months, wondering where I had seen his face before. He&rsquo;s my godson,
Sister, and I haven&rsquo;t set eyes on him for the last&mdash;nearly twenty
years!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Norah O&rsquo;Neill had never before seen an excited doctor in a hospital
ward, but she now beheld one nearly beside himself with excitement, joy,
surprise, and incredulity. (It is sad to have to relate that she also heard one
murmuring over and over again to himself, &ldquo;Well, I am damned&rdquo;.)
</p>

<p>
At last Colonel John Decies announced that the world was a tiny, small place
and a very rum one, that it was just like <i>The Hawk</i> to be the means of
saving <i>her</i> boy of all people, and then took the patient&rsquo;s hand in
his, and sat studying his face, in wondering, pondering silence.
</p>

<p>
To Miss Norah O&rsquo;Neill this seemed extraordinarily powerful affection for
a mere <i>godson</i>, and one lost to sight for twenty years at that. Yet
Colonel Decies was a bachelor and, no, the patient certainly resembled him in
no way whatsoever. The tiny new-born germ of a romance died at once in Miss
O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s romantic heart&mdash;and yet, had she but known, here was
a romance such as her soul loved above all things&mdash;the son of the adored
dead mistress discovered <i>in extremis</i>, and saved, by the devout platonic
lover, the life-long lover, and revealed to him by the utterance of the
pre-natally learnt words of the dead woman herself!
</p>

<p>
Yes&mdash;how many times through those awful days had Decies heard that
heart-rending cry! How cruelly the words had tortured him! And here, they were
repeated twenty years on&mdash;for the identification of the son by the friend!
</p>

<p>
That afternoon Colonel Decies dispatched a cablegram addressed to a Miss
Gavestone, Monksmead, Southshire, England, and containing the words,
&ldquo;Have found him, Kot Ghazi, bad accident, doing well, Decies,&rdquo; and
by the next mail Lucille, with Aunt Yvette and a maid, left Port Said, having
travelled overland to Brindisi and taken passage to Egypt by the <i>Osiris</i>
to overtake the liner that had left Tilbury several days before the cable
reached Monksmead. And in Lucille&rsquo;s largest trunk was an article the like
of which is rarely to be found in the baggage of a young lady&mdash;nothing
more nor less than an ancient rapier of Italian pattern!â€¦
</p>

<p>
To Lucille, who knew her lover so well, it seemed that the sight and feel of
the worshipped Sword of his Ancestors must bring him comfort, self-respect,
memories, thoughts of the joint youth and happiness of himself and her.
</p>

<p>
She knew what the Sword had been to him, how he had felt a different person
when he held its inspiring hilt, how it had moved him to the telling of his
wondrous dream and stories of its stirring past, how he had revered and loved
it â€¦surely it must do him good to have it? If he were stretched upon a bed of
sickness, and it were hung where he could see it, it <i>must</i> help him. It
would bring diversion of thought, cheer him, suggest bright
memories&mdash;perhaps give him brave dreams that would usurp the place of bad
ones.
</p>

<p>
If he were well or convalescent it might be even more needful as a tonic to
self-respect, a reminder of high tradition, a message from dead sires. Yes,
surely it must do him good where she could not. If there were any really
insurmountable obstacle to their&mdash;their &mdash;union&mdash;the Sword could
still be with him always, and say unceasingly: &ldquo;Do not be world-beaten,
son of the de Warrennes and Stukeleys. Do not despair. Do not be
fate-conquered. Fight! Fight! Look upon me not as merely the symbol of struggle
but as the actual Sword of your actual Fathers. Fight Fate! Die
fighting&mdash;but do not live defeated&rdquo;&mdash;but of course her hero Dam
needed no such exhortations. Still&mdash;the Sword must be a comfort, a
pleasure, a hope, an inspiration, a symbol. When she brought it him he would
understand. Swords were to sever, but <i>the</i> Sword should be a link&mdash;a
visible bond between them, and between them again and their common past.
</p>

<p>
To her fellow-passengers Lucille was a puzzling enigma. What could be the story
of the beautiful, and obviously wealthy, girl with the anxious, preoccupied
look, whose thoughts were always far away, who took no interest in the pursuits
and pastimes usual to her sex and age on a long sea voyage; who gave no glance
at the wares of local vendors that came aboard at Port Said and Aden; who
occupied her leisure with no book, no writing, no conversation, no deck-games;
and who constantly consulted her watch as though impatient of the slow flight
of time or the slow progress of the ship?
</p>

<p>
Many leading questions were put to Auntie Yvette, but, dearly as she would have
liked to talk about her charge&rsquo;s romantic trouble, her tongue was tied
and she dreaded to let slip any information that might possibly lead to a train
of thought connecting Lucille, Dam, and the old half-forgotten scandal of the
outcast from Monksmead and Sandhurst. If her beloved nephew foolishly chose to
hide his head in shame when there was no shame, it was not for those who loved
him best to say anything which might possibly lead to his discovery and
identification.
</p>

<p>
While cordially polite to all men (including women) Lucille was found to be
surrounded by an impenetrable wall of what was either glass or ice according to
the nature of the investigator. Those who would fain extend relationship beyond
that of merest ephemeral ship-board acquaintanceship (and the inevitabilities
of close, though temporary, daily contact), while admitting that her manner and
manners were beautiful, had to admit also that she was an extremely difficult
young person &ldquo;to get to know&rdquo;. A gilt-edged, bumptious young
subalternknut, who commenced the voyage apoplectically full of self-admiration,
self-confidence, and admiring wonder at his enormous attractiveness,
importance, and value, finished the same in a ludicrously deflated
condition&mdash;and a quiet civilian, to whom the cub had been shamefully
insolent, was moved to present him with a little poem of his composition
commencing &ldquo;There was a puppy caught a wasp,&rdquo; which gave him the
transient though salutary gift of sight of himself as certain others saw himâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Even the Great Mrs. &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; Spywell (her husband was a wee meek
joint-sessions-judge) was foiled in her diligent endeavours, and those who know
the Great Mrs. &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; Spywell will appreciate the defensive
abilities of Lucille. To those poor souls, throughout the world, who stand lorn
and cold without the charmed and charming circle of Anglo-Indiandom, it may be
explained that the Great Mrs. &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; Spywell was far too Great
to be hampered by silly scruples of diffidence when on the track of information
concerning the private affairs of lesser folk&mdash;which is to say other folk.
</p>

<p>
When travelling abroad she is T<small>HE</small> Judge&rsquo;s Wife; when
staying at Hill Stations she is The J<small>UDGE&rsquo;S</small> Wife, and when
adorning her proper sphere, her native heath of Chota Pagalabad, she is The
Judge&rsquo;s WIFE. As she is the Senior Lady of all Chota Pagalabad she, of
course, always (like Mary) Goes In First at the solemn and superior dinner
parties of that important place, and is feared, flattered, and fawned upon by
the other ladies of the station, since she can socially put down the mighty
from their seat and exalt the humble and meek and them of low degree (though
she would not be likely to touch the last-named with a pair of tongs, socially
speaking, of course). And yet, such is this queer world, the said lesser ladies
of the famous mofussil station of Chota Pagalabad are, among themselves, agreed
<i>nemine contradicente</i> that the Great Mrs. &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; Spywell
is a vulgar old frump (&ldquo;country-bred to say the least of it&rdquo;), and
call her The First Seven Sister. This curious and unsyntactically expressed
epithet alludes to the fact that she and six other &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; of like
instincts meet daily for tea and scandal at the Gymkhana and, for three solid
hours, pull to pieces the reputations of all and sundry their acquaintances,
reminding the amused on-looker, by their voices, manner, and appearance, of
those strange birds the <i>Sat Bai</i> or Seven Sisters, who in gangs of seven
make day hideous in their neighbourhood â€¦
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to India to be married, my dear child?&rdquo; she asked
Lucille, before she knew her name.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Lucille.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are not actually engaged, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, of course, if you&rsquo;d rather keep your own counsel, pray do
so,&rdquo; snapped the Great Lady, bridling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lucille, and Mrs. Spywell informed her circle of
stereotypes that Lucille was a stupid chit without a word to say for herself,
and an artful designing hussy who was probably an adventuress of the
&ldquo;fishing-fleet&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
To Auntie Yvette it appeared matter of marvel that earth and sky and sea were
much as when she last passed that way. In quarter of a century or so there
appeared to be but little change in the Egyptian and Arabian deserts, in the
mountains of the African and Arabian coasts, of the Gulf of Suez, in the
contours of the islands of the Red Sea, and of Aden, whilst, in mid-ocean,
there was absolutely no observable difference between then and now. Wonderful
indeed!
</p>

<p>
This theme, that of what was going on at Monksmead, and that of what to do when
Dam was recaptured, formed the bulk of her conversation with her young
companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What will you <i>do</i>, dear, when we <i>have</i> found the poor
darling boy?&rdquo; she would ask.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take him by the ear to the nearest church and marry him,&rdquo; Lucille
would reply; or&mdash;&ldquo;Stick to him like a leech for evermore,
Auntie&rdquo;; or&mdash;&ldquo;Marry him when he isn&rsquo;t looking, or while
he&rsquo;s asleep, if he&rsquo;s ill&mdash;or by the scruff of his neck if
he&rsquo;s wellâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
(What a pity the Great Mrs. &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; Spywell could not hear these
terrible and unmaidenly sentiments! An adventuress of the
&ldquo;fishing-fleet&rdquo; in very truth!)
</p>

<p>
And with reproving smile the gentle spinster would reply:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My <i>dear!</i> Suppose anyone overheard you, what <i>would</i> they
think?&rdquo; Whereunto the naughty girl would answer:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The truth, Auntie&mdash;that I&rsquo;m going to pursue some poor young
man to his doom. If Dam were a leper in the gutter, begging his bread, I would
marry him in spite of himself&mdash;or share the gutter and bread
in&mdash;er&mdash;guilty splendour. If he were a criminal in jail I would sit
on the doorstep till he came out, and do the same dreadful thing. I&rsquo;m
just going to marry Dam at the first possible moment&mdash;like the Wild West
&lsquo;shoot on sight&rsquo; idea. I&rsquo;m going to seize him and marry him
and take care of him for the rest of his life. If he never had another grief,
ache, or pain in the whole of his life, he must have had more than ten times
his share already. Anyhow whether he&rsquo;ll marry me or whether he
won&rsquo;t&mdash;in his stupid quixotic ideas of his &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; to
do so&mdash;I&rsquo;m never going to part from him again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Auntie Yvette would endeavour to be less shocked than a right-minded
spinster aunt should be at such wild un-Early-Victorian sentiments.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Come, this was a better sort of dream! This was better than dreaming of
prison-cells, lunatic asylums, tortures by the Snake, lying smashed on rocks,
being eaten alive by vultures, wandering for aeons in red- hot waterless
deserts, and other horrors. However illusory and tantalizing, this was at least
a glorious dream, a delirium to welcome, a wondrous change indeed&mdash;to seem
to be holding the hand of Lucille while she gazed into his eyes and, from time
to time, pressed her lips to his forehead. A good job most of the bandages were
gone or she could hardly have done that, even in a dream. And how wondrously
<i>real!</i> Her hand felt quite solid, there were tears trickling down her
cheeks, tears that sometimes dropped on to his own hand with an incredible
effect of actuality. It was even more vivid than his Sword-dream which was
always so extraordinarily realistic and clear. And there, yes, by Jove, was
dear old Auntie Yvette, smiling and weeping simultaneously. Such a dream was
the next best thing to reality&mdash;save that it brought home to one too
vividly what one had lost. Pain of that kind was nevertheless a magnificent
change from the other ghastly nightmares, of the wholly maleficent kind. This
was a kindly, helpful painâ€¦.It is so rare to see the faces of our best-beloved
in dreams â€¦ Sleep was going to be something other than a procession of hideous
nightmares then â€¦
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe he knew me, Auntie,&rdquo; whispered Lucille. &ldquo;Oh, when
will Colonel Decies come back. I want him to be here when he opens his eyes
again. He would know at a glance whether he were in his right mind and knew
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am certain he did, dear,&rdquo; replied Auntie Yvette. &ldquo;I am
positive he smiled at you, and I believe he knew me too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> believe I have found him too late. It
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> be true,&rdquo; wept the girl, overstrained and unstrung
by long vigils, heart-sick with hope deferred, as she turned to her companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucille! Is it real?&rdquo; came a feeble whisper from the bed&mdash;and
Lucille, in the next moments, wondered if it be true that joy cannot kill â€¦
</p>

<hr />

<p>
A few weeks later, Damocles de Warrenne sat on the verandah of the Grand
Imperial Hotel Royal of Kot Ghazi, which has five rooms and five million
cockroaches, and stared blankly into the moonlit compound, beyond which
stretched the bare rocky plain that was bounded on the north and west by mighty
mountains, on the east by a mighty river, and on the south by the more mighty
ocean, many hundreds of miles away.
</p>

<p>
He had just parted from Auntie Yvette and Lucille&mdash;Lucille whose last
words as she turned to go to her room had been:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, understand, Dammy, what you want now is a sea-voyage, a sea-voyage
to England and Monksmead. When we have got you absolutely right, Mr. Wyllis
shall show you as a specimen of the Perfect Man in Harley Street&mdash;and
<i>then</i>, Dammy â€¦&rdquo; and his burning kisses had closed her mouth.
</p>

<p>
Was he scoundrel enough to do it? Had he deteriorated to such a depth of
villainy? Could he let that noblest and finest flower of womanhood marry
a&mdash;dangerous lunatic, a homicidal maniac who had nearly killed the man who
proved to be almost his greatest benefactor? Could he? Would the noble-hearted
Decies frankly say that he was normal and had a right to marry? He would not,
and no living man was better qualified to give an opinion on the case of
Damocles de Warrenne than the man who was a foster-father to him in childhood,
and who brought him into the world in such tragic circumstances. Decies had
loved his mother, Lenore de Warrenne. Would he have married <i>her</i> in such
circumstances? Would he have lived under the same roof with her
permanently&mdash;knowing how overpowering would be the temptation to give way
and marry her, knowing how scandal would inevitably arise? A thousand times No.
Was there <i>no</i> gentlemanliness left in Damocles de Warrenne that he should
even contemplate the doing of a deed at which his old comrades-in-arms, Bear,
Burke, Jones, Little, Goate, Nemo and Peerson would stand aghast, would be
ready to kick him out of a decent barrack-room&mdash;and the poor demented
creature called for a &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; and ordered him to send, at once, for
one Abdul Ghani who would, as usual, be found sleeping beside his camels in the
market-place â€¦
</p>

<p>
Anon the gentle Abdul came, received certain instructions, and departed smiling
till his great yellow fangs gleamed in the moonlight beneath the bristling
moustache, cut back from the lips as that of a righteous Mussulman
<i>shikarri</i> and <i>oont-wallah</i> should be.
</p>

<p>
Damocles de Warrenne&rsquo;s brain became active with plots and plans for
escape&mdash;escape from himself and the temptation which he must avoid by
flight, since he felt he could not conquer it in fight.
</p>

<p>
He must disappear. He must die&mdash;die in such a way that Lucille would never
suppose he had committed suicide. It was the only way to save himself from so
awful a crime and to save her from himself.
</p>

<p>
He would start just before dawn on Abdul&rsquo;s shikar camel, be well away
from Kot Ghazi by daylight and reach the old deserted dak-bungalow, that no one
ever used, by evening. There Abdul would come to him with his
<i>bhoja-oont</i><a href="#fn31" name="fnref31" id="fnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
bringing the usual supplies, and on receipt of them he would dismiss Abdul
altogether and disappear again into the desert, this time for good. Criminal
lunatics and homicidal maniacs are better dead, especially when they are
tempted beyond their strength to marry innocent, beautiful girls who do not
understand the position.

<h2><a name="chap14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br/>
THE SNAKE AND THE SWORD.</h2>

<p>
The dak-bungalow again at last! But how terribly dreary, depressing, and
horrible it looked <i>now</i>&mdash;the hut that had once seemed a kind of
heaven on earth to the starving wanderer. Then, Lucille was thousands of miles
away (geographically, and millions of miles away in imagination). Now, she was
but thirty miles away&mdash;and it was almost more than human endurance could
bearâ€¦. Should he turn back even now, ride straight to Kot Ghazi, fall at her
feet and say: &ldquo;I can struggle no longer. Come back to Monksmead&mdash;and
let what will be, be. I have no more courage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And go mad, one day, and kill her? Keep sane, and sully her fair name? On to
the hovel. Rest for the night, and, at dawn, strike into the desert and there
let what will be, be.
</p>

<p>
Making the camel kneel, Damocles de Warrenne removed its saddle, fastened its
rein-cord tightly to a post, fed it, and then detached the saddle-bags that
hung flatly on either side of the saddle frame, as well as a patent-leather
sword-cover which contained a sword of very different pattern from that for
which it had been made.
</p>

<p>
Entering the hut, of which the doors and windows were bolted on the outside, he
flung open the shutters of the glassless windows, lit a candle, and prepared to
eat a frugal meal. From the saddlebags he took bread, eggs, chocolate,
sardines, biscuits and apples. With a mixture of permanganate of potash, tea
and cold water from the well, if the puddle at the bottom of a deep hole could
be so termed, he made a drink that, while drinkable by one who has known worse,
was unlikely to cause an attack upon an enfeebled constitution, of cholera,
enteric, dysentery or any other of India&rsquo;s specialities. What would he
not have given for a clean whisky-and-soda in the place of the nauseating
muck&mdash;but what should be the end of a man who, in his position, turned to
<i>alcohol</i> for help and comfort? &ldquo;The last state of that man â€¦&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After striking a judicious balance between what he should eat for dinner and
what he should reserve for breakfast, he fell to, ate sparingly, lit his pipe,
and gazed around the wretched room, of which the walls were blue-washed with a
most offensive shade of blue, the bare floor was frankly dry mud and dust, the
roof was bare cob-webbed thatch and rafter, and the furniture a rickety table,
a dangerous-looking cane-bottomed settee and a leg-rest arm-chair from which
some one had removed the leg-rests. Had some scoundrelly <i>oont-wallah</i>
pinched them for fuel? (No, Damocles, an ex-Colonel of the Indian Medical
Service &ldquo;pinched&rdquo; them for splints.) A most depressing human
habitation even for the most cheerful and care-free of souls, a terrible place
for a man in a dangerous mental state of unstable equilibrium and cruel agonyâ€¦.
Only thirty miles away&mdash;and a camel at the door. <i>Lucille</i> still
within a night&rsquo;s ride. Lucille and absolute joyâ€¦. The desert and certain
death&mdash;a death of which she must be assured, that in time she might marry
Ormonde Delorme or some such sound, fine man. Abdul must find his
body&mdash;and it must be the body not of an obvious suicide, but of a man who,
lost in the desert, had evidently travelled in circles, trying to find his way
to the hut he had left, on a shooting expedition. Yes&mdash;he knew all about
travelling in circles&mdash;and what he had done in ignorance (as well as in
agony and horror), he would now do intentionally and with grim purpose. Hard on
the poor camel!â€¦ Perhaps he could manage so that it was set free in time to
find its way back somehow. It would if it were loosed within smell of waterâ€¦.
He must die fairly and squarely of hunger and thirst&mdash;no blowing out of
brains or throat-cutting, no trace of suicide; just lost, poor chap, and no
more to be saidâ€¦. Death of <i>thirst</i>&mdash;in that awful
desert&mdash;<i>again</i>&mdash;No! God in Heaven he had faced the actual pangs
of it once, and escaped&mdash;he could <i>not</i> face it again&mdash;he
wasn&rsquo;t strong enough â€¦ and the unhappy man sprang to his feet to rush
from the room and saddle-up the camel for&mdash;Life and Lucille&mdash;and then
his eye fell on the Sword, the Sword of his Fathers, brought to him by Lucille,
who had said, &ldquo;Have it with you always, Dearest. It can <i>talk</i> to
you, as even I can notâ€¦.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sat down and drew it from the incongruous modern case and from its scabbard.
Ha! What did it say but &ldquo;<i>Honour</i>!&rdquo; What was its message but
&ldquo;Do the right thing. Death is nothing&mdash;Honour is everything. Be
worthy of your Name, your Traditions, your Ancestors&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He would die.
</p>

<p>
Let him die that Lucille&rsquo;s honour, Lucille&rsquo;s happiness,
Lucille&rsquo;s welfare, might live&mdash;and he kissed the hilt of the Sword
as he had so often done in childhood. Having removed boots, leggings and socks,
he lay down on the settee&mdash;innocent of bedding and pillows, pulled over
him the coat that had been rolled and strapped trooper-fashion behind the
saddle and fell asleepâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
And dreamed that he was shut naked in a tiny cell with a gigantic python upon
whose yard-long fangs he was about to be impaled and, as usual, awoke trembling
and bathed in perspiration, with dry mouth and throbbing head, sickness, and
tingling extremities.
</p>

<p>
The wind had got up and had blown out the candle which should have lasted till
dawn!â€¦
</p>

<p>
As he lay shaking, terrified (uncertain as to whether he were a soul in torment
or a human being still alive), and debating as to whether he could get off the
couch, relight the candle, and close the windward window, he heard a sound that
caused his heart to miss a beat and his hair to rise on end. A strange, dry
rustle merged in the sound of paper being dragged across the floor, and he knew
that he <i>was</i> shut in with a snake, shut up in a <i>blue room</i>, cut off
from the matches on the table, and doomed to lie and await the Death he dreaded
more than ten thousand others&mdash;or, going mad, to rush upon that Death.
</p>

<p>
<i>He was shut in with the SNAKE</i>. At last it had come for him in its own
concrete form and had him bound and gagged by fascination and fear&mdash;in the
Dark, the awful cruel Dark. No more mere myrmidons. <i>The SNAKE ITSELF</i>.
</p>

<p>
He tried to scream and could not. He tried to strike out at an imaginary
serpent-head, huge as an elephant, that reared itself above him&mdash;and could
not.
</p>

<p>
He could not even draw his bare foot in under the overcoat. And steadily the
paper dragged across the floor â€¦ Was it approaching? Was it progressing round
and round by the walls? Would the Snake find the bed and climb on to it? Would
it coil round his throat and gaze with-luminescent eyes into his, and torture
him thus for hours ere thrusting its fangs into his brain? Would it coil up and
sleep upon his body for hours before doing so, knowing that he could not move?
Here were his Snake-Dreams realized, and in the actual flesh he lay awake and
conscious, and could neither move nor cry aloud!
</p>

<p>
In the Dark he lay bound and gagged, in a blue-walled room, and the Snake
enveloped him with its Presence, and he could in no wise save himself.
</p>

<p>
Oh, God, why let a sentient creature suffer thus? He himself would have shot
any human being guilty of inflicting a tithe of the agony on a pariah dog.
There could <i>be</i> no God!â€¦ and then the beams of the rising moon fell upon
the blade of the Sword, making it shine like a lamp, and, with a roar as of a
charging lion, Damocles de Warrenne sprang from the bed, seized it by the hilt,
and was aware, without a tremor, of a cobra that reared itself before him in
the moonlight, swaying in the Dance of Death.
</p>

<p>
With a mere flick of the sword he laid the reptile twitching on the
floor&mdash;and for a few minutes was madder with Joy than ever in his life he
had been with Fear.
</p>

<p>
<i>For Fear was gone. The World of Woe had fallen from his shoulders. The Snake
was to him but a wretched reptile whose head he would crush ere it bruised his
heel. He was sane&mdash;he was safe&mdash;he was a Man again, and ere many days
were past he would be the husband of Lucille and the master of Monksmead.</i>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, God forgive me for a blind, rebellious worm,&rdquo; he prayed.
&ldquo;Forgive me, and strike not this cup from my lips. You would not punish
the blasphemy of a madman? I <i>cannot</i> pray in ordered forms, but I beg
forgiveness for my hasty cry &lsquo;There is on God&rsquo; â€¦&rdquo; and then
pressed the Sword to his lips&mdash;the Sword that, under God, had overthrown
the Snake for ever, saved his reason&mdash;and given him Lucilleâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
With the Sword in his hand he lay on the bed once more, and slept the sweet,
dreamless sleep of a healthy, happy child. In the morning, when he awoke, his
eyes fell upon the still living cobra that appeared to watch him with the hate
of a baffled Lucifer as it lay broken-backed, impotent, and full of vicious
fury.
</p>

<p>
Rising, Damocles de Warrenne stepped across to the reptile, and, with a quick
snatch, seized it behind the head and raised it from the ground. Staring into
its baleful, evil-looking eyes, he remarked:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, mine ancient enemy and almost victor! I&rsquo;m not of a
particularly vengeful disposition, but I fancy a few of your brethren have got
to die before I leave India. Why, you poor wretched worm, you miserable
maggot,&mdash;to think what I have <i>suffered</i>&rdquo; and he angrily dashed
it on the ground and spurned it with his foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Easy to do that when your back&rsquo;s broken, you think?&rdquo; he
continued. &ldquo;Right-O, my lad, wait till I find your mate, and we&rsquo;ll
see. Hand to hand, no weapons&mdash;my quickness and strength against his
quickness and venom. Snakes! The paltriest things that crawl&rdquo;&mdash;and
he kicked the reptile into a corner and burst into song as he busied himself
about preparations for washing, food for himself and the camel,
and&mdash;<i>return</i>. After enough food to hearten them both for the
thirty-mile journey he would go as fast as camel&rsquo;s legs could move to
Lucille and the announcement that would send her frantic with joy. He would
take her in his arms&mdash;then they would waltz for an hour to keep themselves
from behaving like lunaticsâ€¦. Fear was dead! The SNAKE was dead&mdash;killed by
the SWORD, the Sword that Lucille had brought, and thereby saved him! Madness
was dead! Joy, Peace, Sanity, Health were come&mdash;the wedding-bells were
trembling to burst into peals of joyous announcement.
</p>

<p>
He would, for Lucille&rsquo;s sake and the names of de Warrenne and Stukeley,
show whether he was a Coward or a snake-fearing Lunatic, an epileptic, an
unfit-to-marry monstrosity and freak. He would show the Harley Street
physicians how much he feared snakes, and would challenge them to an
undertaking which would give them food for thought before acceptanceâ€¦. Where
were his boots? He must fly to Lucille!â€¦
</p>

<p>
And then the galloping hoofs of a horse were heard thudding towards the hut,
and, hastening to the door, he saw Lucille whipping a lathered horse.
</p>

<p>
Rushing towards her he shouted:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you marry me to-morrow? Will you marry me to-day, Lucille?&rdquo;
and, as she pulled her horse in, he darted back into the room and reappeared
twirling a twitching cobra by its tail, and laughing uproariouslyâ€¦.
</p>

<p>
Lucille appeared to be about to faint as he dropped it, seized her in his arms,
and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Darling, I am cured! I have not the slightest fear of snakes. The
Sword has saved me. I am a Man again.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
He told her all as she sat laughing and sobbing for joy and the dying snake lay
at their feet.
</p>

<p>
In her heart of hearts Lucille determined that the wedding should take place
immediately, so that if this were but a temporary respite, the result of the
flash of daring inspired by the Sword, she would have the right to care for him
for the rest of his life â€¦ She would&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she suddenly shrieked, and pointed to where, in the
doorway, cutting them off from escape, was the mate of the cobra that lay
mangled before them. Had the injured reptile in some way called its
mate&mdash;or were they regular inhabitants of this deserted hut?
</p>

<p>
It was Lucille&rsquo;s first experience of cobras and she shuddered to see the
second&mdash;evidently comprehending, aggressive, vengeful&mdash;would it
spring from there â€¦ and the Sword lay on the bed, out of reach.
</p>

<p>
Dam arose with a laugh, picked up his heavy boot as he did so, and, all in one
swift movement, hurled it at the half-coiled swaying creature, with the true
aim of the first-class cricketer and trained athlete; then, following his boot
with a leap, he snatched at the tail of the coiling, thrashing reptile and
&ldquo;cracked&rdquo; the snake as a carter cracks a whip&mdash;whereafter it
dangled limp and dead from his hand! Lucille shrieked, paled, and sprang
towards him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Dam!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how <i>could</i> you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, Kiddy,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to invite the
Harley Street cove to have a match at that&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to give a
little exhibition of it on the lawn at Monksmead&mdash;to all the good folk who
witnessed my disgraceâ€¦. What&rsquo;s a snake after all? It&rsquo;s <i>my</i>
turn now;&rdquo; and Lucille&rsquo;s heart was at rest and very thankful. This
was not a temporary &ldquo;cure&rdquo;. Oh, thank God for her inspiration anent
the Sword â€¦ Thank God, thank God!â€¦
</p>

<h2><a name="chap15"></a>SEVEN YEARS AFTER.</h2>

<p>
A beautiful woman, whose face is that of one whose soul is full of peace and
joy, passes up the great staircase of the stately mansion of Monksmead. Slowly,
because her hand holds that of a chubby youth of five, a picture of sturdy
health, strength and happiness. They pass beneath an ancient Sword and the boy
wheels to the right, stiffens himself, brings his heels together, and raises a
fat little hand to his forehead in solemn salute. The journey is continued
without remark until they reach the day nursery, a big, bright room of which a
striking feature is the mural decoration in a conventional pattern of entwined
serpents, the number of brilliant pictures of snakes, framed and hung upon the
walls, and two glass cases, the one containing a pair of stuffed cobras and the
other a finely-mounted specimen of a boa-constrictor (which had once been the
pride of the heart of a Folkestone taxidermist).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go away, Mitthis Beaton,&rdquo; says the small boy to a white-haired but
fresh-looking and comely old dame; &ldquo;I&rsquo;se not going to bed till
Mummy hath tolded me about ve bwacelet again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve told you a <i>thousand</i> times, Dammykins,&rdquo; says
the lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, now tell me ten hundred times,&rdquo; replies the young man
coolly, and attempts to draw from the lady&rsquo;s wrist a huge and remarkable
bracelet.
</p>

<p>
This uncommon ornament consists of a great ruby-eyed gold snake which coils
around the lady&rsquo;s arm and which is pierced through every coil by a
platinum, diamond-hilted sword, an exact model of the Sword which hangs on the
staircase.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You tell <i>me</i>, Sonny, for a change,&rdquo; suggests the lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Velly well,&rdquo; replies the boyâ€¦. &ldquo;Vere was once a Daddy and a
hobberell gweat Thnake always bovvered him and followed him about and
wouldn&rsquo;t let him gone to thleep and made him be ill like he had eaten too
much sweets, and the doctor came and gave him lotths of meddisnin. Then he had
to wun away from the Thnake, but it wunned after him, and it wath jutht going
to kill him when Mummy bwoughted the Thword and Daddy killed the Thnake all
dead. And I am going to have the Thword when I gwow up, but vere aren&rsquo;t
any more bad Thnakes. They is all good now and Daddy likes vem and I likes vem.
Amen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> never said <i>Amen</i>, when I told you the story,
Sonny,&rdquo; remarks the lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well you can, now I have tolded you it,&rdquo; permits her son.
&ldquo;It means <i>bus</i><a href="#fn32" name="fnref32" id="fnref32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>&mdash;all
finished. Mitthis Beaton thaid tho. And when I am as big as Daddy I&rsquo;m
going to be the Generwal of the Queenth Gweyth and thay
&lsquo;<i>Charge!</i>&rsquo; and wear the Thword.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
Lucille de Warrenne here smothers conversation in the manner common to
worshipping mothers whose prodigies make remarks indicative of marvellous
precocity, in fact absolutely unique intelligence.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
