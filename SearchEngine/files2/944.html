    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>Victory is only a question of keeping cool, says VON
    TIRPITZ. A long-suffering Fatherland anticipates no difficulty
    whatever in following his advice during the winter.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A semi-official message from Berlin declares that Jerusalem
    was evacuated because Germany's friends did not desire to see
    battles fought over sacred ground. The Sultan of TURKEY is
    reported to have wired to the KAISER to think of another.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>America is still breaking all records. A native artist has
    painted a picture which is said to be sixty feet by nineteen,
    the largest miniature ever painted in America.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is rumoured that at a provincial Tribunal the other day
    an applicant asked for a further six months' exemption as he
    had a wife and a position in a butter queue to maintain.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It seems useless to attempt to cope with the multiplicity of
    events in these days. Cuba has declared war on Austria; the
    KAISER threatens to make a Christmas peace offer, and Mr.
    GEORGE BERNARD SHAW has described himself as "a mere
    individual." And this all in one week.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to Dean INGE, Germany is in many ways the best
    governed country in Europe. She certainly seems to have a
    better governed clergy than ours.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Much relief is felt at the announcement that rather than
    endanger the Allies' "solidarity" Lord LANSDOWNE has promised
    not to agree with President WILSON again.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Bloaters have reached the unprecedented price of six-pence
    each. It was hoped that, at any rate, over the Christmas season
    they would remain within reach of the upper classes.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A man has been charged with stealing a railway sandwich at
    Harwich. It appears that the poor fellow, who was lonely,
    wanted to take it home as a pet.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A contemporary has a headline, "Swearing in the New French
    Cabinet." They are beginning early.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>For adding water to his employer's milk a dairyman's
    assistant has been sent to prison. Innocent dairymen must of
    course be protected.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Smokers complain that they are discovering unfamiliar
    substances in their tobacco. A sensation has been caused by the
    expert statement that they are tobacco.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Orchids were sold for as little as two-pence each at a
    recent sale, and alarmed growers are clamouring for the
    immediate appointment of an Orchid Controller.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An evening paper correspondent has complained that he has
    searched the shops in vain for a tortoise. So far the various
    Government Departments have maintained a dignified silence.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is all nonsense for a contemporary to say that the
    blizzard in the North on a recent Saturday did no damage.
    Several of the football results were delayed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>While visiting Seaton College, New York, the other day, Mr.
    ROOSEVELT saluted a statue of ALEXANDER THE GREAT. We have
    always maintained that there is nothing petty about the
    EX-PRESIDENT.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The most striking announcement of the year 1917 comes just
    when it is almost used up. "There is a steady demand for
    money," says a Stock Exchange report.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A mummified duck, estimated to be two thousand years old,
    has been discovered in a sandstone stratum in Iowa. It is not
    often that the poulterers of Iowa are caught napping.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An American policeman is said to have written two successful
    musical comedies. If we remember rightly it was an English
    policeman who first composed the Frog's March.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At a Guildford charity f&ecirc;te the winner of a hurdle
    race was awarded a new-laid egg. If he succeeds in winning it
    three years in succession it is to become his own property.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The L.B. &amp; S.C. Railway desire to state that the train
    from which the deserter jumped without injuring himself was not
    really doing its best.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A burglar was discovered concealed beneath the counter of a
    Leicester butter-merchant's shop. It is understood that he came
    early to avoid the rush.</p>

    <h2>WITH THE AUXILIARY PATROL.</h2>

    <p>I do not think there was a single man of the ship's company
    who bore the loss of poor Mnemosyne dry-eyed. From the
    lieutenant down to the trimmer we had become sincerely attached
    to this affectionate little creature, and when unhappily,
    during the temporary absence of the steward, she ventured to
    circumvent the rim of an open condensed milk-tin, missed her
    footing and succumbed to a clammy death, there was not a more
    unhappy trawler patrolling the North Sea than ours.</p>

    <p>She was a weevil and I found her in my ship's biscuit. From
    the first I recognised that she was no ordinary weevil; her
    stately bearing, the fine upward curl of her moustachios, but,
    more than anything else, the intelligent, often humorous gleam
    in her big black eyes elevated her at once above the mass of
    her compatriots. She took to me wonderfully: I secured her
    confidence with a piece of boiled cat-fish, and thenceforth we
    were scarcely ever apart. Not that she resented the advances of
    the rest of the crew&mdash;she was no snob, and would eat from
    the hand of the trimmer as readily as from my own, and allow
    anyone to stroke her; but it was I who taught her to sit up and
    beg, to "die for her country," to droop her antenn&aelig;
    whenever the name of VON TIRPITZ was mentioned, and to wave
    them for Sir DAVID BEATTY. She would often sit with me in the
    wireless cabin whilst I was on watch, and never once did she
    disturb me during the receiving of a message by boisterous or
    noisy behaviour.</p>

    <p>We had other weevils at different times, but none so
    intelligent or so faithful as Mnemosyne. The lieutenant tamed
    one, and, being a devotee of science and despising the arts, he
    named him Newton Darwin; but he was a foolish fellow at the
    best and continually getting into somebody's way. The
    lieutenant offered to back him against Mnemosyne for a race
    across the cabin table, and we made a match of it. The betting
    was three to two in favour of Newton Darwin, because the third
    hand, who had once been employed in a racing-stable, had been
    heard to remark that he had very fine quarters. The stakes were
    half a plug of ship's tobacco.</p>

    <p>It was a walk-over. On the word "Go" Mnemosyne positively
    leapt forward, took a crease in the tablecloth in her stride
    and completed the course, which measured sixteen inches, in the
    remarkable time of seven and two-fifths minutes. Newton Darwin
    was left standing; indeed he never attempted to race, but,
    after staring about vacantly for some minutes, ambled leisurely
    off in the opposite direction, where he had seen a
    breadcrumb.</p>

    <p>This victory was very popular, and the third hand was
    roundly abused for suggesting that Mnemosyne had been doped.
    Even if Newton had got away with the pistol he would never have
    stood a chance against her. She was the fleetest weevil I ever
    saw.</p>

    <p>Another weevil was Bertie, who belonged to the second
    engineer, but he was caught pilfering the skipper's private
    supply of fresh butter, which he kept in a jar in his bunk and
    was very jealous of, so Bertie had to be made away with. He
    walked the plank at daybreak one grey stormy morning just off
    the Nethermost Ruff of the Dogger. The second was very upset
    for a day or two; he said he would have staked anything on
    Bertie's honesty.</p>

    <p>We kept Mnemosyne for over two months, and never once did
    she misconduct herself or behave in an unseamanlike manner. Her
    one failing, if such it can be called, was a weakness for
    condensed milk, and this it was that led to her untimely end.
    We had come to regard her as one of the crew, and had a little
    lifebelt made for her in case of need. Jones, our signaller,
    who has poetical moments, was inspired by her to make verse,
    which began:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>There is something very evil</p>

            <p>In the war-whoop of a weevil.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This was indignantly censored as a libel, but he excused
    himself on the plea that "evil" was the only possible rhyme to
    be found for "weevil," and declared that his very last
    intention had been to be personal or to cast the least
    reflection on the lovable disposition of Mnemosyne, so we
    forgave him with a caution.</p>

    <p>Well, Mnemosyne is gone, and the ship seems a dull place
    without this exhilarating little pet. Never so long as ship's
    biscuits continue to buckle the jack-knives of British
    seafarers will there be another weevil like Mnemosyne.</p>

    <p>We flew the White Ensign at halfmast from dawn to sundown on
    the day she died.</p>

    <h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

    <h3>LXVIII.</h3>

    <p>My Dear Charles,&mdash;I don't know that I think so much of
    these alliances after all, and I'll tell you why.</p>

    <p>When I first heard that my old friend Italy was in trouble I
    paraded my officer at once. "Stand to attention, George," I
    said, "and tell me what we are going to do about it."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that'll be all right," said he. "I've booked my seat in
    the train."</p>

    <p>I think that George, my subordinate, sometimes forgets who I
    am and what importance attaches to me. I feel that he ought at
    least to consult me formally before he decides what
    instructions I am going to issue to him. After all, I am only
    fifteen years younger than he is.</p>

    <p>"You will proceed forthwith to Italy," I said, "and will
    there study the local conditions on the spot. You will then
    take such action as the occasion seems to you to demand."
    George was cleaning out his pipe, so for once he didn't
    interrupt. "You will report progress to me in triplicate."</p>

    <p>George frowned. Having been the Supreme White Man in some
    African district for dozens of years before the War, all his
    hair seems to have got into his eyebrows, and his frown is a
    terrible thing to see.</p>

    <p>"At any rate," I said, "you might just drop me a post-card
    to tell me how you're getting on."</p>

    <p>George's eyebrows stood at ease and then stood easy.</p>

    <p>"It's all very well for you," I added. "But what about me,
    when it comes to totting up your travelling allowances later
    on?"</p>

    <p>George has private means, which work out at about
    one-and-fourpence, less income tax, a day. Consequently he is a
    little careless about money matters. "Oh, that'll be all
    right," he said.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>George was away for three weeks. What he did all the time
    I'm sure I don't know, though I kept on reporting to my
    superiors that the necessary steps were being taken and the
    requisite measures were being initiated. When he got back he
    wanted to start in at once telling me all about it. But I said
    no, and insisted on getting down to the War.</p>

    <p>"In making out travelling claims," I said, producing the
    appropriate Army Form, "care should be taken to comply with the
    instructions contained in the King's Regulations. We have a
    quarter of an hour before your breakfast will be ready. Let us
    deal with our more formidable enemies, the Pay People,
    first."</p>

    <p>George is the sort of person who gets you into trouble on
    the very first line of any Army Form. Asked as to his rank, he
    told me he was a Second Lieutenant in the Army, temporary
    Lieutenant, acting Captain. All these ranks get a different
    rate of allowance. Which of the three was George in fact?</p>

    <p>"A man of your age ought to know better," I said.</p>

    <p>We were half-an-hour late for breakfast, and even so George
    hadn't got to the station of departure, as far as A.F.O. 1771
    was concerned.</p>

    <p>I determined to devote the morning to the matter, clearing
    the court for the purpose. Our Mr. Booth, however, who is
    intolerably precise and accurate in these matters, had profited
    by my absence at breakfast to collect a folio of relevant
    Orders and Instructions, numbered one to seventy-three
    consecutively.</p>

    <p>It all sounds so simple, doesn't it? You get so many francs
    a day for subsistence, and so many francs a night for
    accommodation, in France; so many lire a day for subsistence,
    and so many lire a night for accommodation, in Italy. Ah yes,
    but you don't know George when he is in action. Not content
    with travelling in the dark, and so subsisting by night when he
    ought to be accommodated, and being accommodated by day when he
    ought to be subsisting, he could never make up his mind to stay
    in the same country for two days together. As to his constant
    movements from one country to the other, three times he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page428"
       id="page428"></a>[pg 428]</span> had supposed he had
       finished with Italy and was due back in France; each time he
       had got comfortably across the frontier into France he had
       been recalled to Italy. Never once had he the sense to cross
       the frontier on the stroke of midnight, and so make a
       complete twenty-four hours of it on each side, and all the
       time the rate of exchange was varying by a fraction. But, as
       George said, it wasn't himself who was manipulating the rate
       of exchange as between the two countries, and courtesy to
       allied nations prevented him from manipulating the
       trains.</p>

    <p>It was towards teatime when he satisfied me of his own
    innocence on these points; but don't run away with the idea
    that by this time we were well on with the business. We had
    barely as much as started. How are you to fix the "date of
    journey" in such a manner as to give the traveller a clear
    night for accommodation in one country, or a clear day for
    subsistence in another, when he leaves his home at 5.15 P.M.,
    arrives at the end of the first stage at 6.10 P.M., sleeps in a
    hotel till 11 P.M., gets in the train at thirty-five minutes
    past, crosses the frontier at 2 P.M. on the following day,
    arrives at his Italian destination at 5 A.M. on the morning
    after that, and then, if you please, goes to bed in another
    hotel? Old soldier though I am, there didn't seem to me to be a
    single line in a single column which I could satisfactorily
    fill in. True, there was the space for "Remarks," but our Mr.
    Booth was quite sure that my remarks were not what the Pay
    People called for.</p>

    <p>By this time I was for giving in, but George was now the
    persistent one. It was never his pocket he cared for; it was
    just one of his confounded principles not to be beaten by
    anything, not even an Army Form. I expressed some surprise that
    in the course of this tour of duty he had not managed to find
    his way to America for an hour or two, if only to complicate my
    business with the dollar question...</p>

    <p>I read the whole Form again, from start to finish, including
    the bit about vouchers being required for any unusual
    expenditure, such as cab-fares of over ten shillings. I then
    told George to write down on a piece of paper how much money he
    had when he started on his silly journey, and how much he had
    in hand when he got back; to deduct the latter from the former
    and tell me the result; to go away, leave me to wrestle all
    night with the problem, come back next morning at nine, remain
    motionless and strictly in one country in the meanwhile,
    neither accommodated nor subsisting. He gave me the figure, 173
    francs, and never mentioned the subject to me again for days
    owing to the sullen fury he noted in my expression every time
    he cleared his throat to do so.</p>

    <p>After ten days I handed George a chit from the Pay People
    for "one hundred and seventy francs for travelling expenses,
    30/10/1917 to 20/11/1917, for tour of duty to Italy." George
    said I had a dashed fine brain to have worked out the claim; I
    told him the Pay Man had a dashed kind heart to settle it. I
    hadn't been able to avoid mentioning Italy; but for the rest
    the Pay Man simply must have thought that George had driven all
    the way to the frontier and back in cabs and done precious
    little duty on the other side of it. Wouldn't you have thought
    so, Charles, if you had received a claim merely for eighty-five
    cabs, at two francs a time, and all in France, too?</p>

    <p>Yours ever,</p>

    <p>HENRY.</p>

    <h2>TRENCH COATS.</h2>

    <p>I went into a shop to buy a trench-coat. The shopman came
    forward with an air which said quite plainly, "You are a second
    lieutenant. You have just obtained a commission from the ranks.
    You think you do not want a complete outfit. It is my business
    to show you that you are mistaken. You want a complete outfit.
    Your Sam Browne is second-hand. You picked your boots up from a
    Salvage Dump. You cap was used once in your bathroom at home as
    a sponge-bag. Your trench-coat is disgusting. The whole outfit
    would fail to deceive a man's maiden aunt, so obvious an
    attempt is it to mislead the unsophisticated into supposing
    that you have arrived here straight from the trenches. I know
    better. You have just obtained a commission in the
    motor-transport section of the Wessex Home Defence Corps.
    Gentlemen from the trenches always dress as if they'd come
    straight out of a shop like this ... And we don't take
    cheques."</p>

    <p>That was what his manner said. What he actually said was
    noncommittal. He said, "Yes, Sir?"</p>

    <p>I took off my trench-coat and let the glory of three whole
    stars dazzle him. He little knew that one of them was "acting,"
    and his face fell.</p>

    <p>"I do not at present," said I, "require a knife with
    indispensable cheese-scoop and marmalade-shredding attachment.
    My indispensable steel mirror with patent lanyard and powder
    puff for attachment to service revolver is in perfect working
    order. I already possess two pairs of marching boots with
    indispensable trapdoors in each heel containing complete
    pedicure set and French-Portuguese dictionaries. My
    indispensable fur waistcoats, Indian clubs, ponchos,
    collapsible Turkish baths, steel aprons and folding billiard
    tables have already brought the weight of my kit nearly up to
    the allotted thirty-five pounds. My indispensable cigar
    cabinet, camouflaged to look like a water-bottle; my patent and
    absolutely essential convertible gramophone which can be
    changed at a moment's notice into a tin hat; my caviare
    lozenges and shampoo tabloids&mdash;I have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page429"
       id="page429"></a>[pg 429]</span> them all. I want a
       trench-coat and nothing else."</p>

    <p>His face had fallen a little as I spoke. But it lit up again
    with a sort of cunning excitement when I said "trench-coat." I
    wondered why&mdash;then. Now I know. I thought that he was
    baffled and would say no more, but I had forgotten the
    developments of trench warfare.</p>

    <p>"This way, Sir," said the shopman.</p>

    <p>He led me to a room which combined the architectural style
    of the Crystal Palace and Waterloo Station with a touch of the
    dentist's waiting-room. There was a khaki tent in the midst of
    it, and he led me towards this with the air of a broody hen
    anticipating the number of her chickens.</p>

    <p>"The Vadecumomnibus trench-coat," said he.</p>

    <p>"But it's a tent," I protested.</p>

    <p>"It has collapsible aluminium centre seam," he retorted
    rapidly, "which can be used as a tent pole in severe weather.
    On buttoning the top button this pole telescopes automatically
    and forms a bullet-proof spine protector. Each sleeve can be
    unscrewed and used in an emergency as a Lewis gun. This is
    indispensable&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Of course," I interrupted. "But I require something quite
    simple and straightforward. Just a trench-coat, you
    understand."</p>

    <p>"We have here," he said immediately, "the Gadget coat. It
    possesses three hundred button-holes and three hundred buttons.
    Every single portion of the coat can be buttoned on to every
    other part at a moment's notice. The pockets are detachable and
    can be used as coffee cups or finger bowls. The coat itself,
    when stretched on our patent aluminium framework, makes an
    admirable hip-bath."</p>

    <p>I played nervously in my pocket with the pin of a live Mills
    grenade (overlooked by the A.M.L.O.).</p>

    <p>"A simple, straightforward trench-coat," I repeated.</p>

    <p>"This," said the shopman, handing me something very like a
    slice of plum-pudding&mdash;"this is the cross-section of a
    piece of the cloth out of which our 'Stopablitey' trench-coat
    is manufactured. It shows the strata of the material,
    consisting of alternate layers of old motor tyres and
    reinforced concrete&mdash;the whole covered with alligator skin
    and proofed with our patent indispensable&mdash;"</p>

    <p>It was then that I killed him and buried him under a pyramid
    of indispensable gadgets. It will be years before they find
    him.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, December 17th.</i>&mdash;On the whole the Lords
    gave a friendly reception to the Franchise Bill. They have
    learned a good deal since 1911. Even Lord SALISBURY forebore on
    this occasion his usual intention to die in the last ditch, and
    was ready to let the Bill pass, provided that Proportional
    Representation was included in it. The most vehement criticism
    came from Lord BRYCE, who viewed with alarm the addition of six
    million women to the electorate. Women, he declared, neither
    met nor talked&mdash;an assertion which surprised the more
    married peers. Lord BURNHAM supported "P.R." with the
    self-sacrificing argument that the Press would become too
    powerful if minorities had no way of expressing their views
    except in the newspapers. Perhaps he doesn't want another
    letter from Lord LANSDOWNE.</p>

             alt="" /></a>A QUEUE FOR THE COMMONS.
    </div>

    <p>Mr. HOGGE is usually so assiduous in his attendance that I
    was surprised at his sudden departure just before Sir C.
    KINLOCH-COOKE put a question to the FOOD CONTROLLER. But when I
    found that the question related to "the political as well as
    the economic effect of the new regulation governing the sale of
    pigs" I recognised the delicacy of his action in withdrawing.
    Mr. CLYNES, however, had nothing to say on the political aspect
    of the question; and shortly afterwards Mr. HOGGE
    reappeared.</p>

    <p>The Members whose interrogatory activities it is sought to
    curb are, for the most part, like the objects in a museum, more
    curious than exhilarating; but there are some, I am afraid,
    whose questions are intentionally mischievous, and by their
    mere appearance on the notice-paper give comfort and even
    information to our foes. Mr. BONAR LAW'S announcement that the
    Government would, during the Christmas holidays, consider how
    to mitigate the nuisance met with noisy objection from Mr.
    LYNCH, Mr. PRINGLE and other Members. The most original
    contribution to the discussion came from Mr. HOLT, who
    innocently inquired whether the Government would mind laying
    before the House a statement of the harmful questions which had
    been asked. Possibly he was thinking of the famous edition of
    MARTIAL in which all epigrams of doubtful propriety were
    excluded from the main text and collected in the appendix.</p>

    <p>The SECRETARY for SCOTLAND, speaking at break-neck speed,
    managed to give the House within the space of ten minutes an
    outline of the Bill which he hopes will maintain for Scotland
    her primacy in education. The new MUNRO doctrine did not,
    however, appeal to everybody, and there were ominous cries of
    dissent when he announced his intention of disestablishing the
    School Boards and putting the denominational schools on the
    rates.</p>

    <p>Lord RHONDDA listened from the Peers' Gallery to the debate
    on Food Control, and received a quantity of advice which should
    help him to mind his p's and q's, particularly the latter. His
    lieutenant, Mr. CLYNES, improved the reputation that he has
    already acquired at Question-time, and was able to bring a
    little personal experience to bear upon the most vexed question
    of the day. "Members of my own household," he said, "have stood
    in these queues, and I know something of their hardships." That
    is why, no doubt, he has urged upon his chief the formation of
    a Consumers' Council, to aid the Ministry in its deliberations.
    Mr. TILLETT seized the opportunity to make his maiden speech,
    and reminded the House that when they talked of queues at home
    they should not forget those other queues in the trenches. For
    the sake of the men who had lined up in our defence it was for
    us to see that their wives and children got their proper supply
    of food.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, December 18th.</i>&mdash;It was curious to hear
    Mr. LEES-SMITH, that stickler for freedom of expression,
    complaining that a London paper had published an article
    attacking M. CAILLAUX; and the House was amused by Lord ROBERT
    CECIL'S suggestion that the hon. Member should furnish him with
    ideas for the more stringent control of newspapers.</p>

    <p>Mr. PETO was alarmed by an alleged increase in the export of
    footwear to Switzerland, and particularly to villages on the
    German frontier. He yields to none in his desire to give the
    KAISER the boot, but not in any surreptitious manner. Lord
    WOLMER comforted him with the statement that the bulk of the
    exports consisted of women's and children's shoes, quite
    useless to the Germans until they get down to their 1930
    class.</p>

    <p>The HOME SECRETARY announced an increase in the War-bonus to
    the police from eight shillings to twelve shillings. With
    leather at its present price it was good to hear that the
    Government had been mindful of their extremities.</p>

    <h2>THE YOUNGEST GENERATION.</h2>

    <p>"What shall he have that killed the deer?" someone asks
    somebody else in <i>As You Like It</i>. But there is a better
    question than that, and it is this&mdash;"What shall they have
    that preserve the little dears?" and the answer (if I can do
    anything to influence it) is&mdash;honour and support; for
    there can be no doubt that in these critical times, when the
    life of the best and bravest and strongest is so cheap, no duty
    is more important than the cherishing of infancy.</p>

    <p>At a <i>Cr&ecirc;che</i> in Notting Hill I watched, the
    other day, some of this cherishing in progress, and it was a
    pleasant and stimulating sight. The institution was in
    existence in a small way before the War, but it has recently
    been enlarged and made scientific, to meet the greater needs
    which the War has set up, and it is now able to act as foster
    mother to seventy mites, from the age of one month to four
    years, whose real mothers are for the most part engaged in war
    work. That is a good piece of citizenship, is it not? And to
    watch it in being is an education in those wonderful things to
    the eye of man&mdash;the solicitude and patience and capability
    of woman. The noise alone, whether of joy or of transitory
    grief, would drive most men frantic; but these devoted souls,
    knowing that it is all part of the game, proceed with an
    unearthly composure through it all&mdash;undressing their
    charges, dressing them, washing them, feeding them, beguiling
    them; in a word, tending them, from morning till evening.</p>

    <p>The children begin to arrive, brought either by their
    mothers, their "Little Mothers" (I mean sisters) or their
    brothers, between 8 and 9&mdash;some in arms and some in
    perambulators and some in go-carts; and then they are
    immediately divested of their home clothes, popped into warm
    baths three or four at a time, and dressed in the clothes
    belonging to the <i>Cr&ecirc;che</i>. For the rest of the day
    they wear these clothes and sleep, eat, play and, when it
    amuses them more to do so, cry, until the time comes to be put
    back into their own garments and be taken away. By some strange
    instinct their relations, I am informed, know them again, and
    very few mistakes occur; and so gradually, in the neighbourhood
    of seven o'clock, peace descends on this corner of Notting Hill
    once more.</p>

    <p>The place is sheer Lilliputia: for everything is on a
    reduced scale. Scores of little beds round the walls, with
    little pillows and little coverlets; scores of little chairs; a
    long table so low that it seems to be the footstool of a
    giant's wife, with little benches beside it for their little
    meals. In the centre of the room are two little pounds, with
    railings so close together as not to be crawled through, where
    the more adventurous ones can be kept out of mischief in the
    company of woolly toys; and outside is a loggia place with
    little cradles for the babies who want more air to sleep
    in.</p>

    <p>Such is the Stoneleigh Street Cr&ecirc;che, and in order to
    realise what admirable and desirable functions it
    fulfils&mdash;principally by voluntary aid, for the capitation
    fee of half-a-crown a week is, of course, quite insufficient to
    maintain it&mdash;one has only to imagine what the lot of these
    helpless little creatures would be if they were left in their
    motherless homes. Not only would they be far less happy but far
    less healthy; and it is upon healthy babies that England's
    future must be founded. If any reader of <i>Punch</i>, then,
    should be in doubt as to what to do with a little surplus
    money, let the little requirements of these little people be
    remembered. The address to which donations should be sent is:

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>

    <p>Those who like to read familiar letters&mdash;and I confess
    it is one of my favourite literary distractions&mdash;will find
    matter very much to their mind in <i>Some Hawarden Letters</i>
    (NISBET), compiled by L. MARCH-PHILLIPS and BERTRAM CHRISTIAN.
    It is a collection of letters addressed to Miss MARY GLADSTONE
    before and after her marriage to Mr. DREW. Sitting at the
    centre she seems to have held together her circle by golden
    threads of confidence and intimacy. Here you will learn how
    RUSKIN was brought to visit Hawarden, and how he entirely
    altered his views on Mr. GLADSTONE, going so far as to suppress
    a number of <i>Fors Clavigera</i> in which slighting allusion
    had been made to him. Here, too, you will find Lord ACTON, who
    deeply disapproved of Mr. GLADSTONE'S conduct in paying a
    memorial tribute of respect and eulogy to Lord BEACONSFIELD.
    ACTON'S list of the hundred best books (or, to be strictly
    accurate, of ninety-nine of them) is also given. It provides
    heavy reading for a hundred years at the very least. As a
    set-off to this ponderosity there are the letters of
    BURNE-JONES, fresh, amiable and delightful, as also those of
    Professor JAMES STUART, which are among the best in the
    collection. Mr. A.J. BALFOUR appears as the owner of four
    concertinas, on which he was willing "to play with anyone who
    would accompany him through any of the oratorios of Handel."
    RUSKIN writes to CARLYLE, addressing him as "Dearest Papa," and
    signing himself "Ever your faithful and loving son." The
    letters of GEORGE WYNDHAM are a charming collection, shining
    with hope and idealism yet never losing their touch of the firm
    earth. This book was nearly completed by the late Mr. MARCH
    PHILLIPS, and after his untimely death the task was brought to
    a conclusion by Mr. CHRISTIAN. On the whole the work has been
    done with great discretion, but there is a passage relating to
    GEORGE ELIOT on pp. 193, 194 which ought to have been
    omitted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Miss MILLS YOUNG tells us that <i>John Musgrave</i>, the
    middle-aged hero of <i>Coelebs</i> (LANE), "was not a prig, but
    he came perilously near to being one at times." Well, if anyone
    ought to know, it is his creator, so I will accept her word for
    it, though for myself I should have called him a first-class
    prig. The little village in which he lived his bachelor
    existence was invaded by some up-to-date people who took the
    Hall, and proceeded to liven up things. <i>Mrs. Chadwick</i>
    freely shocked the poor man; she smoked, was a reckless
    conversationalist and had modern ideas, all which disturbed the
    decorous manner of his life. Moreover, she had taken upon
    herself the heavy task of finding him a wife, and <i>John's</i>
    phlegmatic heart began to flutter when he saw <i>Peggy</i>, her
    lady-gardener and niece, standing on a ladder, in blue
    trousers. He was incensed by such apparel, but he was also
    intrigued. From that moment his number, as they say, was up.
    Apart from a dog-incident, which is far too prolonged, and some
    rather cheap sarcasm at the expense of a wretched spinster,
    this tale of <i>John's</i> conversion from something drier than
    dust to a human being is neatly told. All the same I prefer
    Miss YOUNG'S South African stories.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>My conjecture about <i>The Magic Gate</i> (HUTCHINSON) is
    that its author, MAUD STEPNEY RAWSON, found herself with two
    stories to choose from, one of the Gate itself, and another of
    the romance of <i>Lydia</i> and <i>John Wodrush</i>. In my
    opinion she chose the wrong one. The history of the
    <i>Wodrush</i> elopement, compressed to a couple of pages,
    seems to me far more original and interesting than the present
    rather unwieldy tale. <i>The Magic Gate</i> is a war-novel
    confessed, and I can only fancy that the thronging new
    sensations of the past three years have proved a little too
    much for Mrs. RAWSON'S sense of form. She is so anxious that
    her heroine and her readers shall miss nothing of it all that
    in the result the plot is lost in a maze of incidents that lead
    nowhere. The effect produced on a small country society by the
    early phases of the War is shown deftly enough. But perhaps
    posterity will find in such a record a more compelling interest
    than we can to whom it is still so familiar in every
    unforgettable detail. One other ground of complaint I have
    against the book is that its most original and attractive
    character, the American woman to whose generosity <i>Jennet</i>
    owes her occupancy of Fullbrook Manor, is banished at an early
    page, and submarined just when I was looking for her
    reappearance. Hers is yet another story with which Mrs. RAWSON
    might have entertained me better than by this of <i>The Magic
    Gate</i>, which I found a trifle creaky on its hinges.</p>

    <p><i>Senlis</i> (COLLINS) is one of the many places that have
    been systematically destroyed by the Germans. It is difficult
    for anyone who has not seen the results with his own eyes to
    realise the business-like thoroughness which the Hun brings to
    this congenial task. That a part (and the most beautiful) of
    the town still stands does not imply that he yielded either to
    slackness or to &aelig;sthetic refinement. True that Miss
    CICELY HAMILTON relates a pleasing story that Senlis was saved
    from utter destruction by the entreaties of the
    <i>cur&eacute;</i>, but, all the same, I think the real reason
    why the Bosch did not complete his work was that he was bundled
    out bag and baggage before he had time to add the finishing
    touches. Miss HAMILTON clearly and soberly states the case
    against him, and makes it all the more damning by her frank
    recognition that many of the horrors of war, whoever makes it,
    are inevitable. Her delightful account of Senlis itself,
    admirably illustrated with photographs, is certain to appeal to
    all lovers of the charm of old French towns; and the more
    poignantly when they recall how narrowly the best of its beauty
    escaped from the hand of the spoiler.</p>

    <h2>MR. PUNCH AS PROPAGANDIST.</h2>

    <p>I don't know what decided him to do it. I think he must have
    been a little fed up with our silly British way (rather
    attractive, all the same) of assuming that the whole world is
    bound to recognise the justice of our point of view without the
    use of propaganda to stimulate its intelligence.</p>

    <p>Or else he had read somewhere that the Bolsheviks had been
    flooding the Hun trenches with Socialist literature and that
    the German Headquarters Staff had protested against this kind
    of thing as being contrary to etiquette, and he thought he
    couldn't go far wrong if he did something that was contrary to
    Bosch etiquette.</p>

    <p>Anyhow he started off in his Bouverie biplane to distribute
    a million or so leaflets of his own composition over the whole
    expanse of the Fatherland. It has been my privilege to read a
    sample which he handed to me just before leaving earth. It runs
    as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"GERMANS&mdash;Your Kaiser has taken good care that his
    Press should keep you in ignorance of the feelings with which
    your nation is regarded by the civilized world. I am therefore
    about to oblige you with a few home-truths.</p>

    <p>"You have probably heard a rumour that we and our Allies
    have no quarrel with the German people, but only with its
    rulers. Don't you believe a word of it. Possibly we still
    respected you when the War began, for we had not guessed how
    many of you had been looking forward for years to the coming of
    'The Day.' It is what we have found out about you since you
    started fighting that has made us loathe and despise you.</p>

    <p>"When, as a nation, you accepted without protest the filthy
    savagery of your armies in Belgium and other occupied lands;
    when even your women were vile in their cruelty to the helpless
    prisoners you had taken; when you rang your church bells and
    waved flags and took holidays for joy of the murder of innocent
    women and children, we were not deceived by apologists who
    explained that your only defect was that you were the slaves of
    a brutal militarism (though you were that, all right). We knew
    that you must have something of the beast in your hearts. How
    it got there was another matter; we only knew that it was there
    and that while it remained you were not fit for intercourse
    with decent men.</p>

    <p>"Another thing that you may have heard (for even some of our
    own statesmen, reputed intelligent, have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page436"
       id="page436"></a>[pg 436]</span> said it, and it has no
       doubt been eagerly seized upon by the officials who control
       your Press), is that your form of Government, the particular
       pattern of tyranny under which you elect to grovel, is no
       concern of ours. Well, don't you believe that either. This
       is no question of private taste, like the cut of your
       shoulder-pads or the shape of your women's waists, which are
       matters of purely local interest. Your type of Government is
       as much our concern; as the quality of your poison-gas or
       the composition of the bombs that you drop on our
       babies.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:35%;">
        <a href="images/436-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/436-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"I am reminded of the nonsense that used to be talked by
    responsible statesmen at the time when you were feverishly
    building a fleet to dispute our right to ensure the freedom of
    the seas. We were told that you were at perfect liberty to do
    so if you chose, and that it was not for us to interfere with
    your arrangements. Yet everybody knew all the time that there
    was nothing in the world that concerned us so closely. If
    France had been massing troops on your frontier you would at
    once have asked her to state her intentions, or even possibly
    have taken action without asking her. Well, the sea is our
    frontier.</p>

    <p>"You are to understand, then (whatever anybody may say),
    that everything done in Germany that bears immediately upon our
    relations with your State is of prime concern to us. Our desire
    for peace is as strong as your need of it; but we cannot afford
    to make terms with a Government whose word, as we have proved,
    is not worth the paper they write it on&mdash;who would treat
    any peace as a mere armistice to give them breathing-space for
    preparing a fresh war. No, if you want peace you will have to
    displace your present rulers. You are so good at 'substitutes'
    that you ought to have no difficulty about that.</p>

    <p>"And the sooner the better for you. For as this War drags on
    we are not getting to love you more. Even now it will take you
    at least a generation to purge your offence and get back into
    the community of civilized nations. But there is another
    thought that is more likely to affect your thick commercial
    hides, and it is this. Unless you take steps, and pretty soon,
    to put yourselves in a position in which we can treat with you,
    you will be boycotted in the markets of the world, and you will
    go bankrupt. It is for you, the German people, to decide
    whether you choose this fate. Meanwhile Time presses and the
    sands run low."</p>

    <p>Such was the matter of the leaflet that Mr. Punch rained
    down from his Bouverie biplane (fortunately invulnerable) upon
    the cities of the Fatherland. Till now the German people, fed
    on windy tales of triumph in place of solid food, had borne
    their sufferings patiently as trials incident to all wars even
    when you are told that you are winning them. This was the first
    intimation they had received of the facts. For the first time
    they had a chance of seeing themselves as others saw them.</p>

    <p>He carried no bombs, but as he flew over Potsdam he could
    not refrain from letting fall, by way of reprisal, a weighty
    souvenir upon the purlieus of the Imperial Palace. Dropped at a
    venture, there is reason to believe that it fell within
    measurable distance of the head-piece of the All-Highest. It
    was Mr. Punch's</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="https://gutenberg.org/license">https://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
