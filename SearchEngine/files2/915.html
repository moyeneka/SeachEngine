    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. PENROD AND SAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the daylight hours of several autumn Saturdays there had been
      severe outbreaks of cavalry in the Schofield neighbourhood. The sabres
      were of wood; the steeds were imaginary, and both were employed in a game
      called &ldquo;bonded pris'ner&rdquo; by its inventors, Masters Penrod Schofield and
      Samuel Williams. The pastime was not intricate. When two enemies met, they
      fenced spectacularly until the person of one or the other was touched by
      the opposing weapon; then, when the ensuing claims of foul play had been
      disallowed and the subsequent argument settled, the combatant touched was
      considered to be a prisoner until such time as he might be touched by the
      hilt of a sword belonging to one of his own party, which effected his
      release and restored to him the full enjoyment of hostile activity.
      Pending such rescue, however, he was obliged to accompany the forces of
      his captor whithersoever their strategical necessities led them, which
      included many strange places. For the game was exciting, and, at its
      highest pitch, would sweep out of an alley into a stable, out of that
      stable and into a yard, out of that yard and into a house, and through
      that house with the sound (and effect upon furniture) of trampling herds.
      In fact, this very similarity must have been in the mind of the distressed
      coloured woman in Mrs. Williams's kitchen, when she declared that she
      might &ldquo;jes' as well try to cook right spang in the middle o' the
      stock-yards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All up and down the neighbourhood the campaigns were waged, accompanied by
      the martial clashing of wood upon wood and by many clamorous arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a pris'ner, Roddy Bitts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, too! I touched you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, I'd like to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the sleeve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not! I never felt it. I guess I'd 'a' felt it, wouldn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if you didn't? I touched you, and you're bonded. I leave it to Sam
      Williams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yah! Course you would! He's on your side! <i>I</i> leave it to Herman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won't! If you can't show any SENSE about it, we'll do it over,
      and I guess you'll see whether you feel it or not! There! NOW, I guess you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, squash!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, the undoubted champion proved to be the youngest and
      darkest of all the combatants, one Verman, coloured, brother to Herman,
      and substantially under the size to which his nine years entitled him.
      Verman was unfortunately tongue-tied, but he was valiant beyond all
      others, and, in spite of every handicap, he became at once the chief
      support of his own party and the despair of the opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third Saturday this opposition had been worn down by the successive
      captures of Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett until it consisted of only
      Sam Williams and Penrod. Hence, it behooved these two to be wary, lest
      they be wiped out altogether; and Sam was dismayed indeed, upon cautiously
      scouting round a corner of his own stable, to find himself face to face
      with the valorous and skilful Verman, who was acting as an outpost, or
      picket, of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verman immediately fell upon Sam, horse and foot, and Sam would have fled
      but dared not, for fear he might be touched from the rear. Therefore, he
      defended himself as best he could, and there followed a lusty whacking, in
      the course of which Verman's hat, a relic and too large, fell from his
      head, touching Sam's weapon in falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; panted Sam, desisting immediately. &ldquo;That counts! You're bonded,
      Verman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aim meewer!&rdquo; Verman protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interpreting this as &ldquo;Ain't neither&rdquo;, Sam invented a law to suit the
      occasion. &ldquo;Yes, you are; that's the rule, Verman. I touched your hat with
      my sword, and your hat's just the same as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imm mop!&rdquo; Verman insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said Sam, already warmly convinced (by his own statement)
      that he was in the right. &ldquo;Listen here! If I hit you on the shoe, it would
      be the same as hitting YOU, wouldn't it? I guess it'd count if I hit you
      on the shoe, wouldn't it? Well, a hat's just the same as shoes. Honest,
      that's the rule, Verman, and you're a pris'ner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the arguing part of the game, Verman's impediment cooperated with
      a native amiability to render him far less effective than in the actual
      combat. He chuckled, and ceded the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw wi,&rdquo; he said, and cheerfully followed his captor to a hidden place
      among some bushes in the front yard, where Penrod lurked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky what <i>I</i> got!&rdquo; Sam said importantly, pushing his captive into
      this retreat. &ldquo;NOW, I guess you won't say I'm not so much use any more!
      Squat down, Verman, so's they can't see you if they're huntin' for us.
      That's one o' the rules&mdash;honest. You got to squat when we tell you
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman was agreeable. He squatted, and then began to laugh uproariously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that noise!&rdquo; Penrod commanded. &ldquo;You want to betray us? What you
      laughin' at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ep mack im mimmup,&rdquo; Verman giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he mean?&rdquo; Sam asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was more familiar with Verman's utterance, and he interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says they'll get him back in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they won't. I'd just like to see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they will, too,&rdquo; Penrod said. &ldquo;They'll get him back for the main and
      simple reason we can't stay here all day, can we? And they'd find us
      anyhow, if we tried to. There's so many of 'em against just us two, they
      can run in and touch him soon as they get up to us&mdash;and then HE'LL be
      after us again and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen here!&rdquo; Sam interrupted. &ldquo;Why can't we put some REAL bonds on him?
      We could put bonds on his wrists and around his legs&mdash;we could put
      'em all over him, easy as nothin'. Then we could gag him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we can't,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;We can't, for the main and simple reason we
      haven't got any rope or anything to make the bonds with, have we? I wish
      we had some o' that stuff they give sick people. THEN, I bet they wouldn't
      get him back so soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick people?&rdquo; Sam repeated, not comprehending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes 'em go to sleep, no matter what you do to 'em,&rdquo; Penrod
      explained. &ldquo;That's the main and simple reason they can't wake up, and you
      can cut off their ole legs&mdash;or their arms, or anything you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoy!&rdquo; exclaimed Verman, in a serious tone. His laughter ceased instantly,
      and he began to utter a protest sufficiently intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't worry,&rdquo; Penrod said gloomily. &ldquo;We haven't got any o' that
      stuff; so we can't do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we got to do sumpthing,&rdquo; Sam said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His comrade agreed, and there was a thoughtful silence; but presently
      Penrod's countenance brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;<i>I</i> know what we'll do with him. Why, I
      thought of it just as EASY! I can most always think of things like that,
      for the main and simple reason&mdash;well, I thought of it just as soon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; Sam demanded crossly. Penrod's reiteration of his
      new-found phrase, &ldquo;for the main and simple reason&rdquo;, had been growing more
      and more irksome to his friend all day, though Sam was not definitely
      aware that the phrase was the cause of his annoyance. &ldquo;WHAT are we goin'
      to do with him, you know so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod rose and peered over the tops of the bushes, shading his eyes with
      his hand, a gesture that was unnecessary but had a good appearance. He
      looked all round about him in this manner, finally vouchsafing a report to
      the impatient Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No enemies in sight&mdash;just for the main and simple reason I expect
      they're all in the alley and in Georgie Bassett's backyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet they're not!&rdquo; Sam said scornfully, his irritation much increased.
      &ldquo;How do YOU know so much about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for the main and simple reason,&rdquo; Penrod replied, with dignified
      finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at that, Sam felt a powerful impulse to do violence upon the person of
      his comrade-in-arms. The emotion that prompted this impulse was so
      primitive and straightforward that it almost resulted in action; but Sam
      had a vague sense that he must control it as long as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bugs!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was sensitive, and this cold word hurt him. However, he was under
      the domination of his strategic idea, and he subordinated private
      grievance to the common weal. &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;You get up, too,
      Verman. You got to&mdash;it's the rule. Now here I'll SHOW you what we're
      goin' to do. Stoop over, and both o' you do just exackly like <i>I</i> do.
      You watch ME, because this biz'nuss has got to be done RIGHT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam muttered something; he was becoming more insurgent every moment, but
      he obeyed. Likewise, Verman rose to his feet, ducked his head between his
      shoulders, and trotted out to the sidewalk at Sam's heels, both following
      Penrod and assuming a stooping position in imitation of him. Verman was
      delighted with this phase of the game, and, also, he was profoundly amused
      by Penrod's pomposity. Something dim and deep within him perceived it to
      be cause for such merriment that he had ado to master himself, and was
      forced to bottle and cork his laughter with both hands. They proved
      insufficient; sputterings burst forth between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stop that!&rdquo; Penrod said, looking back darkly upon the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verman endeavoured to oblige, though giggles continued to leak from him at
      intervals, and the three boys stole along the fence in single file,
      proceeding in this fashion until they reached Penrod's own front gate.
      Here the leader ascertained, by a reconnaissance as far as the corner,
      that the hostile forces were still looking for them in another direction.
      He returned in a stealthy but important manner to his disgruntled follower
      and the hilarious captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam impatiently, &ldquo;I guess I'm not goin' to stand around here
      all day, I guess! You got anything you want to do, why'n't you go on and
      DO it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's brow was already contorted to present the appearance of detached
      and lofty concentration&mdash;a histrionic failure, since it did not
      deceive the audience. He raised a hushing hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I got to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bugs!&rdquo; the impolite Mr. Williams said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verman bent double, squealing and sputtering; indeed, he was ultimately
      forced to sit upon the ground, so exhausting was the mirth to which he now
      gave way. Penrod's composure was somewhat affected and he showed
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess you won't laugh quite so much about minute from now, ole
      Mister Verman!&rdquo; he said severely. &ldquo;You get up from there and do like I
      tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why'n't you TELL him why he won't laugh so much, then?&rdquo; Sam
      demanded, as Verman rose. &ldquo;Why'n't you do sumpthing and quit talkin' so
      much about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod haughtily led the way into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You follow me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I guess you'll learn a little sense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, abandoning his hauteur for an air of mystery equally irritating to
      Sam, he stole up the steps of the porch, and, after a moment's
      manipulation of the knob of the big front door, contrived to operate the
      fastenings, and pushed the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he whispered, beckoning. And the three boys mounted the stairs
      to the floor above in silence&mdash;save for a belated giggle on the part
      of Verman, which was restrained upon a terrible gesture from Penrod.
      Verman buried his mouth as deeply as possible in a ragged sleeve, and
      confined his demonstrations to a heaving of the stomach and diaphragm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod led the way into the dainty room of his nineteen-year-old sister,
      Margaret, and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, in a low and husky voice, &ldquo;I expect you'll see what I'm
      goin' to do now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; the skeptical Sam asked. &ldquo;If we stay here very long your
      mother'll come and send us downstairs. What's the good of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WAIT, can't you?&rdquo; Penrod wailed, in a whisper. &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; And going
      to an inner door, he threw it open, disclosing a clothes-closet hung with
      pretty garments of many kinds, while upon its floor were two rows of shoes
      and slippers of great variety and charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A significant thing is to be remarked concerning the door of this somewhat
      intimate treasury: there was no knob or latch upon the inner side, so
      that, when the door was closed, it could be opened only from the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;You get in there, Verman, and I'll bet they won't
      get to touch you back out o' bein' our pris'ner very soon, NOW! Oh, I
      guess not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Is that all you were goin' to do? Why, your mother'll
      come and make him get out the first&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she won't. She and Margaret have gone to my aunt's in the country,
      and aren't goin' to be back till dark. And even if he made a lot o' noise,
      it's kind of hard to hear anything from in there, anyway, when the door's
      shut. Besides, he's got to keep quiet&mdash;that's the rule, Verman.
      You're a pris'ner, and it's the rule you can't holler or nothin'. You
      unnerstand that, Verman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw wi,&rdquo; said Verman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go on in there. Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The obedient Verman marched into the closet and sat down among the shoes
      and slippers, where he presented an interesting effect of contrast. He was
      still subject to hilarity&mdash;though endeavouring to suppress it by
      means of a patent-leather slipper&mdash;when Penrod closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Penrod, leading the way from the room. &ldquo;I guess NOW you
      see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam said nothing, and they came out to the open air and reached their
      retreat in the Williams' yard again, without his having acknowledged
      Penrod's service to their mutual cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of that just as easy!&rdquo; Penrod remarked, probably prompted to
      this odious bit of complacency by Sam's withholding the praise that might
      naturally have been expected. And he was moved to add, &ldquo;I guess it'd of
      been a pretty long while if we'd had to wait for you to think of something
      as good as that, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why would it?&rdquo; Sam asked. &ldquo;Why would it of been such a long while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Penrod responded airily, &ldquo;just for the main and simple reason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam could bear it no longer. &ldquo;Oh, hush up!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was stung. &ldquo;Do you mean ME?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; the goaded Sam replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell ME to hush up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you don't know who you're talkin' to,&rdquo; Penrod said ominously. &ldquo;I
      guess I just better show you who you're talkin' to like that. I guess you
      need a little sumpthing, for the main and simple&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam uttered an uncontrollable howl and sprang upon Penrod, catching him
      round the waist. Simultaneously with this impact, the wooden swords spun
      through the air and were presently trodden underfoot as the two boys
      wrestled to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was not altogether surprised by the onset of his friend. He had
      been aware of Sam's increasing irritation (though neither boy could have
      clearly stated its cause) and that very irritation produced a
      corresponding emotion in the bosom of the irritator. Mentally, Penrod was
      quite ready for the conflict&mdash;nay, he welcomed it&mdash;though, for
      the first few moments, Sam had the physical advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it is proper that a neat distinction be drawn here. This was a
      conflict; but neither technically nor in the intention of the contestants
      was it a fight. Penrod and Sam were both in a state of high exasperation,
      and there was great bitterness; but no blows fell and no tears. They
      strained, they wrenched, they twisted, and they panted and muttered: &ldquo;Oh,
      no, you don't!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I guess I do!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, you will, will you?&rdquo; &ldquo;You'll see
      what you get in about a minute!&rdquo; &ldquo;I guess you'll learn some sense this
      time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Streaks and blotches began to appear upon the two faces, where colour had
      been heightened by the ardent application of a cloth sleeve or shoulder,
      while ankles and insteps were scraped and toes were trampled. Turf and
      shrubberies suffered, also, as the struggle went on, until finally the
      wrestlers pitched headlong into a young lilac bush, and came to earth
      together, among its crushed and sprawling branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OOCH!&rdquo; and &ldquo;WUF!&rdquo; were the two exclamations which marked this episode,
      and then, with no further comment, the struggle was energetically
      continued upon a horizontal plane. Now Penrod was on top, now Sam; they
      rolled, they squirmed, they suffered. And this contest endured. It went on
      and on, and it was impossible to imagine its coming to a definite
      termination. It went on so long that to both the participants it seemed to
      be a permanent thing, a condition that had always existed and that must
      always exist perpetually.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus they were discovered by a foray of the hostile party, headed by
      Roddy Bitts and Herman (older brother to Verman) and followed by the
      bonded prisoners, Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett. These and others
      caught sight of the writhing figures, and charged down upon them with loud
      cries of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pris'ner! Pris'ner! Bonded pris'ner!&rdquo; shrieked Roddy Bitts, and touched
      Penrod and Sam, each in turn, with his sabre. Then, seeing that they paid
      no attention and that they were at his mercy, he recalled the fact that
      several times, during earlier stages of the game, both of them had been
      unnecessarily vigorous in &ldquo;touching&rdquo; his own rather plump person.
      Therefore, the opportunity being excellent, he raised his weapon again,
      and, repeating the words &ldquo;bonded pris'ner&rdquo; as ample explanation of his
      deed, brought into play the full strength of his good right arm. He used
      the flat of the sabre.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHACK! WHACK! Roddy was perfectly impartial. It was a cold-blooded
      performance and even more effective than he anticipated. For one thing, it
      ended the civil war instantly. Sam and Penrod leaped to their feet,
      shrieking and bloodthirsty, while Maurice Levy capered with joy, Herman
      was so overcome that he rolled upon the ground, and Georgie Bassett
      remarked virtuously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It serves them right for fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Roddy Bitts foresaw that something not within the rules of the game
      was about to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! You keep away from me!&rdquo; he quavered, retreating. &ldquo;I was just takin'
      you pris'ners. I guess I had a right to TOUCH you, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! Neither Sam nor Penrod was able to see the matter in that light.
      They had retrieved their own weapons, and they advanced upon Roddy with a
      purposefulness that seemed horrible to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! You keep away from me!&rdquo; he said, in great alarm. &ldquo;I'm goin' home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did go home&mdash;but only subsequently. What took place before his
      departure had the singular solidity and completeness of systematic
      violence; also, it bore the moral beauty of all actions that lead to peace
      and friendship, for, when it was over, and the final vocalizations of
      Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, were growing faint with increasing
      distance, Sam and Penrod had forgotten their differences and felt well
      disposed toward each other once more. All their animosity was exhausted,
      and they were in a glow of good feeling, though probably they were not
      conscious of any direct gratitude to Roddy, whose thoughtful opportunism
      was really the cause of this happy result.

      CHAPTER II. THE BONDED PRISONER
    </h2>
    <p>
      After such rigorous events, every one comprehended that the game of bonded
      prisoner was over, and there was no suggestion that it should or might be
      resumed. The fashion of its conclusion had been so consummately enjoyed by
      all parties (with the natural exception of Roddy Bitts) that a renewal
      would have been tame; hence, the various minds of the company turned to
      other matters and became restless. Georgie Bassett withdrew first,
      remembering that if he expected to be as wonderful as usual, to-morrow, in
      Sunday-school, it was time to prepare himself, though this was not
      included in the statement he made alleging the cause of his departure.
      Being detained bodily and pressed for explanation, he desperately said
      that he had to go home to tease the cook&mdash;which had the rakehelly air
      he thought would insure his release, but was not considered plausible.
      However, he was finally allowed to go, and, as first hints of evening were
      already cooling and darkening the air, the party broke up, its members
      setting forth, whistling, toward their several homes, though Penrod
      lingered with Sam. Herman was the last to go from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I got git 'at stove-wood f' suppuh,&rdquo; he said, rising and stretching
      himself. &ldquo;I got git 'at lil' soap-box wagon, an' go on ovuh wheres 'at new
      house buil'in' on Secon' Street; pick up few shingles an' blocks layin'
      roun'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went through the yard toward the alley, and, at the alley gate,
      remembering something, he paused and called to them. The lot was a deep
      one, and they were too far away to catch his meaning. Sam shouted, &ldquo;Can't
      HEAR you!&rdquo; and Herman replied, but still unintelligibly; then, upon Sam's
      repetition of &ldquo;Can't HEAR you!&rdquo; Herman waved his arm in farewell, implying
      that the matter was of little significance, and vanished. But if they had
      understood him, Penrod and Sam might have considered his inquiry of
      instant importance, for Herman's last shout was to ask if either of them
      had noticed &ldquo;where Verman went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman and Verman's whereabouts were, at this hour, of no more concern to
      Sam and Penrod than was the other side of the moon. That unfortunate
      bonded prisoner had been long since utterly effaced from their fields of
      consciousness, and the dark secret of their Bastille troubled them not&mdash;for
      the main and simple reason that they had forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drifted indoors, and found Sam's mother's white cat drowsing on a
      desk in the library, the which coincidence obviously inspired the
      experiment of ascertaining how successfully ink could be used in making a
      clean white cat look like a coach-dog. There was neither malice nor
      mischief in their idea; simply, a problem presented itself to the
      biological and artistic questionings beginning to stir within them. They
      did not mean to do the cat the slightest injury or to cause her any pain.
      They were above teasing cats, and they merely detained this one and made
      her feel a little wet&mdash;at considerable cost to themselves from both
      the ink and the cat. However, at the conclusion of their efforts, it was
      thought safer to drop the cat out of the window before anybody came, and,
      after some hasty work with blotters, the desk was moved to cover certain
      sections of the rug, and the two boys repaired to the bathroom for hot
      water and soap. They knew they had done nothing wrong; but they felt
      easier when the only traces remaining upon them were the less prominent
      ones upon their garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      These precautions taken, it was time for them to make their appearance at
      Penrod's house for dinner, for it had been arranged, upon petition earlier
      in the day, that Sam should be his friend's guest for the evening meal.
      Clean to the elbows and with light hearts, they set forth. They marched,
      whistling&mdash;though not producing a distinctly musical effect, since
      neither had any particular air in mind&mdash;and they found nothing wrong
      with the world; they had not a care. Arrived at their adjacent
      destination, they found Miss Margaret Schofield just entering the front
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, boys!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mamma came home long before I did, and I'm sure
      dinner is waiting. Run on out to the dining-room and tell them I'll be
      right down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as they obeyed, she mounted the stairs, humming a little tune and
      unfastening the clasp of the long, light-blue military cape she wore. She
      went to her own quiet room, lit the gas, removed her hat and placed it and
      the cape upon the bed; after which she gave her hair a push, subsequent to
      her scrutiny of a mirror; then, turning out the light, she went as far as
      the door. Being an orderly girl, she returned to the bed and took the cape
      and the hat to her clothes-closet. She opened the door of this sanctuary,
      and, in the dark, hung her cape upon a hook and placed her hat upon the
      shelf. Then she closed the door again, having noted nothing unusual,
      though she had an impression that the place needed airing. She descended
      to the dinner table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other members of the family were already occupied with the meal, and
      the visitor was replying politely, in his non-masticatory intervals, to
      inquiries concerning the health of his relatives. So sweet and assured was
      the condition of Sam and Penrod that Margaret's arrival from her room
      meant nothing to them. Their memories were not stirred, and they continued
      eating, their expressions brightly placid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from out of doors there came the sound of a calling and questing
      voice, at first in the distance, then growing louder&mdash;coming nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ver-er-man! O-o-o-oh, Ver-er-ma-a-an!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the voice of Herman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OO-O-O-O-OH, VER-ER-ER-MA-A-A-AN!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then two boys sat stricken at that cheerful table and ceased to eat.
      Recollection awoke with a bang!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; Sam gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; Mr. Schofield said. &ldquo;Swallow something the wrong way,
      Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OO-O-O-O-OH, VER-ER-ER-MA-A-A-AN!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now the voice was near the windows of the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, very pale, pushed back his chair and jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with YOU?&rdquo; his father demanded. &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Herman&mdash;that coloured boy lives in the alley,&rdquo; Penrod said
      hoarsely. &ldquo;I expect&mdash;I think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think his little brother's maybe got lost, and Sam and I better go help
      look&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; Mr. Schofield said sharply. &ldquo;Sit down and
      eat your dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a palsy, the miserable boy resumed his seat. He and Sam exchanged a
      single dumb glance; then the eyes of both swung fearfully to Margaret. Her
      appearance was one of sprightly content, and, from a certain point of
      view, nothing could have been more alarming. If she had opened her closet
      door without discovering Verman, that must have been because Verman was
      dead and Margaret had failed to notice the body. (Such were the thoughts
      of Penrod and Sam.) But she might not have opened the closet door. And
      whether she had or not, Verman must still be there, alive or dead, for if
      he had escaped he would have gone home, and their ears would not be
      ringing with the sinister and melancholy cry that now came from the
      distance, &ldquo;Oo-o-oh, Ver-er-ma-an!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman, in his seclusion, did not hear that appeal from his brother; there
      were too many walls between them. But he was becoming impatient for
      release, though, all in all, he had not found the confinement intolerable
      or even very irksome. His character was philosophic, his imagination calm;
      no bugaboos came to trouble him. When the boys closed the door upon him,
      he made himself comfortable upon the floor and, for a time, thoughtfully
      chewed a patent-leather slipper that had come under his hand. He found the
      patent leather not unpleasant to his palate, though he swallowed only a
      portion of what he detached, not being hungry at that time. The
      soul-fabric of Verman was of a fortunate weave; he was not a seeker and
      questioner. When it happened to him that he was at rest in a shady corner,
      he did not even think about a place in the sun. Verman took life as it
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, he fell asleep. And toward the conclusion of his slumbers, he
      had this singular adventure: a lady set her foot down within less than
      half an inch of his nose&mdash;and neither of them knew it. Verman slept
      on, without being wakened by either the closing or the opening of the
      door. What did rouse him was something ample and soft falling upon him&mdash;Margaret's
      cape, which slid from the hook after she had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enveloped in its folds, Verman sat up, corkscrewing his knuckles into the
      corners of his eyes. Slowly he became aware of two important vacuums&mdash;one
      in time and one in his stomach. Hours had vanished strangely into nowhere;
      the game of bonded prisoner was something cloudy and remote of the long,
      long ago, and, although Verman knew where he was, he had partially
      forgotten how he came there. He perceived, however, that something had
      gone wrong, for he was certain that he ought not to be where he found
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHITE-FOLKS' HOUSE! The fact that Verman could not have pronounced these
      words rendered them no less clear in his mind; they began to stir his
      apprehension, and nothing becomes more rapidly tumultuous than
      apprehension once it is stirred. That he might possibly obtain release by
      making a noise was too daring a thought and not even conceived, much less
      entertained, by the little and humble Verman. For, with the bewildering
      gap of his slumber between him and previous events, he did not place the
      responsibility for his being in White-Folks' House upon the white folks
      who had put him there. His state of mind was that of the stable-puppy who
      knows he MUST not be found in the parlour. Not thrice in his life had
      Verman been within the doors of White-Folks' House, and, above all things,
      he felt that it was in some undefined way vital to him to get out of
      White-Folks' House unobserved and unknown. It was in his very blood to be
      sure of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further than this point, the processes of Verman's mind become mysterious
      to the observer. It appears, however, that he had a definite (though
      somewhat primitive) conception of the usefulness of disguise; and he must
      have begun his preparations before he heard footsteps in the room outside
      his closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      These footsteps were Margaret's. Just as Mr. Schofield's coffee was
      brought, and just after Penrod had been baffled in another attempt to
      leave the table, Margaret rose and patted her father impertinently upon
      the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't bully ME that way!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I got home too late to dress,
      and I'm going to a dance. 'Scuse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she began her dancing on the spot, pirouetting herself swiftly out of
      the room, and was immediately heard running up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo; Mr. Schofield shouted. &ldquo;Sit down! How many times am I going to
      tell you? What IS the matter with you to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I GOT to go,&rdquo; Penrod gasped. &ldquo;I got to tell Margaret sumpthing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you 'got' to tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;it's sumpthing I forgot to tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it will keep till she comes downstairs,&rdquo; Mr. Schofield said grimly.
      &ldquo;You sit down till this meal is finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was becoming frantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got to tell her&mdash;it's sumpthing Sam's mother told me to tell her,&rdquo;
       he babbled. &ldquo;Didn't she, Sam? You heard her tell me to tell her; didn't
      you, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam offered prompt corroboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; she did. She said for us both to tell her. I better go, too, I
      guess, because she said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted. Startlingly upon their ears rang shriek on shriek.
      Mrs. Schofield, recognizing Margaret's voice, likewise shrieked, and Mr.
      Schofield uttered various sounds; but Penrod and Sam were incapable of
      doing anything vocally. All rushed from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret continued to shriek, and it is not to be denied that there was
      some cause for her agitation. When she opened the closet door, her
      light-blue military cape, instead of hanging on the hook where she had
      left it, came out into the room in a manner that she afterward described
      as &ldquo;a kind of horrible creep, but faster than a creep.&rdquo; Nothing was to be
      seen except the creeping cape, she said, but, of course, she could tell
      there was some awful thing inside of it. It was too large to be a cat, and
      too small to be a boy; it was too large to be Duke, Penrod's little old
      dog, and, besides, Duke wouldn't act like that. It crept rapidly out into
      the upper hall, and then, as she recovered the use of her voice and began
      to scream, the animated cape abandoned its creeping for a quicker gait&mdash;&ldquo;a
      weird, heaving flop,&rdquo; she defined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thing then decided upon a third style of locomotion, evidently, for
      when Sam and Penrod reached the front hall, a few steps in advance of Mr.
      and Mrs. Schofield, it was rolling grandly down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield had only a hurried glimpse of it as it reached the bottom,
      close by the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grab that thing!&rdquo; he shouted, dashing forward. &ldquo;Stop it! Hit it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Sam Williams displayed the presence of mind
      that was his most eminent characteristic. Sam's wonderful instinct for the
      right action almost never failed him in a crisis, and it did not fail him
      now. Leaping to the door, at the very instant when the rolling cape
      touched it, Sam flung the door open&mdash;and the cape rolled on. With
      incredible rapidity and intelligence, it rolled, indeed, out into the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod jumped after it, and the next second reappeared in the doorway
      holding the cape. He shook out its folds, breathing hard but acquiring
      confidence. In fact, he was able to look up in his father's face and say,
      with bright ingenuousness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just laying there. Do you know what I think? Well, it couldn't
      have acted that way itself. I think there must have been sumpthing kind of
      inside of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield shook his head slowly, in marvelling admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brilliant&mdash;oh, brilliant!&rdquo; he murmured, while Mrs. Schofield ran to
      support the enfeebled form of Margaret at the top of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... In the library, after Margaret's departure to her dance, Mr. and Mrs.
      Schofield were still discussing the visitation, Penrod having accompanied
      his homeward-bound guest as far as the front gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you're wrong,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield said, upholding a theory, earlier
      developed by Margaret, that the animated behaviour of the cape could be
      satisfactorily explained on no other ground than the supernatural. &ldquo;You
      see, the boys saying they couldn't remember what Mrs. Williams wanted them
      to tell Margaret, and that probably she hadn't told them anything to tell
      her, because most likely they'd misunderstood something she said&mdash;well,
      of course, all that does sound mixed-up and peculiar; but they sound that
      way about half the time, anyhow. No; it couldn't possibly have had a thing
      to do with it. They were right there at the table with us all the time,
      and they came straight to the table the minute they entered the house.
      Before that, they'd been over at Sam's all afternoon. So, it COULDN'T have
      been the boys.&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield paused to ruminate with a little air of
      pride; then added: &ldquo;Margaret has often thought&mdash;oh, long before this!&mdash;that
      she was a medium. I mean&mdash;if she would let her self. So it wasn't
      anything the boys did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll admit this much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll admit it wasn't anything we'll ever
      get out of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the remarks of Sam and Penrod, taking leave of each other, one on each
      side of the gate, appeared to corroborate Mr. Schofield's opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, g'-night, Penrod,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;It was a pretty good Saturday, wasn't
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Penrod casually. &ldquo;G'-night, Sam.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE MILITARIST
    </h2>
    <p>
      PENROD SCHOFIELD, having been &ldquo;kept-in&rdquo; for the unjust period of twenty
      minutes after school, emerged to a deserted street. That is, the street
      was deserted so far as Penrod was concerned. Here and there people were to
      be seen upon the sidewalks, but they were adults, and they and the shade
      trees had about the same quality of significance in Penrod's
      consciousness. Usually he saw grown people in the mass, which is to say,
      they were virtually invisible to him, though exceptions must be taken in
      favour of policemen, firemen, street-car conductors, motormen, and all
      other men in any sort of uniform or regalia. But this afternoon none of
      these met the roving eye, and Penrod set out upon his homeward way wholly
      dependent upon his own resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      To one of Penrod's inner texture, a mere unadorned walk from one point to
      another was intolerable, and he had not gone a block without achieving
      some slight remedy for the tameness of life. An electric-light pole at the
      corner, invested with powers of observation, might have been surprised to
      find itself suddenly enacting a role of dubious honour in improvised
      melodrama. Penrod, approaching, gave the pole a look of sharp suspicion,
      then one of conviction; slapped it lightly and contemptuously with his
      open hand; passed on a few paces, but turned abruptly, and, pointing his
      right forefinger, uttered the symbolic word, &ldquo;Bing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plot was somewhat indefinite; yet nothing is more certain than that
      the electric-light pole had first attempted something against him, then
      growing bitter when slapped, and stealing after him to take him
      treacherously in the back, had got itself shot through and through by one
      too old in such warfare to be caught off his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the body to lie where it was, he placed the smoking pistol in a
      holster at his saddlebow&mdash;he had decided that he was mounted&mdash;and
      proceeded up the street. At intervals he indulged himself in other
      encounters, reining in at first suspicion of ambush with a muttered,
      &ldquo;Whoa, Charlie!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Whoa, Mike!&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Whoa, Washington!&rdquo; for
      preoccupation with the enemy outweighed attention to the details of
      theatrical consistency, though the steed's varying names were at least
      harmoniously masculine, since a boy, in these, creative moments, never
      rides a mare. And having brought Charlie or Mike or Washington to a
      standstill, Penrod would draw the sure weapon from its holster and&mdash;&ldquo;Bing!
      Bing! Bing!&rdquo;&mdash;let them have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not to be understood that this was a noisy performance, or even an
      obvious one. It attracted no attention from any pedestrian, and it was to
      be perceived only that a boy was proceeding up the street at a somewhat
      irregular gait. Three or four years earlier, when Penrod was seven or
      eight, he would have shouted &ldquo;Bing!&rdquo; at the top of his voice; he would
      have galloped openly; all the world might have seen that he bestrode a
      charger. But a change had come upon him with advancing years. Although the
      grown people in sight were indeed to him as walking trees, his dramas were
      accomplished principally by suggestion and symbol. His &ldquo;Whoas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bings&rdquo;
       were delivered in a husky whisper, and his equestrianism was established
      by action mostly of the mind, the accompanying artistry of the feet being
      unintelligible to the passerby.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, though he concealed from observation the stirring little scenes
      he thus enacted, a love of realism was increasing within him. Early
      childhood is not fastidious about the accessories of its drama&mdash;a
      cane is vividly a gun which may instantly, as vividly, become a horse; but
      at Penrod's time of life the lath sword is no longer satisfactory. Indeed,
      he now had a vague sense that weapons of wood were unworthy to the point
      of being contemptible and ridiculous, and he employed them only when he
      was alone and unseen. For months a yearning had grown more and more
      poignant in his vitals, and this yearning was symbolized by one of his
      most profound secrets. In the inner pocket of his jacket, he carried a bit
      of wood whittled into the distant likeness of a pistol, but not even Sam
      Williams had seen it. The wooden pistol never knew the light of day, save
      when Penrod was in solitude; and yet it never left his side except at
      night, when it was placed under his pillow. Still, it did not satisfy; it
      was but the token of his yearning and his dream. With all his might and
      main Penrod longed for one thing beyond all others. He wanted a Real
      Pistol!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was natural. Pictures of real pistols being used to magnificently
      romantic effect were upon almost all the billboards in town, the year
      round, and as for the &ldquo;movie&rdquo; shows, they could not have lived an hour
      unpistoled. In the drug store, where Penrod bought his candy and soda when
      he was in funds, he would linger to turn the pages of periodicals whose
      illustrations were fascinatingly pistolic. Some of the magazines upon the
      very library table at home were sprinkled with pictures of people (usually
      in evening clothes) pointing pistols at other people. Nay, the Library
      Board of the town had emitted a &ldquo;Selected List of Fifteen Books for Boys,&rdquo;
       and Penrod had read fourteen of them with pleasure, but as the fifteenth
      contained no weapons in the earlier chapters and held forth little
      prospect of any shooting at all, he abandoned it halfway, and read the
      most sanguinary of the other fourteen over again. So, the daily food of
      his imagination being gun, what wonder that he thirsted for the Real!
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed from the sidewalk into his own yard, with a subdued &ldquo;Bing!&rdquo;
       inflicted upon the stolid person of a gatepost, and, entering the house
      through the kitchen, ceased to bing for a time. However, driven back from
      the fore part of the house by a dismal sound of callers, he returned to
      the kitchen and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Della,&rdquo; he said to the cook, &ldquo;do you know what I'd do if you was a crook
      and I had my ottomatic with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Della was industrious and preoccupied. &ldquo;If I was a cook!&rdquo; she repeated
      ignorantly, and with no cordiality. &ldquo;Well, I AM a cook. I'm a-cookin'
      right now. Either g'wan in the house where y'b'long, or git out in th'
      yard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod chose the latter, and betook himself slowly to the back fence,
      where he was greeted in a boisterous manner by his wistful little old dog,
      Duke, returning from some affair of his own in the alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down!&rdquo; said Penrod coldly, and bestowed a spiritless &ldquo;Bing!&rdquo; upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a shout was heard from the alley, &ldquo;Yay, Penrod!&rdquo; and the
      sandy head of comrade Sam Williams appeared above the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on over,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sam obediently climbed the fence, the little old dog, Duke, moved
      slowly away, but presently, glancing back over his shoulder and seeing the
      two boys standing together, he broke into a trot and disappeared round a
      corner of the house. He was a dog of long and enlightening experience; and
      he made it clear that the conjunction of Penrod and Sam portended events
      which, from his point of view, might be unfortunate. Duke had a forgiving
      disposition, but he also possessed a melancholy wisdom. In the company of
      either Penrod or Sam, alone, affection often caused him to linger, albeit
      with a little pessimism, but when he saw them together, he invariably
      withdrew in as unobtrusive a manner as haste would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doin'?&rdquo; Sam asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. What you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll show you if you'll come over to our house,&rdquo; said Sam, who was
      wearing an important and secretive expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Penrod showed little interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I said I'd show you if you came on over, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't got anything I haven't got,&rdquo; said Penrod indifferently.
      &ldquo;I know everything that's in your yard and in your stable, and there isn't
      a thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say it was in the yard or in the stable, did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there ain't anything in your house,&rdquo; returned Penrod frankly, &ldquo;that
      I'd walk two feet to look at&mdash;not a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Sam assumed mockery. &ldquo;Oh, no, you wouldn't! You know what it is,
      don't you? Yes, you do!&rdquo; Penrod's curiosity stirred somewhat. &ldquo;Well, all
      right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I got nothin' to do. I just as soon go. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait and see,&rdquo; said Sam, as they climbed the fence. &ldquo;I bet YOUR ole
      eyes'll open pretty far in about a minute or so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet they don't. It takes a good deal to get me excited, unless it's
      sumpthing mighty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll see!&rdquo; Sam promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened an alley, gate and stepped into his own yard in a manner
      signalling caution&mdash;though the exploit, thus far, certainly required
      none and Penrod began to be impressed and hopeful. They entered the house,
      silently, encountering no one, and Sam led the way upstairs, tiptoeing,
      implying unusual and increasing peril. Turning, in the upper hall, they
      went into Sam's father's bedroom, and Sam closed the door with a caution
      so genuine that already Penrod's eyes began to fulfil his host's
      prediction. Adventures in another boy's house are trying to the nerves;
      and another boy's father's bedroom, when invaded, has a violated sanctity
      that is almost appalling. Penrod felt that something was about to happen&mdash;something
      much more important than he had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam tiptoed across the room to a chest of drawers, and, kneeling,
      carefully pulled out the lowest drawer until the surface of its contents&mdash;Mr.
      Williams' winter underwear&mdash;lay exposed. Then he fumbled beneath the
      garments and drew forth a large object, displaying it triumphantly to the
      satisfactorily dumfounded Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a blue-steel Colt's revolver, of the heaviest pattern made in the
      Seventies. Mr. Williams had inherited it from Sam's grandfather (a small
      man, a deacon, and dyspeptic) and it was larger and more horrible than any
      revolver either of the boys had ever seen in any picture, moving or
      stationary. Moreover, greenish bullets of great size were to be seen in
      the chambers of the cylinder, suggesting massacre rather than mere murder.
      This revolver was Real and it was Loaded!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. BINGISM
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Both boys lived breathlessly through a magnificent moment.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me have it!&rdquo; gasped Penrod. &ldquo;Leave me have hold of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait a minute!&rdquo; Sam protested, in a whisper. &ldquo;I want to show you how
      I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you let me show you how <i>I</i> do!&rdquo; Penrod insisted; and they
      scuffled for possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Sam whispered warningly. &ldquo;It might go off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you better leave me have it!&rdquo; And Penrod, victorious and flushed,
      stepped back, the weapon in his grasp. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is the way I
      do: You be a crook; and suppose you got a dagger, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any dagger,&rdquo; Sam protested, advancing. &ldquo;I want that
      revolaver. It's my father's revolaver, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, WAIT a minute, can't you? I got a right to show you the way I DO,
      first, haven't I?&rdquo; Penrod began an improvisation on the spot. &ldquo;Say I'm
      comin' along after dark like this&mdash;look, Sam! And say you try to make
      a jump at me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't!&rdquo; Sam declined this role impatiently. &ldquo;I guess it ain't YOUR
      father's revolaver, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it may be your father's but it ain't yours,&rdquo; Penrod argued,
      becoming logical. &ldquo;It ain't either'r of us revolaver, so I got as much
      right&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't either. It's my fath&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WATCH, can't you&mdash;just a minute!&rdquo; Penrod urged vehemently. &ldquo;I'm not
      goin' to keep it, am I? You can have it when I get through, can't you?
      Here's how <i>I</i> do: I'm comin' along after dark, just walkin' along
      this way&mdash;like this&mdash;look, Sam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, suiting the action to the word, walked to the other end of the
      room, swinging the revolver at his side with affected carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm just walkin' along like this, and first I don't see you,&rdquo; continued
      the actor. &ldquo;Then I kind of get a notion sumpthing wrong's liable to
      happen, so I&mdash;No!&rdquo; He interrupted himself abruptly. &ldquo;No; that isn't
      it. You wouldn't notice that I had my good ole revolaver with me. You
      wouldn't think I had one, because it'd be under my coat like this, and you
      wouldn't see it.&rdquo; Penrod stuck the muzzle of the pistol into the waistband
      of his knickerbockers at the left side and, buttoning his jacket,
      sustained the weapon in concealment by pressure of his elbow. &ldquo;So you
      think I haven't got any; you think I'm just a man comin' along, and so you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam advanced. &ldquo;Well, you've had your turn,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, it's mine. I'm
      goin' to show you how I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WATCH me, can't you?&rdquo; Penrod wailed. &ldquo;I haven't showed you how <i>I</i>
      do, have I? My goodness! Can't you watch me a minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I HAVE been! You said yourself it'd be my turn soon as you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness! Let me have a CHANCE, can't you?&rdquo; Penrod retreated to the
      wall, turning his right side toward Sam and keeping the revolver still
      protected under his coat. &ldquo;I got to have my turn first, haven't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yours is over long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't either! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Sam decidedly, clutching him by the right shoulder and
      endeavouring to reach his left side&mdash;&ldquo;anyway, I'm goin' to have it
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said I could have my turn out!&rdquo; Penrod, carried away by indignation,
      raised his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; Sam, likewise lost to caution, asserted his denial loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said&mdash;Quit that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; Mrs. Williams, Sam's mother, opened the door of the room and stood
      upon the threshold. The scuffling of Sam and Penrod ceased instantly, and
      they stood hushed and stricken, while fear fell upon them. &ldquo;Boys, you
      weren't quarrelling, were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you quarrelling with Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; answered Sam in a small voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounded like it. What was the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both boys returned her curious glance with meekness. They were summoning
      their faculties&mdash;which were needed. Indeed, these are the crises
      which prepare a boy for the business difficulties of his later life.
      Penrod, with the huge weapon beneath his jacket, insecurely supported by
      an elbow and by a waistband which he instantly began to distrust,
      experienced distressful sensations similar to those of the owner of too
      heavily insured property carrying a gasoline can under his overcoat and
      detained for conversation by a policeman. And if, in the coming years it
      was to be Penrod's lot to find himself in that precise situation, no doubt
      he would be the better prepared for it on account of this present
      afternoon's experience under the scalding eye of Mrs. Williams. It should
      be added that Mrs. Williams's eye was awful to the imagination only. It
      was a gentle eye and but mildly curious, having no remote suspicion of the
      dreadful truth, for Sam had backed upon the chest of drawers and closed
      the damnatory open one with the calves of his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, not bearing the fatal evidence upon his person, was in a better state
      than Penrod, though when boys fall into the stillness now assumed by these
      two, it should be understood that they are suffering. Penrod, in fact, was
      the prey to apprehension so keen that the actual pit of his stomach was
      cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being the actual custodian of the crime, he understood that his case was
      several degrees more serious than that of Sam, who, in the event of
      detection, would be convicted as only an accessory. It was a lesson, and
      Penrod already repented his selfishness in not allowing Sam to show how he
      did, first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're sure you weren't quarrelling, Sam?&rdquo; said Mrs. Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; we were just talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she seemed dimly uneasy, and her eye swung to Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you and Sam talking about, Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod gulped invisibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;it wasn't much. Different things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just sumpthing. Different things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you weren't quarrelling,&rdquo; said Mrs. Williams, reassured by this
      reply, which, though somewhat baffling, was thoroughly familiar to her
      ear. &ldquo;Now, if you'll come downstairs, I'll give you each one cookie and no
      more, so your appetites won't be spoiled for your dinners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood, evidently expecting them to precede her. To linger might renew
      vague suspicion, causing it to become more definite; and boys preserve
      themselves from moment to moment, not often attempting to secure the
      future. Consequently, the apprehensive Sam and the unfortunate Penrod
      (with the monstrous implement bulking against his ribs) walked out of the
      room and down the stairs, their countenances indicating an interior
      condition of solemnity. And a curious shade of behaviour might have here
      interested a criminologist. Penrod endeavoured to keep as close to Sam as
      possible, like a lonely person seeking company, while, on the other hand,
      Sam kept moving away from Penrod, seeming to desire an appearance of
      aloofness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the library, boys,&rdquo; said Mrs. Williams, as the three reached the
      foot of the stairs. &ldquo;I'll bring you your cookies. Papa's in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under her eye the two entered the library, to find Mr. Williams reading
      his evening paper. He looked up pleasantly, but it seemed to Penrod that
      he had an ominous and penetrating expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been up to, you boys?&rdquo; inquired this enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Different things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;just different things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Williams nodded; then his glance rested casually upon Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with your arm, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod became paler, and Sam withdrew from him almost conspicuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, What's the matter with your arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; Penrod quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your left. You seem to be holding it at an unnatural position. Have you
      hurt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod swallowed. &ldquo;Yes, sir. A boy bit me&mdash;I mean a dog&mdash;a dog
      bit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Williams murmured sympathetically: &ldquo;That's too bad! Where did he bite
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the&mdash;right on the elbow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious! Perhaps you ought to have it cauterized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have a doctor look at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. My mother put some stuff from the drug store on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. Probably it's all right, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Penrod drew breath more freely, and accepted the warm cookie
      Mrs. Williams brought him. He ate it without relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have only one apiece,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's too near dinner-time. You
      needn't beg for any more, because you can't have 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were good about that; they were in no frame of digestion for cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it your own dog that bit you?&rdquo; Mr. Williams inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir? No, sir. It wasn't Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo; Mrs. Williams exclaimed. &ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't remember just when,&rdquo; he answered feebly. &ldquo;I guess it was day
      before yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious! How did it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he just came up and bit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's terrible! It might be dangerous for other children,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Williams, with a solicitous glance at Sam. &ldquo;Don't you know whom he
      belongs to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm. It was just a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor boy! Your mother must have been dreadfully frightened when you
      came home and she saw&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by the entrance of a middle-aged coloured woman. &ldquo;Miz
      Williams,&rdquo; she began, and then, as she caught sight of Penrod, she
      addressed him directly, &ldquo;You' ma telefoam if you here, send you home right
      away, 'cause they waitin' dinner on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run along, then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Williams, patting the visitor lightly upon
      his shoulder; and she accompanied him to the front door. &ldquo;Tell your mother
      I'm so sorry about your getting bitten, and you must take good care of it,
      Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod lingered helplessly outside the doorway, looking at Sam, who stood
      partially obscured in the hall, behind Mrs. Williams. Penrod's eyes, with
      veiled anguish, conveyed a pleading for help as well as a horror of the
      position in which he found himself. Sam, however, pale and determined,
      seemed to have assumed a stony attitude of detachment, as if it were well
      understood between them that his own comparative innocence was
      established, and that whatever catastrophe ensued, Penrod had brought it
      on and must bear the brunt of it alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'd better run along, since they're waiting for you at home,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Williams, closing the door. &ldquo;Good-night, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ... Ten minutes later Penrod took his place at his own dinner-table,
      somewhat breathless but with an expression of perfect composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you EVER come home without being telephoned for?&rdquo; demanded his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; And Penrod added reproachfully, placing the blame upon members
      of Mr. Schofield's own class, &ldquo;Sam's mother and father kept me, or I'd
      been home long ago. They would keep on talkin', and I guess I had to be
      POLITE, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His left arm was as free as his right; there was no dreadful bulk beneath
      his jacket, and at Penrod's age the future is too far away to be worried
      about the difference between temporary security and permanent security is
      left for grown people. To Penrod, security was security, and before his
      dinner was half eaten his spirit had become fairly serene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when he entered the empty carriage-house of the stable, on
      his return from school the next afternoon, his expression was not
      altogether without apprehension, and he stood in the doorway looking well
      about him before he lifted a loosened plank in the flooring and took from
      beneath it the grand old weapon of the Williams family. Not did his eye
      lighten with any pleasurable excitement as he sat himself down in a
      shadowy corner and began some sketchy experiments with the mechanism. The
      allure of first sight was gone. In Mr. Williams' bedchamber, with Sam
      clamouring for possession, it had seemed to Penrod that nothing in the
      world was so desirable as to have that revolver in his own hands&mdash;it
      was his dream come true. But, for reasons not definitely known to him, the
      charm had departed; he turned the cylinder gingerly, almost with distaste;
      and slowly there stole over him a feeling that there was something
      repellent and threatening in the heavy blue steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus does the long-dreamed Real misbehave&mdash;not only for Penrod!
    </p>
    <p>
      More out of a sense of duty to bingism in general than for any other
      reason, he pointed the revolver at the lawn-mower, and gloomily murmured,
      &ldquo;Bing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, a low and cautious voice sounded from the yard outside,
      &ldquo;Yay, Penrod!&rdquo; and Sam Williams darkened the doorway, his eye falling
      instantly upon the weapon in his friend's hand. Sam seemed relieved to see
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't get caught with it, did you?&rdquo; he said hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod shook his head, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not! I guess I got SOME brains around me,&rdquo; he added, inspired by
      Sam's presence to assume a slight swagger. &ldquo;They'd have to get up pretty
      early to find any good ole revolaver, once I got MY hands on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we can keep it, all right,&rdquo; Sam said confidentially. &ldquo;Because
      this morning papa was putting on his winter underclothes and he found it
      wasn't there, and they looked all over and everywhere, and he was pretty
      mad, and said he knew it was those cheap plumbers stole it that mamma got
      instead of the regular plumbers he always used to have, and he said there
      wasn't any chance ever gettin' it back, because you couldn't tell which
      one took it, and they'd all swear it wasn't them. So it looks like we
      could keep it for our revolaver, Penrod, don't it? I'll give you half of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod affected some enthusiasm. &ldquo;Sam, we'll keep it out here in the
      stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and we'll go huntin' with it. We'll do lots of things with it!&rdquo; But
      Sam made no effort to take it, and neither boy seemed to feel yesterday's
      necessity to show the other how he did. &ldquo;Wait till next Fourth o' July!&rdquo;
       Sam continued. &ldquo;Oh, oh! Look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This incited a genuine spark from Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourth o' July! I guess she'll be a little better than any firecrackers!
      Just a little 'Bing!' Bing! Bing!' she'll be goin'. 'Bing! Bing! Bing!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion of noise stirred his comrade. &ldquo;I'll bet she'll go off
      louder'n that time the gas-works blew up! I wouldn't be afraid to shoot
      her off ANY time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you would,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;You aren't used to revolavers the way I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren't, either!&rdquo; Sam exclaimed promptly, &ldquo;I wouldn't be any more
      afraid to shoot her off than you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let's see you then; you talk so much!&rdquo; And Penrod handed the weapon
      scornfully to Sam, who at once became less self-assertive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd shoot her off in a minute,&rdquo; Sam said, &ldquo;only it might break sumpthing
      if it hit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold her up in the air, then. It can't hurt the roof, can it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam, with a desperate expression, lifted the revolver at arm's length.
      Both boys turned away their heads, and Penrod put his fingers in his ears&mdash;but
      nothing happened. &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Why don't you go on
      if you're goin' to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam lowered his arm. &ldquo;I guess I didn't have her cocked,&rdquo; he said
      apologetically, whereupon Penrod loudly jeered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tryin' to shoot a revolaver and didn't know enough to cock her! If I
      didn't know any more about revolavers than that, I'd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; Sam exclaimed, managing to draw back the hammer until two
      chilling clicks warranted his opinion that the pistol was now ready to
      perform its office. &ldquo;I guess she'll do all right to suit you THIS time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whyn't you go ahead, then; you know so much!&rdquo; And as Sam raised his
      arm, Penrod again turned away his head and placed his forefingers in his
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why'n't you go ahead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, after waiting in keen suspense, turned to behold his friend
      standing with his right arm above his head, his left hand over his left
      ear, and both eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't pull the trigger,&rdquo; said Sam indistinctly, his face convulsed as
      in sympathy with the great muscular efforts of other parts of his body.
      &ldquo;She won't pull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won't?&rdquo; Penrod remarked with scorn. &ldquo;I'll bet <i>I</i> could pull
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam promptly opened his eyes and handed the weapon to Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, with surprising and unusual mildness. &ldquo;You try her,
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly discomfited to a disagreeable extent, Penrod attempted to talk
      his own misgivings out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor 'ittle baby!&rdquo; he said, swinging the pistol at his side with a fair
      pretense of careless ease. &ldquo;Ain't even strong enough to pull a trigger!
      Poor 'ittle baby! Well, if you can't even do that much, you better watch
      me while <i>I</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam reasonably, &ldquo;why don't you go on and do it then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I AM goin' to, ain't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, why don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll do it fast enough to suit YOU, I guess,&rdquo; Penrod retorted,
      swinging the big revolver up a little higher than his shoulder and
      pointing it in the direction of the double doors, which opened upon the
      alley. &ldquo;You better run, Sam,&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;You'll be pretty scared when I
      shoot her off, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you SEE if I will? I bet you're afraid yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am, am I?&rdquo; said Penrod, in a reckless voice&mdash;and his finger
      touched the trigger. It seemed to him that his finger no more than touched
      it; perhaps he had been reassured by Sam's assertion that the trigger was
      difficult. His intentions must remain in doubt, and probably Penrod
      himself was not certain of them; but one thing comes to the surface as
      entirely definite&mdash;that trigger was not so hard to pull as Sam said
      it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      BANG! WH-A-A-ACK! A shattering report split the air of the stable, and
      there was an orifice of remarkable diameter in the alley door. With these
      phenomena, three yells, expressing excitement of different kinds, were
      almost simultaneous&mdash;two from within the stable and the third from a
      point in the alley about eleven inches lower than the orifice just
      constructed in the planking of the door. This third point, roughly
      speaking, was the open mouth of a gayly dressed young coloured man whose
      attention, as he strolled, had been thus violently distracted from some
      mental computations he was making in numbers, including, particularly,
      those symbols at ecstasy or woe, as the case might be, seven and eleven.
      His eye at once perceived the orifice on a line enervatingly little above
      the top of his head; and, although he had not supposed himself so well
      known in this neighbourhood, he was aware that he did, here and there,
      possess acquaintances of whom some such uncomplimentary action might be
      expected as natural and characteristic. His immediate procedure was to
      prostrate himself flat upon the ground, against the stable doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In so doing, his shoulders came brusquely in contact with one of them,
      which happened to be unfastened, and it swung open, revealing to his gaze
      two stark-white white boys, one of them holding an enormous pistol and
      both staring at him in stupor of ultimate horror. For, to the glassy eyes
      of Penrod and Sam, the stratagem of the young coloured man, thus dropping
      to earth, disclosed, with awful certainty, a slaughtered body.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dreadful thing raised itself upon its elbows and looked at them, and
      there followed a motionless moment&mdash;a tableau of brief duration, for
      both boys turned and would have fled, shrieking, but the body spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'At's a nice business!&rdquo; it said reproachfully. &ldquo;Nice business! Tryin'
      blow a man's head off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was unable to speak, but Sam managed to summon the tremulous
      semblance of a voice. &ldquo;Where&mdash;where did it hit you?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemmine anything 'bout where it HIT me,&rdquo; the young coloured man returned,
      dusting his breast and knees as he rose. &ldquo;I want to know what kine o'
      white boys you think you is&mdash;man can't walk 'long street 'thout you
      blowin' his head off!&rdquo; He entered the stable and, with an indignation
      surely justified, took the pistol from the limp, cold hand of Penrod.
      &ldquo;Whose gun you playin' with? Where you git 'at gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's ours,&rdquo; quavered Sam. &ldquo;It belongs to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you' pa ought to be 'rested,&rdquo; said the young coloured man. &ldquo;Lettin'
      boys play with gun!&rdquo; He examined the revolver with an interest in which
      there began to appear symptoms of a pleasurable appreciation. &ldquo;My
      goo'ness! Gun like'iss blow a team o' steers thew a brick house! LOOK at
      'at gun!&rdquo; With his right hand he twirled it in a manner most dexterous and
      surprising; then suddenly he became severe. &ldquo;You white boy, listen me!&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Ef I went an did what I OUGHT to did, I'd march straight out 'iss
      stable, git a policeman, an' tell him 'rest you an' take you off to jail.
      'At's what you need&mdash;blowin' man's head off! Listen me: I'm goin'
      take 'iss gun an' th'ow her away where you can't do no mo' harm with her.
      I'm goin' take her way off in the woods an' th'ow her away where can't
      nobody fine her an' go blowin' man's head off with her. 'At's what I'm
      goin' do!&rdquo; And placing the revolver inside his coat as inconspicuously as
      possible, he proceeded to the open door and into the alley, where he
      turned for a final word. &ldquo;I let you off 'iss one time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
      listen me&mdash;you listen, white boy: you bet' not tell you' pa. <i>I</i>
      ain' goin' tell him, an' YOU ain' goin' tell him. He want know where gun
      gone, you tell him you los' her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Williams, swallowing continuously, presently walked to the alley door,
      and remarked in a weak voice, &ldquo;I'm sick at my stummick.&rdquo; He paused, then
      added more decidedly: &ldquo;I'm goin' home. I guess I've stood about enough
      around here for one day!&rdquo; And bestowing a last glance upon his friend, who
      was now sitting dumbly upon the floor in the exact spot where he had stood
      to fire the dreadful shot, Sam moved slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early shades of autumn evening were falling when Penrod emerged from
      the stable; and a better light might have disclosed to a shrewd eye some
      indications that here was a boy who had been extremely, if temporarily,
      ill. He went to the cistern, and, after a cautious glance round the
      reassuring horizon, lifted the iron cover. Then he took from the inner
      pocket of his jacket an object which he dropped listlessly into the water:
      it was a bit of wood, whittled to the likeness of a pistol. And though his
      lips moved not, nor any sound issued from his vocal organs, yet were words
      formed. They were so deep in the person of Penrod they came almost from
      the slowly convalescing profundities of his stomach. These words concerned
      firearms, and they were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I'd never seen one! Never want to see one again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Penrod had no way of knowing that, as regards bingism in
      general, several of the most distinguished old gentlemen in Europe were at
      that very moment in exactly the same state of mind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE IN-OR-IN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Georgie Bassett was a boy set apart. Not only that; Georgie knew that he
      was a boy set apart. He would think about it for ten or twenty minutes at
      a time, and he could not look at himself in a mirror and remain wholly
      without emotion. What that emotion was, he would have been unable to put
      into words; but it helped him to understand that there was a certain noble
      something about him that other boys did not possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's mother had been the first to discover that Georgie was a boy set
      apart. In fact, Georgie did not know it until one day when he happened to
      overhear his mother telling two of his aunts about it. True, he had always
      understood that he was the best boy in town and he intended to be a
      minister when he grew up; but he had never before comprehended the full
      extent of his sanctity, and, from that fraught moment onward, he had an
      almost theatrical sense of his set-apartness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod Schofield and Sam Williams and the other boys of the neighbourhood
      all were conscious that there was something different and spiritual about
      Georgie, and, though this consciousness of theirs may have been a little
      obscure, it was none the less actual. That is to say, they knew that
      Georgie Bassett was a boy set apart; but they did not know that they knew
      it. Georgie's air and manner at all times demonstrated to them that the
      thing was so, and, moreover, their mothers absorbed appreciation of
      Georgie's wonderfulness from the very fount of it, for Mrs. Bassett's
      conversation was of little else. Thus, the radiance of his character
      became the topic of envious parental comment during moments of strained
      patience in many homes, so that altogether the most remarkable fact to be
      stated of Georgie Bassett is that he escaped the consequences as long as
      he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange as it may seem, no actual violence was done him, except upon the
      incidental occasion of a tar-fight into which he was drawn by an obvious
      eccentricity on the part of destiny. Naturally, he was not popular with
      his comrades; in all games he was pushed aside, and disregarded, being
      invariably the tail-ender in every pastime in which leaders &ldquo;chose sides&rdquo;;
      his counsels were slighted as worse than weightless, and all his opinions
      instantly hooted. Still, considering the circumstances fairly and
      thoughtfully, it is difficult to deny that his boy companions showed
      creditable moderation in their treatment of him. That is, they were
      moderate up to a certain date, and even then they did not directly attack
      him&mdash;there was nothing cold&mdash;blooded about it at all. The thing
      was forced upon them, and, though they all felt pleased and uplifted&mdash;while
      it was happening&mdash;they did not understand precisely why. Nothing
      could more clearly prove their innocence of heart than this very
      ignorance, and yet none of the grown people who later felt themselves
      concerned in the matter was able to look at it in that light. Now, here
      was a characteristic working of those reactions that produce what is
      sometimes called &ldquo;the injustice of life&rdquo;, because the grown people were
      responsible for the whole affair and were really the guilty parties. It
      was from grown people that Georgie Bassett learned he was a boy set apart,
      and the effect upon him was what alienated his friends. Then these
      alienated friends were brought (by odious comparisons on the part of grown
      people) to a condition of mind wherein they suffered dumb annoyance, like
      a low fever, whenever they heard Georgie's name mentioned, while
      association with his actual person became every day more and more
      irritating. And yet, having laid this fuse and having kept it constantly
      glowing, the grown people expected nothing to happen to Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catastrophe befell as a consequence of Sam Williams deciding to have a
      shack in his backyard. Sam had somehow obtained a vasty piano-box and a
      quantity of lumber, and, summoning Penrod Schofield and the coloured
      brethren, Herman and Verman, he expounded to them his building-plans and
      offered them shares and benefits in the institution he proposed to found.
      Acceptance was enthusiastic; straightway the assembly became a union of
      carpenters all of one mind, and ten days saw the shack not completed but
      comprehensible. Anybody could tell, by that time, that it was intended for
      a shack.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a door on leather hinges; it drooped, perhaps, but it was a
      door. There was a window&mdash;not a glass one, but, at least, it could be
      &ldquo;looked out of&rdquo;, as Sam said. There was a chimney made of stovepipe,
      though that was merely decorative, because the cooking was done out of
      doors in an underground &ldquo;furnace&rdquo; that the boys excavated. There were
      pictures pasted on the interior walls, and, hanging from a nail, there was
      a crayon portrait of Sam's grandfather, which he had brought down from the
      attic quietly, though, as he said, it &ldquo;wasn't any use on earth up there.&rdquo;
       There were two lame chairs from Penrod's attic and along one wall ran a
      low and feeble structure intended to serve as a bench or divan. This would
      come in handy, Sam said, if any of the party &ldquo;had to lay down or
      anything&rdquo;, and at a pinch (such as a meeting of the association) it would
      serve to seat all the members in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, coincidentally with the development of the shack, the builders became
      something more than partners. Later, no one could remember who first
      suggested the founding of a secret order, or society, as a measure of
      exclusiveness and to keep the shack sacred to members only; but it was an
      idea that presently began to be more absorbing and satisfactory than even
      the shack itself. The outward manifestations of it might have been
      observed in the increased solemnity and preoccupation of the Caucasian
      members and in a few ceremonial observances exposed to the public eye. As
      an instance of these latter, Mrs. Williams, happening to glance from a
      rearward window, about four o'clock one afternoon, found her attention
      arrested by what seemed to be a flag-raising before the door of the shack.
      Sam and Herman and Verman stood in attitudes of rigid attention, shoulder
      to shoulder, while Penrod Schofield, facing them, was apparently
      delivering some sort of exhortation, which he read from a scribbled sheet
      of foolscap. Concluding this, he lifted from the ground a long and
      somewhat warped clothes-prop, from one end of which hung a whitish flag,
      or pennon, bearing an inscription. Sam and Herman and Verman lifted their
      right hands, while Penrod placed the other end of the clothes-prop in a
      hole in the ground, with the pennon fluttering high above the shack. He
      then raised his own right hand, and the four boys repeated something in
      concert. It was inaudible to Mrs. Williams; but she was able to make out
      the inscription upon the pennon. It consisted of the peculiar phrase
      &ldquo;In-Or-In&rdquo; done in black paint upon a muslin ground, and consequently
      seeming to be in need of a blotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It recurred to her mind, later that evening, when she happened to find
      herself alone with Sam in the library, and, in merest idle curiosity, she
      asked: &ldquo;Sam, what does 'In-Or-In' mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam, bending over an arithmetic, uncreased his brow till it became of a
      blank and marble smoothness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are those words on your flag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam gave her a long, cold, mystic look, rose to his feet and left the room
      with emphasis and dignity. For a moment she was puzzled. But Sam's older
      brother was this year completing his education at a university, and Mrs.
      Williams was not altogether ignorant of the obligations of secrecy imposed
      upon some brotherhoods; so she was able to comprehend Sam's silent
      withdrawal, and, instead of summoning him back for further questions, she
      waited until he was out of hearing and then began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam's action was in obedience to one of the rules adopted, at his own
      suggestion, as a law of the order. Penrod advocated it warmly. From
      Margaret he had heard accounts of her friends in college and thus had
      learned much that ought to be done. On the other hand, Herman subscribed
      to it with reluctance, expressing a decided opinion that if he and Verman
      were questioned upon the matter at home and adopted the line of conduct
      required by the new rule, it would be well for them to depart not only
      from the room in which the questioning took place but from the house, and
      hurriedly at that. &ldquo;An' STAY away!&rdquo; he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verman, being tongue-tied&mdash;not without advantage in this case, and
      surely an ideal qualification for membership&mdash;was not so
      apprehensive. He voted with Sam and Penrod, carrying the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      New rules were adopted at every meeting (though it cannot be said that all
      of them were practicable) for, in addition to the information possessed by
      Sam and Penrod, Herman and Verman had many ideas of their own, founded
      upon remarks overheard at home. Both their parents belonged to secret
      orders, their father to the Innapenent 'Nevolent Lodge (so stated by
      Herman) and their mother to the Order of White Doves.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these and other sources, Penrod found no difficulty in compiling
      material for what came to be known as the &ldquo;rixual&rdquo;; and it was the rixual
      he was reading to the members when Mrs. Williams happened to observe the
      ceremonial raising of the emblem of the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rixual contained the oath, a key to the secret language, or code
      (devised by Penrod for use in uncertain emergencies) and passwords for
      admission to the shack, also instructions for recognizing a brother member
      in the dark, and a rather alarming sketch of the things to be done during
      the initiation of a candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last was employed for the benefit of Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts,
      Junior, on the Saturday following the flag-raising. He presented himself
      in Sam's yard, not for initiation, indeed&mdash;having no previous
      knowledge of the Society of the In-Or-In&mdash;but for general purposes of
      sport and pastime. At first sight of the shack he expressed anticipations
      of pleasure, adding some suggestions for improving the architectural
      effect. Being prevented, however, from entering, and even from standing in
      the vicinity of the sacred building, he plaintively demanded an
      explanation; whereupon he was commanded to withdraw to the front yard for
      a time, and the members held meeting in the shack. Roddy was elected, and
      consented to undergo the initiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not the only new member that day. A short time after Roddy had been
      taken into the shack for the reading of the rixual and other ceremonies,
      little Maurice Levy entered the Williams' gate and strolled round to the
      backyard, looking for Sam. He was surprised and delighted to behold the
      promising shack, and, like Roddy, entertained fair hopes for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the shack was closed; a board covered the window, but a murmur
      of voices came from within. Maurice stole close and listened. Through a
      crack he could see the flicker of a candle-flame, and he heard the voice
      of Penrod Schofield:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roddy Bitts, do you solemnly swear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right,&rdquo; said the voice of Roddy, somewhat breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many fingers you see before your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't see any,&rdquo; Roddy returned. &ldquo;How could I, with this thing over my
      eyes, and laying down on my stummick, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the time has come,&rdquo; Penrod announced in solemn tones. &ldquo;The time has
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whack!
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently a broad and flat implement was thereupon applied to Roddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OW!&rdquo; complained the candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No noise!&rdquo; said Penrod sternly, and added: &ldquo;Roddy Bitts must now say the
      oath. Say exackly what I say, Roddy, and if you don't&mdash;well, you
      better, because you'll see! Now, say 'I solemnly swear&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I solemnly swear&mdash;&rdquo; Roddy said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep the secrets&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep the secrets&mdash;&rdquo; Roddy repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep the secrets in infadelaty and violate and sanctuary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Roddy naturally inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whack!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OW!&rdquo; cried Roddy. &ldquo;That's no fair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got to say just what <i>I</i> say,&rdquo; Penrod was heard informing him.
      &ldquo;That's the rixual, and anyway, even if you do get it right, Verman's got
      to hit you every now and then, because that's part of the rixual, too. Now
      go on and say it. 'I solemnly swear to keep the secrets in infadelaty and
      violate and sanctuary.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I solemnly swear&mdash;&rdquo; Roddy began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Maurice Levy was tired of being no party to such fascinating
      proceedings, and he began to hammer upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam! Sam Williams!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Lemme in there! I know lots about
      'nishiatin'. Lemme in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was flung open, revealing Roddy Bitts, blindfolded and bound,
      lying face down upon the floor of the shack; but Maurice had only a
      fugitive glimpse of this pathetic figure before he, too, was recumbent.
      Four boys flung themselves indignantly upon him and bore him to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he squealed. &ldquo;What you doin'? Haven't you got any SENSE?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, from within the shack, Roddy added his own protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me up, can't you?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I got to see what's goin' on out there,
      haven't I? I guess I'm not goin' to lay here all DAY! What you think I'm
      made of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hush up!&rdquo; Penrod commanded. &ldquo;This is a nice biznuss!&rdquo; he continued,
      deeply aggrieved. &ldquo;What kind of a 'nishiation do you expect this is,
      anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here's Maurice Levy gone and seen part of the secrets,&rdquo; said Sam,
      in a voice of equal plaintiveness. &ldquo;Yes; and I bet he was listenin' out
      here, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme up!&rdquo; begged Maurice, half stifled. &ldquo;I didn't do any harm to your
      old secrets, did I? Anyways, I just as soon be 'nishiated myself. I ain't
      afraid. So if you 'nishiate me, what difference will it make if I did hear
      a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Struck with this idea, which seemed reasonable; Penrod obtained silence
      from every one except Roddy, and it was decided to allow Maurice to rise
      and retire to the front yard. The brother members then withdrew within the
      shack, elected Maurice to the fellowship, and completed the initiation of
      Mr. Bitts. After that, Maurice was summoned and underwent the ordeal with
      fortitude, though the newest brother&mdash;still tingling with his own
      experiences&mdash;helped to make certain parts of the rixual
      unprecedentedly severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once endowed with full membership, Maurice and Roddy accepted the
      obligations and privileges of the order with enthusiasm. Both interested
      themselves immediately in improvements for the shack, and made excursions
      to their homes to obtain materials. Roddy returned with a pair of lensless
      mother-of-pearl opera-glasses, a contribution that led to the creation of
      a new office, called the &ldquo;warner&rdquo;. It was his duty to climb upon the back
      fence once every fifteen minutes and search the horizon for intruders or
      &ldquo;anybody that hasn't got any biznuss around here.&rdquo; This post proved so
      popular, at first, that it was found necessary to provide for rotation in
      office, and to shorten the interval from fifteen minutes to an indefinite
      but much briefer period, determined principally by argument between the
      incumbent and his successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Maurice Levy contributed a device so pleasant, and so necessary to the
      prevention of interruption during meetings, that Penrod and Sam wondered
      why they had not thought of it themselves long before. It consisted of
      about twenty-five feet of garden hose in fair condition. One end of it was
      introduced into the shack through a knothole, and the other was secured by
      wire round the faucet of hydrant in the stable. Thus, if members of the
      order were assailed by thirst during an important session, or in the
      course of an initiation, it would not be necessary for them all to leave
      the shack. One could go, instead, and when he had turned on the water at
      the hydrant, the members in the shack could drink without leaving their
      places. It was discovered, also, that the section of hose could be used as
      a speaking-tube; and though it did prove necessary to explain by shouting
      outside the tube what one had said into it, still there was a general
      feeling that it provided another means of secrecy and an additional
      safeguard against intrusion. It is true that during the half-hour
      immediately following the installation of this convenience, there was a
      little violence among the brothers concerning a question of policy. Sam,
      Roddy and Verman&mdash;Verman especially&mdash;wished to use the tube &ldquo;to
      talk through&rdquo; and Maurice, Penrod and Herman wished to use it &ldquo;to drink
      through.&rdquo; As a consequence of the success of the latter party, the shack
      became too damp for habitation until another day, and several members, as
      they went home at dusk, might easily have been mistaken for survivors of
      some marine catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, not every shack is equipped with running water, and exuberance
      befitted the occasion. Everybody agreed that the afternoon had been one of
      the most successful and important in many weeks. The Order of the In-Or-In
      was doing splendidly, and yet every brother felt, in his heart, that there
      was one thing that could spoil it. Against that fatality, all were united
      to protect themselves, the shack, the rixual, the opera-glasses and the
      water-and-speaking tube. Sam spoke not only for himself but for the entire
      order when he declared, in speeding the last parting guest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we got to stick to one thing or we might as well quit! GEORGIE
      BASSETT better not come pokin' around!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, SIR!&rdquo; said Penrod.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. GEORGIE BECOMES A MEMBER
    </h2>
    <p>
      But Georgie did. It is difficult to imagine how cause and effect could be
      more closely and patently related. Inevitably, Georgie did come poking
      around. How was he to refrain when daily, up and down the neighbourhood,
      the brothers strutted with mystic and important airs, when they whispered
      together and uttered words of strange import in his presence? Thus did
      they defeat their own object. They desired to keep Georgie at a distance,
      yet they could not refrain from posing before him. They wished to impress
      upon him the fact that he was an outsider, and they but succeeded in
      rousing his desire to be an insider, a desire that soon became a
      determination. For few were the days until he not only knew of the shack
      but had actually paid it a visit. That was upon a morning when the other
      boys were in school, Georgie having found himself indisposed until about
      ten o'clock, when he was able to take nourishment and subsequently to
      interest himself in this rather private errand. He climbed the Williams'
      alley fence, and, having made a modest investigation of the exterior of
      the shack, which was padlocked, retired without having disturbed anything
      except his own peace of mind. His curiosity, merely piqued before, now
      became ravenous and painful. It was not allayed by the mystic manners of
      the members or by the unnecessary emphasis they laid upon their coldness
      toward himself; and when a committee informed him darkly that there were
      &ldquo;secret orders&rdquo; to prevent his coming within &ldquo;a hundred and sixteen feet&rdquo;&mdash;such
      was Penrod's arbitrary language&mdash;of the Williams' yard, &ldquo;in any
      direction&rdquo;, Georgie could bear it no longer, but entered his own house,
      and, in burning words, laid the case before a woman higher up. Here the
      responsibility for things is directly traceable to grown people. Within
      that hour, Mrs. Bassett sat in Mrs. Williams's library to address her
      hostess upon the subject of Georgie's grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it isn't Sam's fault,&rdquo; she said, concluding her interpretation
      of the affair. &ldquo;Georgie likes Sam, and didn't blame him at all. No; we
      both felt that Sam would always be a polite, nice boy&mdash;Georgie used
      those very words&mdash;but Penrod seems to have a VERY bad influence.
      Georgie felt that Sam would WANT him to come and play in the shack if
      Penrod didn't make Sam do everything HE wants. What hurt Georgie most is
      that it's SAM'S shack, and he felt for another boy to come and tell him
      that he mustn't even go NEAR it&mdash;well, of course, it was very trying.
      And he's very much hurt with little Maurice Levy, too. He said that he was
      sure that even Penrod would be glad to have him for a member of their
      little club if it weren't for Maurice&mdash;and I think he spoke of Roddy
      Bitts, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the two remaining members were coloured was omitted from
      this discourse which leads to the deduction that Georgie had not mentioned
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie said all the other boys liked him very much,&rdquo; Mrs. Bassett
      continued, &ldquo;and that he felt it his duty to join the club, because most of
      them were so anxious to have him, and he is sure he would have a good
      influence over them. He really did speak of it in quite a touching way,
      Mrs. Williams. Of course, we mothers mustn't brag of our sons too much,
      but Georgie REALLY isn't like other boys. He is so sensitive, you can't
      think how this little affair has hurt him, and I felt that it might even
      make him ill. You see, I HAD to respect his reason for wanting to join the
      club. And if I AM his mother&rdquo;&mdash;she gave a deprecating little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I
      must say that it seems noble to want to join not really for his own sake
      but for the good that he felt his influence would have over the other
      boys. Don't you think so, Mrs. Williams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Williams said that she did, indeed. And the result of this interview
      was another, which took place between Sam and his father that evening, for
      Mrs. Williams, after talking to Sam herself, felt that the matter needed a
      man to deal with it. The man did it man-fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You either invite Georgie Bassett to play in the shack all he wants to,&rdquo;
       the man said, &ldquo;or the shack comes down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your choice. I'm not going to have neighbourhood quarrels over such&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Papa&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough! You said yourself you haven't anything against Georgie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you didn't like him, but you couldn't tell why. You couldn't
      state a single instance of bad behaviour against him. You couldn't mention
      anything he ever did which wasn't what a gentleman should have done. It's
      no use, I tell you. Either you invite Georgie to play in the shack as much
      as he likes next Saturday, or the shack comes down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, PAPA&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to talk any more about it. If you want the shack pulled
      down and hauled away, you and your friends continue to tantalize this
      inoffensive little boy the way you have been. If you want to keep it, be
      polite and invite him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's ALL, I said!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he communicated the bitter substance of the edict to the other
      members, and gloom became unanimous. So serious an aspect did the affair
      present that it was felt necessary to call a special meeting of the order
      after school. The entire membership was in attendance; the door was
      closed, the window covered with a board, and the candle lighted. Then all
      of the brothers&mdash;except one&mdash;began to express their sorrowful
      apprehensions. The whole thing was spoiled, they agreed, if Georgie
      Bassett had to be taken in. On the other hand, if they didn't take him in,
      &ldquo;there wouldn't be anything left.&rdquo; The one brother who failed to express
      any opinion was little Verman. He was otherwise occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verman had been the official paddler during the initiations of Roddy Bitts
      and Maurice Levy; his work had been conscientious, and it seemed to be
      taken by consent that he was to continue in office. An old shingle from
      the woodshed roof had been used for the exercise of his function in the
      cases of Roddy and Maurice; but this afternoon he had brought with him a
      new one that he had picked up somewhere. It was broader and thicker than
      the old one and, during the melancholy prophecies of his fellows, he
      whittled the lesser end of it to the likeness of a handle. Thus engaged,
      he bore no appearance of despondency; on the contrary, his eyes, shining
      brightly in the candlelight, indicated that eager thoughts possessed him,
      while from time to time the sound of a chuckle issued from his simple
      African throat. Gradually the other brothers began to notice his
      preoccupation, and one by one they fell silent, regarding him
      thoughtfully. Slowly the darkness of their countenances lifted a little;
      something happier and brighter began to glimmer from each boyish face. All
      eyes remained fascinated upon Verman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; said Penrod, in a tone that was almost cheerful, &ldquo;this is
      only Tuesday. We got pretty near all week to fix up the 'nishiation for
      Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Saturday brought sunshine to make the occasion more tolerable for both
      the candidate and the society. Mrs. Williams, going to the window to watch
      Sam when he left the house after lunch, marked with pleasure that his look
      and manner were sprightly as he skipped down the walk to the front gate.
      There he paused and yodelled for a time. An answering yodel came
      presently; Penrod Schofield appeared, and by his side walked Georgie
      Bassett. Georgie was always neat; but Mrs. Williams noticed that he
      exhibited unusual gloss and polish to-day. As for his expression, it was a
      shade too complacent under the circumstances, though, for that matter,
      perfect tact avoids an air of triumph under any circumstances. Mrs.
      Williams was pleased to observe that Sam and Penrod betrayed no resentment
      whatever; they seemed to have accepted defeat in a good spirit and to be
      inclined to make the best of Georgie. Indeed, they appeared to be
      genuinely excited about him&mdash;it was evident that their cordiality was
      eager and wholehearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three boys conferred for a few moments; then Sam disappeared round the
      house and returned, waving his hand and nodding. Upon that, Penrod took
      Georgie's left arm, Sam took his right, and the three marched off to the
      backyard in a companionable way that made Mrs. Williams feel it had been
      an excellent thing to interfere a little in Georgie's interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiencing the benevolent warmth that comes of assisting in a good
      action, she ascended to an apartment upstairs, and, for a couple of hours,
      employed herself with needle and thread in sartorial repairs on behalf of
      her husband and Sam. Then she was interrupted by the advent of a coloured
      serving-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miz Williams, I reckon the house goin' fall down!&rdquo; this pessimist said,
      arriving out of breath. &ldquo;That s'iety o' Mist' Sam's suttenly tryin' to
      pull the roof down on ow haids!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The roof?&rdquo; Mrs. Williams inquired mildly. &ldquo;They aren't in the attic, are
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm; they in the celluh, but they REACHIN' fer the roof! I nev' did hear
      no sech a rumpus an' squawkin' an' squawlin' an' fallin' an' whoopin' an'
      whackin' an' bangin'! They troop down by the outside celluh do', n'en&mdash;bang!&mdash;they
      bus' loose, an' been goin' on ev' since, wuss'n Bedlun! Ef they anything
      down celluh ain' broke by this time, it cain' be only jes' the foundashum,
      an' I bet THAT ain' goin' stan' much longer! I'd gone down an' stop 'em,
      but I'm 'fraid to. Hones', Miz Williams, I'm 'fraid o' my life go down
      there, all that Bedlun goin' on. I thought I come see what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Williams laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to stand a little noise in the house sometimes, Fanny, when there
      are boys. They're just playing, and a lot of noise is usually a pretty
      safe sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; Fanny said. &ldquo;It's yo' house, Miz Williams, not mine. You want 'em
      tear it down, I'm willin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She departed, and Mrs. Williams continued to sew. The days were growing
      short, and at five o'clock she was obliged to put the work aside, as her
      eyes did not permit her to continue it by artificial light. Descending to
      the lower floor, she found the house silent, and when she opened the front
      door to see if the evening paper had come, she beheld Sam, Penrod and
      Maurice Levy standing near the gate engaged in quiet conversation. Penrod
      and Maurice departed while she was looking for the paper, and Sam came
      thoughtfully up the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sam,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it wasn't such a bad thing, after all, to show a
      little politeness to Georgie Bassett, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam gave her a non-committal look&mdash;expression of every kind had been
      wiped from his countenance. He presented a blank surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm,&rdquo; he said meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything was just a little pleasanter because you'd been friendly,
      wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Georgie gone home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you made enough noise in the cellar&mdash;Did Georgie have a good
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Georgie Bassett have a good time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;Sam now had the air of a person trying to remember details
      with absolute accuracy&mdash;&ldquo;well, he didn't say he did, and he didn't
      say he didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he thank the boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he even thank you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's queer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He's always so polite. He SEEMED to be
      having a good time, didn't he, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't Georgie seem to be enjoying himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question, apparently so simple, was not answered with promptness. Sam
      looked at his mother in a puzzled way, and then he found it necessary to
      rub each of his shins in turn with the palm of his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stumbled,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;I stumbled on the cellar steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hurt yourself?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm; but I guess maybe I better rub some arnica&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come up to your father's bathroom, Sam. Does it
      hurt much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm,&rdquo; he answered truthfully, &ldquo;it hardly hurts at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And having followed her to the bathroom, he insisted, with unusual
      gentleness, that he be left to apply the arnica to the alleged injuries
      himself. He was so persuasive that she yielded, and descended to the
      library, where she found her husband once more at home after his day's
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did Georgie show up, and were they decent to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; it's all right. Sam and Penrod were good as gold. I saw them
      being actually cordial to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's well,&rdquo; Mr. Williams said, settling into a chair with his paper. &ldquo;I
      was a little apprehensive, but I suppose I was mistaken. I walked home,
      and just now, as I passed Mrs. Bassett's, I saw Doctor Venny's car in
      front, and that barber from the corner shop on Second Street was going in
      the door. I couldn't think what a widow would need a barber and a doctor
      for&mdash;especially at the same time. I couldn't think what Georgie'd
      need such a combination for either, and then I got afraid that maybe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Williams laughed. &ldquo;Oh, no; it hasn't anything to do with his having
      been over here. I'm sure they were very nice to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Williams began, when Fanny appeared, summoning
      her to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is pathetically true that Mrs. Williams went to the telephone humming a
      little song. She was detained at the instrument not more than five
      minutes; then she made a plunging return into the library, a blanched and
      stricken woman. She made strange, sinister gestures at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up, miserably prophetic. &ldquo;Mrs. Bassett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the telephone,&rdquo; Mrs. Williams said hoarsely &ldquo;She wants to talk to
      you, too. She CAN'T talk much&mdash;she's hysterical. She says they lured
      Georgie into the cellar and had him beaten by negroes! That's not all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Williams was already on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find Sam!&rdquo; he commanded, over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Williams stepped into the front hall. &ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; she called, addressing
      the upper reaches of the stairway. &ldquo;Sam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not even echo answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SAM!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint clearing of somebody's throat was heard behind her, a sound so
      modest and unobtrusive it was no more than just audible, and, turning, the
      mother beheld her son sitting upon the floor in the shadow of the stairs
      and gazing meditatively at the hatrack. His manner indicated that he
      wished to produce the impression that he had been sitting there, in this
      somewhat unusual place and occupation, for a considerable time, but
      without overhearing anything that went on in the library so close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what have you DONE?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I guess my legs are all right,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I got the
      arnica on, so probably they won't hurt any m&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;March into the library!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam marched&mdash;slow-time. In fact, no funeral march has been composed
      in a time so slow as to suit this march of Sam's. One might have suspected
      that he was in a state of apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Williams entered at one door as his son crossed the threshold of the
      other, and this encounter was a piteous sight. After one glance at his
      father's face, Sam turned desperately, as if to flee outright. But Mrs.
      Williams stood in the doorway behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come here!&rdquo; And the father's voice was as terrible as his face. &ldquo;WHAT
      DID YOU DO TO GEORGIE BASSETT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin',&rdquo; Sam gulped; &ldquo;nothin' at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We just&mdash;we just 'nishiated him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Williams turned abruptly, walked to the fireplace, and there turned
      again, facing the wretched Sam. &ldquo;That's all you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie Bassett's mother has just told me over the telephone,&rdquo; Mr.
      Williams said, deliberately, &ldquo;that you and Penrod Schofield and Roderick
      Bitts and Maurice Levy LURED GEORGIE INTO THE CELLAR AND HAD HIM BEATEN BY
      NEGROES!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, Sam was able to hold up his head a little and to summon a rather
      feeble indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't so,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We didn't any such thing lower him into the
      cellar. We weren't goin' NEAR the cellar with him. We never THOUGHT of
      goin' down cellar. He went down there himself, first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! I suppose he was running away from you, poor thing! Trying to escape
      from you, wasn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn't,&rdquo; Sam said doggedly. &ldquo;We weren't chasin' him&mdash;or anything
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did he go in the cellar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he didn't exactly GO in the cellar,&rdquo; Sam said reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did he GET in the cellar, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he fell in,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HOW did he fall in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the door was open, and&mdash;well, he kept walkin' around there,
      and we hollered at him to keep away, but just then he kind of&mdash;well,
      the first <i>I</i> noticed was I couldn't SEE him, and so we went and
      looked down the steps, and he was sitting down there on the bottom step
      and kind of shouting, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; Mr. Williams interrupted. &ldquo;You're going to make a clean breast
      of this whole affair and take the consequences. You're going to tell it
      and tell it ALL. Do you understand that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you tell me how Georgie Bassett fell down the cellar steps&mdash;and
      tell me quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he was blindfolded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! NOW we're getting at it. You begin at the beginning and tell me just
      what you did to him from the time he got here. Understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm goin' to,&rdquo; Sam protested. &ldquo;We never hurt him at all. He wasn't
      even hurt when he fell down cellar. There's a lot of mud down there,
      because the cellar door leaks, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; Mr. Williams's tone was deadly. &ldquo;Did you hear me tell you to begin
      at the beginning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam made a great effort and was able to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we had everything ready for the 'nishiation before lunch,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;We wanted it all to be nice, because you said we had to have him, papa,
      and after lunch Penrod went to guard him&mdash;that's a new part in the
      rixual&mdash;and he brought him over, and we took him out to the shack and
      blindfolded him, and&mdash;well, he got kind of mad because we wanted him
      to lay down on his stummick and be tied up, and he said he wouldn't,
      because the floor was a little bit wet in there and he could feel it sort
      of squashy under his shoes, and he said his mother didn't want him ever to
      get dirty and he just wouldn't do it; and we all kept telling him he had
      to, or else how could there be any 'nishiation; and he kept gettin' madder
      and said he wanted to have the 'nishiation outdoors where it wasn't wet
      and he wasn't goin' to lay down on his stummick, anyway.&rdquo; Sam paused for
      wind, then got under way again: &ldquo;Well, some of the boys were tryin' to get
      him to lay down on his stummick, and he kind of fell up against the door
      and it came open and he ran out in the yard. He was tryin' to get the
      blindfold off his eyes, but he couldn't because it was a towel in a pretty
      hard knot; and he went tearin' all around the backyard, and we didn't
      chase him, or anything. All we did was just watch him&mdash;and that's
      when he fell in the cellar. Well, it didn't hurt him any. It didn't hurt
      him at all; but he was muddier than what he would of been if he'd just had
      sense enough to lay down in the shack. Well, so we thought, long as he was
      down in the cellar anyway, we might as well have the rest of the
      'nishiation down there. So we brought the things down and&mdash;and
      'nishiated him&mdash;and that's all. That's every bit we did to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Williams said sardonically; &ldquo;I see. What were the details of
      the initiation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know what else you did to him? What was the initiation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;it's secret,&rdquo; Sam murmured piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any longer, I assure you! The society is a thing of the past and
      you'll find your friend Penrod's parents agree with me in that. Mrs.
      Bassett had already telephoned them when she called us up. You go on with
      your story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam sighed deeply, and yet it may have been a consolation to know that his
      present misery was not altogether without its counterpart. Through the
      falling dusk his spirit may have crossed the intervening distance to catch
      a glimpse of his friend suffering simultaneously and standing within the
      same peril. And if Sam's spirit did thus behold Penrod in jeopardy, it was
      a true vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Mr. Williams said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there wasn't any fire in the furnace because it's too warm yet, and
      we weren't goin' to do anything'd HURT him, so we put him in there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the FURNACE?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was cold,&rdquo; Sam protested. &ldquo;There hadn't been any fire there since last
      spring. Course we told him there was fire in it. We HAD to do that,&rdquo; he
      continued earnestly, &ldquo;because that was part of the 'nishiation. We only
      kept him in it a little while and kind of hammered on the outside a little
      and then we took him out and got him to lay down on his stummick, because
      he was all muddy anyway, where he fell down the cellar; and how could it
      matter to anybody that had any sense at all? Well, then we had the rixual,
      and&mdash;and&mdash;why, the teeny little paddlin' he got wouldn't hurt a
      flea! It was that little coloured boy lives in the alley did it&mdash;he
      isn't anyways near HALF Georgie's size but Georgie got mad and said he
      didn't want any ole nigger to paddle him. That's what he said, and it was
      his own foolishness, because Verman won't let ANYBODY call him 'nigger',
      and if Georgie was goin' to call him that he ought to had sense enough not
      to do it when he was layin' down that way and Verman all ready to be the
      paddler. And he needn't of been so mad at the rest of us, either, because
      it took us about twenty minutes to get the paddle away from Verman after
      that, and we had to lock Verman up in the laundry-room and not let him out
      till it was all over. Well, and then things were kind of spoiled, anyway;
      so we didn't do but just a little more&mdash;and that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! What was the 'just a little more?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;we got him to swaller a little teeny bit of asafidity that
      Penrod used to have to wear in a bag around his neck. It wasn't enough to
      even make a person sneeze&mdash;it wasn't much more'n a half a spoonful&mdash;it
      wasn't hardly a QUARTER of a spoonf&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Mr. Williams. &ldquo;That accounts for the doctor. What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;we&mdash;we had some paint left over from our flag, and we put
      just a little teeny bit of it on his hair and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Mr. Williams. &ldquo;That accounts for the barber. What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all,&rdquo; Sam said, swallowing. &ldquo;Then he got mad and went home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Williams walked to the door, and sternly motioned to the culprit to
      precede him through it. But just before the pair passed from her sight,
      Mrs. Williams gave way to an uncontrollable impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what does 'In-Or-In' stand for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate boy had begun to sniffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it means&mdash;Innapenent Order of Infadelaty,&rdquo; he moaned&mdash;and
      plodded onward to his doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not his alone: at that very moment Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts,
      Junior, was suffering also, consequent upon telephoning on the part of
      Mrs. Bassett, though Roderick's punishment was administered less on the
      ground of Georgie's troubles and more on that of Roddy's having affiliated
      with an order consisting so largely of Herman and Verman. As for Maurice
      Levy, he was no whit less unhappy. He fared as ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, two ex-members of the In-Or-In were finding their lot
      fortunate. Something had prompted them to linger in the alley in the
      vicinity of the shack, and it was to this fated edifice that Mr. Williams,
      with demoniac justice, brought Sam for the deed he had in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman and Verman listened&mdash;awe-stricken&mdash;to what went on within
      the shack. Then, before it was over, they crept away and down the alley
      toward their own home. This was directly across the alley from the
      Schofields' stable, and they were horrified at the sounds that issued from
      the interior of the stable store-room. It was the St. Bartholomew's Eve of
      that neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, man!&rdquo; said Herman, shaking his head. &ldquo;Glad I ain' no white boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman seemed gloomily to assent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. WHITEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Penrod and Sam made a gloomy discovery one morning in mid-October. All the
      week had seen amiable breezes and fair skies until Saturday, when, about
      breakfast-time, the dome of heaven filled solidly with gray vapour and
      began to drip. The boys' discovery was that there is no justice about the
      weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in the carriage-house of the Schofields' empty stable; the doors
      upon the alley were open, and Sam and Penrod stared torpidly at the thin
      but implacable drizzle that was the more irritating because there was
      barely enough of it to interfere with a number of things they had planned
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; this is NICE!&rdquo; Sam said, in a tone of plaintive sarcasm. &ldquo;This is a
      PERTY way to do!&rdquo; (He was alluding to the personal spitefulness of the
      elements.) &ldquo;I'd like to know what's the sense of it&mdash;ole sun pourin'
      down every day in the week when nobody needs it, then cloud up and rain
      all Saturday! My father said it's goin' to be a three days' rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, nobody with any sense cares if it rains Sunday and Monday,&rdquo; Penrod
      said. &ldquo;I wouldn't care if it rained every Sunday as long I lived; but I
      just like to know what's the reason it had to go and rain to-day. Got all
      the days o' the week to choose from and goes and picks on Saturday. That's
      a fine biz'nuss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in vacation&mdash;&rdquo; Sam began; but at a sound from a source
      invisible to him he paused. &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; he said, somewhat startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious sound, loud and hollow and unhuman, yet it seemed to be a
      cough. Both boys rose, and Penrod asked uneasily: &ldquo;Where'd that noise come
      from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's in the alley,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps if the day had been bright, both of them would have stepped
      immediately to the alley doors to investigate; but their actual procedure
      was to move a little distance in the opposite direction. The strange cough
      sounded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SAY!&rdquo; Penrod quavered. &ldquo;What IS that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then both boys uttered smothered exclamations and jumped, for the long,
      gaunt head that appeared in the doorway was entirely unexpected. It was
      the cavernous and melancholy head of an incredibly thin, old, whitish
      horse. This head waggled slowly from side to side; the nostrils vibrated;
      the mouth opened, and the hollow cough sounded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering themselves, Penrod and Sam underwent the customary human
      reaction from alarm to indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you want, you ole horse, you?&rdquo; Penrod shouted. &ldquo;Don't you come
      coughin' around ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Sam, seizing a stick, hurled it at the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out o' here!&rdquo; he roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aged horse nervously withdrew his head, turned tail, and made a
      rickety flight up the alley, while Sam and Penrod, perfectly obedient to
      inherited impulse, ran out into the drizzle and uproariously pursued. They
      were but automatons of instinct, meaning no evil. Certainly they did not
      know the singular and pathetic history of the old horse who wandered into
      the alley and ventured to look through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      This horse, about twice the age of either Penrod or Sam, had lived to find
      himself in a unique position. He was nude, possessing neither harness nor
      halter; all he had was a name, Whitey, and he would have answered to it by
      a slight change of expression if any one had thus properly addressed him.
      So forlorn was Whitey's case, he was actually an independent horse; he had
      not even an owner. For two days and a half he had been his own master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous to that period he had been the property of one Abalene Morris, a
      person of colour, who would have explained himself as engaged in the
      hauling business. On the contrary, the hauling business was an
      insignificant side line with Mr. Morris, for he had long ago given
      himself, as utterly as fortune permitted, to the talent that early in
      youth he had recognized as the greatest of all those surging in his bosom.
      In his waking thoughts and in his dreams, in health and in sickness,
      Abalene Morris was the dashing and emotional practitioner of an art
      probably more than Roman in antiquity. Abalene was a crap-shooter. The
      hauling business was a disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A concentration of events had brought it about that, at one and the same
      time, Abalene, after a dazzling run of the dice, found the hauling
      business an actual danger to the preservation of his liberty. He won
      seventeen dollars and sixty cents, and within the hour found himself in
      trouble with an officer of the Humane Society on account of an altercation
      with Whitey. Abalene had been offered four dollars for Whitey some ten
      days earlier; wherefore he at once drove to the shop of the junk-dealer
      who had made the offer and announced his acquiescence in the sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, suh!&rdquo; the junk-dealer said, with emphasis, &ldquo;I awready done got me a
      good mule fer my deliv'ry hoss, 'n'at ole Whitey hoss ain' wuff no fo'
      dollah nohow! I 'uz a fool when I talk 'bout th'owin' money roun' that
      a-way. <i>I</i> know what YOU up to, Abalene. Man come by here li'l bit
      ago tole me all 'bout white man try to 'rest you, ovah on the avvynoo.
      Yessuh; he say white man goin' to git you yit an' th'ow you in jail 'count
      o' Whitey. White man tryin' to fine out who you IS. He say, nemmine, he'll
      know Whitey ag'in, even if he don' know you! He say he ketch you by the
      hoss; so you come roun' tryin' fix me up with Whitey so white man grab me,
      th'ow ME in 'at jail. G'on 'way f'um hyuh, you Abalene! You cain' sell an'
      you cain' give Whitey to no cullud man 'n 'is town. You go an' drowned 'at
      ole hoss, 'cause you sutny goin' to jail if you git ketched drivin' him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The substance of this advice seemed good to Abalene, especially as the
      seventeen dollars and sixty cents in his pocket lent sweet colours to life
      out of jail at this time. At dusk he led Whitey to a broad common at the
      edge of town, and spoke to him finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G'on 'bout you biz'nis,&rdquo; said Abalene; &ldquo;you ain' MY hoss. Don' look
      roun'at me, 'cause <i>I</i> ain't got no 'quaintance wif you. I'm a man o'
      money, an' I got my own frien's; I'm a-lookin' fer bigger cities, hoss.
      You got you biz'nis an' I got mine. Mista' Hoss, good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whitey found a little frosted grass upon the common and remained there all
      night. In the morning he sought the shed where Abalene had kept him; but
      that was across the large and busy town, and Whitey was hopelessly lost.
      He had but one eye, a feeble one, and his legs were not to be depended
      upon; but he managed to cover a great deal of ground, to have many painful
      little adventures, and to get monstrously hungry and thirsty before he
      happened to look in upon Penrod and Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two boys chased him up the alley they had no intention to cause
      pain; they had no intention at all. They were no more cruel than Duke,
      Penrod's little old dog, who followed his own instincts, and, making his
      appearance hastily through a hole in the back fence, joined the pursuit
      with sound and fury. A boy will nearly always run after anything that is
      running, and his first impulse is to throw a stone at it. This is a
      survival of primeval man, who must take every chance to get his dinner.
      So, when Penrod and Sam drove the hapless Whitey up the alley, they were
      really responding to an impulse thousands and thousands of years old&mdash;an
      impulse founded upon the primordial observation that whatever runs is
      likely to prove edible. Penrod and Sam were not &ldquo;bad&rdquo;; they were never
      that. They were something that was not their fault; they were historic.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next corner Whitey turned to the right into the cross-street;
      thence, turning to the right again and still warmly pursued, he zigzagged
      down a main thoroughfare until he reached another cross-street, which ran
      alongside the Schofields' yard and brought him to the foot of the alley he
      had left behind in his flight. He entered the alley, and there his dim eye
      fell upon the open door he had previously investigated. No memory of it
      remained; but the place had a look associated in his mind with hay, and,
      as Sam and Penrod turned the corner of the alley in panting yet still
      vociferous pursuit, Whitey stumbled up the inclined platform before the
      open doors, staggered thunderously across the carriage-house and through
      another open door into a stall, an apartment vacant since the occupancy of
      Mr. Schofield's last horse, now several years deceased.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. SALVAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two boys shrieked with excitement as they beheld the coincidence of
      this strange return. They burst into the stable, making almost as much
      noise as Duke, who had become frantic at the invasion. Sam laid hands upon
      a rake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get out o' there, you ole horse, you!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;I ain't afraid
      to drive him out. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WAIT a minute!&rdquo; Penrod shouted. &ldquo;Wait till I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was manfully preparing to enter the stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold the doors open,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;so's they won't blow shut and
      keep him in here. I'm goin' to hit him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quee-YUT!&rdquo; Penrod shouted, grasping the handle of the rake so that Sam
      could not use it. &ldquo;Wait a MINUTE, can't you?&rdquo; He turned with ferocious
      voice and gestures upon Duke. &ldquo;DUKE!&rdquo; And Duke, in spite of his
      excitement, was so impressed that he prostrated himself in silence, and
      then unobtrusively withdrew from the stable. Penrod ran to the alley doors
      and closed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo; Sam protested. &ldquo;What you goin' to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to keep this horse,&rdquo; said Penrod, whose face showed the strain
      of a great idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What FOR?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the reward,&rdquo; said Penrod simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam sat down in the wheelbarrow and stared at his friend almost with awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never thought o' that! How&mdash;how much do
      you think we'll get, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam's thus admitting himself to a full partnership in the enterprise met
      no objection from Penrod, who was absorbed in the contemplation of Whitey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said judicially, &ldquo;we might get more and we might get less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam rose and joined his friend in the doorway opening upon the two stalls.
      Whitey had preempted the nearer, and was hungrily nuzzling the old frayed
      hollows in the manger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe a hunderd dollars&mdash;or sumpthing?&rdquo; Sam asked in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod maintained his composure and repeated the newfound expression that
      had sounded well to him a moment before. He recognized it as a symbol of
      the non&mdash;committal attitude that makes people looked up to. &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;he
      made it slow, and frowned&mdash;&ldquo;we might get more and we might get less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More'n a hunderd DOLLARS?&rdquo; Sam gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod, &ldquo;we might get more and we might get less.&rdquo; This time,
      however, he felt the need of adding something. He put a question in an
      indulgent tone, as though he were inquiring, not to add to his own
      information but to discover the extent of Sam's. &ldquo;How much do you think
      horses are worth, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Sam said frankly, and, unconsciously, he added, &ldquo;They
      might be more and they might be less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when our ole horse died,&rdquo; Penrod said, &ldquo;Papa said he wouldn't taken
      five hunderd dollars for him. That's how much HORSES are worth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo; Sam exclaimed. Then he had a practical afterthought. &ldquo;But
      maybe he was a better horse than this'n. What colour was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was bay. Looky here, Sam&rdquo;&mdash;and now Penrod's manner changed from
      the superior to the eager&mdash;&ldquo;you look what kind of horses they have in
      a circus, and you bet a circus has the BEST horses, don't it? Well, what
      kind of horses do they have in a circus? They have some black and white
      ones; but the best they have are white all over. Well, what kind of a
      horse is this we got here? He's perty near white right now, and I bet if
      we washed him off and got him fixed up nice he WOULD be white. Well, a bay
      horse is worth five hunderd dollars, because that's what Papa said, and
      this horse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam interrupted rather timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he's awful bony, Penrod. You don't guess they'd make any&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod laughed contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bony! All he needs is a little food and he'll fill right up and look good
      as ever. You don't know much about horses, Sam, I expect. Why, OUR ole
      horse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect he's hungry now?&rdquo; asked Sam, staring at Whitey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's try him,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Horses like hay and oats the best; but
      they'll eat most anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they will. He's tryin' to eat that manger up right now, and I bet
      it ain't good for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Penrod, closing the door that gave entrance to the stalls.
      &ldquo;We got to get this horse some drinkin'-water and some good food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They tried Whitey's appetite first with an autumnal branch that they
      wrenched from a hardy maple in the yard. They had seen horses nibble
      leaves, and they expected Whitey to nibble the leaves of this branch; but
      his ravenous condition did not allow him time for cool discriminations.
      Sam poked the branch at him from the passageway, and Whitey, after one
      backward movement of alarm, seized it venomously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! You stop that!&rdquo; Sam shouted. &ldquo;You stop that, you ole horse, you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; called Penrod from the hydrant, where he was filling
      a bucket. &ldquo;What's he doin' now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doin'! He's eatin' the wood part, too! He's chewin' up sticks as big as
      baseball bats! He's crazy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod rushed to see this sight, and stood aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it away from him, Sam!&rdquo; he commanded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, take it away from him yourself!&rdquo; was the prompt retort of his
      comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no biz'nuss to give it to him,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Anybody with any
      sense ought to know it'd make him sick. What'd you want to go and give it
      to him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you didn't say not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if I didn't? I never said I did, did I? You go on in that
      stall and take it away from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YES, I will!&rdquo; Sam returned bitterly. Then, as Whitey had dragged the
      remains of the branch from the manger to the floor of the stall, Sam
      scrambled to the top of the manger and looked over. &ldquo;There ain't much left
      to TAKE away! He's swallered it all except some splinters. Better give him
      the water to try and wash it down with.&rdquo; And, as Penrod complied, &ldquo;My
      gracious, look at that horse DRINK!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They gave Whitey four buckets of water, and then debated the question of
      nourishment. Obviously, this horse could not be trusted with branches,
      and, after getting their knees black and their backs sodden, they gave up
      trying to pull enough grass to sustain him. Then Penrod remembered that
      horses like apples, both &ldquo;cooking-apples&rdquo; and &ldquo;eating-apples&rdquo;, and Sam
      mentioned the fact that every autumn his father received a barrel of
      &ldquo;cooking-apples&rdquo; from a cousin who owned a farm. That barrel was in the
      Williams' cellar now, and the cellar was providentially supplied with
      &ldquo;outside doors,&rdquo; so that it could be visited without going through the
      house. Sam and Penrod set forth for the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the stable bulging, and, after a discussion of Whitey's
      digestion (Sam claiming that eating the core and seeds, as Whitey did,
      would grow trees in his inside) they went back to the cellar for supplies
      again&mdash;and again. They made six trips, carrying each time a capacity
      cargo of apples, and still Whitey ate in a famished manner. They were
      afraid to take more apples from the barrel, which began to show
      conspicuously the result of their raids, wherefore Penrod made an
      unostentatious visit to the cellar of his own house. From the inside he
      opened a window and passed vegetables out to Sam, who placed them in a
      bucket and carried them hurriedly to the stable, while Penrod returned in
      a casual manner through the house. Of his sang-froid under a great strain
      it is sufficient to relate that, in the kitchen, he said suddenly to
      Della, the cook, &ldquo;Oh, look behind you!&rdquo; and by the time Della discovered
      that there was nothing unusual behind her, Penrod was gone, and a loaf of
      bread from the kitchen table was gone with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitey now ate nine turnips, two heads of lettuce, one cabbage, eleven raw
      potatoes and the loaf of bread. He ate the loaf of bread last and he was a
      long time about it; so the boys came to a not unreasonable conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I guess we got him filled up at last!&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;I bet he
      wouldn't eat a saucer of ice-cream now, if we'd give it to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks better to me,&rdquo; said Sam, staring critically at Whitey. &ldquo;I think
      he's kind of begun to fill out some. I expect he must like us, Penrod; we
      been doin' a good deal for this horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we got to keep it up,&rdquo; Penrod insisted rather pompously. &ldquo;Long as
      <i>I</i> got charge o' this horse, he's goin' to get good treatment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we better do now, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod took on the outward signs of deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's plenty to DO, all right. I got to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam made several suggestions, which Penrod&mdash;maintaining his air of
      preoccupation&mdash;dismissed with mere gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> know!&rdquo; Sam cried finally. &ldquo;We ought to wash him so's he'll
      look whiter'n what he does now. We can turn the hose on him across the
      manger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not yet,&rdquo; Penrod said. &ldquo;It's too soon after his meal. You ought to
      know that yourself. What we got to do is to make up a bed for him&mdash;if
      he wants to lay down or anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make up a what for him?&rdquo; Sam echoed, dumfounded. &ldquo;What you talkin' about?
      How can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sawdust,&rdquo; Penrod said. &ldquo;That's the way the horse we used to have used to
      have it. We'll make this horse's bed in the other stall, and then he can
      go in there and lay down whenever he wants to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How we goin' to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Sam; there's the hole into the sawdust-box! All you got to do is
      walk in there with the shovel, stick the shovel in the hole till it gets
      full of sawdust, and then sprinkle it around on the empty stall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All <i>I</i> got to do!&rdquo; Sam cried. &ldquo;What are you goin' to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to be right here,&rdquo; Penrod answered reassuringly. &ldquo;He won't kick
      or anything, and it isn't goin' to take you half a second to slip around
      behind him to the other stall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think he won't kick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I KNOW he won't, and, besides, you could hit him with the shovel if
      he tried to. Anyhow, I'll be right here, won't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care where you are,&rdquo; Sam said earnestly. &ldquo;What difference would
      that make if he ki&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you were goin' right in the stall,&rdquo; Penrod reminded him. &ldquo;When he
      first came in, you were goin' to take the rake and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care if I was,&rdquo; Sam declared. &ldquo;I was excited then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can get excited now, can't you?&rdquo; his friend urged. &ldquo;You can
      just as easy get&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a shout from Sam, who was keeping his eye upon
      Whitey throughout the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! Looky there!&rdquo; And undoubtedly renewing his excitement, Sam pointed
      at the long, gaunt head beyond the manger. It was disappearing from view.
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Sam shouted. &ldquo;He's layin' down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Penrod, &ldquo;I guess he's goin' to take a nap. If he wants
      to lay down without waitin' for us to get the sawdust fixed for him,
      that's his lookout, not ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, Sam perceived a favourable opportunity for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just as soon go and make his bed up while he's layin' down,&rdquo; he
      volunteered. &ldquo;You climb up on the manger and watch him, Penrod, and I'll
      sneak in the other stall and fix it all up nice for him, so's he can go in
      there any time when he wakes up, and lay down again, or anything; and if
      he starts to get up, you holler and I'll jump out over the other manger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Penrod established himself in a position to observe the
      recumbent figure. Whitey's breathing was rather laboured but regular, and,
      as Sam remarked, he looked &ldquo;better&rdquo;, even in his slumber. It is not to be
      doubted that although Whitey was suffering from a light attack of colic
      his feelings were in the main those of contentment. After trouble, he was
      solaced; after exposure, he was sheltered; after hunger and thirst, he was
      fed and watered. He slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noon whistles blew before Sam's task was finished; but by the time he
      departed for lunch there was made a bed of such quality that Whitey must
      needs have been a born fault-finder if he complained of it. The friends
      parted, each urging the other to be prompt in returning; but Penrod got
      into threatening difficulties as soon as he entered the house.

      CHAPTER IX. REWARD OF MERIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;what did you do with that loaf of bread Della
      says you took from the table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am? WHAT loaf o' bread?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I can't let you go outdoors this afternoon,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield
      said severely. &ldquo;If you were hungry, you know perfectly well all you had to
      do was to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wasn't hungry; I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can explain later,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield said. &ldquo;You'll have all afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's heart grew cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I CAN'T stay in,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I've asked Sam Williams to come over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll telephone Mrs. Williams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; Penrod's voice became agonized. &ldquo;I HAD to give that bread to a&mdash;to
      a poor ole man. He was starving and so were his children and his wife.
      They were all just STARVING&mdash;and they couldn't wait while I took time
      to come and ask you, Mamma. I got to GO outdoors this afternoon. I GOT to!
      Sam's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She relented.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the carriage-house, half an hour later, Penrod gave an account of the
      episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where'd we been, I'd just like to know,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;if I hadn't got
      out here this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I could managed him all right,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;I was in the
      passageway, a minute ago, takin' a look at him. He's standin' up again. I
      expect he wants more to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we got to fix about that,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;But what I mean&mdash;if
      I'd had to stay in the house, where would we been about the most important
      thing in the whole biz'nuss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you talkin' about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why can't you wait till I tell you?&rdquo; Penrod's tone had become
      peevish. For that matter, so had Sam's; they were developing one of the
      little differences, or quarrels, that composed the very texture of their
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you tell me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how can I?&rdquo; Penrod demanded. &ldquo;You keep talkin' every minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not talkin' NOW, am I?&rdquo; Sam protested. &ldquo;You can tell me NOW, can't
      you? I'm not talk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, too!&rdquo; Penrod shouted. &ldquo;You talk all the time! You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by Whitey's peculiar cough. Both boys jumped and forgot
      their argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means he wants some more to eat, I bet,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he does, he's got to wait,&rdquo; Penrod declared. &ldquo;We got to get the
      most important thing of all fixed up first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reward,&rdquo; said Penrod mildly. &ldquo;That's what I was tryin' to tell you
      about, Sam, if you'd ever give me half a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I DID give you a chance. I kept TELLIN' you to tell me, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never! You kept sayin'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They renewed this discussion, protracting it indefinitely; but as each
      persisted in clinging to his own interpretation of the facts, the question
      still remains unsettled. It was abandoned, or rather, it merged into
      another during the later stages of the debate, this other being concerned
      with which of the debaters had the least &ldquo;sense.&rdquo; Each made the plain
      statement that if he were more deficient than his opponent in that regard,
      self-destruction would be his only refuge. Each declared that he would
      &ldquo;rather die than be talked to death&rdquo;; and then, as the two approached a
      point bluntly recriminative, Whitey coughed again, whereupon they were
      miraculously silent, and went into the passageway in a perfectly amiable
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got to have a good look at him, for once,&rdquo; Penrod said, as he stared
      frowningly at Whitey. &ldquo;We got to fix up about that reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to take a good ole look at him myself,&rdquo; Sam said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supplying Whitey with another bucket of water, they returned to the
      carriage-house and seated themselves thoughtfully. In truth, they were
      something a shade more than thoughtful; the adventure to which they had
      committed themselves was beginning to be a little overpowering. If Whitey
      had been a dog, a goat, a fowl, or even a stray calf, they would have felt
      equal to him; but now that the earlier glow of their wild daring had
      disappeared, vague apprehensions stirred. Their &ldquo;good look&rdquo; at Whitey had
      not reassured them&mdash;he seemed large, Gothic and unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whisperings within them began to urge that for boys to undertake an
      enterprise connected with so huge an animal as an actual horse was
      perilous. Beneath the surface of their musings, dim but ominous prophecies
      moved; both boys began to have the feeling that, somehow, this affair was
      going to get beyond them and that they would be in heavy trouble before it
      was over&mdash;they knew not why. They knew why no more than they knew why
      they felt it imperative to keep the fact of Whitey's presence in the
      stable a secret from their respective families; but they did begin to
      realize that keeping a secret of that size was going to be attended with
      some difficulty. In brief, their sensations were becoming comparable to
      those of the man who stole a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, after a short period given to unspoken misgivings, they
      returned to the subject of the reward. The money-value of bay horses, as
      compared to white, was again discussed, and each announced his certainty
      that nothing less than &ldquo;a good ole hunderd dollars&rdquo; would be offered for
      the return of Whitey.
    </p>
    <p>
      But immediately after so speaking they fell into another silence, due to
      sinking feelings. They had spoken loudly and confidently, and yet they
      knew, somehow, that such things were not to be. According to their
      knowledge, it was perfectly reasonable to suppose that they would receive
      this fortune; but they frightened themselves in speaking of it. They knew
      that they COULD not have a hundred dollars for their own. An oppression,
      as from something awful and criminal, descended upon them at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, they were warmed to a little cheerfulness again by
      Penrod's suggestion that they should put a notice in the paper. Neither of
      them had the slightest idea how to get it there; but such details as that
      were beyond the horizon; they occupied themselves with the question of
      what their advertisement ought to &ldquo;say&rdquo;. Finding that they differed
      irreconcilably, Penrod went to his cache in the sawdust-box and brought
      two pencils and a supply of paper. He gave one of the pencils and several
      sheets to Sam; then both boys bent themselves in silence to the labour of
      practical composition. Penrod produced the briefer paragraph. (See Fig.
      I.) Sam's was more ample. (See Fig. II.) &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;[Transcribed

    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Sam nor Penrod showed any interest in what the other had written;
      but both felt that something praiseworthy had been accomplished. Penrod
      exhaled a sigh, as of relief, and, in a manner he had observed his father
      use sometimes, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness, THAT'S off my mind, anyway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we goin' do next, Penrod?&rdquo; Sam asked deferentially, the borrowed
      manner having some effect upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what YOU'RE goin' to do,&rdquo; Penrod returned, picking up the
      old cigarbox that had contained the paper and pencils. &ldquo;I'M goin' to put
      mine in here, so's it'll come in handy when I haf to get at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I'll keep mine there, too,&rdquo; Sam said. Thereupon he
      deposited his scribbled slip beside Penrod's in the cigarbox, and the box
      was solemnly returned to the secret place whence it had been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, THAT'S 'tended to!&rdquo; Sam said, and, unconsciously imitating his
      friend's imitation, he gave forth audibly a breath of satisfaction and
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both boys felt that the financial side of their great affair had been
      conscientiously looked to, that the question of the reward was settled,
      and that everything was proceeding in a businesslike manner. Therefore,
      they were able to turn their attention to another matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the question of Whitey's next meal. After their exploits of the
      morning, and the consequent imperilment of Penrod, they decided that
      nothing more was to be done in apples, vegetables or bread; it was evident
      that Whitey must be fed from the bosom of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn't pull enough o' that frostbit ole grass in the yard to feed
      him,&rdquo; Penrod said gloomily. &ldquo;We could work a week and not get enough to
      make him swaller more'n about twice. All we got this morning, he blew most
      of it away. He'd try to scoop it in toward his teeth with his lip, and
      then he'd haf to kind of blow out his breath, and after that all the grass
      that'd be left was just some wet pieces stickin' to the outsides of his
      face. Well, and you know how he acted about that maple branch. We can't
      trust him with branches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> know!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There's lots of leaves left on the branches.
      We can give them to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean the branches,&rdquo; Sam explained. &ldquo;We'll leave the branches on
      the trees, but just pull the leaves off the branches and put 'em in the
      bucket and feed 'em to him out of the bucket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod thought this plan worth trying, and for three-quarters of an hour
      the two boys were busy with the lower branches of various trees in the
      yard. Thus they managed to supply Whitey with a fair quantity of wet
      leaves, which he ate in a perfunctory way, displaying little of his
      earlier enthusiasm. And the work of his purveyors might have been more
      tedious if it had been less damp, for a boy is seldom bored by anything
      that involves his staying-out in the rain without protection. The drizzle
      had thickened; the leaves were heavy with water, and at every jerk the
      branches sent fat drops over the two collectors. They attained a
      noteworthy state of sogginess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, they were brought to the attention of the authorities indoors,
      and Della appeared upon the back porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musther Penrod,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;y'r mamma says ye'll c'm in the house this
      minute an' change y'r shoes an' stockin's an' everythun' else ye got on!
      D'ye hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, taken by surprise and unpleasantly alarmed, darted away from the
      tree he was depleting and ran for the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell her I'm dry as toast!&rdquo; he shouted over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Della withdrew, wearing the air of a person gratuitously insulted; and a
      moment later she issued from the kitchen, carrying an umbrella. She opened
      it and walked resolutely to the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says I'm to bring ye in the house,&rdquo; said Della, &ldquo;an' I'm goin' to
      bring ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam had joined Penrod in the carriage-house, and, with the beginnings of
      an unnamed terror, the two beheld this grim advance. But they did not stay
      for its culmination. Without a word to each other they hurriedly tiptoed
      up the stairs to the gloomy loft, and there they paused, listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard Della's steps upon the carriage-house floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there's plenty places t'hide in,&rdquo; they heard her say; &ldquo;but I'll show
      ye! She tole me to bring ye, and I'm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by a peculiar sound&mdash;loud, chilling, dismal, and
      unmistakably not of human origin. The boys knew it for Whitey's cough; but
      Della had not their experience. A smothered shriek reached their ears;
      there was a scurrying noise, and then, with horror, they heard Della's
      footsteps in the passageway that ran by Whitey's manger. Immediately there
      came a louder shriek, and even in the anguish of knowing their secret
      discovered, they were shocked to hear distinctly the words, &ldquo;O Lard in
      hivvin!&rdquo; in the well-known voice of Della. She shrieked again, and they
      heard the rush of her footfalls across the carriage-house floor. Wild
      words came from the outer air, and the kitchen door slammed violently. It
      was all over. She had gone to &ldquo;tell&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod and Sam plunged down the stairs and out of the stable. They climbed
      the back fence and fled up the alley. They turned into Sam's yard, and,
      without consultation, headed for the cellar doors, nor paused till they
      found themselves in the farthest, darkest and gloomiest recess of the
      cellar. There, perspiring, stricken with fear, they sank down upon the
      earthen floor, with their moist backs against the stone wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus with boys. The vague apprehensions that had been creeping upon Penrod
      and Sam all afternoon had become monstrous; the unknown was before them.
      How great their crime would turn out to be (now that it was in the hands
      of grown people) they did not know; but, since it concerned a horse, it
      would undoubtedly be considered of terrible dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their plans for a reward, and all the things that had seemed both innocent
      and practical in the morning, now staggered their minds as manifestations
      of criminal folly. A new and terrible light seemed to play upon the day's
      exploits; they had chased a horse belonging to strangers, and it would be
      said that they deliberately drove him into the stable and there concealed
      him. They had, in truth, virtually stolen him, and they had stolen food
      for him. The waning light through the small window above them warned
      Penrod that his inroads upon the vegetables in his own cellar must soon be
      discovered. Della, that Nemesis, would seek them in order to prepare them
      for dinner, and she would find them not. But she would recall his
      excursion to the cellar, for she had seen him when he came up; and also
      the truth would be known concerning the loaf of bread. Altogether, Penrod
      felt that his case was worse than Sam's&mdash;until Sam offered a
      suggestion that roused such horrible possibilities concerning the
      principal item of their offense that all thought of the smaller
      indictments disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Penrod,&rdquo; Sam quavered: &ldquo;What&mdash;what if that&mdash;what if
      that ole horse maybe b'longed to a&mdash;policeman!&rdquo; Sam's imagination was
      not of the comforting kind. &ldquo;What'd they&mdash;do to us, Penrod, if it
      turned out he was some policeman's horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was able only to shake his head. He did not reply in words; but
      both boys thenceforth considered it almost inevitable that Whitey had
      belonged to a policeman, and, in their sense of so ultimate a disaster,
      they ceased for a time to brood upon what their parents would probably do
      to them. The penalty for stealing a policeman's horse would be only a step
      short of capital, they were sure. They would not be hanged; but vague,
      looming sketches of something called the penitentiary began to flicker
      before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew darker in the cellar, so that finally they could not see each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they're huntin' for us by now,&rdquo; Sam said huskily. &ldquo;I don't&mdash;I
      don't like it much down here, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's hoarse whisper came from the profound gloom: &ldquo;Well, who ever said
      you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Sam paused; then he said plaintively, &ldquo;I wish we'd never
      SEEN that dern ole horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was every bit his fault,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;We didn't do anything. If he
      hadn't come stickin' his ole head in our stable, it'd never happened at
      all. Ole fool!&rdquo; He rose. &ldquo;I'm goin' to get out of here; I guess I've stood
      about enough for one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where you goin', Penrod? You aren't goin' HOME, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I'm not! What you take me for? You think I'm crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where CAN we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How far Penrod's desperation actually would have led him is doubtful; but
      he made this statement: &ldquo;I don't know where YOU'RE goin', but I'M goin' to
      walk straight out in the country till I come to a farmhouse and say my
      name's George and live there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it, too,&rdquo; Sam whispered eagerly. &ldquo;I'll say my name's Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we better get started,&rdquo; said the executive Penrod. &ldquo;We got to get
      away from here, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when they came to ascend the steps leading to the &ldquo;outside doors&rdquo;,
      they found that those doors had been closed and locked for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use,&rdquo; Sam lamented, &ldquo;and we can't bust 'em, cause I tried to,
      once before. Fanny always locks 'em about five o'clock&mdash;I forgot. We
      got to go up the stairway and try to sneak out through the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They tiptoed back, and up the inner stairs. They paused at the top, then
      breathlessly stepped out into a hall that was entirely dark. Sam touched
      Penrod's sleeve in warning and bent to listen at a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately that door opened, revealing the bright library, where sat
      Penrod's mother and Sam's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sam's mother who had opened the door. &ldquo;Come into the library,
      boys,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mrs. Schofield is just telling us about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as the two comrades moved dumbly into the lighted room, Penrod's
      mother rose, and, taking him by the shoulder, urged him close to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stand there and try to dry off a little, while I finish telling Mr.
      and Mrs. Williams about you and Sam,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You'd better make Sam
      keep near the fire, too, Mrs. Williams, because they both got wringing
      wet. Think of their running off just when most people would have wanted to
      stay! Well, I'll go on with the story, then. Della told me all about it,
      and what the cook next door said SHE'D seen, how they'd been trying to
      pull grass and leaves for the poor old thing all day&mdash;and all about
      the apples they carried from YOUR cellar, and getting wet and working in
      the rain as hard as they could&mdash;and they'd given him a loaf of bread!
      Shame on you, Penrod!&rdquo; She paused to laugh; but there was a little
      moisture about her eyes, even before she laughed. &ldquo;And they'd fed him on
      potatoes and lettuce and cabbage and turnips out of OUR cellar! And I wish
      you'd see the sawdust bed they made for him! Well, when I'd telephoned,
      and the Humane Society man got there, he said it was the most touching
      thing he ever knew. It seems he KNEW this horse, and had been looking for
      him. He said ninety-nine boys out of a hundred would have chased the poor
      old thing away, and he was going to see to it that this case didn't go
      unnoticed, because the local branch of the society gives little silver
      medals for special acts like this. And the last thing he said was that he
      was sure Penrod and Sam each would be awarded one at the meeting of the
      society next Thursday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ... On the following Saturday a yodel sounded from the sunny sidewalk in
      front of the Schofields' house, and Penrod, issuing forth, beheld the
      familiar figure of Samuel Williams waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon Sam's breast there glittered a round bit of silver suspended by a
      white ribbon from a bar of the same metal. Upon the breast of Penrod was a
      decoration precisely similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lo, Penrod,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;What are you goin' to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got mine on,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, too,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;I wouldn't take a hunderd dollars for mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't take two hunderd for mine,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each glanced pleasantly at the other's medal. They faced each other
      without shame. Neither had the slightest sense of hypocrisy in himself or
      in his comrade. On the contrary!
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's eyes went from Sam's medal back to his own; thence they wandered,
      with perhaps a little disappointment, to the lifeless street and to the
      empty yards and spectatorless windows of the neighbourhood. Then he looked
      southward toward the busy heart of the town, where multitudes were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go down and see what time it is by the court-house-clock,&rdquo; said
      Penrod.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. CONSCIENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield had been away for three days, visiting her sister in
      Dayton, Illinois, and on the train, coming back, she fell into a reverie.
      Little dramas of memory were reenacted in her pensive mind, and through
      all of them moved the figure of Penrod as a principal figure, or star.
      These little dramas did not present Penrod as he really was, much less did
      they glow with the uncertain but glamorous light in which Penrod saw
      himself. No; Mrs. Schofield had indulged herself in absence from her
      family merely for her own pleasure, and, now that she was homeward bound,
      her conscience was asserting itself; the fact that she had enjoyed her
      visit began to take on the aspect of a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had heard from her family only once during the three days&mdash;the
      message &ldquo;All well don't worry enjoy yourself&rdquo; telegraphed by Mr.
      Schofield, and she had followed his suggestions to a reasonable extent. Of
      course she had worried&mdash;but only at times; wherefore she now suffered
      more and more poignant pangs of shame because she had not worried
      constantly. Naturally, the figure of Penrod, in her railway reverie, was
      that of an invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recalled all the illnesses of his babyhood and all those of his
      boyhood. She reconstructed scene after scene, with the hero always
      prostrate and the family physician opening the black case of phials. She
      emphatically renewed her recollection of accidental misfortunes to the
      body of Penrod Schofield, omitting neither the considerable nor the
      inconsiderable, forgetting no strain, sprain, cut, bruise or dislocation
      of which she had knowledge. And running this film in a sequence unrelieved
      by brighter interludes, she produced a biographical picture of such
      consistent and unremittent gloom that Penrod's past appeared to justify
      disturbing thoughts about his present and future.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became less and less at ease, reproaching herself for having gone
      away, wondering how she had brought herself to do such a crazy thing, for
      it seemed to her that the members of her family were almost helpless
      without her guidance; they were apt to do anything&mdash;anything at all&mdash;or
      to catch anything. The more she thought about her having left these
      irresponsible harebrains unprotected and undirected for three days, the
      less she was able to account for her action. It seemed to her that she
      must have been a little flighty; but, shaking her head grimly, she decided
      that flightiness was not a good excuse. And she made up her mind that if,
      upon her arrival, she found poor little neglected Penrod (and Margaret and
      Mr. Schofield) spared to her, safe and sound, she would make up to them&mdash;especially
      to Penrod&mdash;for all her lack of care in the past, and for this present
      wild folly of spending three whole days and nights with her sister, far
      away in Dayton, Illinois. Consequently, when Mrs. Schofield descended from
      that train, she wore the hurried but determined expression that was always
      the effect upon her of a guilty conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're SURE Penrod is well now?&rdquo; she repeated, after Mr. Schofield had
      seated himself at her side in a vehicle known to its driver as a &ldquo;deepoe
      hack&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well NOW?'&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He's been well all the time. I've told you twice
      that he's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men can't always see.&rdquo; She shook her head impatiently. &ldquo;I haven't been a
      bit sure he was well lately. I don't think he's been really well for two
      or three months. How has he seemed to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fair health,&rdquo; Mr. Schofield replied thoughtfully. &ldquo;Della called me up
      at the office to tell me that one of the telephone-men had come into the
      house to say that if that durn boy didn't quit climbing their poles they'd
      have him arrested. They said he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield interrupted quickly. &ldquo;He's nervous. It's some
      nervous trouble makes him act like that. He's not like himself at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Mr. Schofield said, &ldquo;I wish he weren't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he's himself,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield went on anxiously, &ldquo;he's very quiet
      and good; he doesn't go climbing telegraph-poles and reckless things like
      that. And I noticed before I went away that he was growing twitchy, and
      seemed to be getting the habit of making unpleasant little noises in his
      throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't fret about that,&rdquo; her husband said. &ldquo;He was trying to learn Sam
      Williams's imitation of a bullfrog's croak. I used to do that myself when
      I was a boy. Gl-glump, gallump! No; I can't do it now. But nearly all boys
      feel obliged to learn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're entirely mistaken, Henry,&rdquo; she returned a little sharply. &ldquo;That
      isn't the way he goes in his throat. Penrod is getting to be a VERY
      nervous boy, and he makes noises because he can't help it. He works part
      of his face, too, sometimes, so much that I've been afraid it would
      interfere with his looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interfere with his what?&rdquo; For the moment, Mr. Schofield seemed to be
      dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he's himself,&rdquo; she returned crisply, &ldquo;he's quite a handsome boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsomer than the average, anyhow,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield said firmly. &ldquo;No
      wonder you don't see it&mdash;when we've let his system get all run down
      like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; the mystified Mr. Schofield murmured. &ldquo;Penrod's system
      hasn't been running down; it's just the same as it always was. He's
      absolutely all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed he is not!&rdquo; she said severely. &ldquo;We've got to take better care of
      him than we have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how could&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I'm talking about,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Penrod is anything but
      a strong boy, and it's all our fault. We haven't been watchful enough of
      his health; that's what's the matter with him and makes him so nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus she continued, and, as she talked on, Mr. Schofield began, by
      imperceptible processes, to adopt her views. As for Mrs. Schofield
      herself, these views became substantial by becoming vocal. This is to say,
      with all deference, that as soon as she heard herself stating them she was
      convinced that they accurately represented facts. And the determined look
      in her eyes deepened when the &ldquo;deepoe hack&rdquo; turned the familiar corner and
      she saw Penrod running to the gate, followed by Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Penrod been so glad to greet his mother. Never was he more
      boisterous in the expression of happiness of that kind. And the tokens of
      his appetite at dinner, a little later, were extraordinary. Mr. Schofield
      began to feel reassured in spite of himself; but Mrs. Schofield shook her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see? It's abnormal!&rdquo; she said, in a low, decisive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Penrod awoke from a sweet, conscienceless slumber&mdash;or,
      rather, he was awakened. A wrappered form lurked over him in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uff&mdash;ow&mdash;&rdquo; he muttered, and turned his face from the dim light
      that shone through the doorway. He sighed and sought the depths of sleep
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; his mother said softly, and, while he resisted feebly, she
      turned him over to face her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawn lea' me 'lone,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as a little sphere touched his lips, he jerked his head away,
      startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whassat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield replied in tones honeysweet and coaxing: &ldquo;It's just a nice
      little pill, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doe waw 'ny!&rdquo; he protested, keeping his eyes shut, clinging to the sleep
      from which he was being riven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a good boy, Penrod,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Here's a glass of nice cool water
      to swallow it down with. Come, dear; it's going to do you lots of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again the little pill was placed suggestively against his lips; but
      his head jerked backward, and his hand struck out in blind, instinctive
      self-defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll BUST that ole pill,&rdquo; he muttered, still with closed eyes. &ldquo;Lemme get
      my han's on it an' I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PLEASE go on away, mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, just as soon as you take this little pill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DID!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Penrod insisted plaintively. &ldquo;You made me take it just before I
      went to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; THAT one. But, dearie,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield explained, &ldquo;I got to
      thinking about it after I went to bed, and I decided you'd better have
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't WANT another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go 'way and let me sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till you've taken the little pill, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, GOLLY!&rdquo; Groaning, he propped himself upon an elbow and allowed the
      pill to pass between his lips. (He would have allowed anything whatever to
      pass between them, if that passing permitted his return to slumber.) Then,
      detaining the pill in his mouth, he swallowed half a glass of water, and
      again was recumbent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G'-night, Mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, dearie. Sleep well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After her departure Penrod drowsily enjoyed the sugar coating of the pill;
      but this was indeed a brief pleasure. A bitterness that was like a pang
      suddenly made itself known to his sense of taste, and he realized that he
      had dallied too confidingly with the product of a manufacturing chemist
      who should have been indicted for criminal economy. The medicinal portion
      of the little pill struck the wall with a faint tap, then dropped
      noiselessly to the floor, and, after a time, Penrod slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours later he began to dream; he dreamed that his feet and legs were
      becoming uncomfortable as a result of Sam Williams's activities with a
      red-hot poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You QUIT that!&rdquo; he said aloud, and awoke indignantly. Again a dark,
      wrappered figure hovered over the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only a hot-water bag, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield said, still labouring
      under the covers with an extended arm. &ldquo;You mustn't hunch yourself up that
      way, Penrod. Put your feet down on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as he continued to hunch himself, she moved the bag in the direction
      of his withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow, murder!&rdquo; he exclaimed convulsively. &ldquo;What you tryin' to do? Scald me
      to death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness, Mamma,&rdquo; he wailed; &ldquo;can't you let me sleep a MINUTE?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very bad for you to let your feet get cold, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They WEREN'T cold. I don't want any ole hot-wat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;you must put your feet against the bag. It
      isn't too hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, isn't it?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I don't s'pose you'd care if I burned my
      feet right off! Mamma, won't you please, pul-LEEZE let me get some sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by a groan that seemed to come from an abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'll do it! Let 'em burn, then!&rdquo; Thus spake the desperate
      Penrod; and Mrs. Schofield was able to ascertain that one heel had been
      placed in light contact with the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; both feet, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a tragic shiver he obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT'S right, dear! Now, keep them that way. It's good for you.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G'-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed softly behind her, and the body of Penrod, from the hips
      upward, rose invisibly in the complete darkness of the bedchamber. A
      moment later the hot-water bag reached the floor in as noiseless a manner
      as that previously adopted by the remains of the little pill, and Penrod
      once more bespread his soul with poppies. This time he slept until the
      breakfast-bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was late to school, and at once found himself in difficulties.
      Government demanded an explanation of the tardiness; but Penrod made no
      reply of any kind. Taciturnity is seldom more strikingly out of place than
      under such circumstances, and the penalties imposed took account not only
      of Penrod's tardiness but of his supposititious defiance of authority in
      declining to speak. The truth was that Penrod did not know why he was
      tardy, and, with mind still lethargic, found it impossible to think of an
      excuse his continuing silence being due merely to the persistence of his
      efforts to invent one. Thus were his meek searchings misinterpreted, and
      the unloved hours of improvement in science and the arts made odious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll SEE!&rdquo; he whispered sorely to himself, as he bent low over his
      desk, a little later. Some day he would &ldquo;show 'em&rdquo;. The picture in his
      mind was of a vast, vague assembly of people headed by Miss Spence and the
      superior pupils who were never tardy, and these multitudes, representing
      persecution and government in general, were all cringing before a Penrod
      Schofield who rode a grim black horse up and down their miserable ranks,
      and gave curt orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make 'em step back there!&rdquo; he commanded his myrmidons savagely. &ldquo;Fix it
      so's your horses'll step on their feet if they don't do what I say!&rdquo; Then,
      from his shining saddle, he watched the throngs slinking away. &ldquo;I guess
      they know who I am NOW!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE TONIC
    </h2>
    <p>
      These broodings helped a little; but it was a severe morning, and on his
      way home at noon he did not recover heart enough to practice the
      bullfrog's croak, the craft that Sam Williams had lately mastered to
      inspiring perfection. This sonorous accomplishment Penrod had determined
      to make his own. At once guttural and resonant, impudent yet plaintive,
      with a barbaric twang like the plucked string of a Congo war-fiddle, the
      sound had fascinated him. It is made in the throat by processes utterly
      impossible to describe in human words, and no alphabet as yet produced by
      civilized man affords the symbols to vocalize it to the ear of
      imagination. &ldquo;Gunk&rdquo; is the poor makeshift that must be employed to
      indicate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod uttered one half-hearted &ldquo;Gunk&rdquo; as he turned in at his own gate.
      However, this stimulated him, and he paused to practice. &ldquo;Gunk!&rdquo; he
      croaked. &ldquo;Gunk-gunk-gunk-gunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield leaned out of an open window upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't do that, Penrod,&rdquo; she said anxiously. &ldquo;Please don't do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Penrod asked, and, feeling encouraged by his progress in the
      new art, he continued: &ldquo;Gunk&mdash;gunk-gunk! Gunk-gunk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please try not to do it,&rdquo; she urged pleadingly. &ldquo;You CAN stop it if you
      try. Won't you, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod felt that he was almost upon the point of attaining a mastery
      equal to Sam Williams's. He had just managed to do something in his throat
      that he had never done before, and he felt that unless he kept on doing it
      at this time, his new-born facility might evade him later. &ldquo;Gunk!&rdquo; he
      croaked. &ldquo;Gunk&mdash;gunk-gunk!&rdquo; And he continued to croak, persevering
      monotonously, his expression indicating the depth of his preoccupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother looked down solicitously, murmured in a melancholy undertone,
      shook her head; then disappeared from the window, and, after a moment or
      two, opened the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I've got something for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's look of preoccupation vanished; he brightened and ceased to
      croak. His mother had already given him a small leather pocketbook with a
      nickel in it, as a souvenir of her journey. Evidently she had brought
      another gift as well, delaying its presentation until now. &ldquo;I've got
      something for you!&rdquo; These were auspicious words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mamma?&rdquo; he asked, and, as she smiled tenderly upon him, his
      gayety increased. &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Mamma, is it that reg'lar
      carpenter's tool chest I told you about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I'll show you, Penrod. Come on, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her with alacrity to the dining-room, and the bright
      anticipation in his eyes grew more brilliant&mdash;until she opened the
      door of the china-closet, simultaneously with that action announcing
      cheerily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's something that's going to do you lots of good, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was instantly chilled, for experience had taught him that when
      predictions of this character were made, nothing pleasant need be
      expected. Two seconds later his last hope departed as she turned from the
      closet and he beheld in her hands a quart bottle containing what appeared
      to be a section of grassy swamp immersed in a cloudy brown liquor. He
      stepped back, grave suspicion in his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS that?&rdquo; he asked, in a hard voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield smiled upon him. &ldquo;It's nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is, it's
      nothing you'll mind at all. It's just so you won't be so nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think so, of course, dear,&rdquo; she returned, and, as she spoke,
      she poured some of the brown liquor into a tablespoon. &ldquo;People often can't
      tell when they're nervous themselves; but your Papa and I have been
      getting a little anxious about you, dear, and so I got this medicine for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHERE'D you get it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield set the bottle down and moved toward him, insinuatingly
      extending the full tablespoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;just take this little spoonful, like a goo&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know where it came from,&rdquo; he insisted darkly, again stepping
      backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; she echoed absently, watching to see that nothing was spilled
      from the spoon as she continued to move toward him. &ldquo;Why, I was talking to
      old Mrs. Wottaw at market this morning, and she said her son Clark used to
      have nervous trouble, and she told me about this medicine and how to have
      it made at the drug store. She told me it cured Clark, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to be cured,&rdquo; Penrod said, adding inconsistently, &ldquo;I haven't
      got anything to be cured of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield began, &ldquo;you don't want your papa and me to
      keep on worrying about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care whether you worry or not,&rdquo; the heartless boy interrupted. &ldquo;I
      don't want to take any horrable ole medicine. What's that grass and weeds
      in the bottle for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield looked grieved. &ldquo;There isn't any grass and there aren't any
      weeds; those are healthful herbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet they'll make me sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &ldquo;Penrod, we're trying to make you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I AM well, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; your papa's been very much troubled about you. Come, Penrod;
      swallow this down and don't make such a fuss about it. It's just for your
      own good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she advanced upon him again, the spoon extended toward his lips. It
      almost touched them, for he had retreated until his back was against the
      wall-paper. He could go no farther; but he evinced his unshaken repugnance
      by averting his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's it taste like?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not unpleasant at all,&rdquo; she answered, poking the spoon at his mouth.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wottaw said Clark used to be very fond of it. It doesn't taste like
      ordinary medicine at all,' she said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often I got to take it?&rdquo; Penrod mumbled, as the persistent spoon
      sought to enter his mouth. &ldquo;Just this once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; three times a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo; She spoke sharply. &ldquo;You swallow this down and stop making such a
      fuss. I can't be all day. Hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She inserted the spoon between his lips, so that its rim touched his
      clenched teeth; he was still reluctant. Moreover, is reluctance was
      natural and characteristic, for a boy's sense of taste is as simple and as
      peculiar as a dog's, though, of course, altogether different from a dog's.
      A boy, passing through the experimental age, may eat and drink astonishing
      things; but they must be of his own choosing. His palate is tender, and,
      in one sense, might be called fastidious; nothing is more sensitive or
      more easily shocked. A boy tastes things much more than grown people taste
      them: what is merely unpleasant to a man is sheer broth of hell to a boy.
      Therefore, not knowing what might be encountered, Penrod continued to be
      reluctant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; his mother exclaimed, losing patience, &ldquo;I'll call your papa to
      make you take it, if you don't swallow it right down! Open your mouth,
      Penrod! It isn't going to taste bad at all. Open your mouth&mdash;THERE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reluctant jaw relaxed at last, and Mrs. Schofield dexterously elevated
      the handle of the spoon so that the brown liquor was deposited within her
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she repeated triumphantly. &ldquo;It wasn't so bad after all, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod did not reply. His expression had become odd, and the oddity of his
      manner was equal to that of his expression. Uttering no sound, he seemed
      to distend, as if he had suddenly become a pneumatic boy under dangerous
      pressure. Meanwhile, his reddening eyes, fixed awfully upon his mother,
      grew unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, it wasn't such a bad taste,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield said rather nervously.
      &ldquo;Don't go acting THAT way, Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod could not help himself. In truth, even a grown person hardened
      to all manner of flavours, and able to eat caviar or liquid Camembert,
      would have found the cloudy brown liquor virulently repulsive. It
      contained in solution, with other things, the vital element of surprise,
      for it was comparatively odourless, and, unlike the chivalrous
      rattlesnake, gave no warning of what it was about to do. In the case of
      Penrod, the surprise was complete and its effect visibly shocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distention by which he began to express his emotion appeared to be
      increasing; his slender throat swelled as his cheeks puffed. His shoulders
      rose toward his ears; he lifted his right leg in an unnatural way and held
      it rigidly in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that, Penrod!&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield commanded. &ldquo;You stop it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uff! OOOFF!&rdquo; he said thickly, and collapsed&mdash;a mere, ordinary,
      every-day convulsion taking the place of his pneumatic symptoms. He began
      to writhe, at the same time opening and closing his mouth rapidly and
      repeatedly, waving his arms, stamping on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow! Ow-ow-OW!&rdquo; he vociferated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reassured by these normal demonstrations, of a type with which she was
      familiar, Mrs. Schofield resumed her fond smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU'RE all right, little boysie!&rdquo; she said heartily. Then, picking up the
      bottle, she replenished the tablespoon, and told Penrod something she had
      considered it undiplomatic to mention before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the other one,&rdquo; she said sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uuf!&rdquo; he sputtered. &ldquo;Other&mdash;uh&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two tablespoons before each meal,&rdquo; she informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Penrod made the first of a series of passionate efforts to leave
      the room. His determination was so intense and the manifestations of it
      were so ruthless, that Mrs. Schofield, exhausted, found herself obliged to
      call for the official head of the house&mdash;in fact, she found herself
      obliged to shriek for him; and Mr. Schofield, hastily entering the room,
      beheld his wife apparently in the act of sawing his son back and forth
      across the sill of an open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod made a frantic effort to reach the good green earth, even after his
      mother's clutch upon his ankle had been reenforced by his father's. Nor
      was the lad's revolt subdued when he was deposited upon the floor and the
      window closed. Indeed, it may be said that he actually never gave up,
      though it is a fact that the second potion was successfully placed inside
      him. But by the time this feat was finally accomplished, Mr. Schofield had
      proved that, in spite of middle age, he was entitled to substantial claims
      and honours both as athlete and orator&mdash;his oratory being founded
      less upon the school of Webster and more upon that of Jeremiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the thing was done, and the double dose put within the person of Penrod
      Schofield. It proved not ineffective there, and presently, as its new
      owner sat morosely at table, he began to feel slightly dizzy and his eyes
      refused him perfect service. This was natural, because two tablespoons of
      the cloudy brown liquor contained about the amount of alcohol to be found
      in an ordinary cocktail. Now a boy does not enjoy the effects of
      intoxication; enjoyment of that kind is obtained only by studious
      application. Therefore, Penrod spoke of his symptoms complainingly, and
      even showed himself so vindictive as to attribute them to the new
      medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother made no reply. Instead, she nodded her head as if some inner
      conviction had proven well founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;BILIOUS, TOO,&rdquo; she whispered to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, during the half-hour preceding dinner, the dining-room was
      the scene of another struggle, only a little less desperate than that
      which had been the prelude to lunch, and again an appeal to the head of
      the house was found necessary. Muscular activity and a liberal imitation
      of the jeremiads once more subjugated the rebel&mdash;and the same
      rebellion and its suppression in a like manner took place the following
      morning before breakfast. But this was Saturday, and, without warning or
      apparent reason, a remarkable change came about at noon. However, Mr. and
      Mrs. Schofield were used to inexplicable changes in Penrod, and they
      missed its significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Schofield, with dread in her heart, called Penrod into the house
      &ldquo;to take his medicine&rdquo; before lunch, he came briskly, and took it like a
      lamb!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Penrod, that's splendid!&rdquo; she cried &ldquo;You see it isn't bad, at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm,&rdquo; he said meekly. &ldquo;Not when you get used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And aren't you ashamed, making all that fuss?&rdquo; she went on happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, I guess so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don't you feel better? Don't you see how much good it's doing you
      already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, I guess so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon a holiday morning, several weeks later, Penrod and Sam Williams
      revived a pastime that they called &ldquo;drug store&rdquo;, setting up display
      counters, selling chemical, cosmetic and other compounds to imaginary
      customers, filling prescriptions and variously conducting themselves in a
      pharmaceutical manner. They were in the midst of affairs when Penrod
      interrupted his partner and himself with a cry of recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> know!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I got some mighty good ole stuff we want.
      You wait!&rdquo; And, dashing to the house, he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning immediately, Penrod placed upon the principal counter of the
      &ldquo;drug store&rdquo; a large bottle. It was a quart bottle, in fact; and it
      contained what appeared to be a section of grassy swamp immersed in a
      cloudy brown liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; Penrod exclaimed. &ldquo;How's that for some good ole medicine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's good ole stuff,&rdquo; Sam said approvingly. &ldquo;Where'd you get it? Whose is
      it, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It WAS mine,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Up to about serreval days ago, it was. They
      quit givin' it to me. I had to take two bottles and a half of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you haf to take it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got nervous, or sumpthing,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all well again now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so. Uncle Passloe and cousin Ronald came to visit, and I expect
      she got too busy to think about it, or sumpthing. Anyway, she quit makin'
      me take it, and said I was lots better. She's forgot all about it by this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was looking at the bottle with great interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all that stuff in there, Penrod?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What's all that stuff
      in there looks like grass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It IS grass,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd it get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stuck it in there,&rdquo; the candid boy replied. &ldquo;First they had some
      horrable ole stuff in there like to killed me. But after they got three
      doses down me, I took the bottle out in the yard and cleaned her all out
      and pulled a lot o' good ole grass and stuffed her pretty full and poured
      in a lot o' good ole hydrant water on top of it. Then, when they got the
      next bottle, I did the same way, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't look like water,&rdquo; Sam objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod laughed a superior laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's nothin',&rdquo; he said, with the slight swagger of young and
      conscious genius. &ldquo;Of course, I had to slip in and shake her up sometimes,
      so's they wouldn't notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did you put in it to make it look like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, upon the point of replying, happened to glance toward the house.
      His gaze, lifting, rested for a moment upon a window. The head of Mrs.
      Schofield was framed in that window. She nodded gayly to her son. She
      could see him plainly, and she thought that he seemed perfectly healthy,
      and as happy as a boy could be. She was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What DID you put in it?&rdquo; Sam insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And probably it was just as well that, though Mrs. Schofield could see her
      son, the distance was too great for her to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin',&rdquo; Penrod replied. &ldquo;Nothin' but a little good ole mud.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. GIPSY
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a fair Saturday afternoon in November Penrod's little old dog Duke
      returned to the ways of his youth and had trouble with a strange cat on
      the back porch. This indiscretion, so uncharacteristic, was due to the
      agitation of a surprised moment, for Duke's experience had inclined him to
      a peaceful pessimism, and he had no ambition for hazardous undertakings of
      any sort. He was given to musing but not to avoidable action, and he
      seemed habitually to hope for something that he was pretty sure would not
      happen. Even in his sleep, this gave him an air of wistfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, being asleep in a nook behind the metal refuse-can, when the strange
      cat ventured to ascend the steps of the porch, his appearance was so
      unwarlike that the cat felt encouraged to extend its field of
      reconnaissance for the cook had been careless, and the backbone of a
      three-pound whitefish lay at the foot of the refuse-can.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cat was, for a cat, needlessly tall, powerful, independent and
      masculine. Once, long ago, he had been a roly-poly pepper-and-salt kitten;
      he had a home in those days, and a name, &ldquo;Gipsy,&rdquo; which he abundantly
      justified. He was precocious in dissipation. Long before his adolescence,
      his lack of domesticity was ominous, and he had formed bad companionships.
      Meanwhile, he grew so rangy, and developed such length and power of leg
      and such traits of character, that the father of the little girl who owned
      him was almost convincing when he declared that the young cat was half
      broncho and half Malay pirate&mdash;though, in the light of Gipsy's later
      career, this seems bitterly unfair to even the lowest orders of bronchos
      and Malay pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; Gipsy was not the pet for a little girl. The rosy hearthstone and
      sheltered rug were too circumspect for him. Surrounded by the comforts of
      middle-class respectability, and profoundly oppressed, even in his youth,
      by the Puritan ideals of the household, he sometimes experienced a sense
      of suffocation. He wanted free air and he wanted free life; he wanted the
      lights, the lights and the music. He abandoned the bourgeoise irrevocably.
      He went forth in a May twilight, carrying the evening beefsteak with him,
      and joined the underworld.
    </p>
    <p>
      His extraordinary size, his daring and his utter lack of sympathy soon
      made him the leader&mdash;and, at the same time, the terror&mdash;of all
      the loose-lived cats in a wide neighbourhood. He contracted no friendships
      and had no confidants. He seldom slept in the same place twice in
      succession, and though he was wanted by the police, he was not found. In
      appearance he did not lack distinction of an ominous sort; the slow,
      rhythmic, perfectly controlled mechanism of his tail, as he impressively
      walked abroad, was incomparably sinister. This stately and dangerous walk
      of his, his long, vibrant whiskers, his scars, his yellow eye, so
      ice-cold, so fire-hot, haughty as the eye of Satan, gave him the deadly
      air of a mousquetaire duellist. His soul was in that walk and in that eye;
      it could be read&mdash;the soul of a bravo of fortune, living on his wits
      and his velour, asking no favours and granting no quarter. Intolerant,
      proud, sullen, yet watchful and constantly planning&mdash;purely a
      militarist, believing in slaughter as in a religion, and confident that
      art, science, poetry and the good of the world were happily advanced
      thereby&mdash;Gipsy had become, though technically not a wildcat,
      undoubtedly the most untamed cat at large in the civilized world. Such, in
      brief, was the terrifying creature that now elongated its neck, and, over
      the top step of the porch, bent a calculating scrutiny upon the wistful
      and slumberous Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scrutiny was searching but not prolonged. Gipsy muttered
      contemptuously to himself, &ldquo;Oh, sheol; I'm not afraid o' THAT!&rdquo; And he
      approached the fishbone, his padded feet making no noise upon the boards.
      It was a desirable fishbone, large, with a considerable portion of the
      fish's tail still attached to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about a foot from Duke's nose, and the little dog's dreams began to
      be troubled by his olfactory nerve. This faithful sentinel, on guard even
      while Duke slept, signalled that alarums and excursions by parties unknown
      were taking place, and suggested that attention might well be paid. Duke
      opened one drowsy eye. What that eye beheld was monstrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a strange experience&mdash;the horrific vision in the midst of
      things so accustomed. Sunshine fell sweetly upon porch and backyard;
      yonder was the familiar stable, and from its interior came the busy hum of
      a carpenter shop, established that morning by Duke's young master, in
      association with Samuel Williams and Herman. Here, close by, were the
      quiet refuse-can and the wonted brooms and mops leaning against the
      latticed wall at the end of the porch, and there, by the foot of the
      steps, was the stone slab of the cistern, with the iron cover displaced
      and lying beside the round opening, where the carpenters had left it, not
      half an hour ago, after lowering a stick of wood into the water, &ldquo;to
      season it&rdquo;. All about Duke were these usual and reassuring environs of his
      daily life, and yet it was his fate to behold, right in the midst of them,
      and in ghastly juxtaposition to his face, a thing of nightmare and lunacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gipsy had seized the fishbone by the middle. Out from one side of his
      head, and mingling with his whiskers, projected the long, spiked spine of
      the big fish; down from the other side of that ferocious head dangled the
      fish's tail, and from above the remarkable effect thus produced shot the
      intolerable glare of two yellow eyes. To the gaze of Duke, still blurred
      by slumber, this monstrosity was all of one piece the bone seemed a living
      part of it. What he saw was like those interesting insect-faces that the
      magnifying glass reveals to great M. Fabre. It was impossible for Duke to
      maintain the philosophic calm of M. Fabre, however; there was no
      magnifying glass between him and this spined and spiky face. Indeed, Duke
      was not in a position to think the matter over quietly. If he had been
      able to do that, he would have said to himself: &ldquo;We have here an animal of
      most peculiar and unattractive appearance, though, upon examination, it
      seems to be only a cat stealing a fishbone. Nevertheless, as the thief is
      large beyond all my recollection of cats and has an unpleasant stare, I
      will leave this spot at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, Duke was so electrified by his horrid awakening that he
      completely lost his presence of mind. In the very instant of his first
      eye's opening, the other eye and his mouth behaved similarly, the latter
      loosing upon the quiet air one shriek of mental agony before the little
      dog scrambled to his feet and gave further employment to his voice in a
      frenzy of profanity. At the same time the subterranean diapason of a
      demoniac bass viol was heard; it rose to a wail, and rose and rose again
      till it screamed like a small siren. It was Gipsy's war-cry, and, at the
      sound of it, Duke became a frothing maniac. He made a convulsive frontal
      attack upon the hobgoblin&mdash;and the massacre began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never releasing the fishbone for an instant, Gipsy laid back his ears in a
      chilling way, beginning to shrink into himself like a concertina, but
      rising amidships so high that he appeared to be giving an imitation of
      that peaceful beast, the dromedary. Such was not his purpose, however,
      for, having attained his greatest possible altitude, he partially sat down
      and elevated his right arm after the manner of a semaphore. This semaphore
      arm remained rigid for a second, threatening; then it vibrated with
      inconceivable rapidity, feinting. But it was the treacherous left that did
      the work. Seemingly this left gave Duke three lightning little pats upon
      the right ear; but the change in his voice indicated that these were no
      love-taps. He yelled &ldquo;help!&rdquo; and &ldquo;bloody murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never had such a shattering uproar, all vocal, broken out upon a peaceful
      afternoon. Gipsy possessed a vocabulary for cat-swearing certainly second
      to none out of Italy, and probably equal to the best there, while Duke
      remembered and uttered things he had not thought of for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hum of the carpenter shop ceased, and Sam Williams appeared in the
      stable doorway. He stared insanely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gorry!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Duke's havin' a fight with the biggest cat you
      ever saw in your life! C'mon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His feet were already in motion toward the battlefield, with Penrod and
      Herman hurrying in his wake. Onward they sped, and Duke was encouraged by
      the sight and sound of these reenforcements to increase his own outrageous
      clamours and to press home his attack. But he was ill-advised. This time
      it was the right arm of the semaphore that dipped&mdash;and Duke's honest
      nose was but too conscious of what happened in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lump of dirt struck the refuse-can with violence, and Gipsy beheld the
      advance of overwhelming forces. They rushed upon him from two directions,
      cutting off the steps of the porch. Undaunted, the formidable cat raked
      Duke's nose again, somewhat more lingeringly, and prepared to depart with
      his fishbone. He had little fear for himself, because he was inclined to
      think that, unhampered, he could whip anything on earth; still, things
      seemed to be growing rather warm and he saw nothing to prevent his
      leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though he could laugh in the face of so unequal an antagonist as Duke,
      Gipsy felt that he was never at his best or able to do himself full
      justice unless he could perform that feline operation inaccurately known
      as &ldquo;spitting&rdquo;. To his notion, this was an absolute essential to combat;
      but, as all cats of the slightest pretensions to technique perfectly
      understand, it can neither be well done nor produce the best effects
      unless the mouth be opened to its utmost capacity so as to expose the
      beginnings of the alimentary canal, down which&mdash;at least that is the
      intention of the threat&mdash;the opposing party will soon be passing. And
      Gipsy could not open his mouth without relinquishing his fishbone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, on small accounts he decided to leave the field to his enemies
      and to carry the fishbone elsewhere. He took two giant leaps. The first
      landed him upon the edge of the porch. There, without an instant's pause,
      he gathered his fur-sheathed muscles, concentrated himself into one big
      steel spring, and launched himself superbly into space. He made a stirring
      picture, however brief, as he left the solid porch behind him and sailed
      upward on an ascending curve into the sunlit air. His head was proudly up;
      he was the incarnation of menacing power and of self-confidence. It is
      possible that the whitefish's spinal column and flopping tail had
      interfered with his vision, and in launching himself he may have mistaken
      the dark, round opening of the cistern for its dark, round cover. In that
      case, it was a leap calculated and executed with precision, for as the
      boys clamoured their pleased astonishment, Gipsy descended accurately into
      the orifice and passed majestically from public view, with the fishbone
      still in his mouth and his haughty head still high.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a grand splash!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. CONCERNING TROUSERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Duke, hastening to place himself upon the stone slab, raged at his enemy
      in safety; and presently the indomitable Gipsy could be heard from the
      darkness below, turning on the bass of his siren, threatening the water
      that enveloped him, returning Duke's profanity with interest, and cursing
      the general universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hush!&rdquo; Penrod stormed, rushing at Duke. &ldquo;You go 'way from here! You
      DUKE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Duke, after prostrating himself, decided that it would be a relief to
      obey and to consider his responsibilities in this matter at an end. He
      withdrew beyond a corner of the house, thinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why'n't you let him bark at the ole cat?&rdquo; Sam Williams inquired,
      sympathizing with the oppressed. &ldquo;I guess you'd want to bark if a cat had
      been treatin' you the way this one did Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we got to get this cat out o' here, haven't we?&rdquo; Penrod demanded
      crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fer?&rdquo; Herman asked. &ldquo;Mighty mean cat! If it was me, I let 'at ole
      cat drownd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness,&rdquo; Penrod cried. &ldquo;What you want to let it drown for? Anyways,
      we got to use this water in our house, haven't we? You don't s'pose people
      like to use water that's got a cat drowned in it, do you? It gets pumped
      up into the tank in the attic and goes all over the house, and I bet you
      wouldn't want to see your father and mother usin' water a cat was drowned
      in. I guess I don't want my father and moth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how CAN we get it out?&rdquo; Sam asked, cutting short this virtuous
      oration. &ldquo;It's swimmin' around down there,&rdquo; he continued, peering into the
      cistern, &ldquo;and kind of roaring, and it must of dropped its fishbone, 'cause
      it's spittin' just awful. I guess maybe it's mad 'cause it fell in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how it's goin' to be got out,&rdquo; said Penrod; &ldquo;but I know it's
      GOT to be got out, and that's all there is to it! I'm not goin' to have my
      father and mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, once,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;once when a kitten fell down OUR cistern, Papa
      took a pair of his trousers, and he held 'em by the end of one leg, and
      let 'em hang down through the hole till the end of the other leg was in
      the water, and the kitten went and clawed hold of it, and he pulled it
      right up, easy as anything. Well, that's the way to do now, 'cause if a
      kitten could keep hold of a pair of trousers, I guess this ole cat could.
      It's the biggest cat <i>I</i> ever saw! All you got to do is to go and ast
      your mother for a pair of your father's trousers, and we'll have this ole
      cat out o' there in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod glanced toward the house perplexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain't home, and I'd be afraid to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take your own, then,&rdquo; Sam suggested briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take 'em off in the stable, and wait in there, and I and Herman'll
      get the cat out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod had no enthusiasm for this plan; but he affected to consider it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know 'bout that,&rdquo; he said, and then, after gazing
      attentively into the cistern and making some eye measurements of his
      knickerbockers, he shook his head. &ldquo;They'd be too short. They wouldn't be
      NEAR long enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then neither would mine,&rdquo; said Sam promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herman's would,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, suh!&rdquo; Herman had recently been promoted to long trousers, and he
      expressed a strong disinclination to fall in with Penrod's idea. &ldquo;My Mammy
      sit up late nights sewin' on 'ese britches fer me, makin' 'em outen of a
      pair o' pappy's, an' they mighty good britches. Ain' goin' have no wet cat
      climbin' up 'em! No, suh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both boys began to walk toward him argumentatively, while he moved slowly
      backward, shaking his head and denying them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't keer how much you talk!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mammy gave my OLE britches to
      Verman, an' 'ese here ones on'y britches I got now, an' I'm go' to keep
      'em on me&mdash;not take 'em off an' let ole wet cat splosh all over 'em.
      My Mammy, she sewed 'em fer ME, I reckon&mdash;d'in' sew 'em fer no cat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, PLEASE, come on, Herman!&rdquo; Penrod begged pathetically. &ldquo;You don't want
      to see the poor cat drown, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty mean cat!&rdquo; Herman said. &ldquo;Bet' let 'at ole pussy-cat 'lone whur it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it'll only take a minute,&rdquo; Sam urged. &ldquo;You just wait inside the
      stable and you'll have 'em back on again before you could say 'Jack
      Robinson.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain' got no use to say no Jack Robason,&rdquo; said Herman. &ldquo;An' I ain' go'
      to han' over my britches fer NO cat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen here, Herman,&rdquo; Penrod began pleadingly. &ldquo;You can watch us every
      minute through the crack in the stable door, can't you? We ain't goin' to
      HURT 'em any, are we? You can see everything we do, can't you? Look at
      here, Herman: you know that little saw you said you wished it was yours,
      in the carpenter shop? Well, honest, if you'll just let us take your
      trousers till we get this poor ole cat out the cistern, I'll give you that
      little saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman was shaken; he yearned for the little saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gimme her to keep?&rdquo; he asked cautiously. &ldquo;You gimme her befo' I han'
      over my britches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll see!&rdquo; Penrod ran into the stable, came back with the little saw,
      and placed it in Herman's hand. Herman could resist no longer, and two
      minutes later he stood in the necessary negligee within the shelter of the
      stable door, and watched, through the crack, the lowering of the
      surrendered garment into the cistern. His gaze was anxious, and surely
      nothing could have been more natural, since the removal had exposed
      Herman's brown legs, and, although the weather was far from inclement,
      November is never quite the month for people to be out of doors entirely
      without leg-covering. Therefore, he marked with impatience that Sam and
      Penrod, after lowering the trousers partway to the water, had withdrawn
      them and fallen into an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name o' goo'ness!&rdquo; Herman shouted. &ldquo;I ain' got no time fer you all do so
      much talkin'. If you go' git 'at cat out, why'n't you GIT him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait just a minute,&rdquo; Penrod called, and he came running to the stable,
      seized upon a large wooden box, which the carpenters had fitted with a lid
      and leather hinges, and returned with it cumbersomely to the cistern.
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That'll do to put it in. It won't get out o' that, I
      bet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd like to know what you want to keep it for,&rdquo; Sam said peevishly,
      and, with the suggestion of a sneer, he added, &ldquo;I s'pose you think
      somebody'll pay about a hunderd dollars reward or something, on account of
      a cat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't, either!&rdquo; Penrod protested hotly. &ldquo;I know what I'm doin', I tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what on earth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you some day, won't I?&rdquo; Penrod cried. &ldquo;I got my reasons for
      wantin' to keep this cat, and I'm goin' to keep it. YOU don't haf to ke&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right,&rdquo; Sam said shortly. &ldquo;Anyways, it'll be dead if you don't
      hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't, either,&rdquo; Penrod returned, kneeling and peering down upon the
      dark water. &ldquo;Listen to him! He's growlin' and spittin' away like anything!
      It takes a mighty fine-blooded cat to be as fierce as that. I bet you most
      cats would 'a' given up and drowned long ago. The water's awful cold, and
      I expect he was perty supprised when he lit in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herman's makin' a fuss again,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;We better get the ole cat out
      o' there if we're goin' to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is the way we'll do,&rdquo; Penrod said authoritatively: &ldquo;I'll let
      you hold the trousers, Sam. You lay down and keep hold of one leg, and let
      the other one hang down till its end is in the water. Then you kind of
      swish it around till it's somewheres where the cat can get hold of it, and
      soon as he does, you pull it up, and be mighty careful so's it don't fall
      off. Then I'll grab it and stick it in the box and slam the lid down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather pleased to be assigned to the trousers, Sam accordingly extended
      himself at full length upon the slab and proceeded to carry out Penrod's
      instructions. Meanwhile, Penrod, peering from above, inquired anxiously
      for information concerning this work of rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see it, Sam? Why don't it grab hold? What's it doin' now, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's spittin' at Herman's trousers,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;My gracious, but it's a
      fierce cat! If it's mad all the time like this, you better not ever try to
      pet it much. Now it's kind o' sniffin' at the trousers. It acks to me as
      if it was goin' to ketch hold. Yes, it's stuck one claw in 'em&mdash;OW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam uttered a blood-curdling shriek and jerked convulsively. The next
      instant, streaming and inconceivably gaunt, the ravening Gipsy appeared
      with a final bound upon Sam's shoulder. It was not in Gipsy's character to
      be drawn up peaceably; he had ascended the trousers and Sam's arm without
      assistance and in his own way. Simultaneously&mdash;for this was a notable
      case of everything happening at once&mdash;there was a muffled, soggy
      splash, and the unfortunate Herman, smit with prophecy in his seclusion,
      uttered a dismal yell. Penrod laid hands upon Gipsy, and, after a struggle
      suggestive of sailors landing a man-eating shark, succeeded in getting him
      into the box, and sat upon the lid thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had leaped to his feet, empty handed and vociferous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow ow, OUCH!&rdquo; he shouted, as he rubbed his suffering arm and shoulder.
      Then, exasperated by Herman's lamentations, he called angrily: &ldquo;Oh, what
      <i>I</i> care for your ole britches? I guess if you'd 'a' had a cat climb
      up YOU, you'd 'a' dropped 'em a hunderd times over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, upon excruciating entreaty, he consented to explore the surface
      of the water with a clothes-prop, but reported that the luckless trousers
      had disappeared in the depths, Herman having forgotten to remove some
      &ldquo;fishin' sinkers&rdquo; from his pockets before making the fated loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was soothing a lacerated wrist in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a mighty fine-blooded cat,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I expect it'd got away
      from pretty near anybody, 'specially if they didn't know much about cats.
      Listen at him, in the box, Sam. I bet you never heard a cat growl as loud
      as that in your life. I shouldn't wonder it was part panther or
      sumpthing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam began to feel more interest and less resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what we can do, Penrod,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Let's take it in the stable
      and make the box into a cage. We can take off the hinges and slide back
      the lid a little at a time, and nail some o' those laths over the front
      for bars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just exackly what I was goin' to say!&rdquo; Penrod exclaimed. &ldquo;I
      already thought o' that, Sam. Yessir, we'll make it just like a reg'lar
      circus-cage, and our good ole cat can look out from between the bars and
      growl. It'll come in pretty handy if we ever decide to have another show.
      Anyways, we'll have her in there, good and tight, where we can watch she
      don't get away. I got a mighty good reason to keep this cat, Sam. You'll
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you&mdash;&rdquo; Sam was interrupted by n vehement appeal from
      the stable. &ldquo;Oh, we're comin'!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We got to bring our cat in
      its cage, haven't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Herman,&rdquo; Penrod called absent-mindedly. &ldquo;Bring us some bricks, or
      something awful heavy to put on the lid of our cage, so we can carry it
      without our good ole cat pushin' the lid open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman explained with vehemence that it would not be right for him to
      leave the stable upon any errand until just restorations had been made. He
      spoke inimically of the cat that had been the occasion of his loss, and he
      earnestly requested that operations with the clothes-prop be resumed in
      the cistern. Sam and Penrod declined, on the ground that this was
      absolutely proven to be of no avail, and Sam went to look for bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two boys were not unfeeling. They sympathized with Herman; but they
      regarded the trousers as a loss about which there was no use in making so
      much outcry. To them, it was part of an episode that ought to be closed.
      They had done their best, and Sam had not intended to drop the trousers;
      that was something no one could have helped, and therefore no one was to
      be blamed. What they were now interested in was the construction of a
      circus-cage for their good ole cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's goin' to be a cage just exactly like circus-cages, Herman,&rdquo; Penrod
      said, as he and Sam set the box down on the stable floor. &ldquo;You can help us
      nail the bars and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain' studyin' 'bout no bars!&rdquo; Herman interrupted fiercely. &ldquo;What good
      you reckon nailin' bars go' do me if Mammy holler fer me? You white boys
      sutn'y show me bad day! I try treat people nice, 'n'en they go th'ow my
      britches down cistern!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; Sam protested. &ldquo;That ole cat just kicked 'em out o' my hand
      with its hind feet while its front ones were stickin' in my arm. I bet
      YOU'D of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blame it on cat!&rdquo; Herman sneered. &ldquo;'At's nice! Jes' looky here minute:
      Who'd I len' 'em britches to? D' I len' 'em britches to thishere cat? No,
      suh; you know I didn'! You know well's any man I len' 'em britches to you&mdash;an'
      you tuck an' th'owed 'em down cistern!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, PLEASE hush up about your old britches!&rdquo; Penrod said plaintively. &ldquo;I
      got to think how we're goin' to fix our cage up right, and you make so
      much noise I can't get my mind on it. Anyways, didn't I give you that
      little saw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Li'l saw!&rdquo; Herman cried, unmollified. &ldquo;Yes; an' thishere li'l saw go' do
      me lot o' good when I got to go home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's only across the alley to your house, Herman!&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;That
      ain't anything at all to step over there, and you've got your little saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw right! You jes' take off you' closes an' step 'cross the alley,&rdquo; said
      Herman bitterly. &ldquo;I give you li'l saw to carry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod had begun to work upon the cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen here, Herman,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;if you'll quit talkin' so much, and
      kind of get settled down or sumpthing, and help us fix a good cage for our
      panther, well, when mamma comes home about five o'clock, I'll go and tell
      her there's a poor boy got his britches burned up in a fire, and how he's
      waitin' out in the stable for some, and I'll tell her I promised him.
      Well, she'll give me a pair I wore for summer; honest she will, and you
      can put 'em on as quick as anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Herman,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;now you're all right again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHO all right?&rdquo; Herman complained. &ldquo;I like feel sump'm' roun' my laigs
      befo' no five o'clock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you're sure to get 'em by then,&rdquo; Penrod promised. &ldquo;It ain't winter
      yet, Herman. Come on and help saw these laths for the bars, Herman, and
      Sam and I'll nail 'em on. It ain't long till five o'clock, Herman, and
      then you'll just feel fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman was not convinced; but he found himself at a disadvantage in the
      argument. The question at issue seemed a vital one to him&mdash;and yet
      his two opponents evidently considered it of minor importance. Obviously,
      they felt that the promise for five o'clock had settled the whole matter
      conclusively; but to Herman this did not appear to be the fact. However,
      he helplessly suffered himself to be cajoled back into carpentry, though
      he was extremely ill at ease and talked a great deal of his misfortune. He
      shivered and grumbled, and, by his passionate urgings, compelled Penrod to
      go into the house so many times to see what time it was by the kitchen
      clock that both his companions almost lost patience with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Penrod, returning from performing this errand for the fourth
      time. &ldquo;It's twenty minutes after three, and I'm not goin' in to look at
      that ole clock again if I haf to die for it! I never heard anybody make
      such a fuss in my life, and I'm gettin' tired of it. Must think we want to
      be all night fixin' this cage for our panther! If you ask me to go and see
      what time it is again, Herman, I'm a-goin' to take back about askin' mamma
      at five o'clock, and THEN where'll you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seem like mighty long aft'noon to me,&rdquo; Herman sighed. &ldquo;I jes'
      like to know what time it is gettin' to be now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Penrod warned him. &ldquo;You heard what I was just tellin' you
      about how I'd take back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemmine,&rdquo; Herman said hurriedly. &ldquo;I wasn' astin' you. I jes' sayin'
      sump'm' kind o' to myse'f like.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. CAMERA WORK IN THE JUNGLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The completed cage, with Gipsy behind the bars, framed a spectacle
      sufficiently thrilling and panther-like. Gipsy raved, &ldquo;spat&rdquo;, struck
      virulently at taunting fingers, turned on his wailing siren for minutes at
      a time, and he gave his imitation of a dromedary almost continuously.
      These phenomena could be intensified in picturesqueness, the boys
      discovered, by rocking the cage a little, tapping it with a hammer, or
      raking the bars with a stick. Altogether, Gipsy was having a lively
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a vigorous rapping on the alley door of the stable, and Verman
      was admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay, Verman!&rdquo; cried Sam Williams. &ldquo;Come and look at our good ole
      panther!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another curiosity, however, claimed Verman's attention. His eyes opened
      wide, and he pointed at Herman's legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha' ma' oo? Mammy hay oo hip ap hoe-woob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mammy tell ME git 'at stove-wood?&rdquo; Herman interpreted resentfully. &ldquo;How'm
      I go' git 'at stove-wood when my britches down bottom 'at cistern, I like
      you answer ME please? You shet 'at do' behime you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman complied, and again pointing to his brother's legs, requested to be
      enlightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sin' I tole you once they down bottom 'at cistern,&rdquo; Herman shouted, much
      exasperated. &ldquo;You wan' know how come so, you ast Sam Williams. He say
      thishere cat tuck an' th'owed 'em down there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam, who was busy rocking the cage, remained cheerfully absorbed in that
      occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come look at our good ole panther, Verman,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I'll get this
      circus-cage rockin' right good, an' then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Penrod; &ldquo;I got sumpthing I got to think about. Quit
      rockin' it! I guess I got a right to think about sumpthing without havin'
      to go deaf, haven't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having obtained the quiet so plaintively requested, he knit his brow and
      gazed intently upon Verman, then upon Herman, then upon Gipsy. Evidently
      his idea was fermenting. He broke the silence with a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> know, Sam! I know what we'll do NOW! I just thought of it, and
      it's goin' to be sumpthing I bet there aren't any other boys in this town
      could do, because where would they get any good ole panther like we got,
      and Herman and Verman? And they'd haf to have a dog, too&mdash;and we got
      our good ole Dukie, I guess. I bet we have the greatest ole time this
      afternoon we ever had in our lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His enthusiasm roused the warm interest of Sam&mdash;and Verman, though
      Herman, remaining cold and suspicious, asked for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I like to hear if it's sump'm',&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;what's go' git me my
      britches back outen 'at cistern!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it ain't exackly that,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;It's different from that.
      What I'm thinkin' about, well, for us to have it the way it ought to be,
      so's you and Verman would look like natives&mdash;well, Verman ought to
      take off his britches, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mo!&rdquo; said Verman, shaking his head violently. &ldquo;Mo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wait a minute, can't you?&rdquo; Sam Williams said. &ldquo;Give Penrod a chance
      to say what he wants to, first, can't you? Go on, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, Sam,&rdquo; said Penrod, turning to this sympathetic auditor;
      &ldquo;you remember that movin'-pitcher show we went to, 'Fortygraphing Wild
      Animals in the Jungle'. Well, Herman wouldn't have to do a thing more to
      look like those natives we saw that the man called the 'beaters'. They
      were dressed just about like the way he is now, and if Verman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MO!&rdquo; said Verman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, WAIT a minute, Verman!&rdquo; Sam entreated. &ldquo;Go on, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we can make a mighty good jungle up in the loft,&rdquo; Penrod continued
      eagerly. &ldquo;We can take that ole dead tree that's out in the alley and some
      branches, and I bet we could have the best jungle you ever saw. And then
      we'd fix up a kind of place in there for our panther, only, of course,
      we'd haf to keep him in the cage so's he wouldn't run away; but we'd
      pretend he was loose. And then you remember how they did with that calf?
      Well, we'd have Duke for the tied-up calf for the panther to come out and
      jump on, so they could fortygraph him. Herman can be the chief beater, and
      we'll let Verman be the other beaters, and I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; shouted Sam Williams. &ldquo;I'll be the fortygraph man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Penrod; &ldquo;you be the one with the gun that guards the fortygraph
      man, because I'm the fortygraph man already. You can fix up a mighty good
      gun with this carpenter shop, Sam. We'll make spears for our good ole
      beaters, too, and I'm goin' to make me a camera out o' that little
      starch-box and a bakin'-powder can that's goin' to be a mighty good ole
      camera. We can do lots more things&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; Sam cried. &ldquo;Let's get started!&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Wait a minute, Penrod.
      Verman says he won't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's got to!&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I momp!&rdquo; Verman insisted, almost distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to argue with him; but, for a time, Verman remained firm. They
      upheld the value of dramatic consistency, declaring that a beater dressed
      as completely as he was &ldquo;wouldn't look like anything at all&rdquo;. He would
      &ldquo;spoil the whole biznuss&rdquo;, they said, and they praised Herman for the
      faithful accuracy of his costume. They also insisted that the garment in
      question was much too large for Verman, anyway, having been so recently
      worn by Herman and turned over to Verman with insufficient alteration, and
      they expressed surprise that &ldquo;anybody with any sense&rdquo; should make such a
      point of clinging to a misfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman sided against his brother in this controversy, perhaps because a
      certain loneliness, of which he was censcious, might be assuaged by the
      company of another trouserless person&mdash;or it may be that his motive
      was more sombre. Possibly he remembered that Verman's trousers were his
      own former property and might fit him in case the promise for five o'clock
      turned out badly. At all events, Verman finally yielded under great
      pressure, and consented to appear in the proper costume of the multitude
      of beaters it now became his duty to personify.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouting, the boys dispersed to begin the preparation of their jungle
      scene. Sam and Penrod went for branches and the dead tree, while Herman
      and Verman carried the panther in his cage to the loft, where the first
      thing that Verman did was to hang his trousers on a nail in a conspicuous
      and accessible spot near the doorway. And with the arrival of Penrod and
      Sam, panting and dragging no inconsiderable thicket after them, the
      coloured brethren began to take a livelier interest in things. Indeed,
      when Penrod, a little later, placed in their hands two spears, pointed
      with tin, their good spirits were entirely restored, and they even began
      to take a pride in being properly uncostumed beaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam's gun and Penrod's camera were entirely satisfactory, especially the
      latter. The camera was so attractive, in fact, that the hunter and the
      chief beater and all the other beaters immediately resigned and insisted
      upon being photographers. Each had to be given a &ldquo;turn&rdquo; before the jungle
      project could be resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, for goodnesses' sakes,&rdquo; said Penrod, taking the camera from Verman,
      &ldquo;I hope you're done, so's we can get started doin something like we ought
      to! We got to have Duke for a tied-up calf. We'll have to bring him and
      tie him out here in front the jungle, and then the panther'll come out and
      jump on him. Wait, and I'll go bring him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Departing upon this errand, Penrod found Duke enjoying the declining rays
      of the sun in the front yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hyuh, Duke!&rdquo; called his master, in an indulgent tone. &ldquo;Come on, good ole
      Dukie! Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duke rose conscientiously and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got him, men!&rdquo; Penrod called from the stairway. &ldquo;I got our good ole
      calf all ready to be tied up. Here he is!&rdquo; And he appeared in the doorway
      with the unsuspecting little dog beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gipsy, who had been silent for some moments, instantly raised his banshee
      battlecry, and Duke yelped in horror. Penrod made a wild effort to hold
      him; but Duke was not to be detained. Unnatural strength and activity came
      to him in his delirium, and, for the second or two that the struggle
      lasted, his movements were too rapid for the eyes of the spectators to
      follow&mdash;merely a whirl and blur in the air could be seen. Then
      followed a sound of violent scrambling and Penrod sprawled alone at the
      top of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why'n't you come and help me?&rdquo; he demanded indignantly. &ldquo;I couldn't
      get him back now if I was to try a million years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we goin' to do about it?&rdquo; Sam asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod rose and dusted his knees. &ldquo;We got to get along without any tied-up
      calf&mdash;that's certain! But I got to take those fortygraphs SOME way or
      other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me an' Verman aw ready begin 'at beatin',&rdquo; Herman suggested. &ldquo;You tole us
      we the beaters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wait a minute,&rdquo; said Penrod, whose feeling for realism in drama was
      always alert. &ldquo;I want to get a mighty good pitcher o' that ole panther
      this time.&rdquo; As he spoke, he threw open the wide door intended for the
      delivery of hay into the loft from the alley below. &ldquo;Now, bring the cage
      over here by this door so's I can get a better light; it's gettin' kind of
      dark over where the jungle is. We'll pretend there isn't any cage there,
      and soon as I get him fortygraphed, I'll holler, 'Shoot, men!' Then you
      must shoot, Sam&mdash;and Herman, you and Verman must hammer on the cage
      with your spears, and holler: 'Hoo! Hoo!' and pretend you're spearin'
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we aw ready!&rdquo; said Herman. &ldquo;Hoo! Hoo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Penrod interposed, frowningly surveying the cage. &ldquo;I got
      to squat too much to get my camera fixed right.&rdquo; He assumed various solemn
      poses, to be interpreted as those of a photographer studying his subject.
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said finally; &ldquo;it won't take good that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gootness!&rdquo; Herman exclaimed. &ldquo;When we goin' begin 'at beatin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Apparently Penrod had solved a weighty problem. &ldquo;Bring that busted
      ole kitchen chair, and set the panther up on it. There! THAT'S the ticket!
      This way, it'll make a mighty good pitcher!&rdquo; He turned to Sam importantly.
      &ldquo;Well, Jim, is the chief and all his beaters here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Bill; all here,&rdquo; Sam responded, with an air of loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I guess we're ready,&rdquo; said Penrod, in his deepest voice.
      &ldquo;Beat, men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman and Verman were anxious to beat. They set up the loudest uproar of
      which they were capable. &ldquo;Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!&rdquo; they bellowed, flailing the
      branches with their spears and stamping heavily upon the floor. Sam,
      carried away by the elan of the performance, was unable to resist joining
      them. &ldquo;Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!&rdquo; And as the dust rose
      from the floor to their stamping, the three of them produced such a din
      and hoo-hooing as could be made by nothing on earth except boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, men!&rdquo; Penrod called, raising his voice to the utmost. &ldquo;Back for
      your lives. The PA-A-ANTHER! Now I'm takin' his pitcher. Click, click!
      Shoot, men; shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bing! Bing!&rdquo; shouted Sam, levelling his gun at the cage, while Herman and
      Verman hammered upon it, and Gipsy cursed boys, the world and the day he
      was born. &ldquo;Bing! Bing! Bing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You missed him!&rdquo; screamed Penrod. &ldquo;Give me that gun!&rdquo; And snatching it
      from Sam's unwilling hand, he levelled it at the cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;BING!&rdquo; he roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously there was the sound of another report; but this was an
      actual one and may best be symbolized by the statement that it was a
      whack. The recipient was Herman, and, outrageously surprised and pained,
      he turned to find himself face to face with a heavily built coloured woman
      who had recently ascended the stairs and approached the preoccupied
      hunters from the rear. In her hand was a lath, and, even as Herman turned,
      it was again wielded, this time upon Verman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MAMMY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you bettuh holler, 'Mammy!&rdquo;' she panted. &ldquo;My goo'ness, if yo' pappy
      don' lam you to-night! Ain' you got no mo' sense 'an to let white boys
      'suede you play you Affikin heathums? Whah you britches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonnuh Verman's,&rdquo; quavered Herman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whah y'own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Choking, Herman answered bravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'At ole cat tuck an' th'owed 'em down cistern!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Exasperated almost beyond endurance, she lifted the lath again. But
      unfortunately, in order to obtain a better field of action, she moved
      backward a little, coming in contact with the bars of the cage, a
      circumstance that she overlooked. More unfortunately still, the longing of
      the captive to express his feelings was such that he would have welcomed
      the opportunity to attack an elephant. He had been striking and scratching
      at inanimate things and at boys out of reach for the past hour; but here
      at last was his opportunity. He made the most of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I learn you tell me cat th'owed&mdash;OOOOH!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coloured woman leaped into the air like an athlete, and, turning with
      a swiftness astounding in one of her weight, beheld the semaphoric arm of
      Gipsy again extended between the bars and hopefully reaching for her.
      Beside herself, she lifted her right foot briskly from the ground, and
      allowed the sole of her shoe to come in contact with Gipsy's cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cage moved from the tottering chair beneath it. It passed through the
      yawning hay-door and fell resoundingly to the alley below, where&mdash;as
      Penrod and Sam, with cries of dismay, rushed to the door and looked down&mdash;it
      burst asunder and disgorged a large, bruised and chastened cat. Gipsy
      paused and bent one strange look upon the broken box. Then he shook his
      head and departed up the alley, the two boys watching him till he was out
      of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they turned, a harrowing procession issued from the carriage-house
      doors beneath them. Herman came first, hurriedly completing a temporary
      security in Verman's trousers. Verman followed, after a little reluctance
      that departed coincidentally with some inspiriting words from the rear. He
      crossed the alley hastily, and his Mammy stalked behind, using constant
      eloquence and a frequent lath. They went into the small house across the
      way and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sam turned to Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;was it on account of fortygraphing in the
      jungle you wanted to keep that cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that was a mighty fine-blooded cat. We'd of made some money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam jeered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean when we'd sell tickets to look at it in its cage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod shook his head, and if Gipsy could have overheard and understood
      his reply, that atrabilious spirit, almost broken by the events of the
      day, might have considered this last blow the most overwhelming of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Penrod; &ldquo;when she had kittens.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. A MODEL LETTER TO A FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Monday morning Penrod's faith in the coming of another Saturday was
      flaccid and lustreless. Those Japanese lovers who were promised a reunion
      after ten thousand years in separate hells were brighter with hope than he
      was. On Monday Penrod was virtually an agnostic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere upon his shining morning face could have been read any eager
      anticipation of useful knowledge. Of course he had been told that school
      was for his own good; in fact, he had been told and told and told, but the
      words conveying this information, meaningless at first, assumed, with each
      repetition, more and more the character of dull and unsolicited insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wholly unable to imagine circumstances, present or future, under
      which any of the instruction and training he was now receiving could be of
      the slightest possible use or benefit to himself; and when he was informed
      that such circumstances would frequently arise in his later life, he but
      felt the slur upon his coming manhood and its power to prevent any such
      unpleasantness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were possible to place a romantic young Broadway actor and athlete
      under hushing supervision for six hours a day, compelling him to bend his
      unremittent attention upon the city directory of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, he
      could scarce be expected to respond genially to frequent statements that
      the compulsion was all for his own good. On the contrary, it might be
      reasonable to conceive his response as taking the form of action, which is
      precisely the form that Penrod's smouldering impulse yearned to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Penrod school was merely a state of confinement, envenomed by
      mathematics. For interminable periods he was forced to listen to
      information concerning matters about which he had no curiosity whatever;
      and he had to read over and over the dullest passages in books that bored
      him into stupors, while always there overhung the preposterous task of
      improvising plausible evasions to conceal the fact that he did not know
      what he had no wish to know. Likewise, he must always be prepared to avoid
      incriminating replies to questions that he felt nobody had a real and
      natural right to ask him. And when his gorge rose and his inwards
      revolted, the hours became a series of ignoble misadventures and petty
      disgraces strikingly lacking in privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was usually upon Wednesday that his sufferings culminated; the nervous
      strength accumulated during the holiday hours at the end of the week would
      carry him through Monday and Tuesday; but by Wednesday it seemed
      ultimately proven that the next Saturday actually never was coming, &ldquo;this
      time&rdquo;, and the strained spirit gave way. Wednesday was the day averaging
      highest in Penrod's list of absences; but the time came when he felt that
      the advantages attendant upon his Wednesday &ldquo;sick headache&rdquo; did not
      compensate for its inconveniences.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one thing, this illness had become so symmetrically recurrent that
      even the cook felt that he was pushing it too far, and the liveliness of
      her expression, when he was able to leave his couch and take the air in
      the backyard at about ten o'clock, became more disagreeable to him with
      each convalescence. There visibly increased, too, about the whole
      household, an atmosphere of uncongeniality and suspicion so pronounced
      that every successive illness was necessarily more severe, and at last the
      patient felt obliged to remain bedded until almost eleven, from time to
      time giving forth pathetic little sounds eloquent of anguish triumphing
      over Stoic endurance, yet lacking a certain conviction of utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, his father enacted, and his mother applied, a new and distinctly
      special bit of legislation, explaining it with simple candour to the
      prospective beneficiary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you really ARE sick,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you can go out and play as
      soon as you're well&mdash;that is, if it happens on Saturday. But when
      you're sick on a school-day, you'll stay in bed till the next morning.
      This is going to do you good, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Physically, their opinion appeared to be affirmed, for Wednesday after
      Wednesday passed without any recurrence of the attack; but the spiritual
      strain may have been damaging. And it should be added that if Penrod's
      higher nature did suffer from the strain, he was not unique. For,
      confirming the effect of Wednesday upon boys in general, it is probable
      that, if full statistics concerning cats were available, they would show
      that cats dread Wednesdays, and that their fear is shared by other
      animals, and would be shared, to an extent by windows, if windows
      possessed nervous systems. Nor must this probable apprehension on the part
      of cats and the like be thought mere superstition. Cats have
      superstitions, it is true; but certain actions inspired by the sight of a
      boy with a missile in his hand are better evidence of the workings of
      logic upon a practical nature than of faith in the supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the attention of family physicians and specialists should be
      drawn to these significant though obscure phenomena; for the suffering of
      cats is a barometer of the nerve-pressure of boys, and it may be accepted
      as sufficiently established that Wednesday&mdash;after school-hours&mdash;is
      the worst time for cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the promulgation of that parental edict, &ldquo;You'll stay in bed till
      the next morning&rdquo;, four weeks went by unflawed by a single absence from
      the field of duty; but, when the fifth Wednesday came, Penrod held sore
      debate within himself before he finally rose. In fact, after rising, and
      while actually engaged with his toilet, he tentatively emitted the series
      of little moans that was his wonted preliminary to a quiet holiday at
      home; and the sound was heard (as intended) by Mr. Schofield, who was
      passing Penrod's door on his way to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ALL right!&rdquo; the father said, making use of peculiar and unnecessary
      emphasis. &ldquo;Stay in bed till to-morrow morning. Castor-oil, this time,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod had not hoped much for his experiment; nevertheless his rebellious
      blood was sensibly inflamed by the failure, and he accompanied his
      dressing with a low murmuring&mdash;apparently a bitter dialogue between
      himself and some unknown but powerful patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they better NOT!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, what can I DO about it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I'D show
      'em!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I WILL show 'em!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you OUGHT to show 'em; that's the
      way <i>I</i> do! I just shake 'em around, and say, 'Here! I guess you
      don't know who you're talkin' to like that! You better look out!'&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
      that's the way <i>I</i>'m goin' to do!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, go on and DO it, then!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Well, I AM goin'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the next room was slightly ajar; now it swung wide, and
      Margaret appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod, what on earth are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. None o' your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hurry to breakfast, then; it's getting late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lightly she went, humming a tune, leaving the door of her room open, and
      the eyes of Penrod, as he donned his jacket, chanced to fall upon her
      desk, where she had thoughtlessly left a letter&mdash;a private missive
      just begun, and intended solely for the eyes of Mr. Robert Williams, a
      senior at a far university.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a fashion is coincidence the architect of misfortune. Penrod's
      class in English composition had been instructed, the previous day, to
      concoct at home and bring to class on Wednesday morning, &ldquo;a model letter
      to a friend on some subject of general interest.&rdquo; Penalty for omission to
      perform this simple task was definite; whosoever brought no letter would
      inevitably be &ldquo;kept in&rdquo; after school, that afternoon, until the letter was
      written, and it was precisely a premonition of this misfortune that had
      prompted Penrod to attempt his experimental moaning upon his father, for,
      alas! he had equipped himself with no model letter, nor any letter
      whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In stress of this kind, a boy's creed is that anything is worth a try; but
      his eye for details is poor. He sees the future too sweepingly and too
      much as he would have it seldom providing against inconsistencies of
      evidence that may damage him. For instance, there is a well-known case of
      two brothers who exhibited to their parents, with pathetic confidence,
      several imported dried herring on a string, as a proof that the afternoon
      had been spent, not at a forbidden circus, but with hook and line upon the
      banks of a neighbouring brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with Penrod. He had vital need of a letter, and there before his eyes,
      upon Margaret's desk, was apparently the precise thing he needed!
    </p>
    <p>
      From below rose the voice of his mother urging him to the breakfast-table,
      warning him that he stood in danger of tardiness at school; he was pressed
      for time, and acted upon an inspiration that failed to prompt him even to
      read the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly he wrote &ldquo;Dear freind&rdquo; at the top of the page Margaret had
      partially filled. Then he signed himself &ldquo;Yours respectfuly, Penrod
      Schofield&rdquo; at the bottom, and enclosed the missive within a battered
      volume entitled, &ldquo;Principles of English Composition.&rdquo; With that and other
      books compacted by a strap, he descended to a breakfast somewhat
      oppressive but undarkened by any misgivings concerning a &ldquo;letter to a
      friend on some subject of general interest.&rdquo; He felt that a difficulty had
      been encountered and satisfactorily disposed of; the matter could now be
      dismissed from his mind. He had plenty of other difficulties to take its
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; he had no misgivings, nor was he assailed by anything unpleasant in
      that line, even when the hour struck for the class in English composition.
      If he had been two or three years older, experience might have warned him
      to take at least the precaution of copying his offering, so that it would
      appear in his own handwriting when he &ldquo;handed it in&rdquo;; but Penrod had not
      even glanced at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Miss Spence said, &ldquo;I will ask several of you to read your
      letters aloud before you hand them in. Clara Raypole, you may read yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was bored but otherwise comfortable; he had no apprehension that he
      might be included in the &ldquo;several,&rdquo; especially as Miss Spence's beginning
      with Clara Raypole, a star performer, indicated that her selection of
      readers would be made from the conscientious and proficient division at
      the head of the class. He listened stoically to the beginning of the first
      letter, though he was conscious of a dull resentment, inspired mainly by
      the perfect complacency of Miss Raypole's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dear Cousin Sadie,'&rdquo; she began smoothly, &ldquo;'I thought I would write you
      to-day on some subject of general interest, and so I thought I would tell
      you about the subject of our court-house. It is a very fine building
      situated in the centre of the city, and a visit to the building after
      school hours well repays for the visit. Upon entrance we find upon our
      left the office of the county clerk and upon our right a number of windows
      affording a view of the street. And so we proceed, finding on both sides
      much of general interest. The building was begun in 1886 A.D. and it was
      through in 1887 A.D. It is four stories high and made of stone, pressed
      brick, wood, and tiles, with a tower, or cupola, one hundred and
      twenty-seven feet seven inches from the ground. Among other subjects of
      general interest told by the janitor, we learn that the architect of the
      building was a man named Flanner, and the foundations extend fifteen feet
      five inches under the ground.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was unable to fix his attention upon these statistics; he began
      moodily to twist a button of his jacket and to concentrate a new-born and
      obscure but lasting hatred upon the court-house. Miss Raypole's glib voice
      continued to press upon his ears; but, by keeping his eyes fixed upon the
      twisting button he had accomplished a kind of self-hypnosis, or mental
      anaesthesia, and was but dimly aware of what went on about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court-house was finally exhausted by its visitor, who resumed her seat
      and submitted with beamish grace to praise. Then Miss Spence said, in a
      favourable manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie Bassett, you may read your letter next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The neat Georgie rose, nothing loath, and began: &ldquo;'Dear Teacher&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight titter, which Miss Spence suppressed. Georgie was not
      at all discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My mother says,'&rdquo; he continued, reading his manuscript, &ldquo;'we should
      treat our teacher as a friend, and so <i>I</i> will write YOU a letter.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This penetrated Penrod's trance, and he lifted his eyes to fix them upon
      the back of Georgie Bassett's head in a long and inscrutable stare. It was
      inscrutable, and yet if Georgie had been sensitive to thought waves, it is
      probable that he would have uttered a loud shriek; but he remained
      placidly unaware, continuing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I thought I would write you about a subject of general interest, and so
      I will write you about the flowers. There are many kinds of flowers,
      spring flowers, and summer flowers, and autumn flowers, but no winter
      flowers. Wild flowers grow in the woods, and it is nice to hunt them in
      springtime, and we must remember to give some to the poor and hospitals,
      also. Flowers can be made to grow in flower-beds and placed in vases in
      houses. There are many names for flowers, but <i>I</i> call them &ldquo;nature's
      ornaments.&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's gaze had relaxed, drooped to his button again, and his lethargy
      was renewed. The outer world grew vaguer; voices seemed to drone at a
      distance; sluggish time passed heavily&mdash;but some of it did pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Spence's searching eye had taken note of the bent head and the
      twisting button. She found it necessary to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came languidly to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may read your letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he began to paw clumsily among his books, whereupon Miss Spence's
      glance fired with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you prepared one?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; said Penrod dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're going to find you forgot to bring it, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got it,&rdquo; said Penrod, discovering the paper in his &ldquo;Principles of
      English Composition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll listen to what you've found time to prepare,&rdquo; she said,
      adding coldly, &ldquo;for once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The frankest pessimism concerning Penrod permeated the whole room; even
      the eyes of those whose letters had not met with favour turned upon him
      with obvious assurance that here was every prospect of a performance that
      would, by comparison, lend a measure of credit to the worst preceding it.
      But Penrod was unaffected by the general gaze; he rose, still blinking
      from his lethargy, and in no true sense wholly alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had one idea: to read as rapidly as possible, so as to be done with the
      task, and he began in a high-pitched monotone, reading with a blind mind
      and no sense of the significance of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dear friend,&rdquo;' he declaimed. &ldquo;'You call me beautiful, but I am not
      really beautiful, and there are times when I doubt if I am even pretty,
      though perhaps my hair is beautiful, and if it is true that my eyes are
      like blue stars in heaven&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously he lost his breath and there burst upon him a perception of
      the results to which he was being committed by this calamitous reading.
      And also simultaneous the outbreak of the class into cachinnations of
      delight, severely repressed by the perplexed but indignant Miss Spence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she commanded grimly, when she had restored order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo; he gulped, looking wretchedly upon the rosy faces all about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with the description of yourself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We'd like to hear
      some more about your eyes being like blue stars in heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here many of Penrod's little comrades were forced to clasp their faces
      tightly in both hands; and his dismayed gaze, in refuge, sought the
      treacherous paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      What it beheld there was horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed!&rdquo; Miss Spence said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I&mdash;often think,'&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;'and a-a tree-more th-thrills my
      bein' when I REcall your last words to me&mdash;that last&mdash;that last&mdash;that&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GO ON!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That last evening in the moonlight when you&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; Miss Spence said dangerously, &ldquo;you go on, and stop that
      stammering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You&mdash;you said you would wait for&mdash;for years to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PENROD!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To win me!'&rdquo; the miserable Penrod managed to gasp. &ldquo;'I should not have
      pre&mdash;premitted&mdash;permitted you to speak so until we have our&mdash;our
      parents' con-consent; but oh, how sweet it&mdash;'&rdquo; He exhaled a sigh of
      agony, and then concluded briskly, &ldquo;'Yours respectfully, Penrod
      Schofield.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Spence had at last divined something, for she knew the Schofield
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me that letter!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the scarlet boy passed forward between rows of mystified but
      immoderately uplifted children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Spence herself grew rather pink as she examined the missive, and the
      intensity with which she afterward extended her examination to cover the
      complete field of Penrod Schofield caused him to find a remote centre of
      interest whereon to rest his embarrassed gaze. She let him stand before
      her throughout a silence, equalled, perhaps, by the tenser pauses during
      trials for murder, and then, containing herself, she sweepingly gestured
      him to the pillory&mdash;a chair upon the platform, facing the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he suffered for the unusual term of an hour, with many jocular and
      cunning eyes constantly upon him; and, when he was released at noon,
      horrid shouts and shrieks pursued him every step of his homeward way. For
      his laughter-loving little schoolmates spared him not&mdash;neither boy
      nor girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay, Penrod!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;How's your beautiful hair?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Hi,
      Penrod! When you goin' to get your parents' consent?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Say, blue
      stars in heaven, how's your beautiful eyes?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Say, Penrod, how's your
      tree-mores?&rdquo; &ldquo;Does your tree-mores thrill your bein', Penrod?&rdquo; And many
      other facetious inquiries, hard to bear in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he reached the temporary shelter of his home, he experienced no
      relief upon finding that Margaret was out for lunch. He was as deeply
      embittered toward her as toward any other, and, considering her largely
      responsible for his misfortune, he would have welcomed an opportunity to
      show her what he thought of her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. WEDNESDAY MADNESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      How long he was &ldquo;kept in&rdquo; after school that afternoon is not a matter of
      record; but it was long. Before he finally appeared upon the street, he
      had composed an ample letter on a subject of general interest, namely
      &ldquo;School Life&rdquo;, under the supervision of Miss Spencer. He had also received
      some scorching admonitions in respect to honourable behaviour regarding
      other people's letters; and Margaret's had been returned to him with
      severe instructions to bear it straight to the original owner accompanied
      by full confession and apology. As a measure of insurance that these
      things be done, Miss Spence stated definitely her intention to hold a
      conversation by telephone with Margaret that evening. Altogether, the day
      had been unusually awful, even for Wednesday, and Penrod left the
      school-house with the heart of an anarchist throbbing in his hot bosom. It
      were more accurate, indeed, to liken him to the anarchist's characteristic
      weapon; for as Penrod came out to the street he was, in all inward
      respects, a bomb, loaded and ticking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked moodily, with a visible aspect of soreness. A murmurous sound
      was thick about his head, wherefore it is to be surmised that he communed
      with his familiar, and one vehement, oft-repeated phrase beat like a
      tocsin of revolt upon the air: &ldquo;Daw-gone 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meant everybody&mdash;the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly included, evidently, was a sparrow, offensively cheerful upon
      a lamp-post. This self-centred little bird allowed a pebble to pass
      overhead and remained unconcerned, but, a moment later, feeling a jar
      beneath his feet, and hearing the tinkle of falling glass, he decided to
      leave. Similarly, and at the same instant, Penrod made the same decision,
      and the sparrow in flight took note of a boy likewise in flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy disappeared into the nearest alley and emerged therefrom,
      breathless, in the peaceful vicinity of his own home. He entered the
      house, clumped upstairs and down, discovered Margaret reading a book in
      the library, and flung the accursed letter toward her with loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take the old thing,&rdquo; he said bitterly. &ldquo;<i>I</i> don't want it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before she was able to reply, he was out of the room. The next moment
      he was out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daw-GONE 'em!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, across the street, his soured eye fell upon his true comrade and
      best friend leaning against a picket fence and holding desultory converse
      with Mabel Rorebeck, an attractive member of the Friday Afternoon Dancing
      Class, that hated organization of which Sam and Penrod were both members.
      Mabel was a shy little girl; but Penrod had a vague understanding that Sam
      considered her two brown pig-tails beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Howbeit, Sam had never told his love; he was, in fact, sensitive about it.
      This meeting with the lady was by chance, and, although it afforded
      exquisite moments, his heart was beating in an unaccustomed manner, and he
      was suffering from embarrassment, being at a loss, also, for subjects of
      conversation. It is, indeed, no easy matter to chat easily with a person,
      however lovely and beloved, who keeps her face turned the other way,
      maintains one foot in rapid and continuous motion through an arc seemingly
      perilous to her equilibrium, and confines her responses, both affirmative
      and negative, to &ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, Sam was sufficiently nervous without any help from Penrod, and
      it was with pure horror that he heard his own name and Mabel's shrieked
      upon the ambient air with viperish insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam-my and May-bul! OH, oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam started violently. Mabel ceased to swing her foot, and both,
      encarnadined, looked up and down and everywhere for the invisible but
      well-known owner of that voice. It came again, in taunting mockery:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Sammy's mad, and I am glad,
     And I know what will please him:
       A bottle o' wine to make him shine,
     And Mabel Rorebeck to squeeze him!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fresh ole thing!&rdquo; said Miss Rorebeck, becoming articulate. And
      unreasonably including Sam in her indignation, she tossed her head at him
      with an unmistakable effect of scorn. She began to walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mabel,&rdquo; Sam said plaintively, following, &ldquo;it ain't MY fault. <i>I</i>
      didn't do anything. It's Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; she began pettishly, when the viperish voice was again
      lifted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! Who's your beau? Guess <i>I</i> know: Mabel and Sammy, oh,
      oh, oh! <i>I</i> caught you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mabel did one of those things that eternally perplex the slower sex.
      She deliberately made a face, not at the tree behind which Penrod was
      lurking, but at the innocent and heart-wrung Sam. &ldquo;You needn't come
      limpin' after me, Sam Williams!&rdquo; she said, though Sam was approaching upon
      two perfectly sound legs. And then she ran away at the top of her speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run, rigger, run!&rdquo; Penrod began inexcusably. But Sam cut the persecutions
      short at this point. Stung to fury, he charged upon the sheltering tree in
      the Schofields' yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily, at such a juncture, Penrod would have fled, keeping his own
      temper and increasing the heat of his pursuer's by back-flung jeers. But
      this was Wednesday, and he was in no mood to run from Sam. He stepped away
      from the tree, awaiting the onset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what you goin' to do so much?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam did not pause to proffer the desired information. &ldquo;'Tcha got'ny
      SENSE!&rdquo; was the total extent of his vocal preliminaries before flinging
      himself headlong upon the taunter; and the two boys went to the ground
      together. Embracing, they rolled, they pommelled, they hammered, they
      kicked. Alas, this was a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose, flailing a while, then renewed their embrace, and, grunting,
      bestowed themselves anew upon our ever too receptive Mother Earth. Once
      more upon their feet, they beset each other sorely, dealing many great
      blows, ofttimes upon the air, but with sufficient frequency upon resentful
      flesh. Tears were jolted to the rims of eyes, but technically they did not
      weep. &ldquo;Got'ny sense,&rdquo; was repeated chokingly many, many times; also, &ldquo;Dern
      ole fool!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;I'll SHOW you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peacemaker who appeared upon the animated scene was Penrod's
      great-uncle Slocum. This elderly relative had come to call upon Mrs.
      Schofield, and he was well upon his way to the front door when the
      mutterings of war among some shrubberies near the fence caused him to
      deflect his course in benevolent agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys! Boys! Shame, boys!&rdquo; he said; but, as the originality of these
      expressions did not prove striking enough to attract any great attention
      from the combatants, he felt obliged to assume a share in the proceedings.
      It was a share entailing greater activity than he had anticipated, and,
      before he managed to separate the former friends, he intercepted bodily an
      amount of violence to which he was wholly unaccustomed. Additionally, his
      attire was disarranged; his hat was no longer upon his head, and his
      temper was in a bad way. In fact, as his hat flew off, he made use of
      words that under less extreme circumstances would have caused both boys to
      feel a much profounder interest than they did in great-uncle Slocum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll GET you!&rdquo; Sam babbled. &ldquo;Don't you ever dare to speak to me again,
      Penrod Schofield, long as you live, or I'll whip you worse'n I have this
      time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod squawked. For the moment he was incapable of coherent speech, and
      then, failing in a convulsive attempt to reach his enemy, his fury
      culminated upon an innocent object that had never done him the slightest
      harm. Great-uncle Slocum's hat lay upon the ground close by, and Penrod
      was in the state of irritation that seeks an outlet too blindly&mdash;as
      people say, he &ldquo;HAD to do SOMETHING!&rdquo; He kicked great-uncle Slocum's hat
      with such sweep and precision that it rose swiftly, and, breasting the
      autumn breeze, passed over the fence and out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great-uncle Slocum uttered a scream of anguish, and, immediately ceasing
      to peacemake, ran forth to a more important rescue; but the conflict was
      not renewed. Sanity had returned to Sam Williams; he was awed by this
      colossal deed of Penrod's and filled with horror at the thaught that he
      might be held as accessory to it. Fleetly he fled, pursued as far as the
      gate by the whole body of Penrod, and thereafter by Penrod's voice alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You BETTER run! You wait till I catch you! You'll see what you get next
      time! Don't you ever speak to me again as long as you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he paused abruptly, for great-uncle Slocum had recovered his hat and
      was returning toward the gate. After one glance at great-uncle Slocum,
      Penrod did not linger to attempt any explanation&mdash;there are times
      when even a boy can see that apologies would seem out of place. Penrod ran
      round the house to the backyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was enthusiastically greeted by Duke. &ldquo;You get away from me!&rdquo;
       Penrod said hoarsely, and with terrible gestures he repulsed the faithful
      animal, who retired philosophically to the stable, while his master let
      himself out of the back gate. Penrod had decided to absent himself from
      home for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky was gray, and there were hints of coming dusk in the air; it was
      an hour suited to his turbulent soul, and he walked with a sombre swagger.
      &ldquo;Ran like a c'ardy-calf!&rdquo; he sniffed, half aloud, alluding to the haste of
      Sam Williams in departure. &ldquo;All he is, ole c'ardy-calf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he proceeded up the alley, a hated cry smote his ears: &ldquo;Hi,
      Penrod! How's your tree-mores?&rdquo; And two jovial schoolboy faces appeared
      above a high board fence. &ldquo;How's your beautiful hair, Penrod?&rdquo; they
      vociferated. &ldquo;When you goin' to git your parents' consent? What makes you
      think you're only pretty, ole blue stars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod looked about feverishly for a missile, and could find none to his
      hand, but the surface of the alley sufficed; he made mud balls and
      fiercely bombarded the vociferous fence. Naturally, hostile mud balls
      presently issued from behind this barricade; and thus a campaign developed
      that offered a picture not unlike a cartoonist's sketch of a political
      campaign, wherein this same material is used for the decoration of
      opponents. But Penrod had been unwise; he was outnumbered, and the hostile
      forces held the advantageous side of the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mud balls can be hard as well as soggy; some of those that reached Penrod
      were of no inconsiderable weight and substance, and they made him grunt
      despite himself. Finally, one, at close range, struck him in the pit of
      the stomach, whereupon he clasped himself about the middle silently, and
      executed some steps in seeming imitation of a quaint Indian dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His plight being observed through a knothole, his enemies climbed upon the
      fence and regarded him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, YOU'RE all right, ain't you, old tree-mores?&rdquo; inquired one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll SHOW you!&rdquo; bellowed Penrod, recovering his breath; and he hurled a
      fat ball&mdash;thoughtfully retained in hand throughout his agony&mdash;to
      such effect that his interrogator disappeared backward from the fence
      without having taken any initiative of his own in the matter. His comrade
      impulsively joined him upon the ground, and the battle continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the gathering dusk it went on. It waged but the hotter as darkness
      made aim more difficult&mdash;and still Penrod would not be driven from
      the field. Panting, grunting, hoarse from returning insults, fighting on
      and on, an indistinguishable figure in the gloom, he held the back alley
      against all comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For such a combat darkness has one great advantage; but it has an equally
      important disadvantage&mdash;the combatant cannot see to aim; on the other
      hand, he cannot see to dodge. And all the while Penrod was receiving two
      for one. He became heavy with mud. Plastered, impressionistic and
      sculpturesque, there was about him a quality of the tragic, of the
      magnificent. He resembled a sombre masterpiece by Rodin. No one could have
      been quite sure what he was meant for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner bells tinkled in houses. Then they were rung from kitchen doors.
      Calling voices came urging from the distance, calling boys' names into the
      darkness. They called and a note of irritation seemed to mar their beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then bells were rung again&mdash;and the voices renewed appeals more
      urgent, much more irritated. They called and called and called.
    </p>
    <p>
      THUD! went the mud balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thud! Thud! Blunk!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OOF!&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Sam Williams, having dined with his family at their usual hour, seven,
      slipped unostentatiously out of the kitchen door, as soon as he could,
      after the conclusion of the meal, and quietly betook himself to the
      Schofields' corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he stationed himself where he could see all avenues of approach to
      the house, and waited. Twenty minutes went by, and then Sam became
      suddenly alert and attentive, for the arc-light revealed a small,
      grotesque figure slowly approaching along the sidewalk. It was brown in
      colour, shaggy and indefinite in form; it limped excessively, and paused
      to rub itself, and to meditate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peculiar as the thing was, Sam had no doubt as to its identity. He
      advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lo, Penrod,&rdquo; he said cautiously, and with a shade of formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod leaned against the fence, and, lifting one leg, tested the
      knee-joint by swinging his foot back and forth, a process evidently
      provocative of a little pain. Then he rubbed the left side of his
      encrusted face, and, opening his mouth to its whole capacity as an
      aperture, moved his lower jaw slightly from side to side, thus
      triumphantly settling a question in his own mind as to whether or no a
      suspected dislocation had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having satisfied himself on these points, he examined both shins
      delicately by the sense of touch, and carefully tested the capacities of
      his neck-muscles to move his head in a wonted manner. Then he responded
      somewhat gruffly: &ldquo;'Lo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Where you been?&rdquo; Sam said eagerly, his formality
      vanishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havin' a mud-fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you did!&rdquo; Sam exclaimed, in a low voice. &ldquo;What you goin' to tell
      your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister telephoned to our house to see if I knew where you were,&rdquo;
       said Sam. &ldquo;She told me if I saw you before you got home to tell you
      sumpthing; but not to say anything about it. She said Miss Spence had
      telephoned to her, but she said for me to tell you it was all right about
      that letter, and she wasn't goin' to tell your mother and father on you,
      so you needn't say anything about it to 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Penrod indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says you're goin' to be in enough trouble without that,&rdquo; Sam went on.
      &ldquo;You're goin' to catch fits about your Uncle Slocum's hat, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about not comin' home to dinner, too. Your mother telephoned twice to
      Mamma while we were eatin' to see if you'd come in our house. And when
      they SEE you&mdash;MY, but you're goin' to get the DICKENS, Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod seemed unimpressed, though he was well aware that Sam's prophecy
      was no unreasonable one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I know it,&rdquo; he repeated casually. And he moved slowly
      toward his own gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend looked after him curiously&mdash;then, as the limping figure
      fumbled clumsily with bruised fingers at the latch of the gate, there
      sounded a little solicitude in Sam's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Penrod, how&mdash;how do you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel pretty bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Penrod, and, in spite of what awaited him beyond the lighted
      portals just ahead, he spoke the truth. His nerves were rested, and his
      soul was at peace. His Wednesday madness was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Penrod; &ldquo;I feel bully!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. PENROD'S BUSY DAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although the pressure had thus been relieved and Penrod found peace with
      himself, nevertheless there were times during the rest of that week when
      he felt a strong distaste for Margaret. His schoolmates frequently
      reminded him of such phrases in her letter as they seemed least able to
      forget, and for hours after each of these experiences he was unable to
      comport himself with human courtesy when constrained (as at dinner) to
      remain for any length of time in the same room with her. But by Sunday
      these moods had seemed to pass; he attended church in her close company,
      and had no thought of the troubles brought upon him by her correspondence
      with a person who throughout remained unknown to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod slumped far down in the pew with his knees against the back of that
      in front, and he also languished to one side, so that the people sitting
      behind were afforded a view of him consisting of a little hair and one
      bored ear. The sermon&mdash;a noble one, searching and eloquent&mdash;was
      but a persistent sound in that ear, though, now and then, Penrod's
      attention would be caught by some detached portion of a sentence, when his
      mind would dwell dully upon the phrases for a little while and lapse into
      a torpor. At intervals his mother, without turning her head, would
      whisper, &ldquo;Sit up, Penrod,&rdquo; causing him to sigh profoundly and move his
      shoulders about an inch, this mere gesture of compliance exhausting all
      the energy that remained to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black backs and gray heads of the elderly men in the congregation
      oppressed him; they made him lethargic with a sense of long lives of
      repellent dullness. But he should have been grateful to the lady with the
      artificial cherries upon her hat. His gaze lingered there, wandered away,
      and hopelessly returned again and again, to be a little refreshed by the
      glossy scarlet of the cluster of tiny globes. He was not so fortunate as
      to be drowsy; that would have brought him some relief&mdash;and yet, after
      a while, his eyes became slightly glazed; he saw dimly, and what he saw
      was distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church had been built in the early 'Seventies, and it contained some
      naive stained glass of that period. The arch at the top of a window facing
      Penrod was filled with a gigantic Eye. Of oyster-white and raw blues and
      reds, inflamed by the pouring sun, it had held an awful place in the
      infantile life of Penrod Schofield, for in his tenderer years he accepted
      it without question as the literal Eye of Deity. He had been informed that
      the church was the divine dwelling&mdash;and there was the Eye!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, being no longer a little child, he had somehow come to know
      better without being told, and, though the great flaming Eye was no longer
      the terrifying thing it had been to him during his childhood, it
      nevertheless retained something of its ominous character. It made him feel
      spied upon, and its awful glare still pursued him, sometimes, as he was
      falling asleep at night. When he faced the window his feeling was one of
      dull resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own glazed eyes, becoming slightly crossed with an ennui that was
      peculiarly intense this morning, rendered the Eye more monstrous than it
      was. It expanded to horrible size, growing mountainous; it turned into a
      volcano in the tropics, and yet it stared at him, indubitably an Eye
      implacably hostile to all rights of privacy forever. Penrod blinked and
      clinched his eyelids to be rid of this dual image, and he managed to shake
      off the volcano. Then, lowering the angle of his glance, he saw something
      most remarkable&mdash;and curiously out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inverted white soup-plate was lying miraculously balanced upon the back
      of a pew a little distance in front of him, and upon the upturned bottom
      of the soup-plate was a brown cocoanut. Mildly surprised, Penrod yawned,
      and, in the effort to straighten his eyes, came to life temporarily. The
      cocoanut was revealed as Georgie Bassett's head, and the soup-plate as
      Georgie's white collar. Georgie was sitting up straight, as he always did
      in church, and Penrod found this vertical rectitude unpleasant. He knew
      that he had more to fear from the Eye than Georgie had, and he was under
      the impression (a correct one) that Georgie felt on intimate terms with it
      and was actually fond of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod himself would have maintained that he was fond of it, if he had
      been asked. He would have said so because he feared to say otherwise; and
      the truth is that he never consciously looked at the Eye disrespectfully.
      He would have been alarmed if he thought the Eye had any way of finding
      out how he really felt about it. When not off his guard, he always looked
      at it placatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, he sagged so far to the left that he had symptoms of a &ldquo;stitch
      in the side&rdquo;, and, rousing himself, sat partially straight for several
      moments. Then he rubbed his shoulders slowly from side to side against the
      back of the seat, until his mother whispered, &ldquo;Don't do that, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, he allowed himself to slump inwardly till the curve in the back
      of his neck rested against the curved top of the back of the seat. It was
      a congenial fit, and Penrod again began to move slowly from side to side,
      finding the friction soothing. Even so slight a pleasure was denied him by
      a husky, &ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; from his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod sighed, and slid farther down. He scratched his head, his left
      knee, his right biceps and his left ankle, after which he scratched his
      right knee, his right ankle and his left biceps. Then he said, &ldquo;Oh, hum!&rdquo;
       unconsciously, but so loudly that there was a reproving stir in the
      neighbourhood of the Schofield pew, and his father looked at him angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, his nose began to trouble him. It itched, and after scratching
      it, he rubbed it harshly. Another &ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; from his father proved of
      no avail, being greeted by a desperate-sounding whisper, &ldquo;I GOT to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, continuing to rub his nose with his right hand, Penrod began to
      search his pockets with his left. The quest proving fruitless, he rubbed
      his nose with his left hand and searched with his right. Then he abandoned
      his nose and searched feverishly with both hands, going through all of his
      pockets several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What DO you want?&rdquo; whispered his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Margaret had divined his need, and she passed him her own
      handkerchief. This was both thoughtful and thoughtless&mdash;the latter
      because Margaret was in the habit of thinking that she became faint in
      crowds, especially at the theatre or in church, and she had just soaked
      her handkerchief with spirits of ammonia from a small phial she carried in
      her muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod hastily applied the handkerchief to his nose and even more hastily
      exploded. He sneezed stupendously; he choked, sneezed again, wept, passed
      into a light convulsion of coughing and sneezing together&mdash;a mergence
      of sound that attracted much attention&mdash;and, after a few recurrent
      spasms, convalesced into a condition marked by silent tears and only
      sporadic instances of sneezing.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time his family were unanimously scarlet&mdash;his father and
      mother with mortification, and Margaret with the effort to control the
      almost irresistible mirth that the struggles and vociferations of Penrod
      had inspired within her. And yet her heart misgave her, for his bloodshot
      and tearful eyes were fixed upon her from the first and remained upon her,
      even when half-blinded with his agony; and their expression&mdash;as
      terrible as that of the windowed Eye confronting her&mdash;was not for an
      instant to be misunderstood. Absolutely, he believed that she had handed
      him the ammonia-soaked handkerchief deliberately and with malice, and well
      she knew that no power on earth could now or at any time henceforth
      persuade him otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I didn't mean it, Penrod,&rdquo; she said, at the first opportunity
      upon their homeward way. &ldquo;I didn't notice&mdash;that is, I didn't think&mdash;&rdquo;
       Unfortunately for the effect of sincerity she hoped to produce, her voice
      became tremulous and her shoulders moved suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just you wait! You'll see!&rdquo; he prophesied, in a voice now choking, not
      with ammonia, but with emotion. &ldquo;Poison a person, and then laugh in his
      face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spake no more until they had reached their own house, though she made
      some further futile efforts at explanation and apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after brooding abysmally throughout the meal that followed, he
      disappeared from the sight of his family, having answered with one
      frightful look his mother's timid suggestion that it was almost time for
      Sunday-school. He retired to his eyry&mdash;the sawdust box in the empty
      stable&mdash;and there gave rein to his embittered imaginings,
      incidentally forming many plans for Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of these were much too elaborate; but one was so alluring that he
      dwelt upon it, working out the details with gloomy pleasure, even after he
      had perceived its defects. It involved some postponement&mdash;in fact,
      until Margaret should have become the mother of a boy about Penrod's
      present age. This boy would be precisely like Georgie Bassett&mdash;Penrod
      conceived that as inevitable&mdash;and, like Georgie, he would be his
      mother's idol. Penrod meant to take him to church and force him to blow
      his nose with an ammonia-soaked handkerchief in the presence of the Eye
      and all the congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Penrod intended to say to this boy, after church, &ldquo;Well, that's
      exackly what your mother did to me, and if you don't like it, you better
      look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the real Penrod in the sawdust box clenched his fists. &ldquo;Come ahead,
      then!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You talk too much!&rdquo; Whereupon, the Penrod of his
      dream gave Margaret's puny son a contemptuous thrashing under the eyes of
      his mother, who besought in vain for mercy. This plan was finally dropped,
      not because of any lingering nepotism within Penrod, but because his
      injury called for action less belated.
    </p>
    <p>
      One after another, he thought of impossible things; one after another, he
      thought of things merely inane and futile, for he was trying to do
      something beyond his power. Penrod was never brilliant, or even
      successful, save by inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o'clock he came into the house, still nebulous, and as he passed
      the open door of the library he heard a man's voice, not his father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; said this voice, &ldquo;the finest lines in all literature are those in
      Tennyson's 'Maud'&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Had it lain for a century dead, My dust would hear her and beat, And
      blossom in purple and red, There somewhere around near her feet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have quoted correctly,&rdquo; continued the voice nervously, &ldquo;but, at
      any rate, what I wished to&mdash;ah&mdash;say was that I often think of
      those ah&mdash;words; but I never think of them without thinking of&mdash;of&mdash;of
      YOU. I&mdash;ah&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nervous voice paused, and Penrod took an oblique survey of the room,
      himself unobserved. Margaret was seated in an easy chair and her face was
      turned away from Penrod, so that her expression of the moment remained
      unknown to him. Facing her, and leaning toward her with perceptible
      emotion, was Mr. Claude Blakely&mdash;a young man with whom Penrod had no
      acquaintance, though he had seen him, was aware of his identity, and had
      heard speech between Mrs. Schofield and Margaret which indicated that Mr.
      Blakely had formed the habit of calling frequently at the house. This was
      a brilliantly handsome young man; indeed, his face was so beautiful that
      even Penrod was able to perceive something about it which might be
      explicably pleasing&mdash;at least to women. And Penrod remembered that,
      on the last evening before Mr. Robert Williams's departure for college,
      Margaret had been peevish because Penrod had genially spent the greater
      portion of the evening with Robert and herself upon the porch. Margaret
      made it clear, later, that she strongly preferred to conduct her
      conversations with friends unassisted&mdash;and as Penrod listened to the
      faltering words of Mr. Claude Blakely, he felt instinctively that, in a
      certain contingency, Margaret's indignation would be even more severe
      to-day than on the former occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blakely coughed faintly and was able to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say that when I say that what Tennyson says&mdash;ah&mdash;seems
      to&mdash;to apply to&mdash;to a feeling about you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point, finding too little breath in himself to proceed, in spite
      of the fact that he had spoken in an almost inaudible tone, Mr. Blakely
      stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something about this little scene was making a deep impression upon
      Penrod. What that impression was, he could not possibly have stated; but
      he had a sense of the imminence of a tender crisis, and he perceived that
      the piquancy of affairs in the library had reached a point which would
      brand an intentional interruption as the act of a cold-blooded ruffian.
      Suddenly it was as though a strong light shone upon him: he decided that
      it was Mr. Blakely who had told Margaret that her eyes were like blue
      stars in heaven&mdash;THIS was the person who had caused the hateful
      letter to be written! That decided Penrod; his inspiration, so long waited
      for, had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I feel that perhaps I am not plain,&rdquo; said Mr. Blakely, and
      immediately became red, whereas he had been pale. He was at least modest
      enough about his looks to fear that Margaret might think he had referred
      to them. &ldquo;I mean, not plain in another sense&mdash;that is, I mean not
      that <i>I</i> am not plain in saying what I mean to you&mdash;I mean, what
      you mean to ME! I feel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the moment selected by Penrod. He walked carelessly into the
      library, inquiring in a loud, bluff voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anybody seen my dog around here anywheres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blakely had inclined himself so far toward Margaret, and he was
      sitting so near the edge of the chair, that only a really wonderful bit of
      instinctive gymnastics landed him upon his feet instead of upon his back.
      As for Margaret, she said, &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; and regarded Penrod blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod breezily, &ldquo;I guess it's no use lookin' for him&mdash;he
      isn't anywheres around. I guess I'll sit down.&rdquo; Herewith, he sank into an
      easy chair, and remarked, as in comfortable explanation, &ldquo;I'm kind of
      tired standin' up, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even in this crisis, Margaret was a credit to her mother's training.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod, have you met Mr. Blakely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret primly performed the rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blakely, this is my little brother Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blakely was understood to murmur, &ldquo;How d'ye do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm well,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret bent a perplexed gaze upon him, and he saw that she had not
      divined his intentions, though the expression of Mr. Blakely was already
      beginning to be a little compensation for the ammonia outrage. Then, as
      the protracted silence which followed the introduction began to be a
      severe strain upon all parties, Penrod felt called upon to relieve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't have anything much to do this afternoon, anyway,&rdquo; he said. And
      at that there leaped a spark in Margaret's eye; her expression became
      severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have gone to Sunday-school,&rdquo; she told him crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't!&rdquo; said Penrod, with a bitterness so significant of
      sufferings connected with religion, ammonia, and herself, that Margaret,
      after giving him a thoughtful look, concluded not to urge the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blakely smiled pleasantly. &ldquo;I was looking out of the window a minute
      ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I saw a dog run across the street and turn the
      corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a lookin' dog was it?&rdquo; Penrod inquired, with languor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Blakely, &ldquo;it was a&mdash;it was a nice-looking dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What colour was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was&mdash;ah&mdash;white. That is, I think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't Duke,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Duke's kind of brownish-gray-like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blakely brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This dog I saw first had another dog with
      him&mdash;a brownish-gray dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little or big?&rdquo; Penrod asked, without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Duke's a little dog!&rdquo; Margaret intervened. &ldquo;Of COURSE, if it was
      little, it must have been Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It WAS little,&rdquo; said Mr. Blakely too enthusiastically. &ldquo;It was a little
      bit of a dog. I noticed it because it was so little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't 'a' been Duke, then,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Duke's a kind of a
      middle-sized dog.&rdquo; He yawned, and added: &ldquo;I don't want him now. I want to
      stay in the house this afternoon, anyway. And it's better for Duke to be
      out in the fresh air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blakely coughed again and sat down, finding little to say. It was
      evident, also, that Margaret shared his perplexity; and another silence
      became so embarrassing that Penrod broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was out in the sawdust-box,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it got kind of chilly.&rdquo;
       Neither of his auditors felt called upon to offer any comment, and
      presently he added, &ldquo;I thought I better come in here where it's warmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too warm,&rdquo;' said Margaret, at once. &ldquo;Mr. Blakely, would you mind
      opening a window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means!&rdquo; the young man responded earnestly, as he rose. &ldquo;Maybe I'd
      better open two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;that would be much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod watched Mr. Blakely open two windows to their widest, and
      betrayed no anxiety. His remarks upon the relative temperatures of the
      sawdust-box and the library had been made merely for the sake of creating
      sound in a silent place. When the windows had been open for several
      minutes, Penrod's placidity, though gloomy, denoted anything but
      discomfort from the draft, which was powerful, the day being windy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Blakely's turn to break a silence, and he did it so
      unexpectedly that Margaret started. He sneezed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; Margaret began, but paused apprehensively.
      &ldquo;Perhaps-per-per&mdash;&rdquo; Her apprehensions became more and more poignant;
      her eyes seemed fixed upon some incredible disaster; she appeared to
      inflate while the catastrophe she foresaw became more and more imminent.
      All at once she collapsed, but the power decorum had over her was attested
      by the mildness of her sneeze after so threatening a prelude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'd better put one of the windows down,&rdquo; Mr. Blakely suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, I believe,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;The room has cooled off, now, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blakely closed the windows, and, returning to a chair near Margaret,
      did his share in the production of another long period of quiet. Penrod
      allowed this one to pass without any vocal disturbance on his part. It may
      be, however, that his gaze was disturbing to Mr. Blakely, upon whose
      person it was glassily fixed with a self-forgetfulness that was almost
      morbid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you enjoy the last meeting of the Cotillion Club?&rdquo; Margaret said
      finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      And upon Mr. Blakely's answering absently in the affirmative, she suddenly
      began to be talkative. He seemed to catch a meaning in her fluency, and
      followed her lead, a conversation ensuing which at first had all the
      outward signs of eagerness. They talked with warm interest of people and
      events unknown to Penrod; they laughed enthusiastically about things
      beyond his ken; they appeared to have arranged a perfect way to enjoy
      themselves, no matter whether he was with them or elsewhere but presently
      their briskness began to slacken; the appearance of interest became
      perfunctory. Within ten minutes the few last scattering semblances of
      gayety had passed, and they lapsed into the longest and most profound of
      all their silences indoors that day. Its effect upon Penrod was to make
      him yawn and settle himself in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Blakely, coming to the surface out of deep inward communings,
      snapped his finger against the palm of his hand impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he exclaimed, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Margaret asked. &ldquo;Did you remember something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing at all. But, by the way, it seems a
      pity for you to be missing the fine weather. I wonder if I could persuade
      you to take a little walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, somewhat to the surprise of both the gentlemen present, looked
      uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blakely saw that she missed his point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can talk better in the open, don't you think?&rdquo; he urged, with a
      significant glance toward Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret also glanced keenly at Penrod. &ldquo;Well, perhaps.&rdquo; And then, &ldquo;I'll
      get my hat,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was on his feet before she left the room. He stretched himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get mine, too,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he carefully went to find it in a direction different from that taken
      by his sister, and he joined her and her escort not till they were at the
      front door, whither Mr. Blakely&mdash;with a last flickering of hope had
      urged a flight in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I been thinkin' of takin' a walk, all afternoon,&rdquo; said Penrod pompously.
      &ldquo;Don't matter to me which way we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exquisite oval of Mr. Claude Blakely's face merged into outlines more
      rugged than usual; the conformation of his jaw became perceptible, and it
      could be seen that he had conceived an idea which was crystallizing into a
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it happens that this is our first walk together,&rdquo; he said to
      Margaret, as they reached the pavement, &ldquo;but, from the kind of tennis you
      play, I judge that you could go a pretty good gait. Do you like walking
      fast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;For exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we try it then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You set the pace,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I think I can keep up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her at her word, and the amazing briskness of their start seemed a
      little sinister to Penrod, though he was convinced that he could do
      anything that Margaret could do, and also that neither she nor her comely
      friend could sustain such a speed for long. On the contrary, they actually
      increased it with each fleeting block they covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he panted, when they had thus put something more than a half-mile
      behind them. &ldquo;There isn't anybody has to have a doctor, I guess! What's
      the use our walkin' so fast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Penrod was not walking, for his shorter legs permitted no actual
      walking at such a speed; his gait was a half-trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, WE'RE out for a WALK!&rdquo; Mr. Blakely returned, a note of gayety
      beginning to sound in his voice. &ldquo;Marg&mdash;ah&mdash;Miss Schofield, keep
      your head up and breathe through your nose. That's it! You'll find I was
      right in suggesting this. It's going to turn out gloriously! Now, let's
      make it a little faster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret murmured inarticulately, for she would not waste her breath in a
      more coherent reply. Her cheeks were flushed; her eyes were brimming with
      the wind, but when she looked at Penrod, they were brimming with something
      more. Gurgling sounds came from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's expression had become grim. He offered no second protest, mainly
      because he, likewise, would not waste his breath, and if he would, he
      could not. Of breath in the ordinary sense breath, breathed automatically&mdash;he
      had none. He had only gasps to feed his straining lungs, and his
      half-trot, which had long since become a trot, was changed for a lope when
      Mr. Blakely reached his own best burst of speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now people stared at the flying three. The gait of Margaret and Mr.
      Blakely could be called a walk only by courtesy, while Penrod's was
      becoming a kind of blind scamper. At times he zigzagged; other times, he
      fell behind, wabbling. Anon, with elbows flopping and his face sculptured
      like an antique mask, he would actually forge ahead, and then carom from
      one to the other of his companions as he fell back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the trio sped through the coming of autumn dusk, outflying the fallen
      leaves that tumbled upon the wind. And still Penrod held to the task that
      he had set himself. The street lamps flickered into life, but on and on
      Claude Blakely led the lady, and on and on reeled the grim Penrod. Never
      once was he so far from them that they could have exchanged a word
      unchaperoned by his throbbing ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OH!&rdquo; Margaret cried, and, halting suddenly, she draped herself about a
      lamp-post like a strip of bunting. &ldquo;Guh-uh-guh-GOODNESS!&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod immediately drooped to the curb-stone, which he reached, by pure
      fortune, in a sitting position. Mr. Blakely leaned against a fence, and
      said nothing, though his breathing was eloquent. &ldquo;We&mdash;we must go&mdash;go
      home,&rdquo; Margaret gasped. &ldquo;We must, if&mdash;if we can drag ourselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Penrod showed them what mettle they he'd tried to crack. A paroxysm
      of coughing shook him; he spoke through it sobbingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Drag!' 'S jus' lul-like a girl! Ha-why I walk&mdash;OOF!&mdash;faster'n
      that every day&mdash;on my&mdash;way to school.&rdquo; He managed to subjugate a
      tendency to nausea. &ldquo;What you&mdash;want to go&mdash;home for?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Le's go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness Mr. Claude Blakely's expression could not be seen, nor was
      his voice heard. For these and other reasons, his opinions and sentiments
      may not be stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Mrs. Schofield was looking rather anxiously forth from her front door
      when the two adult figures and the faithful smaller one came up the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was getting uneasy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Papa and I came in and found the house
      empty. It's after seven. Oh, Mr. Blakely, is that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I fear I must be keeping an engagement.
      Good-night. Good-night, Miss Schofield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night,&rdquo; Penrod called, staring after him. But Mr. Blakely was
      already too far away to hear him, and a moment later Penrod followed his
      mother and sister into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I let Della go to church,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield said to Margaret. &ldquo;You and I
      might help Katie get supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a few minutes,&rdquo; Margaret returned gravely, looking at Penrod.
      &ldquo;Come upstairs, mamma; I want to tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod cackled hoarse triumph and defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! Tell! What <i>'I</i> care? You try to poison a person in church
      again, and then laugh in his face, you'll see what you get!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But after his mother had retired with Margaret to the latter's room, he
      began to feel disturbed in spite of his firm belief that his cause was
      wholly that of justice victorious. Margaret had insidious ways of stating
      a case; and her point of view, no matter how absurd or unjust, was almost
      always adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Schofield in cases of controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod became uneasy. Perceiving himself to be in danger, he decided that
      certain measures were warranted. Unquestionably, it would be well to know
      beforehand in what terms Margaret would couch the charges which he
      supposed he must face in open court&mdash;that is to say, at the
      supper-table. He stole softly up the stairs, and, flattening himself
      against the wall, approached Margaret's door, which was about an inch
      ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard his mother making sounds which appalled him&mdash;he took them
      for sobs. And then Margaret's voice rang out in a peal of insane laughter.
      Trembling, he crept nearer the door. Within the room Margaret was clinging
      to her mother, and both were trying to control their hilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did it all to get even!&rdquo; Margaret exclaimed, wiping her eyes. &ldquo;He came
      in at just the right time. That GOOSE was beginning to talk his silly,
      soft talk&mdash;the way he does with every girl in town&mdash;and he was
      almost proposing, and I didn't know how to stop him. And then Penrod came
      in and did it for me. I could have hugged Penrod, mamma, I actually could!
      And I saw he meant to stay to get even for that ammonia&mdash;and, oh, I
      worked so hard to make him think I wanted him to GO! Mamma, mamma, if you
      could have SEEN that walk! That GOOSE kept thinking he could wear Penrod
      out or drop him behind, but I knew he couldn't so long as Penrod believed
      he was worrying us and getting even. And that GOOSE thought I WANTED to
      get rid of Penrod, too; and the conceited thing said it would turn out
      'gloriously,' meaning we'd be alone together pretty soon&mdash;I'd like to
      shake him! You see, I pretended so well, in order to make Penrod stick to
      us, that GOOSE believed I meant it! And if he hadn't tried to walk Penrod
      off his legs, he wouldn't have wilted his own collar and worn himself out,
      and I think he'd have hung on until you'd have had to invite him to stay
      to supper, and he'd have stayed on all evening, and I wouldn't have had a
      chance to write to Robert Williams. Mamma, there have been lots of times
      when I haven't been thankful for Penrod, but to-day I could have got down
      on my knees to you and papa for giving me such a brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness of the hall, as a small but crushed and broken form stole
      away from the crack in the door, a gigantic Eye seemed to form&mdash;seemed
      to glare down upon Penrod&mdash;warning him that the way of vengeance is
      the way of bafflement, and that genius may not prevail against the
      trickeries of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has been a NICE day!&rdquo; Penrod muttered hoarsely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. ON ACCOUNT OF THE WEATHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is no boredom (not even an invalid's) comparable to that of a boy
      who has nothing to do. When a man says he has nothing to do, he speaks
      idly; there is always more than he can do. Grown women never say they have
      nothing to do, and when girls or little girls say they have nothing to do,
      they are merely airing an affectation. But when a boy has nothing to do,
      he has actually nothing at all to do; his state is pathetic, and when he
      complains of it his voice is haunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield was troubled by this uncomfortable quality in the voice of
      her son, who came to her thrice, in his search for entertainment or even
      employment, one Saturday afternoon during the February thaw. Few facts are
      better established than that the February thaw is the poorest time of year
      for everybody. But for a boy it is worse than poorest; it is bankrupt. The
      remnant streaks of old soot-speckled snow left against the north walls of
      houses have no power to inspire; rather, they are dreary reminders of
      sports long since carried to satiety. One cares little even to eat such
      snow, and the eating of icicles, also, has come to be a flaccid and stale
      diversion. There is no ice to bear a skate, there is only a vast
      sufficiency of cold mud, practically useless. Sunshine flickers shiftily,
      coming and going without any honest purpose; snow-squalls blow for five
      minutes, the flakes disappearing as they touch the earth; half an hour
      later rain sputters, turns to snow and then turns back to rain&mdash;and
      the sun disingenuously beams out again, only to be shut off like a rogue's
      lantern. And all the wretched while, if a boy sets foot out of doors, he
      must be harassed about his overcoat and rubbers; he is warned against
      tracking up the plastic lawn and sharply advised to stay inside the house.
      Saturday might as well be Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the season. Penrod had sought all possible means to pass the time. A
      full half-hour of vehement yodelling in the Williams' yard had failed to
      bring forth comrade Sam; and at last a coloured woman had opened a window
      to inform Penrod that her intellect was being unseated by his
      vocalizations, which surpassed in unpleasantness, she claimed, every sound
      in her previous experience and, for the sake of definiteness, she stated
      her age to be fifty-three years and four months. She added that all
      members of the Williams family had gone out of town to attend the funeral
      of a relative, but she wished that they might have remained to attend
      Penrod's, which she confidently predicted as imminent if the neighbourhood
      followed its natural impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod listened for a time, but departed before the conclusion of the
      oration. He sought other comrades, with no success; he even went to the
      length of yodelling in the yard of that best of boys, Georgie Bassett.
      Here was failure again, for Georgie signalled to him, through a closed
      window, that a closeting with dramatic literature was preferable to the
      society of a playmate; and the book that Georgie exhibited was openly
      labelled, &ldquo;300 Choice Declamations.&rdquo; Georgie also managed to convey
      another reason for his refusal of Penrod's companionship, the visitor
      being conversant with lip-reading through his studies at the &ldquo;movies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TOO MUDDY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield said, having almost exhausted a mother's powers of
      suggestion, &ldquo;well, why don't you give Duke a bath?&rdquo; She was that far
      depleted when Penrod came to her the third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mothers' suggestions are wonderful for little children but sometimes lack
      lustre when a boy approaches twelve an age to which the ideas of a Swede
      farm-hand would usually prove more congenial. However, the dim and
      melancholy eye of Penrod showed a pale gleam, and he departed. He gave
      Duke a bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entertainment proved damp and discouraging for both parties. Duke
      began to tremble even before he was lifted into the water, and after his
      first immersion he was revealed to be a dog weighing about one-fourth of
      what an observer of Duke, when Duke was dry, must have guessed his weight
      to be. His wetness and the disclosure of his extreme fleshly
      insignificance appeared to mortify him profoundly. He wept. But,
      presently, under Penrod's thorough ministrations&mdash;for the young
      master was inclined to make this bath last as long as possible&mdash;Duke
      plucked up a heart and began a series of passionate attempts to close the
      interview. As this was his first bath since September, the effects were
      lavish and impressionistic, both upon Penrod and upon the bathroom.
      However, the imperious boy's loud remonstrances contributed to bring about
      the result desired by Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield came running, and eloquently put an end to Duke's winter
      bath. When she had suggested this cleansing as a pleasant means of passing
      the time, she assumed that it would take place in a washtub in the cellar;
      and Penrod's location of the performance in her own bathroom was far from
      her intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod found her language oppressive, and, having been denied the right to
      rub Duke dry with a bath-towel&mdash;or even with the cover of a table in
      the next room&mdash;the dismal boy, accompanied by his dismal dog, set
      forth, by way of the kitchen door, into the dismal weather. With no
      purpose in mind, they mechanically went out to the alley, where Penrod
      leaned morosely against the fence, and Duke stood shivering close by, his
      figure still emaciated and his tail absolutely withdrawn from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cold, wet wind, however; and before long Duke found his
      condition unendurable. He was past middle age and cared little for
      exercise; but he saw that something must be done. Therefore, he made a
      vigorous attempt to dry himself in a dog's way. Throwing himself,
      shoulders first, upon the alley mud, he slid upon it, back downward; he
      rolled and rolled and rolled. He began to feel lively and rolled the more;
      in every way he convinced Penrod that dogs have no regard for appearances.
      Also, having discovered an ex-fish near the Herman and Verman cottage,
      Duke confirmed an impression of Penrod's that dogs have a peculiar fancy
      in the matter of odours that they like to wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing livelier and livelier, Duke now wished to play with his master.
      Penrod was anything but fastidious; nevertheless, under the circumstances,
      he withdrew to the kitchen, leaving Duke to play by himself, outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Della, the cook, was comfortably making rolls and entertaining a caller
      with a cup of tea. Penrod lingered a few moments, but found even his
      attention to the conversation ill received, while his attempts to take
      part in it met outright rebuff. His feelings were hurt; he passed
      broodingly to the front part of the house, and flung himself wearily into
      an armchair in the library. With glazed eyes he stared at shelves of books
      that meant to him just what the wallpaper meant, and he sighed from the
      abyss. His legs tossed and his arms flopped; he got up, scratched himself
      exhaustively, and shuffled to a window. Ten desolate minutes he stood
      there, gazing out sluggishly upon a soggy world. During this time two wet
      delivery-wagons and four elderly women under umbrellas were all that
      crossed his field of vision. Somewhere in the world, he thought, there was
      probably a boy who lived across the street from a jail or a fire-engine
      house, and had windows worth looking out of. Penrod rubbed his nose up and
      down the pane slowly, continuously, and without the slightest pleasure;
      and he again scratched himself wherever it was possible to do so, though
      he did not even itch. There was nothing in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such boredom as he was suffering can become agony, and an imaginative
      creature may do wild things to escape it; many a grown person has taken to
      drink on account of less pressure than was upon Penrod during that
      intolerable Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint sound in his ear informed him that Della, in the kitchen, had
      uttered a loud exclamation, and he decided to go back there. However,
      since his former visit had resulted in a rebuff that still rankled, he
      paused outside the kitchen door, which was slightly ajar, and listened. He
      did this idly, and with no hope of hearing anything interesting or
      helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snakes!&rdquo; Della exclaimed. &ldquo;Didja say the poor man was seein' snakes, Mrs.
      Cullen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Della,&rdquo; Mrs. Cullen returned dolorously; &ldquo;jist one. Flora says he
      niver see more th'n one&mdash;jist one big, long, ugly-faced horrible
      black one; the same one comin' back an' makin' a fizzin' n'ise at um iv'ry
      time he had the fit on um. 'Twas alw'ys the same snake; an' he'd holler at
      Flora. 'Here it comes ag'in, oh, me soul!' he'd holler. 'The big, black,
      ugly-faced thing; it's as long as the front fence!' he'd holler, 'an' it's
      makin' a fizzin' n'ise at me, an' breathin' in me face!' he'd holler. 'Fer
      th' love o' hivin', Flora,' he'd holler, 'it's got a little black man wit'
      a gassly white forehead a-pokin' of it along wit' a broom-handle, an'
      a-sickin' it on me, the same as a boy sicks a dog on a poor cat. Fer the
      love o' hivin', Flora,' he'd holler, 'cantcha fright it away from me
      before I go out o' me head?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Tom!&rdquo; said Della with deep compassion. &ldquo;An' the poor man out of his
      head all the time, an' not knowin' it! 'Twas awful fer Flora to sit there
      an' hear such things in the night like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may believe yerself whin ye say it!&rdquo; Mrs. Cullen agreed. &ldquo;Right the
      very night the poor soul died, he was hollerin' how the big black snake
      and the little black man wit' the gassly white forehead a-pokin' it wit' a
      broomstick had come fer um. 'Fright 'em away, Flora!' he was croakin', in
      a v'ice that hoarse an' husky 'twas hard to make out what he says. 'Fright
      'em away, Flora!' he says. ''Tis the big, black, ugly-faced snake, as
      black as a black stockin' an' thicker round than me leg at the thigh
      before I was wasted away!' he says, poor man. 'It's makin' the fizzin'
      n'ise awful to-night,' he says. 'An' the little black man wit' the gassly
      white forehead is a-laughin',' he says. 'He's a-laughin' an' a-pokin' the
      big, black, fizzin', ugly-faced snake wit' his broomstick&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Della was unable to endure the description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tell me no more, Mrs. Cullen!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Poor Tom! I thought
      Flora was wrong last week whin she hid the whisky. 'Twas takin' it away
      from him that killed him&mdash;an' him already so sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cullen, &ldquo;he hardly had the strengt' to drink much, she
      tells me, after he see the big snake an' the little black divil the first
      time. Poor woman, she says he talked so plain she sees 'em both herself,
      iv'ry time she looks at the poor body where it's laid out. She says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tell me!&rdquo; cried the impressionable Della. &ldquo;Don't tell me, Mrs.
      Cullen! I can most see 'em meself, right here in me own kitchen! Poor Tom!
      To think whin I bought me new hat, only last week, the first time I'd be
      wearin' it'd be to his funeral. To-morrow afternoon, it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At two o'clock,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cullen. &ldquo;Ye'll be comin' to th' house
      to-night, o' course, Della?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Della. &ldquo;After what I've been hearin' from ye, I'm 'most
      afraid to come, but I'll do it. Poor Tom! I remember the day him an' Flora
      was married&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the eavesdropper heard no more; he was on his way up the back stairs.
      Life and light&mdash;and purpose had come to his face once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was out for the afternoon. Unostentatiously, he went to her room,
      and for the next few minutes occupied himself busily therein. He was so
      quiet that his mother, sewing in her own room, would not have heard him
      except for the obstinacy of one of the drawers in Margaret's bureau. Mrs.
      Schofield went to the door of her daughter's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not disturbing any of Margaret's things, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; said the meek lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you jerk that drawer open for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard me, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am. I was just lookin' for sumpthing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield asked. &ldquo;You know that nothing of yours would be
      in Margaret's room, Penrod, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you wanted?&rdquo; she asked, rather impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just lookin' for some pins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, and handed him two from the shoulder of her blouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want about forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just want to MAKE sumpthing, Mamma,&rdquo; he said plaintively. &ldquo;My goodness!
      Can't I even want to have a few pins without everybody makin' such a fuss
      about it you'd think I was doin' a srime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing a what, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A SRIME!&rdquo; he repeated, with emphasis; and a moment's reflection
      enlightened his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a crime!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You MUST quit reading the murder trials in
      the newspapers, Penrod. And when you read words you don't know how to
      pronounce you ought to ask either your papa or me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am askin' you about sumpthing now,&rdquo; Penrod said. &ldquo;Can't I even
      have a few PINS without stoppin' to talk about everything in the
      newspapers, Mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, laughing at his seriousness; and she took him to her
      room, and bestowed upon him five or six rows torn from a paper of pins.
      &ldquo;That ought to be plenty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for whatever you want to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she smiled after his retreating figure, not noting that he looked
      softly bulky around the body, and held his elbows unnaturally tight to his
      sides. She was assured of the innocence of anything to be made with pins,
      and forbore to press investigation. For Penrod to be playing with pins
      seemed almost girlish. Unhappy woman, it pleased her to have her son seem
      girlish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod went out to the stable, tossed his pins into the wheelbarrow, then
      took from his pocket and unfolded six pairs of long black stockings,
      indubitably the property of his sister. (Evidently Mrs. Schofield had been
      a little late in making her appearance at the door of Margaret's room.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod worked systematically; he hung the twelve stockings over the sides
      of the wheelbarrow, and placed the wheelbarrow beside a large packing-box
      that was half full of excelsior. One after another, he stuffed the
      stockings with excelsior, till they looked like twelve long black
      sausages. Then he pinned the top of one stocking securely over the stuffed
      foot of another, pinning the top of a third to the foot of the second, the
      top of a fourth to the foot of the third&mdash;and continued operations in
      this fashion until the twelve stockings were the semblance of one long and
      sinuous black body, sufficiently suggestive to any normal eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tied a string to one end of this unpleasant-looking thing, led it
      around the stable, and, by vigorous manipulations, succeeded in making it
      wriggle realistically; but he was not satisfied, and, dropping the string
      listlessly, sat down in the wheelbarrow to ponder. Penrod sometimes proved
      that there were within him the makings of an artist; he had become
      fascinated by an idea, and could not be content until that idea was
      beautifully realized. He had meant to create a big, long, ugly-faced
      horrible black snake with which to interest Della and her friend, Mrs.
      Cullen; but he felt that results, so far, were too crude for exploitation.
      Merely to lead the pinned stockings by a string was little to fulfill his
      ambitious vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, he rose from the wheelbarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I only had a cat!&rdquo; he said dreamily.

      CHAPTER XIX. CREATIVE ART
    </h2>
    <h3>
      He went forth, seeking.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Schofield household was catless this winter but there was a nice white
      cat at the Williams'. Penrod strolled thoughtfully over to the Williams's
      yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was entirely successful, not even having been seen by the sensitive
      coloured woman, aged fifty-three years and four months.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still Penrod was thoughtful. The artist within him was unsatisfied
      with his materials: and upon his return to the stable he placed the cat
      beneath an overturned box, and once more sat down in the inspiring
      wheelbarrow, pondering. His expression, concentrated and yet a little
      anxious, was like that of a painter at work upon a portrait that may or
      may not turn out to be a masterpiece. The cat did not disturb him by her
      purring, though she was, indeed, already purring. She was one of those
      cozy, youngish cats&mdash;plump, even a little full-bodied, perhaps, and
      rather conscious of the figure&mdash;that are entirely conventional and
      domestic by nature, and will set up a ladylike housekeeping anywhere
      without making a fuss about it. If there be a fault in these cats,
      overcomplacency might be the name for it; they err a shade too sure of
      themselves, and their assumption that the world means to treat them
      respectfully has just a little taint of the grande dame. Consequently,
      they are liable to great outbreaks of nervous energy from within,
      engendered by the extreme surprises that life sometimes holds in store for
      them. They lack the pessimistic imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Williams's cat was content upon a strange floor and in the confining
      enclosure of a strange box. She purred for a time, then trustfully fell
      asleep. 'Twas well she slumbered; she would need all her powers presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slumbered, and dreamed not that she would wake to mingle with events
      that were to alter her serene disposition radically and cause her to
      become hasty-tempered and abnormally suspicious for the rest of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Penrod appeared to reach a doubtful solution of his problem.
      His expression was still somewhat clouded as he brought from the storeroom
      of the stable a small fragment of a broken mirror, two paint brushes and
      two old cans, one containing black paint and the other white. He regarded
      himself earnestly in the mirror; then, with some reluctance, he dipped a
      brush into one of the cans, and slowly painted his nose a midnight black.
      He was on the point of spreading this decoration to cover the lower part
      of his face, when he paused, brush halfway between can and chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      What arrested him was a sound from the alley&mdash;a sound of drumming
      upon tin. The eyes of Penrod became significant of rushing thoughts; his
      expression cleared and brightened. He ran to the alley doors and flung
      them open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Verman!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marching up and down before the cottage across the alley, Verman plainly
      considered himself to be an army. Hanging from his shoulders by a string
      was an old tin wash-basin, whereon he beat cheerily with two dry bones,
      once the chief support of a chicken. Thus he assuaged his ennui.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verman, come on in here,&rdquo; Penrod called. &ldquo;I got sumpthing for you to do
      you'll like awful well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman halted, ceased to drum, and stared. His gaze was not fixed
      particularly upon Penrod's nose, however, and neither now nor later did he
      make any remark or gesture referring to this casual eccentricity. He
      expected things like that upon Penrod or Sam Williams. And as for Penrod
      himself, he had already forgotten that his nose was painted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Verman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman continued to stare, not moving. He had received such invitations
      before, and they had not always resulted to his advantage. Within that
      stable things had happened to him the like of which he was anxious to
      avoid in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come ahead, Verman!&rdquo; Penrod urged, and, divining logic in the
      reluctance confronting him, he added, &ldquo;This ain't goin' to be anything
      like last time, Verman. I got sumpthing just SPLENDUD for you to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman's expression hardened; he shook his head decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mo,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, COME on, Verman?&rdquo; Penrod pleaded. &ldquo;It isn't anything goin' to HURT
      you, is it? I tell you it's sumpthing you'd give a good deal to GET to do,
      if you knew what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mo!&rdquo; said Verman firmly. &ldquo;I mome maw woo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod offered arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Verman!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Listen here a minute, can't you? How d'you know
      you don't want to until you know what it is? A person CAN'T know they
      don't want to do a thing even before the other person tells 'em what
      they're goin' to get 'em to do, can they? For all you know, this thing I'm
      goin' to get you to do might be sumpthing you wouldn't miss doin' for
      anything there is! For all you know, Verman, it might be sumpthing like
      this: well, f'rinstance, s'pose I was standin' here, and you were over
      there, sort of like the way you are now, and I says, 'Hello, Verman!' and
      then I'd go on and tell you there was sumpthing I was goin' to get you to
      do; and you'd say you wouldn't do it, even before you heard what it was,
      why where'd be any sense to THAT? For all you know, I might of been goin'
      to get you to eat a five-cent bag o' peanuts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman had listened obdurately until he heard the last few words; but as
      they fell upon his ear, he relaxed, and advanced to the stable doors,
      smiling and extending his open right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw wi,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gi'm here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Penrod returned, a trifle embarrassed, &ldquo;I didn't say it WAS
      peanuts, did I? Honest, Verman, it's sumpthing you'll like better'n a few
      old peanuts that most of 'em'd prob'ly have worms in 'em, anyway. All I
      want you to do is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Verman was not favourably impressed; his face hardened again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mo!&rdquo; he said, and prepared to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Verman,&rdquo; Penrod urged. &ldquo;It isn't goin' to hurt you just to
      come in here and see what I got for you, is it? You can do that much,
      can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surely such an appeal must have appeared reasonable, even to Verman,
      especially since its effect was aided by the promising words, &ldquo;See what I
      got for you.&rdquo; Certainly Verman yielded to it, though perhaps a little
      suspiciously. He advanced a few cautious steps into the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Penrod cried, and he ran to the stuffed and linked stockings,
      seized the leading-string, and vigorously illustrated his further remarks.
      &ldquo;How's that for a big, long, ugly-faced horr'ble black ole snake, Verman?
      Look at her follow me all round anywhere I feel like goin'! Look at her
      wiggle, will you, though? Look how I make her do anything I tell her to.
      Lay down, you ole snake, you&mdash;See her lay down when I tell her to,
      Verman? Wiggle, you ole snake, you! See her wiggle, Verman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; Undoubtedly Verman felt some pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, listen, Verman!&rdquo; Penrod continued, hastening to make the most of the
      opportunity. &ldquo;Listen! I fixed up this good ole snake just for you. I'm
      goin' to give her to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HI!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On account of a previous experience not unconnected with cats, and likely
      to prejudice Verman, Penrod decided to postpone mentioning Mrs. Williams's
      pet until he should have secured Verman's cooperation in the enterprise
      irretrievably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you got to do,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is to chase this good ole snake around,
      and sort o' laugh and keep pokin' it with the handle o' that rake yonder.
      I'm goin' to saw it off just so's you can poke your good ole snake with
      it, Verman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw wi,&rdquo; said Verman, and, extending his open hand again, he uttered a
      hopeful request. &ldquo;Peamup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His host perceived that Verman had misunderstood him. &ldquo;Peanuts!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;My goodness! I didn't say I HAD any peanuts, did I? I only
      said s'pose f'rinstance I DID have some. My goodness! You don't expeck me
      to go round here all day workin' like a dog to make a good ole snake for
      you and then give you a bag o' peanuts to hire you to play with it, do
      you, Verman? My goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman's hand fell, with a little disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw wi,&rdquo; he said, consenting to accept the snake without the bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the boy! NOW we're all right, Verman; and pretty soon I'm goin' to
      saw that rake-handle off for you, too; so's you can kind o' guide your
      good ole snake around with it; but first&mdash;well, first there's just
      one more thing's got to be done. I'll show you&mdash;it won't take but a
      minute.&rdquo; Then, while Verman watched him wonderingly, he went to the can of
      white paint and dipped a brush therein. &ldquo;It won't get on your clo'es much,
      or anything, Verman,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I only just got to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as he approached, dripping brush in hand, the wondering look was all
      gone from Verman; determination took its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mo!&rdquo; he said, turned his back, and started for outdoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Verman,&rdquo; Penrod cried. &ldquo;I haven't done anything to you yet,
      have I? It isn't goin' to hurt you, is it? You act like a little teeny bit
      o' paint was goin' to kill you. What's the matter of you? I only just got
      to paint the top part of your face; I'm not goin' to TOUCH the other part
      of it&mdash;nor your hands or anything. All <i>I</i> want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MO!&rdquo; said Verman from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; moaned Penrod; and in desperation he drew forth from
      his pocket his entire fortune. &ldquo;All right, Verman,&rdquo; he said resignedly.
      &ldquo;If you won't do it any other way, here's a nickel, and you can go and buy
      you some peanuts when we get through. But if I give you this money, you
      got to promise to wait till we ARE through, and you got to promise to do
      anything I tell you to. You goin' to promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of Verman glistened; he returned, gave bond, and, grasping the
      coin, burst into the rich laughter of a gourmand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod immediately painted him dead white above the eyes, all round his
      head and including his hair. It took all the paint in the can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the artist mentioned the presence of Mrs. Williams's cat, explained
      in full his ideas concerning the docile animal, and the long black snake,
      and Della and her friend, Mrs. Cullen, while Verman listened with anxiety,
      but remained true to his oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      They removed the stocking at the end of the long black snake, and cut four
      holes in the foot and ankle of it. They removed the excelsior, placed Mrs.
      Williams's cat in the stocking, shook her down into the lower section of
      it; drew her feet through the four holes there, leaving her head in the
      toe of the stocking; then packed the excelsior down on top of her, and
      once more attached the stocking to the rest of the long, black snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      How shameful is the ease of the historian! He sits in his dressing-gown to
      write: &ldquo;The enemy attacked in force&mdash;&rdquo; The tranquil pen, moving in a
      cloud of tobacco smoke, leaves upon the page its little hieroglyphics,
      serenely summing up the monstrous deeds and sufferings of men of action.
      How cold, how niggardly, to state merely that Penrod and the painted
      Verman succeeded in giving the long, black snake a motive power, or
      tractor, apparently its own but consisting of Mrs. Williams's cat!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was drowsy when they lifted her from the box; she was still drowsy
      when they introduced part of her into the orifice of the stocking; but she
      woke to full, vigorous young life when she perceived that their purpose
      was for her to descend into the black depths of that stocking head first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verman held the mouth of the stocking stretched, and Penrod manipulated
      the cat; but she left her hearty mark on both of them before, in a moment
      of unfortunate inspiration, she humped her back while she was upside down,
      and Penrod took advantage of the concavity to increase it even more than
      she desired. The next instant she was assisted downward into the gloomy
      interior, with excelsior already beginning to block the means of egress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gymnastic moments followed; there were times when both boys hurled
      themselves full-length upon the floor, seizing the animated stocking with
      far-extended hands; and even when the snake was a complete thing, with
      legs growing from its unquestionably ugly face, either Penrod or Verman
      must keep a grasp upon it, for it would not be soothed, and refused, over
      and over, to calm itself, even when addressed as, &ldquo;Poor pussy!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nice
      'ittle kitty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finally, they thought they had their good ole snake &ldquo;about quieted down&rdquo;,
      as Penrod said, because the animated head had remained in one place for an
      unusual length of time, though the legs produced a rather sinister effect
      of crouching, and a noise like a distant planing-mill came from the
      interior&mdash;and then Duke appeared in the doorway. He was still feeling
      lively.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE DEPARTING GUEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the time Penrod returned from chasing Duke to the next corner, Verman
      had the long, black snake down from the rafter where its active head had
      taken refuge, with the rest of it dangling; and both boys agreed that Mrs.
      Williams's cat must certainly be able to &ldquo;see SOME, anyway&rdquo;, through the
      meshes of the stocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod, &ldquo;it's gettin' pretty near dark, what with all this
      bother and mess we been havin' around here, and I expeck as soon as I get
      this good ole broom-handle fixed out of the rake for you, Verman, it'll be
      about time to begin what we had to go and take all this trouble FOR.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .... Mr. Schofield had brought an old friend home to dinner with him:
      &ldquo;Dear old Joe Gilling,&rdquo; he called this friend when introducing him to Mrs.
      Schofield. Mr. Gilling, as Mrs. Schofield was already informed by
      telephone, had just happened to turn up in town that day, and had called
      on his classmate at the latter's office. The two had not seen each other
      in eighteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gilling was a tall man, clad highly in the mode, and brought to a
      polished and powdered finish by barber and manicurist; but his colour was
      peculiar, being almost unhumanly florid, and, as Mrs. Schofield afterward
      claimed to have noticed, his eyes &ldquo;wore a nervous, apprehensive look&rdquo;, his
      hands were tremulous, and his manner was &ldquo;queer and jerky&rdquo;&mdash;at least,
      that is how she defined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not surprised to hear him state that he was travelling for his
      health and not upon business. He had not been really well for several
      years, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that, Mr. Schofield laughed and slapped him heartily on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy!&rdquo; Mr. Gilling cried, leaping in his chair. &ldquo;What IS the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; Mr. Schofield laughed. &ldquo;I just slapped you the way we used to
      slap each other on the campus. What I was going to say was that you have
      no business being a bachelor. With all your money, and nothing to do but
      travel and sit around hotels and clubs, no wonder you've grown bilious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I'm not bilious,&rdquo; Mr. Gilling said uncomfortably. &ldquo;I'm not
      bilious at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to get married,&rdquo; Mr. Schofield returned. &ldquo;You ought&mdash;&rdquo; He
      paused, for Mr. Gilling had jumped again. &ldquo;What's the trouble, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I thought perhaps&mdash;perhaps you were going to slap me on the
      back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; Mr. Schofield said, renewing his laughter. &ldquo;Well, is
      dinner about ready?&rdquo; he asked, turning to his wife. &ldquo;Where are Margaret
      and Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret's just come in,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield answered. &ldquo;She'll be down in a
      minute, and Penrod's around somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod?&rdquo; Mr. Gilling repeated curiously, in his nervous, serious way.
      &ldquo;What is Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at this, Mrs. Schofield joined in her husband's laughter. Mr.
      Schofield explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod's our young son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He's not much for looks, maybe; but
      he's been pretty good lately, and sometimes we're almost inclined to be
      proud of him. You'll see him in a minute, old Joe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Joe saw him even sooner. Instantly, as Mr. Schofield finished his
      little prediction, the most shocking uproar ever heard in that house burst
      forth in the kitchen. Distinctly Irish shrieks unlimited came from that
      quarter&mdash;together with the clashing of hurled metal and tin, the
      appealing sound of breaking china, and the hysterical barking of a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library door flew open, and Mrs. Cullen appeared as a mingled streak
      crossing the room from one door to the other. She was followed by a boy
      with a coal-black nose and between his feet, as he entered, there appeared
      a big long, black, horrible snake, with frantic legs springing from what
      appeared to be its head; and it further fulfilled Mrs. Cullen's
      description by making a fizzin' noise. Accompanying the snake, and still
      faithfully endeavouring to guide it with the detached handle of a rake,
      was a small black demon with a gassly white forehead and gasslier white
      hair. Duke evidently still feeling his bath, was doing all in his power to
      aid the demon in making the snake step lively. A few kitchen implements
      followed this fugitive procession through the library doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long, black snake became involved with a leg of the heavy table in the
      centre of the room. The head developed spasms of agility; there were
      clangings and rippings, then the foremost section of the long, black snake
      detached itself, bounded into the air, and, after turning a number of
      somersaults, became, severally, a torn stocking, excelsior, and a lunatic
      cat. The ears of this cat were laid back flat upon its head and its speed
      was excessive upon a fairly circular track it laid out for itself in the
      library. Flying round this orbit, it perceived the open doorway; passed
      through it, thence to the kitchen, and outward and onward&mdash;Della
      having left the kitchen door open in her haste as she retired to the
      backyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black demon with the gassly white forehead and hair, finding himself
      in the presence of grown people who were white all over, turned in his
      tracks and followed Mrs. Williams's cat to the great outdoors. Duke
      preceded Verman. Mrs. Cullen vanished. Of the apparition, only wreckage
      and a rightfully apprehensive Penrod were left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield began, a few minutes later, looking suddenly
      mystified&mdash;&ldquo;where&mdash;where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where what?&rdquo; Mr. Schofield asked testily. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;
       His nerves were jarred, and he was rather hoarse after what he had been
      saying to Penrod. (That regretful necromancer was now upstairs doing
      unhelpful things to his nose over a washstand.) &ldquo;What do you mean by,
      'Where, where, where?'&rdquo; Mr. Schofield demanded. &ldquo;I don't see any sense to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is your old classmate?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where's Mr. Gilling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was the first to notice this striking absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; Mr. Schofield exclaimed. &ldquo;Where IS old Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret intervened. &ldquo;You mean that tall, pale man who was calling?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pale, no!&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;He's as flushed as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was pale when <i>I</i> saw him,&rdquo; Margaret said. &ldquo;He had his hat and
      coat, and he was trying to get out of the front door when I came running
      downstairs. He couldn't work the catch for a minute; but before I got to
      the foot of the steps he managed to turn it and open the door. He went out
      before I could think what to say to him, he was in such a hurry. I guess
      everything was so confused you didn't notice&mdash;but he's certainly
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield turned to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought he was going to stay to dinner!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield shook his head, admitting himself floored. Later, having
      mentally gone over everything that might shed light on the curious
      behaviour of old Joe, he said, without preface:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn't at all dissipated when we were in college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield nodded severely. &ldquo;Maybe this was just the best thing could
      have happened to him, after all,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; her husband returned. &ldquo;I don't say it isn't. BUT that isn't
      going to make any difference in what I'm going to do to Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. YEARNINGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day a new ambition entered into Penrod Schofield; it was heralded
      by a flourish of trumpets and set up a great noise within his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way home from Sunday-school he had paused at a corner to listen to
      a brass band, which was returning from a funeral, playing a medley of airs
      from &ldquo;The Merry Widow,&rdquo; and as the musicians came down the street, walking
      so gracefully, the sun picked out the gold braid upon their uniforms and
      splashed fire from their polished instruments. Penrod marked the shapes of
      the great bass horns, the suave sculpture of their brazen coils, and the
      grand, sensational flare of their mouths. And he saw plainly that these
      noble things, to be mastered, needed no more than some breath blown into
      them during the fingering of a few simple keys. Then obediently they gave
      forth those vast but dulcet sounds which stirred his spirit as no other
      sounds could stir it quite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leader of the band, walking ahead, was a pleasing figure, nothing
      more. Penrod supposed him to be a mere decoration, and had never
      sympathized with Sam Williams' deep feeling about drum-majors. The
      cornets, the trombones, the smaller horns were rather interesting, of
      course; and the drums had charm, especially the bass drum, which must be
      partially supported by a youth in front; but, immeasurably above all
      these, what fascinated Penrod was the little man with the monster horn.
      There Penrod's widening eyes remained transfixed&mdash;upon the horn, so
      dazzling, with its broad spaces of brassy highlights, and so overwhelming,
      with its mouth as wide as a tub; that there was something almost
      threatening about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little, elderly band-musician walked manfully as he blew his great
      horn; and in that pompous engine of sound, the boy beheld a spectacle of
      huge forces under human control. To Penrod, the horn meant power, and the
      musician meant mastery over power, though, of course, Penrod did not know
      that this was how he really felt about the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandiloquent sketches were passing and interchanging before his mind's
      eye&mdash;Penrod, in noble raiment, marching down the staring street, his
      shoulders swaying professionally, the roar of the horn he bore submerging
      all other sounds; Penrod on horseback, blowing the enormous horn and
      leading wild hordes to battle, while Marjorie Jones looked on from the
      sidewalk; Penrod astounding his mother and father and sister by suddenly
      serenading them in the library. &ldquo;Why, Penrod, where DID you learn to play
      like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were vague and shimmering glories of vision rather than definite
      plans for his life work, yet he did with all his will determine to own and
      play upon some roaring instrument of brass. And, after all, this was no
      new desire of his; it was only an old one inflamed to take a new form. Nor
      was music the root of it, for the identical desire is often uproarious
      among them that hate music. What stirred in Penrod was new neither in him
      nor in the world, but old&mdash;old as old Adam, old as the childishness
      of man. All children have it, of course: they are all anxious to Make a
      Noise in the World.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the band approached, Penrod marked the time with his feet; then he
      fell into step and accompanied the musicians down the street, keeping as
      near as possible to the little man with the big horn. There were four or
      five other boys, strangers, also marching with the band, but these were
      light spirits, their flushed faces and prancing legs proving that they
      were merely in a state of emotional reaction to music. Penrod, on the
      contrary, was grave. He kept his eyes upon the big horn, and, now and
      then, he gave an imitation of it. His fingers moved upon invisible keys,
      his cheeks puffed out, and, from far down in his throat, he produced
      strange sounds: &ldquo;Taw, p'taw-p'taw! Taw, p'taw-p'taw! PAW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other boys turned back when the musicians ceased to play, but Penrod
      marched on, still keeping close to what so inspired him. He stayed with
      the band till the last member of it disappeared up a staircase in an
      office-building, down at the business end of the street; and even after
      that he lingered a while, looking at the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, however, he set his face toward home, whither he marched in a
      procession, the visible part of which consisted of himself alone. All the
      way the rhythmic movements of his head kept time with his marching feet
      and, also, with a slight rise and fall of his fingers at about the median
      line of his abdomen. And pedestrians who encountered him in this
      preoccupation were not surprised to hear, as he passed, a few explosive
      little vocalizations: &ldquo;Taw, p'taw-p'taw! TAW! Taw-aw-HAW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were the outward symptoms of no fleeting impulse, but of steadfast
      desire; therefore they were persistent. The likeness of the great bass
      horn remained upon the retina of his mind's eye, losing nothing of its
      brazen enormity with the passing of hours, nor abating, in his mind's ear,
      one whit of its fascinating blatancy. Penrod might have forgotten almost
      anything else more readily; for such a horn has this double compulsion:
      people cannot possibly keep themselves from looking at its possessor&mdash;and
      they certainly have GOT to listen to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was preoccupied at dinner and during the evening, now and then
      causing his father some irritation by croaking, &ldquo;Taw, p'taw-p'taw!&rdquo; while
      the latter was talking. And when bedtime came for the son of the house, he
      mounted the stairs in a rhythmic manner, and p'tawed himself through the
      upper hall as far as his own chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after he had gone to bed, there came a revival of these
      manifestations. His mother had put out his light for him and had returned
      to the library downstairs; three-quarters of an hour had elapsed since
      then, and Margaret was in her room, next to his, when a continuous low
      croaking (which she was just able to hear) suddenly broke out into loud,
      triumphal blattings:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TAW, p'taw-p'taw-aw-HAW! P'taw-WAW-aw! Aw-PAW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; Margaret called, &ldquo;stop that! I'm trying to write letters. If you
      don't quit and go to sleep, I'll call papa up, and you'll SEE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise ceased, or, rather, it tapered down to a desultory faint
      croaking which finally died out; but there can be little doubt that
      Penrod's last waking thoughts were of instrumental music. And in the
      morning, when he woke to face the gloomy day's scholastic tasks, something
      unusual and eager fawned in his face with the return of memory.
      &ldquo;Taw-p'taw!&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;PAW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All day, in school and out, his mind was busy with computations&mdash;not
      such as are prescribed by mathematical pedants, but estimates of how much
      old rags and old iron would sell for enough money to buy a horn. Happily,
      the next day, at lunch, he was able to dismiss this problem from his mind:
      he learned that his Uncle Joe would be passing through town, on his way
      from Nevada, the following afternoon, and all the Schofield family were to
      go to the station to see him. Penrod would be excused from school.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this news his cheeks became pink, and for a moment he was breathless.
      Uncle Joe and Penrod did not meet often, but when they did, Uncle Joe
      invariably gave Penrod money. Moreover, he always managed to do it
      privately so that later there was no bothersome supervision. Last time he
      had given Penrod a silver dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      At thirty-five minutes after two, Wednesday afternoon, Uncle Joe's train
      came into the station, and Uncle Joe got out and shouted among his
      relatives. At eighteen minutes before three he was waving to them from the
      platform of the last car, having just slipped a two-dollar bill into
      Penrod's breast-pocket. And, at seven minutes after three, Penrod opened
      the door of the largest &ldquo;music store&rdquo; in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, exquisite, fair man, evidently a musical earl, stood before him,
      leaning whimsically upon a piano of the highest polish. The sight abashed
      Penrod not a bit&mdash;his remarkable financial condition even made him
      rather peremptory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said brusquely: &ldquo;I want to look at that big horn in the
      window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the earl; &ldquo;look at it.&rdquo; And leaned more luxuriously upon
      the polished piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant&mdash;&rdquo; Penrod began, but paused, something daunted, while an
      unnamed fear brought greater mildness into his voice, as he continued, &ldquo;I
      meant&mdash;I&mdash;How much IS that big horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; the earl repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Penrod, &ldquo;how much is it worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; the earl returned. &ldquo;Its price is eighty-five dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty-fi&mdash;&rdquo; Penrod began mechanically, but was forced to pause and
      swallow a little air that obstructed his throat, as the difference between
      eighty-five and two became more and more startling. He had entered the
      store, rich; in the last ten seconds he had become poverty-stricken.
      Eighty-five dollars was the same as eighty-five millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I put it aside for you,&rdquo; asked the salesman-earl, &ldquo;while you look
      around the other stores to see if there's anything you like better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess&mdash;I guess not,&rdquo; said Penrod, whose face had grown red. He
      swallowed again, scraped the floor with the side of his right shoe,
      scratched the back of his neck, and then, trying to make his manner casual
      and easy, &ldquo;Well I can't stand around here all day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I got to be
      gettin' on up the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, turning to the door, suspected jocularity, but he found himself
      without recourse; he was nonplussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you won't let me have that horn tied up in nice wrapping-paper in
      case you decide to take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was almost positive that the spirit of this question was satirical;
      but he was unable to reply, except by a feeble shake of the head&mdash;though
      ten minutes later, as he plodded forlornly his homeward way, he looked
      over his shoulder and sent backward a few words of morose repartee:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am, am I?&rdquo; he muttered, evidently concluding a conversation which
      he had continued mentally with the salesman. &ldquo;Well, you're double anything
      you call me, so that makes you a smart Aleck twice! Ole double smart
      Aleck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that, he walked with the least bit more briskness, but not much. No
      wonder he felt discouraged: there are times when eighty-five dollars can
      be a blow to anybody! Penrod was so stunned that he actually forgot what
      was in his pocket. He passed two drug stores, and they had absolutely no
      meaning to him. He walked all the way without spending a cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home he spent a moment in the kitchen pantry while the cook was in the
      cellar; then he went out to the stable and began some really pathetic
      experiments. His materials were the small tin funnel which he had obtained
      in the pantry, and a short section of old garden hose. He inserted the
      funnel into one end of the garden hose, and made it fast by wrappings of
      cord. Then he arranged the hose in a double, circular coil, tied it so
      that it would remain coiled, and blew into the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He blew and blew and blew; he set his lips tight together, as he had
      observed the little musician with the big horn set his, and blew and
      sputtered, and sputtered and blew, but nothing of the slightest importance
      happened in the orifice of the funnel. Still he blew. He began to be
      dizzy; his eyes watered; his expression became as horrible as a strangled
      person's. He but blew the more. He stamped his feet and blew. He staggered
      to the wheelbarrow, sat, and blew&mdash;and yet the funnel uttered
      nothing; it seemed merely to breathe hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not sound like a horn, and, when Penrod finally gave up, he had
      to admit piteously that it did not look like a horn. No boy over nine
      could have pretended that it was a horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed the thing upon the floor, and leaned back in the wheelbarrow,
      inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay, Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam Williams appeared in the doorway, and, behind Sam, Master Roderick
      Magsworth Bitts, Junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod made no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two came in, and Sam picked up the poor contrivance Penrod had tossed
      upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this ole dingus?&rdquo; Sam asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what's it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin',&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;It's a kind of a horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For music,&rdquo; said Penrod simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bitts laughed loud and long; he was derisive. &ldquo;Music!&rdquo; he yipped.
      &ldquo;I thought you meant a cow's horn! He says it's a music-horn, Sam? What
      you think o' that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam blew into the thing industriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't work,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course it won't!&rdquo; Roddy Bitts shouted. &ldquo;You can't make it go without you
      got a REAL horn. I'm goin' to get me a real horn some day before long, and
      then you'll see me goin' up and down here playin' it like sixty! I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Some day before long!'&rdquo; Sam mocked. &ldquo;Yes, we will! Why'n't you get it
      to-day, if you're goin' to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said Roddy. &ldquo;I'd go get the money from my father right now,
      only he wouldn't give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam whooped, and Penrod, in spite of his great depression, uttered a few
      jibing sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd get MY father to buy me a fire-engine and team o' HORSES,&rdquo; Sam
      bellowed, &ldquo;only he wouldn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, can't you?&rdquo; cried Roddy. &ldquo;I mean he would most any time, but not
      this month. I can't have any money for a month beginning last Saturday,
      because I got paint on one of our dogs, and he came in the house with it
      on him, and got some on pretty near everything. If it hadn't 'a' been for
      that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;If it hadn't 'a' been for that! It's always
      SUMPTHING!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, why'n't you go GET a real horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roddy's face had flushed with irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn't I just TELL you&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but paused, while the
      renewal of some interesting recollection became visible in his expression.
      &ldquo;Why, I COULD, if I wanted to,&rdquo; he said more calmly. &ldquo;It wouldn't be a new
      one, maybe. I guess it would be kind of an old one, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a toy horn!&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I expect one you had when you were three
      years old, and your mother stuck it up in the attic to keep till you're
      dead, or sumpthing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not either any toy horn,&rdquo; Roddy insisted. &ldquo;It's a reg'lar horn for a
      band, and I could have it as easy as anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of this declaration was so sincere that it roused the lethargic
      Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roddy, is that true?&rdquo; he sat up to inquire piercingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is!&rdquo; Master Bitts returned. &ldquo;What you take me for? I could
      go get that horn this minute if I wanted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A real one&mdash;honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn't I say it was a real one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like in the BAND?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said so, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you mean one of those little ones,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; Roddy insisted stoutly; &ldquo;it's a big one! It winds around in a
      big circle that would go all the way around a pretty fat man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What store is it in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not in any store,&rdquo; said Roddy. &ldquo;It's at my Uncle Ethelbert's. He's
      got this horn and three or four pianos and a couple o' harps and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he keep a music store?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. These harps and pianos and all such are old ones&mdash;awful old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;he runs a second-hand store!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not!&rdquo; Master Bitts returned angrily. &ldquo;He doesn't do anything.
      He's just got 'em. He's got forty-one guitars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; Sam whooped, and jumped up and down. &ldquo;Listen to Roddy Bitts makin'
      up lies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look out, Sam Williams!&rdquo; said Roddy threateningly. &ldquo;You look out how
      you call me names!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name'd I call you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just the same as said I told lies. That's just as good as callin' me
      a liar, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;but I got a right to, if I want to. Haven't I, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; Roddy demanded hotly. &ldquo;How you got a right to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you can't prove what you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Roddy, &ldquo;you'd be just as much of one if you can't prove what
      I said WASN'T true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! You either got to prove it or be a liar. Isn't that so, Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Penrod ruled, with a little importance, &ldquo;that's the way it is,
      Roddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Roddy, &ldquo;come on over to my Uncle Ethelbert's, and I'll
      show you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I wouldn't walk over there just to find out sumpthing I
      already know isn't so. Outside of a music store there isn't anybody in the
      world got forty-one guitars! I've heard lots o' people TALK, but I never
      heard such a big l&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shut up!&rdquo; shouted Roddy. &ldquo;You ole&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why'n't you show us the horn, Roddy?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You said you could get
      it. You show us the horn and we'll believe you. If you show us the horn,
      Sam'll haf to take what he said back; won't you, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam, and added. &ldquo;He hasn't got any. He went and told a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roddy's eyes were bright with rage; he breathed noisily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You just wait here, and I'll show you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he ran furiously from the stable.

      CHAPTER XXII. THE HORN OF FAME
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Bet he won't come back!&rdquo; said Sam.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he does and he hasn't got any horn, I got a right to call him
      anything I want to, and he's got to stand it. And if he doesn't come
      back,&rdquo; Sam continued, as by the code, &ldquo;then I got a right to call him
      whatever I like next time I ketch him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect he'll have SOME kind of ole horn, maybe,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the skeptical Sam insisted, &ldquo;he won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Roddy did. Twenty minutes elapsed, and both the waiting boys had
      decided that they were legally entitled to call him whatever they thought
      fitting, when he burst in, puffing; and in his hands he bore a horn. It
      was a &ldquo;real&rdquo; one, and of a kind that neither Penrod nor Sam had ever seen
      before, though they failed to realize this, because its shape was
      instantly familiar to them. No horn could have been simpler: it consisted
      merely of one circular coil of brass with a mouthpiece at one end for the
      musician, and a wide-flaring mouth of its own, for the noise, at the
      other. But it was obviously a second-hand horn; dents slightly marred it,
      here and there, and its surface was dull, rather greenish. There were no
      keys; and a badly faded green cord and tassel hung from the coil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so shabby a horn as this electrified Penrod. It was not a stupendous
      horn, but it was a horn, and when a boy has been sighing for the moon, a
      piece of green cheese will satisfy him, for he can play that it is the
      moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme that HORN!&rdquo; Penrod shouted, as he dashed for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YAY!&rdquo; Sam cried, and sought to wrest it from him. Roddy joined the
      scuffle, trying to retain the horn; but Penrod managed to secure it. With
      one free hand he fended the others off while he blew into the mouthpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have it,&rdquo; Sam urged. &ldquo;You can't do anything with it. Lemme take
      it, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Roddy. &ldquo;Let ME! My goodness! Ain't I got any right to blow my
      own horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They pressed upon Penrod, who frantically fended and frantically blew. At
      last he remembered to compress his lips, and force the air through the
      compression.
    </p>
    <p>
      A magnificent snort from the horn was his reward. He removed his lips from
      the mouthpiece, and capered in pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Hear that? I guess <i>I</i> can't play this good ole
      horn! Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During his capers, Sam captured the horn. But Sam had not made the best of
      his opportunities as an observer of bands; he thrust the mouthpiece deep
      into his mouth, and blew until his expression became one of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Penrod exclaimed. &ldquo;You haven't got the secret of blowin' a horn,
      Sam. What's the use your keepin' hold of it, when you don't know any more
      about it 'n that? It ain't makin' a sound! You lemme have that good ole
      horn back, Sam. Haven't you got sense enough to see I know how to PLAY?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laying hands upon it, he jerked it away from Sam, who was a little piqued
      over the failure of his own efforts, especially as Penrod now produced a
      sonarous blat&mdash;quite a long one. Sam became cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; Roddy Bitts said peevishly. &ldquo;Ain't I ever goin' to get a
      turn at my own horn? Here you've had two turns, Penrod, and even Sam
      Williams&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam's petulance at once directed itself toward Roddy partly because of the
      latter's tactless use of the word &ldquo;even,&rdquo; and the two engaged in
      controversy, while Penrod was left free to continue the experiments which
      so enraptured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own horn!&rdquo; Sam sneered. &ldquo;I bet it isn't yours! Anyway, you can't
      prove it's yours, and that gives me a right to call you any&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better not! It is, too, mine. It's just the same as mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;I bet you got to take it back where you got it, and
      that's not anything like the same as yours; so I got a perfect right to
      call you whatev&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do NOT haf to take it back where I got it, either!&rdquo; Roddy cried, more
      and more irritated by his opponent's persistence in stating his rights in
      this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I BET they told you to bring it back,&rdquo; said Sam tauntingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn't, either! There wasn't anybody there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay! Then you got to get it back before they know it's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't either any such a thing! I heard my Uncle Ethelbert say Sunday he
      didn't want it. He said he wished somebody'd take that horn off his hands
      so's he could buy sumpthing else. That's just exactly what he said. I
      heard him tell my mother. He said, 'I guess I prackly got to give it away
      if I'm ever goin' to get rid of it.' Well, when my own uncle says he wants
      to give a horn away, and he wishes he could get rid of it, I guess it's
      just the same as mine, soon as I go and take it, isn't it? I'm goin' to
      keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was shaken, but he had set out to demonstrate those rights of his and
      did not mean to yield them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you'll have a NICE time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;next time your uncle goes to
      play on that horn and can't find it. No, sir; I got a perfect ri&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle don't PLAY on it!&rdquo; Roddy shrieked. &ldquo;It's an ole wore-out horn
      nobody wants, and it's mine, I tell you! I can blow on it, or bust it, or
      kick it out in the alley and leave it there, if I want to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can't. You can't PROVE you can, and unless you prove it, I got a
      perf&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roddy stamped his foot. &ldquo;I can, too!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;You ole durn jackass,
      I can, too! I can, can, can, can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod suddenly stopped his intermittent production of blats, and
      intervened. &ldquo;<i>I</i> know how you can prove it, Roddy,&rdquo; he said briskly.
      &ldquo;There's one way anybody can always prove sumpthing belongs to them, so
      that nobody'd have a right to call them what they wanted to. You can prove
      it's yours, EASY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod, &ldquo;if you give it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you mean?&rdquo; asked Roddy, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look here,&rdquo; Penrod began brightly. &ldquo;You can't give anything away
      that doesn't belong to you, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then,&rdquo; the resourceful boy continued, &ldquo;f'r instance, if you give this
      ole horn to me, that'd prove it was yours, and Sam'd haf to say it was,
      and he wouldn't have any right to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't do it!&rdquo; said Roddy sourly. &ldquo;I don't want to give you that horn.
      What I want to give you anything at all for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod sighed, as if the task of reaching Roddy's mind with reason were
      too heavy for him. &ldquo;Well, if you don't want to prove it, and rather let us
      have the right to call you anything we want to&mdash;well, all right,
      then,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look out what you call me!&rdquo; Roddy cried, only the more incensed, in
      spite of the pains Penrod was taking with him. &ldquo;I don't haf to prove it.
      It's MINE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind o' proof is that?&rdquo; Sam Williams demanded severely. &ldquo;You GOT to
      prove it and you can't do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roddy began a reply, but his agitation was so great that what he said had
      not attained coherency when Penrod again intervened. He had just
      remembered something important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> know, Roddy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If you sell it, that'd prove it
      was yours almost as good as givin' it away. What'll you take for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to sell it,&rdquo; said Roddy sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay! Yay! YAY!&rdquo; shouted the taunting Sam Williams, whose every word and
      sound had now become almost unbearable to Master Bitts. Sam was usually so
      good-natured that the only explanation of his conduct must lie in the fact
      that Roddy constitutionally got on his nerves. &ldquo;He KNOWS he can't prove
      it! He's a goner, and now we can begin callin' him anything we can think
      of! I choose to call him one first, Penrod. Roddy, you're a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; shouted Penrod, for he really believed Roddy's claims to be both
      moral and legal. When an uncle who does not even play upon an old
      second-hand horn wishes to get rid of that horn, and even complains of
      having it on his hands, it seems reasonable to consider that the horn
      becomes the property of a nephew who has gone to the trouble of carrying
      the undesired thing out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod determined to deal fairly. The difference between this horn and the
      one in the &ldquo;music-store&rdquo; window seemed to him just about the difference
      between two and eighty-five. He drew forth the green bill from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roddy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll give you two dollars for that horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam Williams's mouth fell open; he was silenced indeed. But for a moment,
      the confused and badgered Roddy was incredulous; he had not dreamed that
      Penrod possessed such a sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme take a look at that money!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      If at first there had been in Roddy's mind a little doubt about his
      present rights of ownership, he had talked himself out of it. Also, his
      financial supplies for the month were cut off, on account of the careless
      dog. Finally, he thought that the horn was worth about fifty cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it, Penrod!&rdquo; he said with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Penrod shouted aloud, prancing up and down the carriage-house
      with the horn. Roddy was happy, too, land mingled his voice with Penrod's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi! Hi! Hi!&rdquo; shouted Roddy Bitts. &ldquo;I'm goin' to buy me an air-gun down at
      Fox's hardware store!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he departed, galloping.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... He returned the following afternoon. School was over, and Penrod and
      Sam were again in the stable; Penrod &ldquo;was practising&rdquo; upon the horn, with
      Sam for an unenthusiastic spectator and auditor. Master Bitts' brow was
      heavy; he looked uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I got to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod removed the horn briefly from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't come bangin' around here and interrup' me all the time,&rdquo; he said
      severely. &ldquo;I got to practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he again pressed the mouthpiece to his lips. He was not of those whom
      importance makes gracious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Penrod,&rdquo; said Roddy, &ldquo;I got to have that horn back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod lowered the horn quickly enough at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you talkin' about?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What you want to come bangin'
      around here for and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came around here for that horn,&rdquo; Master Bitts returned, and his manner
      was both dogged and apprehensive, the apprehension being more prevalent
      when he looked at Sam. &ldquo;I got to have that horn,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, who had been sitting in the wheelbarrow, jumped up and began to dance
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay! It WASN'T his, after all! Roddy Bitts told a big l&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never, either!&rdquo; Roddy almost wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what you want the horn back for?&rdquo; the terrible Sam demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, 'cause I want it. I got a right to want it if I want to, haven't
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's face had flushed with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look here, Sam,&rdquo; he began hotly. &ldquo;Didn't you hear Roddy say this was
      his horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it!&rdquo; Sam declared. &ldquo;He said it a million times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and didn't he sell this horn to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, SIR!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I pay him money cash down for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and ain't it my horn now, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YES, sir!&rdquo; Penrod went on with vigour. &ldquo;It's my horn now whether it
      belonged to you or not, Roddy, because you SOLD it to me and I paid my
      good ole money for it. I guess a thing belongs to th`, person that paid
      their own money for it, doesn't it? <i>I</i> don't haf to give up my own
      propaty, even if you did come on over here and told us a big l&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> NEVER!&rdquo; shouted Roddy. &ldquo;It was my horn, too, and I didn't tell
      any such a thing!&rdquo; He paused; then, reverting to his former manner, said
      stubbornly, &ldquo;I got to have that horn back. I GOT to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why'n't you tell us what FOR, then?&rdquo; Sam insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roddy's glance at this persecutor was one of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know my own biz'nuss!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while Sam jeered, Roddy turned to Penrod desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gimme that horn back! I got to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod followed Sam's lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why can't you tell us what FOR?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps if Sam had not been there, Roddy could have unbosomed himself. He
      had no doubt of his own virtue in this affair, and he was conscious that
      he had acted in good faith throughout&mdash;though, perhaps, a little
      impulsively. But he was in a predicament, and he knew that if he became
      more explicit, Sam could establish with undeniable logic those rights
      about which he had been so odious the day before. Such triumph for Sam was
      not within Roddy's power to contemplate; he felt that he would rather die,
      or sumpthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got to have that horn!&rdquo; he reiterated woodenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod had no intention to humour this preposterous boy, and it was only
      out of curiosity that he asked, &ldquo;Well, if you want the horn back, where's
      the two dollars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spent it. I bought an air-gun for a dollar and sixty-five cents, and
      three sodies and some candy with the rest. I'll owe you the two dollars,
      Penrod. I'm willing to do that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you give him the air-gun,&rdquo; asked the satirical Sam, &ldquo;and
      owe him the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't. Papa took the air-gun away from me because he didn't like
      sumpthing I did with it. I got to owe you the whole two dollars, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Roddy,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Don't you s'pose I'd rather keep this
      horn and blow on it than have you owe me two dollars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something about this simple question which convinced Roddy that
      his cause was lost. His hopes had been but faint from the beginning of the
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; said Roddy. For a time he scuffed the floor with his shoe.
      &ldquo;Daw-gone it!&rdquo; he said, at last; and he departed morosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod had already begun to &ldquo;practice&rdquo; again, and Mr. Williams, after vain
      appeals to be permitted to practice in turn, sank into the wheelbarrow in
      a state of boredom, not remarkable under the circumstances. Then Penrod
      contrived&mdash;it may have been accidental&mdash;to produce at one blast
      two tones which varied in pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pride and excitement were extreme though not contagious. &ldquo;Listen,
      Sam!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;How's THAT for high?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bored Sam made no response other than to rise languidly to his feet,
      stretch, and start for home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Penrod's practice became less ardent; he needed the stimulus
      of an auditor. With the horn upon his lap he began to rub the greenish
      brass surface with a rag. He meant to make this good ole two-dollar horn
      of his LOOK like sumpthing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, moved by a better idea, he left the horn in the stable and went
      into the house, soon afterward appearing before his mother in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; he said, complainingly, &ldquo;Della won't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Schofield checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh, Penrod; your father's reading the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod glanced at Mr. Schofield, who sat near the window, reading by the
      last light of the early sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know it,&rdquo; said Penrod, lowering his voice. &ldquo;But I wish you'd tell
      Della to let me have the silver polish. She says she won't, and I want to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Penrod, you can't have the silver polish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mamma&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not another word. Can't you see you're interrupting your father. Go on,
      papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield read aloud several despatches from abroad, and after each
      one of them Penrod began in a low but pleading tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, I want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH, Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield continued to read, and Penrod remained in the room, for he
      was determined to have the silver polish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's something curious,&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield, as his eye fell upon a
      paragraph among the &ldquo;locals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valuable relic missing,&rdquo; Mr. Schofield read. &ldquo;It was reported at police
      headquarters to-day that a 'valuable object had been stolen from the
      collection of antique musical instruments owned by E. Magsworth Bitts, 724
      Central Avenue. The police insist that it must have been an inside job,
      but Mr. Magsworth Bitts inclines to think it was the work of a negro, as
      only one article was removed and nothing else found to be disturbed. The
      object stolen was an ancient hunting-horn dating from the eighteenth
      century and claimed to have belonged to Louis XV, King of France. It was
      valued at about twelve hundred and fifty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield opened her mouth wide. &ldquo;Why, that IS curious!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up. &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod was no longer in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; Mr. Schofield inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield breathlessly. &ldquo;HE bought an old horn&mdash;like
      one in old hunting-pictures&mdash;yesterday! He bought it with some money
      Uncle Joe gave him! He bought it from Roddy Bitts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where'd he go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they rushed to the back porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod had removed the lid of the cistern; he was kneeling beside it, and
      the fact that the diameter of the opening into the cistern was one inch
      less than the diameter of the coil of Louis the Fifteenth's hunting-horn
      was all that had just saved Louis the Fifteenth's hunting-horn from
      joining the drowned trousers of Herman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Penrod's instinct, and thus loyally he had followed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... He was dragged into the library, expecting anything whatever. The
      dreadful phrases of the newspaper item rang through his head like the
      gongs of delirium: &ldquo;Police headquarters!&rdquo; &ldquo;Work of a negro!&rdquo; &ldquo;King of
      France!&rdquo; &ldquo;Valued at about twelve hundred and fifty dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eighty-five dollars had dismayed him; twelve hundred and fifty was
      unthinkable. Nightmares were coming to life before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a light broke slowly; it came first to Mr. and Mrs. Schofield, and it
      was they who illuminated Penrod. Slowly, slowly, as they spoke more and
      more pleasantly to him, it began to dawn upon him that this trouble was
      all Roddy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Mr. Schofield went to take the horn to the house of Mr. Ethelbert
      Magsworth Bitts, Penrod sat quietly with his mother. Mr. Schofield was
      gone an hour and a half. Upon his solemn return he reported that Roddy's
      father had been summoned by telephone to bring his son to the house of
      Uncle Ethelbert. Mr. Bitts had forthwith appeared with Roddy, and, when
      Mr. Schofield came away, Roddy was still (after half an hour's previous
      efforts) explaining his honourable intentions. Mr. Schofield indicated
      that Roddy's condition was agitated, and that he was having a great deal
      of difficulty in making his position clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's imagination paused outside the threshold of that room in Mr.
      Ethelbert Magsworth Bitts' house, and awe fell upon him when he thought of
      it. Roddy seemed to have disappeared within a shrouding mist where
      Penrod's mind refused to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he got back his ole horn!&rdquo; said Sam after school the next
      afternoon. &ldquo;I KNEW we had a perfect right to call him whatever we wanted
      to! I bet you hated to give up that good ole horn, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod was serene. He was even a little superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm goin' to learn to play on sumpthing better'n any
      ole horn. It's lots better, because you can carry it around with you
      anywhere, and you couldn't a horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Sam asked, not too much pleased by Penrod's air of
      superiority and high content. &ldquo;You mean a jew's-harp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not! I mean a flute with all silver on it and everything. My
      father's goin' to buy me one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet he isn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, too,&rdquo; said Penrod; &ldquo;soon as I'm twenty-one years old.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIII. THE PARTY

       |                            |
       |     Miss Amy Rennsdale     |
       |                            |
       |          At Home           |
       | Saturday, the twenty-third |
       |     from three to six      |
       |                            |
       | R.s.v.p.           Dancing |
        &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      This little card, delicately engraved, betokened the hospitality
      incidental to the ninth birthday anniversary of Baby Rennsdale, youngest
      member of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class, and, by the same token, it
      represented the total social activity (during that season) of a certain
      limited bachelor set consisting of Messrs. Penrod Schofield and Samuel
      Williams. The truth must be faced: Penrod and Sam were seldom invited to
      small parties; they were considered too imaginative. But in the case of so
      large an affair as Miss Rennsdale's, the feeling that their parents would
      be sensitive outweighed fears of what Penrod and Sam might do at the
      party. Reputation is indeed a bubble, but sometimes it is blown of sticky
      stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comrades set out for the fete in company, final maternal outpourings
      upon deportment and the duty of dancing with the hostess evaporating in
      their freshly cleaned ears. Both boys, however, were in a state of mind,
      body, and decoration appropriate to the gala scene they were approaching.
      Their collars were wide and white; inside the pockets of their overcoats
      were glistening dancing-pumps, wrapped in tissue-paper; inside their
      jacket pockets were pleasant-smelling new white gloves, and inside their
      heads solemn timidity commingled with glittering anticipations. Before
      them, like a Christmas tree glimpsed through lace curtains, they beheld
      joy shimmering&mdash;music, ice-cream, macaroons, tinsel caps, and the
      starched ladies of their hearts Penrod and Sam walked demurely yet almost
      boundingly; their faces were shining but grave&mdash;they were on their
      way to the Party!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at there!&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;There's Carlie Chitten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Sam asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cross the street. Haven't you got any eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whyn't you say he was 'cross the street in the first place?&rdquo; Sam
      returned plaintively. &ldquo;Besides, he's so little you can't hardly see him.&rdquo;
       This was, of course, a violent exaggeration, though Master Chitten, not
      yet eleven years old, was an inch or two short for his age. &ldquo;He's all
      dressed up,&rdquo; Sam added. &ldquo;I guess he must be invited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet he does sumpthing,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet he does, too,&rdquo; Sam agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the extent of their comment upon the small person across the
      street; but, in spite of its non-committal character, the manner of both
      commentators seemed to indicate that they had just exchanged views upon an
      interesting and even curious subject. They walked along in silence for
      several minutes, staring speculatively at Master Chitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      His appearance was pleasant and not remarkable. He was a handsome, dark
      little boy, with quick eyes and a precociously reserved expression; his
      air was &ldquo;well-bred&rdquo;; he was exquisitely neat, and he had a look of manly
      competence that grown people found attractive and reassuring. In short, he
      was a boy of whom a timid adult stranger would have inquired the way with
      confidence. And yet Sam and Penrod had mysterious thoughts about him&mdash;obviously
      there was something subterranean here.
    </p>
    <p>
      They continued to look at him for the greater part of block, when, their
      progress bringing them in sight of Miss Amy Rennsdale's place of residence
      their attention was directed to a group of men bearing festal burdens&mdash;encased
      violins, a shrouded harp and other beckoning shapes. There were signs,
      too, that most of &ldquo;those invited&rdquo; intended to miss no moment of this
      party; guests already indoors watched from the windows the approach of the
      musicians. Washed boys in black and white, and girls in tender colours
      converged from various directions, making gayly for the thrilling gateway&mdash;and
      the most beautiful little girl in all the world, Marjorie Jones, of the
      amber curls, jumped from a carriage step to the curbstone as Penrod and
      Sam came up. She waved to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam responded heartily; but Penrod, feeling real emotion and seeking to
      conceal it, muttered, &ldquo;'Lo, Marjorie!&rdquo; gruffly, offering no further
      demonstration. Marjorie paused a moment, expectant, and then, as he did
      not seize the opportunity to ask her for the first dance, she tried not to
      look disappointed and ran into the house ahead of the two boys. Penrod was
      scarlet; he wished to dance the first dance with Marjorie, and the second
      and the third and all the other dances, and he strongly desired to sit
      with her &ldquo;at refreshments&rdquo;; but he had been unable to ask for a single one
      of these privileges. It would have been impossible for him to state why he
      was thus dumb, although the reason was simple and wholly complimentary to
      Marjorie: she had looked so overpoweringly pretty that she had produced in
      the bosom of her admirer a severe case of stage fright. That was &ldquo;all the
      matter with him&rdquo;; but it was the beginning of his troubles, and he did not
      recover until he and Sam reached the &ldquo;gentlemen's dressing-room&rdquo;, whither
      they were directed by a polite coloured man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they found a cloud of acquaintances getting into pumps and gloves,
      and, in a few extreme cases, readjusting hair before a mirror. Some even
      went so far&mdash;after removing their shoes and putting on their pumps&mdash;as
      to wash traces of blacking from their hands in the adjacent bathroom
      before assuming their gloves. Penrod, being in a strange mood, was one of
      these, sharing the basin with little Maurice Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carrie Chitten's here,&rdquo; said Maurice, as they soaped their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I know it,&rdquo; Penrod returned. &ldquo;I bet he does sumpthing, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maurice shook his head ominously. &ldquo;Well, I'm gettin' tired of it. I know
      he was the one stuck that cold fried egg in P'fesser Bartet's overcoat
      pocket at dancin'-school, and ole p'fesser went and blamed it on me. Then,
      Carlie, he cum up to me, th' other day, and he says, 'Smell my buttonhole
      bokay.' He had some vi'lets stickin' in his buttonhole, and I went to
      smell 'em and water squirted on me out of 'em. I guess I've stood about
      enough, and if he does another thing I don't like, he better look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod showed some interest, inquiring for details, whereupon Maurice
      explained that if Master Chitten displeased him further, Master Chitten
      would receive a blow upon one of his features. Maurice was simple and
      homely about it, seeking rhetorical vigour rather than elegance; in fact,
      what he definitely promised Master Chitten was &ldquo;a bang on the snoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod, &ldquo;he never bothered ME any. I expect he knows too much
      for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cry of pain was heard from the dressing-room at this juncture, and,
      glancing through the doorway, Maurice and Penrod beheld Sam Williams in
      the act of sucking his right thumb with vehemence, the while his brow was
      contorted and his eyes watered. He came into the bathroom and held his
      thumb under a faucet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That darn little Carlie Chitten!&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;He ast me to hold a
      little tin box he showed me. He told me to hold it between my thumb and
      fingers and he'd show me sumpthing. Then he pushed the lid, and a big
      needle came out of a hole and stuck me half through my thumb. That's a
      NICE way to act, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carlie Chitten's dark head showed itself cautiously beyond the casing of
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's your thumb, Sam?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait!&rdquo; Sam shouted, turning furiously; but the small prestidigitator
      was gone. With a smothered laugh, Carlie dashed through the groups of boys
      in the dressing-room and made his way downstairs, his manner reverting to
      its usual polite gravity before he entered the drawing-room, where his
      hostess waited. Music sounding at about this time, he was followed by the
      other boys, who came trooping down, leaving the dressing-room empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, among the tail-enders of the procession, made his dancing-school
      bow to Miss Rennsdale and her grown-up supporters (two maiden aunts and a
      governess) then he looked about for Marjorie, discovering her but too
      easily. Her amber curls were swaying gently in time to the music; she
      looked never more beautiful, and her partner was Master Chitten!
    </p>
    <p>
      A pang of great penetrative power and equal unexpectedness found the most
      vulnerable spot beneath the simple black of Penrod Schofield's jacket.
      Straightway he turned his back upon the crash-covered floors where the
      dancers were, and moved gloomily toward the hall. But one of the maiden
      aunts Rennsdale waylaid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Penrod Schofield, isn't it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Or Sammy Williams? I'm not
      sure which. Is it Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Penrod, I can find a partner for you. There are several dear little
      girls over here, if you'll come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, shifted from one foot to the other, and looked
      enigmatic. &ldquo;I better not,&rdquo; he said. He meant no offence; his trouble was
      only that he had not yet learned how to do as he pleased at a party and,
      at the same time, to seem polite about it. &ldquo;I guess I don't want to,&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; And Miss Rennsdale instantly left him to his own devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to lurk in the wide doorway between the hall and the drawing-room&mdash;under
      such conditions the universal refuge of his sex at all ages. There he
      found several boys of notorious shyness, and stood with them in a mutually
      protective group. Now and then one of them would lean upon another until
      repelled by action and a husky &ldquo;What's matter 'th you? Get off o' me!&rdquo;
       They all twisted their slender necks uneasily against the inner bands of
      their collars, at intervals, and sometimes exchanged facetious blows under
      cover. In the distance Penrod caught glimpses of amber curls flashing to
      and fro, and he knew himself to be among the derelicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained in this questionable sanctuary during the next dance; but,
      edging along the wall to lean more comfortably in a corner, as the music
      of the third sounded, he overheard part of a conversation that somewhat
      concerned him. The participants were the governess of his hostess, Miss
      Lowe, and that one of the aunts Rennsdale who had offered to provide him
      with a partner. These two ladies were standing just in front of him,
      unconscious of his nearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never,&rdquo; Miss Rennsdale said, &ldquo;never saw a more fascinating little boy
      than that Carlie Chitten. There'll be some heartaches when he grows up; I
      can't keep my eyes off him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he's a charming boy,&rdquo; Miss Lowe said. &ldquo;His manners are remarkable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a little man of the world,&rdquo; the enthusiastic Miss Rennsdale went on,
      &ldquo;very different from such boys as Penrod Schofield!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, PENROD!&rdquo; Miss Lowe exclaimed. &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why he came. He declines to dance&mdash;rudely, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think the little girls will mind that so much!&rdquo; Miss Lowe said.
      &ldquo;If you'd come to the dancing class some Friday with Amy and me, you'd
      understand why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved away. Penrod heard his name again mentioned between them as
      they went, and, though he did not catch the accompanying remark, he was
      inclined to think it unfavourable. He remained where he was, brooding
      morbidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood that the government was against him, nor was his judgment at
      fault in this conclusion. He was affected, also, by the conduct of
      Marjorie, who was now dancing gayly with Maurice Levy, a former rival of
      Penrod's. The fact that Penrod had not gone near her did not make her
      culpability seem the less; in his gloomy heart he resolved not to ask her
      for one single dance. He would not go near her. He would not go near ANY
      OF 'EM!
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes began to burn, and he swallowed heavily; but he was never one to
      succumb piteously to such emotion, and it did not even enter his head that
      he was at liberty to return to his own home. Neither he nor any of his
      friends had ever left a party until it was officially concluded. What his
      sufferings demanded of him now for their alleviation was not departure but
      action!
    </p>
    <p>
      Underneath the surface, nearly all children's parties contain a group of
      outlaws who wait only for a leader to hoist the black flag. The group
      consists mainly of boys too shy to be at ease with the girls, but who wish
      to distinguish themselves in some way; and there are others, ordinarily
      well behaved, whom the mere actuality of a party makes drunken. The effect
      of music, too, upon children is incalculable, especially when they do not
      hear it often&mdash;and both a snare-drum and a bass drum were in the
      expensive orchestra at the Rennsdale party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the outlawry at any party may remain incipient unless a
      chieftain appears; but in Penrod's corner were now gathering into one
      anarchical mood all the necessary qualifications for leadership. Out of
      that bitter corner there stepped, not a Penrod Schofield subdued and
      hoping to win the lost favour of the Authorities, but a hot-hearted rebel
      determined on an uprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling a reckless and challenging smile, he returned to the cluster of
      boys in the wide doorway and began to push one and another of them about.
      They responded hopefully with counter-pushes, and presently there was a
      tumultuous surging and eddying in that quarter, accompanied by noises that
      began to compete with the music. Then Penrod allowed himself to be shoved
      out among the circling dancers, so that he collided with Marjorie and
      Maurice Levy, almost oversetting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a mock bow and a mock apology, being inspired to invent a jargon
      phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, at the same time making vocal his own conception of
      a taunting laugh. &ldquo;Excuse me, but I must 'a' got your bumpus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie looked grieved and turned away with Maurice; but the boys in the
      doorway squealed with maniac laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gotcher bumpus! Gotcher bumpus!&rdquo; they shrilled. And they began to push
      others of their number against the dancing couples, shouting, &ldquo;'Scuse me!
      Gotcher bumpus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It became a contagion and then a game. As the dances went on, strings of
      boys, led by Penrod, pursued one another across the rooms, howling,
      &ldquo;Gotcher bumpus!&rdquo; at the top of their lungs. They dodged and ducked, and
      seized upon dancers as shields; they caromed from one couple into another,
      and even into the musicians of the orchestra. Boys who were dancing
      abandoned their partners and joined the marauders, shrieking, &ldquo;Gotcher
      bumpus!&rdquo; Potted plants went down; a slender gilt chair refused to support
      the hurled body of Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts, and the sound of
      splintering wood mingled with other sounds. Dancing became impossible;
      Miss Amy Rennsdale wept in the midst of the riot, and everybody knew that
      Penrod Schofield had &ldquo;started it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under instructions, the leader of the orchestra, clapping his hands for
      attention, stepped to the centre of the drawing-room, and shouted,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment silence, if you bleace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the hubbub ceased; the virtuous and the wicked paused alike in
      their courses to listen. Miss Amy Rennsdale was borne away to have her
      tearful face washed, and Marjorie Jones and Carlie Chitten and Georgie
      Bassett came forward consciously, escorted by Miss Lowe. The musician
      waited until the return of the small hostess; then he announced in a loud
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fency dence called 'Les Papillons', denced by Miss Amy Rennstul, Miss
      Chones, Mister Chorch Passett, ant Mister Jitten. Some young chentlemen
      haf mate so much noise ant confoosion Miss Lowe wish me to ask bleace no
      more such a nonsense. Fency dence, 'Les Papillons'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, after formal salutations, Mr. Chitten took Marjorie's hand,
      Georgie Bassett took Miss Rennsdale's, and they proceeded to dance &ldquo;Les
      Papillons&rdquo; in a manner that made up in conscientiousness whatever it may
      have lacked in abandon. The outlaw leader looked on, smiling a smile
      intended to represent careless contempt, but in reality he was
      unpleasantly surprised. A fancy dance by Georgie Bassett and Baby
      Rennsdale was customary at every party attended by members of the Friday
      Afternoon Dancing Class; but Marjorie and Carlie Chitten were new
      performers, and Penrod had not heard that they had learned to dance &ldquo;Les
      Papillons&rdquo; together. He was the further embittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlie made a false step, recovering himself with some difficulty,
      whereupon a loud, jeering squawk of laughter was heard from the insurgent
      cluster, which had been awed to temporary quiet but still maintained its
      base in the drawing-room doorway. There was a general &ldquo;SH!&rdquo; followed by a
      shocked whispering, as well as a general turning of eyes toward Penrod.
      But it was not Penrod who had laughed, though no one would have credited
      him with an alibi. The laughter came from two throats that breathed as one
      with such perfect simultaneousness that only one was credited with the
      disturbance. These two throats belonged respectively to Samuel Williams
      and Maurice Levy, who were standing in a strikingly
      Rosencrantz-and-Guildenstern attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got me with his ole tin-box needle, too,&rdquo; Maurice muttered to Sam. &ldquo;He
      was goin' to do it to Marjorie, and I told her to look out, and he says,
      'Here, YOU take it!' all of a sudden, and he stuck it in my hand so quick
      I never thought. And then, BIM! his ole needle shot out and perty near
      went through my thumb-bone or sumpthing. He'll be sorry before this day's
      over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam darkly, &ldquo;he's goin' to be sorry he stuck ME, anyway!&rdquo;
       Neither Sam nor Maurice had even the vaguest plan for causing the desired
      regret in the breast of Master Chitten; but both derived a little
      consolation from these prophecies. And they, too, had aligned themselves
      with the insurgents. Their motives were personal&mdash;Carlie Chitten had
      wronged both of them, and Carlie was conspicuously in high favour with the
      Authorities. Naturally Sam and Maurice were against the Authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Les Papillons&rdquo; came to a conclusion. Carlie and Georgie bowed; Marjorie
      Jones and Baby Rennsdale curtesied, and there was loud applause. In fact,
      the demonstration became so uproarious that some measure of it was open to
      suspicion, especially as hisses of reptilian venomousness were commingled
      with it, and also a hoarse but vociferous repetition of the dastard words,
      &ldquo;Carrie dances ROTTEN!&rdquo; Again it was the work of Rosencrantz and
      Guildenstern; but the plot was attributed to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SHAME, Penrod Schofield!&rdquo; said both the aunts Rennsdale publicly, and
      Penrod, wholly innocent, became scarlet with indignant mortification.
      Carlie Chitten himself, however, marked the true offenders. A slight flush
      tinted his cheeks, and then, in his quiet, self-contained way, he slipped
      through the crowd of girls and boys, unnoticed, into the hall, and ran
      noiselessly up the stairs and into the &ldquo;gentlemen's dressing-room&rdquo;, now
      inhabited only by hats, caps, overcoats, and the temporarily discarded
      shoes of the dancers. Most of the shoes stood in rows against the wall,
      and Carlie examined these rows attentively, after a time discovering a
      pair of shoes with patent leather tips. He knew them; they belonged to
      Maurice Levy, and, picking them up, he went to a corner of the room where
      four shoes had been left together under a chair. Upon the chair were
      overcoats and caps that he was able to identify as the property of Penrod
      Schofield and Samuel Williams; but, as he was not sure which pair of shoes
      belonged to Penrod and which to Sam, he added both pairs to Maurice's and
      carried them into the bathroom. Here he set the plug in the tub, turned
      the faucets, and, after looking about him and discovering large supplies
      of all sorts in a wall cabinet, he tossed six cakes of green soap into the
      tub. He let the soap remain in the water to soften a little, and,
      returning to the dressing room, whiled away the time in mixing and
      mismating pairs of shoes along the walls, and also in tying the strings of
      the mismated shoes together in hard knots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout all this, his expression was grave and intent; his bright eyes
      grew brighter, but he did not smile. Carlie Chitten was a singular boy,
      though not unique: he was an &ldquo;only child&rdquo;, lived at a hotel, and found
      life there favourable to the development of certain peculiarities in his
      nature. He played a lone hand, and with what precocious diplomacy he
      played that curious hand was attested by the fact that Carlie was
      brilliantly esteemed by parents and guardians in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be said for Carlie that, in one way, his nature was liberal. For
      instance, having come upstairs to prepare a vengeance upon Sam and Maurice
      in return for their slurs upon his dancing, he did not confine his efforts
      to the belongings of those two alone. He provided every boy in the house
      with something to think about later, when shoes should be resumed; and he
      was far from stopping at that. Casting about him for some material that he
      desired, he opened a door of the dressing-room and found himself
      confronting the apartment of Miss Lowe. Upon a desk he beheld the bottle
      of mucilage he wanted, and, having taken possession of it, he allowed his
      eye the privilege of a rapid glance into a dressing table drawer,
      accidentally left open.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the dressing-room, five seconds later, carrying not only
      the mucilage but a &ldquo;switch&rdquo; worn by Miss Lowe when her hair was dressed in
      a fashion different from that which she had favoured for the party. This
      &ldquo;switch&rdquo; he placed in the pocket of a juvenile overcoat unknown to him,
      and then he took the mucilage into the bathroom. There he rescued from the
      water the six cakes of soap, placed one in each of the six shoes, pounding
      it down securely into the toe of the shoe with the handle of a back brush.
      After that, Carlie poured mucilage into all six shoes impartially until
      the bottle was empty, then took them back to their former positions in the
      dressing-room. Finally, with careful forethought, he placed his own shoes
      in the pockets of his overcoat, and left the overcoat and his cap upon a
      chair near the outer door of the room. Then he went quietly downstairs,
      having been absent from the festivities a little less than twelve minutes.
      He had been energetic&mdash;only a boy could have accomplished so much in
      so short a time. In fact, Carlie had been so busy that his forgetting to
      turn off the faucets in the bathroom is not at all surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had noticed his absence. That infectious pastime, &ldquo;Gotcher bumpus&rdquo;,
      had broken out again, and the general dancing, which had been resumed upon
      the conclusion of &ldquo;Les Papillons&rdquo;, was once more becoming demoralized.
      Despairingly the aunts Rennsdale and Miss Lowe brought forth from the rear
      of the house a couple of waiters and commanded them to arrest the
      ringleaders, whereupon hilarious terror spread among the outlaw band.
      Shouting tauntingly at their pursuers, they fled&mdash;and bellowing,
      trampling flight swept through every quarter of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refreshments quelled this outbreak for a time. The orchestra played a
      march; Carlie Chitten and Georgie Bassett, with Amy Rennsdale and
      Marjorie, formed the head of a procession, while all the boys who had
      retained their sense of decorum immediately sought partners and fell in
      behind. The outlaws, succumbing to ice cream hunger, followed suit, one
      after the other, until all of the girls were provided with escorts. Then,
      to the moral strains of &ldquo;The Stars and Stripes Forever&rdquo;, the children
      paraded out to the dining-room. Two and two they marched, except at the
      extreme tail end of the line, where, since there were three more boys than
      girls at the party, the three left-over boys were placed. These three were
      also the last three outlaws to succumb and return to civilization from
      outlying portions of the house after the pursuit by waiters. They were
      Messieurs Maurice Levy, Samuel Williams, and Penrod Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took their chairs in the capacious dining-room quietly enough, though
      their expressions were eloquent of bravado, and they jostled one another
      and their neighbours intentionally, even in the act of sitting. However,
      it was not long before delectable foods engaged their whole attention and
      Miss Amy Rennsdale's party relapsed into etiquette for the following
      twenty minutes. The refection concluded with the mild explosion of paper
      &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; that erupted bright-coloured, fantastic headgear, and, during
      the snapping of the &ldquo;crackers&rdquo;, Penrod heard the voice of Marjorie calling
      from somewhere behind him, &ldquo;Carrie and Amy, will you change chairs with
      Georgie Bassett and me&mdash;just for fun?&rdquo; The chairs had been placed in
      rows, back to back, and Penrod would not even turn his head to see if
      Master Chitten and Miss Rennsdale accepted Marjorie's proposal, though
      they were directly behind him and Sam; but he grew red and breathed hard.
      A moment later, the liberty-cap that he had set upon his head was softly
      removed, and a little crown of silver paper put in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PENROD?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whisper was close to his ear, and a gentle breath cooled the back of
      his neck.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. THE HEART OF MARJORIE JONES
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Well, what you want?&rdquo; Penrod asked, brusquely.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Marjorie's wonderful eyes were dark and mysterious, like still water at
      twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you behave so AWFUL?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't either! I guess I got a right to do the way I want to, haven't
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; said Marjorie, &ldquo;you ought to quit bumping into people so
      it hurts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poh! It wouldn't hurt a fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it did. It hurt when you bumped Maurice and me that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't either. WHERE'D it hurt you? Let's see if it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can't show you, but it did. Penrod, are you going to keep on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's heart had melted within him; but his reply was pompous and cold.
      &ldquo;I will if I feel like it, and I won't if I feel like it. You wait and
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Marjorie jumped up and ran around to him abandoning her escort. All
      the children were leaving their chairs and moving toward the
      dancing-rooms; the orchestra was playing dance-music again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Penrod!&rdquo; Marjorie cried. &ldquo;Let's go dance this together. Come
      on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With seeming reluctance, he suffered her to lead him away. &ldquo;Well, I'll go
      with you; but I won't dance,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;I wouldn't dance with the President
      of the United States&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;because well, I won't DO it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I don't care. I guess I've danced plenty, anyhow. Let's go in
      here.&rdquo; She led him into a room too small for dancing, used ordinarily by
      Miss Amy Rennsdale's father as his study, and now vacant. For a while
      there was silence; but finally Marjorie pointed to the window and said
      shyly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Penrod, it's getting dark. The party'll be over pretty soon, and
      you've never danced one single time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I know that, don't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was unable to cast aside his outward truculence though it was but a
      relic. However, his voice was gentler, and Marjorie seemed satisfied. From
      the other rooms came the swinging music, shouts of &ldquo;Gotcher bumpus!&rdquo;
       sounds of stumbling, of scrambling, of running, of muffled concus signs
      and squeals of dismay. Penrod's followers were renewing the wild work,
      even in the absence of their chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield, you bad boy,&rdquo; said Marjorie, &ldquo;you started every bit of
      that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> didn't do anything,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and he believed it. &ldquo;Pick on
      me for everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they wouldn't if you didn't do so much,&rdquo; said Marjorie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn't, either. Who would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Miss Lowe,&rdquo; he specified bitterly. &ldquo;Yes, and Baby Rennsdale's aunts.
      If the house'd burn down, I bet they'd say Penrod Schofield did it!
      Anybody does anything at ALL, they say, 'Penrod Schofield, shame on you!'
      When you and Carlie were dan&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod, I just hate that little Carlie Chitten. P'fesser Bartet made me
      learn that dance with him; but I just hate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was now almost completely mollified; nevertheless, he continued to
      set forth his grievance. &ldquo;Well, they all turned around to me and they
      said, 'Why, Penrod Schofield, shame on you!' And I hadn't done a single
      thing! I was just standin' there. They got to blame ME, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie laughed airily. &ldquo;Well, if you aren't the foolishest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would, too,&rdquo; he asserted, with renewed bitterness. &ldquo;If the house was
      to fall down, you'd see! They'd all say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie interrupted him. She put her hand on the top of her head, looking
      a little startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like rain!&rdquo; Marjorie cried. &ldquo;Like it was raining in here! A drop fell on
      my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it couldn't&mdash;&rdquo; he began. But at this instant a drop fell upon
      his head, too, and, looking up, they beheld a great oozing splotch upon
      the ceiling. Drops were gathering upon it and falling; the tinted plaster
      was cracking, and a little stream began to patter down and splash upon the
      floor. Then there came a resounding thump upstairs, just above them, and
      fragments of wet plaster fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The roof must be leaking,&rdquo; said Marjorie, beginning to be alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't be the roof,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Besides there ain't any rain
      outdoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a second slender stream of water began to patter upon the
      floor of the hall outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; Marjorie cried, while the ceiling above them shook as
      with earthquake&mdash;or as with boys in numbers jumping, and a great
      uproar burst forth overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe the house IS falling down, Penrod!&rdquo; she quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they'll blame ME for it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyways, we better get out o'
      here. I guess sumpthing must be the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His guess was accurate, so far as it went. The dance-music had swung into
      &ldquo;Home Sweet Home&rdquo; some time before, the children were preparing to leave,
      and Master Chitten had been the first boy to ascend to the gentlemen's
      dressing-room for his cap, overcoat and shoes, his motive being to avoid
      by departure any difficulty in case his earlier activities should cause
      him to be suspected by the other boys. But in the doorway he halted,
      aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights had not been turned on; but even the dim windows showed that
      the polished floor gave back reflections no floor-polish had ever
      equalled. It was a gently steaming lake, from an eighth to a quarter of an
      inch deep. And Carlie realized that he had forgotten to turn off the
      faucets in the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, his savoir faire deserted him, and he was filled with
      ordinary, human-boy panic. Then, at a sound of voices behind him, he lost
      his head and rushed into the bathroom. It was dark, but certain sensations
      and the splashing of his pumps warned him that the water was deeper in
      there. The next instant the lights were switched on in both bathroom and
      dressing-room, and Carlie beheld Sam Williams in the doorway of the
      former.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look, Maurice!&rdquo; Sam shouted, in frantic excitement. &ldquo;Somebody's let
      the tub run over, and it's about ten feet deep! Carlie Chitten's sloshin'
      around in here. Let's hold the door on him and keep him in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carlie rushed to prevent the execution of this project; but he slipped and
      went swishing full length along the floor, creating a little surf before
      him as he slid, to the demoniac happiness of Sam and Maurice. They closed
      the door, however, and, as other boys rushed, shouting and splashing, into
      the flooded dressing-room, Carlie began to hammer upon the panels. Then
      the owners of shoes, striving to rescue them from the increasing waters,
      made discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most dangerous time to give a large children's party is when there has
      not been one for a long period. The Rennsdale party had that misfortune,
      and its climax was the complete and convulsive madness of the gentlemen's
      dressing-room during those final moments supposed to be given to quiet
      preparations, on the part of guests, for departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the upper hall and upon the stairway, panic-stricken little girls
      listened, wild-eyed, to the uproar that went on, while waiters and maid
      servants rushed with pails and towels into what was essentially the worst
      ward in Bedlam. Boys who had behaved properly all afternoon now gave way
      and joined the confraternity of lunatics. The floors of the house shook to
      tramplings, rushes, wrestlings, falls and collisions. The walls resounded
      to chorused bellowings and roars. There were pipings of pain and pipings
      of joy; there was whistling to pierce the drums of ears; there were
      hootings and howlings and bleatings and screechings, while over all
      bleated the heathen battle-cry incessantly: &ldquo;GOTCHER BUMPUS! GOTCHER
      BUMPUS!&rdquo; For the boys had been inspired by the unusual water to transform
      Penrod's game of &ldquo;Gotcher bumpus&rdquo; into an aquatic sport, and to induce one
      another, by means of superior force, dexterity, or stratagems, either to
      sit or to lie at full length in the flood, after the example of Carlie
      Chitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the aunts Rennsdale had taken what charge she could of the deafened
      and distracted maids and waiters who were working to stem the tide, while
      the other of the aunts Rennsdale stood with her niece and Miss Lowe at the
      foot of the stairs, trying to say good-night reassuringly to those of the
      terrified little girls who were able to tear themselves away. This latter
      aunt Rennsdale marked a dripping figure that came unobtrusively, and yet
      in a self-contained and gentlemanly manner, down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carlie Chitten!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You poor dear child, you're soaking! To
      think those outrageous little fiends wouldn't even spare YOU!&rdquo; As she
      spoke, another departing male guest came from behind Carlie and placed in
      her hand a snakelike article&mdash;a thing that Miss Lowe seized and
      concealed with one sweeping gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's some false hair somebody must of put in my overcoat pocket,&rdquo; said
      Roderick Magsworth Bitts. &ldquo;Well, 'g-night. Thank you for a very nice
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Miss Rennsdale,&rdquo; said Master Chitten demurely. &ldquo;Thank you for
      a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Rennsdale detained him. &ldquo;Carrie,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;you're a
      dear boy, and I know you'll tell me something. It was all Penrod
      Schofield, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he left the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she said, in a low tone, not altogether devoid of ferocity. &ldquo;I
      mean it was Penrod who left the faucets running, and Penrod who tied the
      boys' shoes together, and filled some of them with soap and mucilage, and
      put Miss Lowe's hair in Roddy Bitts's overcoat. No; look me in the eye,
      Carlie! They were all shouting that silly thing he started. Didn't he do
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carlie cast down thoughtful eyes. &ldquo;I wouldn't like to tell, Miss
      Rennsdale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I guess I better be going or I'll catch cold. Thank
      you for a very nice time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Miss Rennsdale vehemently, as Carlie went on his way. &ldquo;What
      did I tell you? Carlie Chitten's too manly to say it, but I just KNOW it
      was that terrible Penrod Schofield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind her, a low voice, unheard by all except the person to whom it
      spoke, repeated a part of this speech: &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This voice belonged to one Penrod Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod and Marjorie had descended by another stairway, and he now
      considered it wiser to pass to the rear of the little party at the foot of
      the stairs. As he was still in his pumps, his choked shoes occupying his
      overcoat pockets, he experienced no difficulty in reaching the front door,
      and getting out of it unobserved, although the noise upstairs was greatly
      abated. Marjorie, however, made her curtseys and farewells in a creditable
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; Penrod said again, when she rejoined him in the darkness outside.
      &ldquo;What did I tell you? Didn't I say I'd get the blame of it, no matter if
      the house went and fell down? I s'pose they think I put mucilage and soap
      in my own shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie delayed at the gate until some eagerly talking little girls had
      passed out. The name &ldquo;Penrod Schofield&rdquo; was thick and scandalous among
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marjorie, &ldquo;<i>I</i> wouldn't care, Penrod. 'Course, about
      soap and mucilage in YOUR shoes, anybody'd know some other boy must of put
      'em there to get even for what you put in his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I DIDN'T!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I didn't do ANYTHING! That ole Miss Rennsdale
      can say what she wants to, I didn't do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway, Penrod,&rdquo; said Marjorie, softly, &ldquo;they can't ever PROVE it
      was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself suffocating in a coil against which no struggle availed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never DID it!&rdquo; he wailed, helplessly. &ldquo;I never did anything at
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned toward him a little, and the lights from her waiting carriage
      illumined her dimly, but enough for him to see that her look was fond and
      proud, yet almost awed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, Penrod,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;<i>I</i> don't believe there's any other
      boy in the whole world could of done HALF as much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that, she left him, and ran out to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod remained by the gate to wait for Sam, and the burden of his
      sorrows was beginning to lift. In fact, he felt a great deal better, in
      spite of his having just discovered why Marjorie loved him.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
