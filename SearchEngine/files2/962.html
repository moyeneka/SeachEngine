<h3>MARRIAGE CONTRACT OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS AND THE EARL OF BOTHWELL.</h3>

<div class="note">
<p>[Among the curious documents which have been
produced from time to time before the House of Lords
in support of peerage claims, there have been few of
greater historical interest than the one which we now
reprint from the Fourth Part of the Evidence taken
before the Committee of Privileges on the Claim of
W. Constable Maxwell, Esquire, to the title of Lord
Herries of Terregles. It is a copy of the Contract of
Marriage between Queen Mary and the Earl of Bothwell,
which, although it is said to have been printed
by Carmichael, in his <i>Various Tracts relating to the
Peerage of Scotland, extracted from the Public Records</i>,
has not been referred to by Robertson, or other historians
of Scotland, not even by the most recent of
them, Mr. Tytler.</p>

<p>Mr. Tytler tells us that on the 12th of May, 1567,
Bothwell was created Duke of Orkney, "the Queen
with her own hands placing the coronet on his head,"
and that the marriage took place on the 15th of May,
at four o'clock in the morning in the presence-chamber
at Holyrood; and that on the following morning a
paper, with this ominous verse, was fixed on the palace
gate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Mense malas Maio nubere vulgus ait."</p>

<p>The Contract, which is dated on the fourteenth of
May, is preserved in the Register of Deeds in the
Court of Session (Vol. IX. p. 86.), and as the copy
produced before the House is authenticated&mdash;and
consequently it may be presumed a more strictly accurate
one than that which Carmichael has given&mdash;it seems
well deserving of being transferred to our columns, and
so made more available to the purposes of the historian,
than it has been found to be in Carmichael's <i>Tract</i>, or
is likely to be when buried in a Parliamentary Blue
Book.]

<h3>BILL OF FARE OF 1626.</h3>

<p>If an <i>actual</i> bill of fare in a gentleman's house,
anno 1626, be worth your acceptance, as a pendant
to the one <i>prescribed</i> in your fourth number, you
are welcome to the following extract from the
account book of Sir Edward Dering, Knt. and
Bart.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A Dinner att London, made when my Lady
Richardson, my sister E Ashbornham, and Kate
Ashb,&mdash;my brother John Ashb, my cosen Walldron
and her sister, and S'r John Skeffington, were with me
att Aldersgate streete, December 23, 1626. My sister
Fr Ashb and cosen Mary Hill did fayle of coming.</p>

<pre>

a Banquet and 2 dozen and a half of glass plates to
  sett it out in                                  1l. 3s.
Half a doe&mdash;which in y'e fee and charge of bringing
  itt out of Northampton                              8s.
a warden py that the cooke made&mdash;we finding y'e
  wardens                                         2s. 4d.
ffor a venison pasty, we finding y'e venison          4s.
ffor 2 minct pyes                                 2s. 6d.
a breast of veale                                 2s. 4d.
a legg of mutton                                      2s.
                                             &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
Sum totall expended                          3l. 10s. 3d.
                                             &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The dinner was at y'e first course&mdash;

a peece of Brawne.
a boiled ducke in white broathe.
a boiled haunch of powdered venison.
2 minct pyes.
a boyled legge of mutton.
a venison pasty.
a roast ducke.
a powdered goose roasted.
a breast of veale.
a cold Capon py.

Second course&mdash;

a couple of rabbitts.
3 plovers.
12 larks.
4 snikes.
pickled oysters&mdash;2 dishes.
a cold warden py.
a joull of Sturgeon.

Complement&mdash;

Apples and Carrawayes.
wardens bakt and cold.
A Cake and
  Cheese.
</pre>

<p>A banquett ready in y'e next room.</p>

<p>Mem'd&mdash;we had out of y'e country y'e goose, y'e
duckes, y'e capon py, y'e Cake and wardens, and y'e
venison; but that is allways p'd for, though given."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The above seems to have been a family dinner.
Sir Edward married, for his second wife, a daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
of Sir Ashbornham, as appears by the following
entry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"1. January 1624/5, beeing Saturday, at sixe of y'e
clocke att night, atte Whitehall, in y'e Duke of
Buckingham's lodgings, I married Anne Ashbornham,
third d of Sir Ashbornham, late of
Ashbornham, Kt."
</p></blockquote>

<p>In another entry we have&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"... Dec. 1626, being thursday, Elizabeth Lady
Ashbornham widor of S'r Jno Ashbornham, was married
in S't Giles his Church in y'e feildes, nere London,
to S'r Thomas Richardson, K't, then Lo. cheife Justice
of y'e common pleas."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The day of the month is torn out. It would almost
seem as if this was the wedding dinner, on the
occasion of the marriage of the Chief Justice with
Lady Dering's mother; at all events the reunion
of the family in London was caused by that event.</p>

<p>Banquet was the name given to a dessert, and it
was usually set out in another room.</p>

<p>The large baking pear is still called warden in
many counties.</p>

<p>Appended to the above is a bill of the items of
the "banquet," with the cost of hire for the glass
plates; but it is so hopelessly illegible that I will
not venture to give it. Many of the items, as far
as I can read them, are not to be found in "the
books," and are quite new to me.</p>

<p>Having had no small experience in deciphering
hopeless scribblings, I think I may pronounce this
to be better left alone than given in its present
confused state.</p>

<h3>MONETA SANCT HELEN.</h3>

<p>As a subscriber to your valuable publication,
allow me to suggest that it might, from time to
time, be open to contributions explaining obscure
passages or words, which often occur in the works
of medival writers, and more especially in early
English records. So far as English usages and
customs are concerned, the Glossary of Du Cange
is of comparatively little value to the English
student; many terms, indeed, being wrongly interpreted
in all editions of that work. Take, for
example, the word "tricesima," the explanation of
which is truly ridiculous; under "berefellarii,"
the commentary is positively comic; and many
other instances might be cited. At the same time,
it would be presumptuous to speak otherwise than
in terms of the highest respect and admiration of
Du Cange and his labours. The errors to which
I allude were the natural consequences of a
foreigner's imperfect knowledge of English law
and English customs; still it is to be lamented
that they should have remained uncorrected in
the later editions of the Glossary; and I take it to
be our duty to collect and publish, where feasible,
materials for an English dictionary of medival
Latin. It is in your power materially to advance
such a work, and under that impression I venture
to send the present "Note."</p>

<p>In the Wardrobe Account of the 55th year of
Henry the Third, it is stated that among the valuables
in the charge of the keeper of the royal
wardrobe, there was a silken purse, containing
"<i>monetam Sancte Helene</i>." It is well known that,
during the middle ages, many and various objects
were supposed to possess talismanic virtues. Of
this class were the coins attributed to the mother
of Constantine, the authenticity of which is questioned
by Du Cange, in his treatise "<i>de Inferioris
vi numismatibus</i>." He observes, also, that the
same name was given, vulgarly, to almost all the
coins of the Byzantine emperors, not only to those
bearing the effigies of St. Helena, but indeed to
all marked with a cross, which were commonly
worn suspended from the neck as phylacteries;
"hence," he subjoins, "we find that these coins are
generally perforated." It was quite in accordance
with the superstitious character of Henry the
Third that coins of St. Helena should be preserved
in his wardrobe, among numerous other amulets
and relics. But what was the peculiar virtue
attributed to such coins? Du Cange, in the same
treatise, says, on the authority of "Bosius," that
they were a remedy against the "<i>comitialem morbum</i>,"
or epilepsy. The said "Bosius," or rather
"Bozius," wrote a ponderous work, "<i>de Signis
Ecclesi Dei</i>" (a copy of which, by the by, is not
to be seen in the library of the British Museum, although
there are two editions of it in the Bodleian),
in which he discourseth as follows:&mdash;"Monet
adhuc aliquot exstant, qu in honorem Helen
August, et invent crucis, cum hujusmodi imaginibus
excus antiquitus fuerunt. Illis est prsens
remedium adversus morbum comitialem: et
qui hodie vivit Turcarum Rex Amurathes, quamvis
a nobis alienus, vim sanctam illarum expertus
solet eas gestare; e morbo namque hujusmodi interdum
laborat. Nummi quoque Sancti Ludovici
Francorum regis mirifice valent adversus nonnullos
morbos."&mdash;Lib. xv. sig. 68.</p>

<p>This mention of the sultan Amurath carrying
these coins about his person as a precaution against
a disease to which he was subject, and indeed the
whole passage shows a belief in their efficacy
was still prevalent in the sixteenth century, when
Bozius wrote. It only remains to add, that Du
Cange, in his Glossary, does not enumerate the
"money of St. Helena" under the word "moneta;"
nor does he allude to the coins of St. Louis, which,
according to Bozius, were endowed with similar
properties.</p>

<p>Having sent you a "Note," permit me to make
two or three "Queries." 1. What is the earliest
known instance of the use of a beaver hat in
England? 2. What is the precise meaning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
term "pisan," so often used, in old records, for
some part of defensive armour, particularly in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries? It does not
bear any relation to the fabrics of Pisa.</p>

<h3>TRANSLATIONS OF GRAY'S ELEGY.</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;My best apology for troubling you with
such a lengthened Query is, that it will serve, to
some extent, as a Note. Will any of your correspondents
inform me of any additions to the following
list of translations of Gray's <i>Elegy?</i> It
may possibly be more incomplete than I am aware
of, as it is drawn up, with two exceptions, from
copies in my own library only.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Greek:</p>

<p>1. By Professor Cooke, printed with his edition
of Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>, Cantab. 1775. It begins:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
[Greek: "Nux pelei, oud an agros pura kaietai, oud ana komas."]
</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>There is also a Greek version of the epitaph
only, by J. Plumptre, printed with his Greek
version of Pope's <i>Messiah.</i> 4to. 1795. In a
biographical notice of Dr. Sparke, it is stated that
he was among the thirteen candidates when the
competition took place for the best translation of
Gray's <i>Elegy</i> into Greek. Query, what was this
competition, and were any of the other versions
published?</p>

<blockquote><p>
Latin:</p>

<p>1. By Lloyd. Query, when and where
originally published? My copy, which is among
some collections of the late Mr. Haselwood,
appears to have been cut out of a Dublin edition.
It begins:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Audistin! quam lenta sonans campana per agros."
</p>

<p>2. By Signor Gio. Costa. 12mo. In Eblana,
1776:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Ingeminat signum occidu Campana diei."
</p>

<p>5. The last-mentioned version originally appeared
anonymously in a somewhat different form
(4to. Cantab. 1762), the first line being:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Audin' ut occidu signum Campana diei."
</p>

<p>6. An anonymous version, "by a member of
the University of Cambridge," printed with the
French translation of M. Guedon de Berchere,
mentioned below. I have no copy, and do not
know the opening line.</p>

<p>7. By S.N.E. 4to. London, 1824. Query, the
name of the author. It may perhaps appear on
the title-page, which is wanting in my copy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Triste sonans, lent tinnit campana per agros."
</p>

<p>8. By the Rev. J. H. Macauley, in the "Arundines

published? My copy is from the same source
as the Latin version by Lloyd:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Il Bronzo vespertin con flebil rombo."
</p>

<p>3. By Gennari, printed on the same pages with
the Latin version by Costa:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Nunzio del d che parte intorno suona."
</p>

<p>4. By Giannini. 2nd ed. 4to. London, 1782:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Piange la squilla 'l giorno, che si muore."
</p>

<p>5. By Torelli. 8vo. Cambridge, 1782:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Segna la squilla il d che gi vien manco."

</p></blockquote>

<p>The Latin version by Costa, and the Italian by
Cesarotti and Torelli, were reprinted by Bodoni
in 1793, in 4to., as a supplement to his edition of
Gray.</p>

<blockquote><p>
French:</p>

<p>1. By Mons. P. Guedon de Berchere. I have no

It was communicated by a correspondent who had
obtained a copy from the writer in Germany:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Des Dorfes Glocke schallt den Moor entlang."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must frankly avow that I have no present object
in seeking information beyond the gratification
of curiosity; but I would venture to throw out a
hint that an edition of this <i>Elegy</i>, exhibiting all the
known translations, arranged in double columns,
might be made a noble monument to the memory
of Gray. The plan would involve the necessity
for a folio size, affording scope for pictorial illustration,
on a scale capable of doing justice to "the
most finished poem in the English language."</p>

<h3>ON AUTHORS AND BOOKS, NO. 2</h3>

<p>To revive the memory of estimable authors, or
of estimable books, is a pursuit to which a man of
leisure may devote himself under the certainty
that he can neither want materials to proceed with,
not miss the reward of commendation.</p>

<p>It is by the extensive circulation of biographical
dictionaries, and the re-productive agency of the
press, that the fame of authors and their works
is chiefly perpetuated. General biographers, however,
relying too much on the intelligence and tact
of their precursors, are frequently the dupes of
tradition; and the press, like other descriptions of
machinery, requires a <i>double</i> motive-power.</p>

<p>A remedy happily presents itself. As it appears,
a short note is sufficient to raise inquiry; and
inquiry may lead to new fact, or advance critical
equity. It may rescue a meritorious author from
oblivion, and restore him to his true position on
the roll of fame.</p>

<p>It is near a century and a half since Ant. Wood
printed a notice of the reverend Thomas Powell,
and more than a century since the inquisitive
Oldys devoted eighteen pages to an abstract of
his <i>Human industry</i>;&mdash;yet we search in vain for
the name of Powell in the dictionaries of Aikin,
Watkins, Chalmers, Gorton, &amp;c.&mdash;It is even omitted
in the <i>Cambrian biogarphy</i> of his countryman
William Owen, F.S.A.</p>

<p>An exact transcript of the title of the work,
and of the manuscript notes which enrich my own
copy of it, may therefore be acceptable:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Humane industry; or, a history of most manual
arts, deducing the original, progress, and improvement
of them. Furnished with variety of instances and examples,
shewing forth the excellency of humane wit.
[<i>Anonymous.</i>] London, for Henry Herringman, 1661."
8.</p>

<p>[<i>On the title.</i>] "E libris rarioribus Joannis Brand,
Coll. Line. Oxon. 1777."</p>

<p>[<i>On a fly-leaf.</i>] "This book is ascribed by Wood to
Dr. Tho'm. Powell, canon of St. David's, who was, says
he, 'an able philosopher,  a curious critic, and well
versed in various languages.' See an abstract of this
scarce book in Oldys's <i>British librarian</i>, p. 42."</p>

<p>"N.B.&mdash;The above is the hand-writing of the Rev'd. M'r.
Granger, author of the <i>biographical history.</i>&mdash;
I bought it of Mr. Prince, at Oxford, who purchased
his books." [John Brand.]
</p></blockquote>

<p>I have now only to consign the learned Powell
to future biographers, and to recommend the
volume as one which deserves a place in every
choice collection of English books.</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>

<p><i>Quotations from Pope.</i></p>

<p>D***N**R. (p. 38.), gives, as an instance of
misquotation, a passage from Pope, as it appeared
in the <i>Times</i>, and adds a correction of it. As my
<i>memory</i> suggested a version different from both
that of the <i>Times</i>, and the correction of your correspondent,
I turned to Pope (Bowles edition,
1806), and found the passage there, precisely as it
is given from the <i>Times</i>. Has your correspondent
any authority for his reading? No various reading
of the lines is given by Bowles.</p>

<p>While on the subject of Pope, I will make a
note (as I have not seen it noticed by his commentators),
that the well-known line,</p>

<p class="poem">
"The proper study of mankind is man,"
</p>

<p>is literally from Charron (<i>De la Sagesse</i>, I. i.
ch. 1.)&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"La vraye science et le vray etude de l'homme c'est
l'homme."
</p>

<p class="author">F.F.B.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[We may add, that in the Aldine edition of Pope,
which was produced under the editorial superintendence
of the Rev. A. Dyce, the lines are given as quoted
from the <i>Times</i>, and without any various reading. See
vol. ii. p. 55.]
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Angels' Visits.</i></p>

<p>Campbell's famous line,</p>

<p class="poem">
"Like angels visits, few and far between,"
</p>

<p>has been clearly shown by a correspondent in
another paper, to be all but copied from Blair:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
&mdash;&mdash; "like an ill-used ghost
Not to return;&mdash;or if it did, its visits
<i>Like those of angels, short and far between.</i>"
</p>

<p class="author">Blair's <i>Grave</i>.</p>

<p>But the same phrase, though put differently, occurs
in a religious poem of Norris of Bemerton,
who died in 1711:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"But those who soonest take their flight,
   Are the most exquisite and strong,
 <i>Like angels visits, short</i> and bright,
   Mortality's too weak to bear them long."

<p>Sir,&mdash;As a pendant to the extracts from the
register of East Peckham, Kent, in your third
number, I send the following, which I copied some
time ago from one of the register books of the
parish of North Runcton, Norfolk, and which
may prove interesting to some of your readers.</p>

<p>"Reader,&mdash;Lest whatever pseudography (as there

account of what hath occasioned the same, viz. In the
woful days of the late usurper, the registring of births,
not baptisms, was injoyned and required, to give a
liberty to all the adversaries of Pedobaptisme, &amp;c., and,
besides some circumstances, too unhandsome for the
calling and person of a minister, were then allso annexed
to him that was to keep a register of all, &amp;c.; and so
it came to passe, that persons of no learning, for many
places, were chosen by y'e parish, and ministers declined

<p><i>The Norman Crusader</i>.</p>

<p>"The Norman Crusader," in the horse-armoury
in the Tower of London, or a part of it, came from
Green's Museum. He obtained the hauberk from
Tong Castle. At the dispersion of the Museum,
the hauberk was purchased by Bullock, of Liverpool
(afterwards of the Egyptian Hall), in whose
catalogue for 1808 it appears as a <i>standing</i> figure,
holding a brown bill in the right hand, and resting
the left upon a heater shield.</p>

<p>Bullock at this time added the chauses.&mdash;In
1810, the "London Museum" was opened at the
"Egyptian Temple" (Hall), the figure as before;
but, in the catalogue for 1813, we have the man
<i>and horse</i> standing in front of the gallery, and
named "The Norman Crusader."</p>

<p>At the "decline and fall" of Bullock's Museum,
Mr. Gwennap purchased the Crusader for, it is
said, 200 guineas; and after being put in thorough
repair, it was placed in the "Aplotheca," Brook
Street, Mr. Gwennap, jun. adding the sword.</p>

<p>During its repair, it was discovered that the
armour was not originally made for a horse, but
for an elephant; and, on inquiry, it appeared that
Bullock had purchased it, together with other curiosities,
of a sailor, had taken it to pieces, and
formed the armour for the horse.</p>

<p>At the sale of Gwennap's collection, "The
Norman Crusader" was knocked down by Geo. Robins
to a Mr. Bentley, for 30<i>l</i>., and he being unable to
<i>polish</i> it, as he had intended, sold it to the
authorities at the Tower for one hundred guineas, where
it is exhibited as "The Norman Crusader."</p>

<p><i>Lady Jane of Westmoreland.</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;On page 206. of Mr. Collier's second volume
of <i>Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers'
Company,</i> the following entry occurs:&mdash;
"1585-6. Cold and uncoth blowes, of the lady
Jane of Westmorland." And on page 211.,
"A songe of Lady Jane of Westmorland." Mr.
Collier considers these entries to refer to the same
production.</p>

<p>The name of Lady Jane of Westmoreland does
not occur in Park's edition of <i>Royal and Noble
Authors</i>; but it would clearly be entitled to a
place there, if we can ascertain who she was.</p>

<p>I have little doubt she was Jane, daughter of
Thomas Manvers, first Earl of Rutland, and first
wife of Henry Nevill, fifth Earl of Westmoreland,
by whom she was mother of Charles, Earl of Westmoreland,
one of the chiefs of the northern rebellion.</p>

<p>Collins, under the title "Rutland," states that
<i>Anne</i>, daughter of Thomas, first Earl of Rutland,
married Henry, Earl of Westmoreland; but under
the title "Abergavenny" he states that the same
Henry, Earl of Westmoreland, married <i>Jane</i>,
daughter of Thomas, first Earl of Rutland. The
last statement I presume to be the correct one.</p>

<p>I can find no other person, at the period in
question, to whom the title of Lady Jane of
Westmoreland could have been attributed; and her
sister Frances, who also married a Henry Nevill
(fourth Lord Abergavenny of that name), is known
to have been an authoress. An account of her
will be found in the first volume of the <i>Royal and
Noble Authors</i>, by Park. Lady Frances
Abergavenny (whose work is entered on page 52. of
Mr. Collier's second volume), had an only daughter,
who married Sir Thomas Fane, and from this
marriage the present Earl of Westmoreland is descended.</p>

<h3>NOTES IN ANSWER TO QUERIES.</h3>

<p><i>The Lobster in the Medal of the Pretender.</i></p>

<p>Your correspondent, Mr. B. NIGHTINGALE, desires
an answer to his Query (in your No. 4),
Why is the figure of <i>a Lobster</i> introduced into the
impression upon the rare medal struck 20th June,
1688, in contempt or ridicule of Prince James
Edward, the newly-born son of King James II.?</p>

<p>A reference to the two following works will,
perhaps, supply the answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. In Philemon Holland's translation of Pliny's
<i>Natural History</i> (a great authority at the time) this
passage occurs in book ix. cap. 30.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Lobsters, so long as they are secure of any fear and
danger, go directly straight, letting down their hornes
at length along their sides;... but if they be in
any fear, up go their hornes straight&mdash;and then they
creep byas and go sidelong."
</p></blockquote>

<p>And in the next chapter (31.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Crabs" (which were often confounded with lobsters)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
"when they will be afraid, will recule backward, as fast as
they went forward."
</p></blockquote>

<p>2nd. In the celebrated work of Sebastian Brandt,
entitled <i>Stultifera Naxis</i> (which went through
many editions after its first appearance in 1494),
is an engraving of a fool, wearing cap and bells,
seated astride on the back of a lobster, with a
broken reed in his hand, and a pigeon flying past
him as he stares vacantly at it with open mouth.
The following lines are attached:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>DE PREDESTINATIONE</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>"Qui pretium poseit quod non meruisse videtur,</p>
<p>Atque super fragilem ponit sua brachia cannam</p>
<p>Illius in dorso Cancrorum semita stabit;</p>
<p>Devolet inque suum rictum satis assa Columba."</p>
</div></div>

<p>It appears, then, to me, that the design of the
medallist was to hold up to the exceration of the
English people the machinations of Father Petre,
who (together with Sunderland) guided the councils
of the king at the juncture. The Jesuits,
like the crustaceous fish above-mentioned, were
alleged to accomplish their dark and crooked
designs by creeping and sedulously working their
way straight forward through the mud, until some
real danger presented itself, and then <i>reculing</i>
with equal adroitness.</p>

<p>At this time, too, the bigoted and superstitious
adherents of James had been offering their vows
at every shrine, and even making pilgrimages, to
induce Heaven to grant a male heir to the throne,
and thus exclude the Protestant daughters of the
king. The premature and unexpected event,
therefore, of the birth of a son, was pronounced by
James's friends to have been predestined by the
special grace of the Most High. All this, I apprehend,
was intended to be typified by the figure of
the <i>Jesuit Petre riding upon a Lobster</i>.</p>

<p><i>Straw Necklaces&mdash;Method of keeping Notes, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;As I see this matter is not yet explained,
I venture a suggestion. Wheat straw was an
emblem of peace among heathen nations; in it the
first-fruits brought by Abaris the Hyperborean
to Delos were wrapped; and when commerce, or
rather trade by barter, had rendered transmission
from hand to hand practicable, wheat straw was
still used. With the worship of Diana the offering
of wheat straw passed over to Thrace, where it
was a recognition of that goddess as the patron of
chastity. In Judea the wheat harvest was later
than that of barley, the Jews therefore offered a
sheaf of the latter grain as first-fruits; it is, however,
extraordinary that Moses orders barley-meal
as the offering for jealousy (Numbers, v 15.),
though the price of barley was but half that of
wheat. It seems as if there were the same connection
between this peace-offering and that of
the first-fruits with the Jews, that we see between
the offering to Diana and the first-fruits of the
Hyperboreans; both may have been derived from
Egypt, in the learning of which, we are told, Moses
was skilled. The straw necklace or chaplet of
Erasmus' pilgrim might be worn to secure him
from molestation in travelling, or it may refer to
the patroness of Walsingham, the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>I dare say many persons have thought with me,
that a poet's promise of a "belt of straw" to his
love, was not a very complimentary one; one possible
meaning never struck me till this moment:
it may be a compliment unconsciously drawn from
a heathen source, and perpetuated, like so many
of our old-world customs, among a class of people
the least likely to understand the meaning.</p>

<p>Another corroboration of Macaulay's Young
Levite may be found in <i>The Tatler</i>, No. 255, sixty
years later than Burton.</p>

<p>I beg to suggest a method of keeping "Notes,"
which I have found useful. I have a blank book
for each quarter of the world, paged alphabetically;
I enter my notes and queries according to
the subject for which they are most likely to be
required; if relating to mere geography or history,
under the name of place or person. I also keep a
list (with dates) of all the books I read, with a
note of any use to be made of them; I also keep
a list of all books to be read, and the reasons
for reading them. I tried various ways of keeping
my notes, and found no classification so easy for
reference as the plan I have mentioned; it may
not, however, suffice to those whose reading is
much more extensive than mine; I mention it
as a <i>working</i> plan.</p>

<h3>ANSWERS TO MINOR QUERIES</h3>

<p><i>Ancient Motto</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In your Sixth Number, p. 93, J.E.M.
wishes to know whence the motto, "Si quis
amicum absentum rodere delectat," &amp;c. is taken.</p>

<p>Allow me to refer your correspondent to
Horace, Sat. I. iv. 81 sqq.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">"Absentem qui rodit amicum,</p>
<p>Qui non defendit, alio culpante,</p>
<p> * * * * * * * *</p>
<p class="i2">hic niger est, hanc tu, Romane, caveto."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The inscription would seem to be but an adaptation
of Horace's maxim.</p>

<p class="author">C.B.B.</p>


<p><i>Political Maxim&mdash;when first used.</i></p>

<p>The political maxim, or phrase, inquired after
by C. is Burke's. It occurs in his celebrated
<i>Thoughts on the Cause of the present Discontent</i>,
published in 1770, in the course of his defence of
party, a few pages from the end. A short extract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
will show the connection in which it is introduced:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into
enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported,
desultory, unsystematic endeavours are of power
to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious
citizens. When bad men combine, the good
must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an
unpitied sacrifice, in a contemptible struggle."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I have some suspicion that the maxim may be found,
with probably a slight variation of expression,
repeated in one of Burke's later tracts.
But this is certainly its first appearance.</p>

<p><i>Annus Trabeationis.</i></p>

<p>Sir Harris Nicholas, in his <i>Chronology of History</i>,
p. 4., gives "annus Trabeationis" as one way
in which the year of our Lord is designated in
ancient documents. Would any of your readers
favour me with the meaning of the word Trabeatio?</p>

<p class="author">G.P.</p>

<p class="note">
[Our correspondent will find, on referring to Mr.
Hampson's useful work, <i>Medii vi Kalendarium</i>, vol. ii.
s. v. Annus Trabentionis, "According to Du Cange,
this is the year of the crucifixion&mdash;'Annus Trabeationis
Christi (annus quo Christus <i>trabi</i> affixus est);'
but according to <i>L'Art de vrifier les Dates</i>, it is the
same as the year of the Incarnation." Mr. Hampson
adds, "the import of the word is the year of the Crucifixion,
and cannot well be reconciled with that of the
Incarnation." But, upon referring to Du Cange, s. v.
<i>Trabeatio</i>, our correspondent will find that Du Cange
regards it as the year of the Incarnation&mdash;"<i>Trabeatio</i>
autem, non a <i>trabe</i>, qu Crux intelligi posset, sed a
<i>trabea</i> tog species, deducitur"&mdash;quoting, as his authority
for this interpretation, a sermon of St. Fulgentius
on St. Stephen, in which he says, "Heri enim Rex
noster <i>Trabea carnis</i> indutus."]

<p><i>Betterton's Duties of a Player.</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Betterton's <i>Instructions on the Art of
Playing and Public Speaking</i>, queried in your 5th
Number, were pubished by the well-known dramatic
critic, Charles Gildon, and form a portion of
his <i>Life of Betterton</i>. As this work is little known,
I shall quote the title at length:&mdash;"The Life
of Mr. Thomas Betterton, the late eminent Tragedian,
wherein the Action and Utterance of the
Stage, Bar, and Pulpit, are distinctly considered;
with the judgment of the late ingenious Monsieur
de St. Evremond, upon the Italian and French
Music and Operas, in a Letter to the Duke of
Buckingham. To which is added, The Amorous
Widow, or the Wanton Wife, a Comedy, written
by Mr. Betterton, now first printed from the Original
Copy. <i>London, Printed for Robert Gosling,
at the Miter, near the Inner Temple Gate in Fleet
Street</i>, 1710. 8vo." Gildon was intimately
acquainted with Betterton, and he gives an interesting
account of a visit paid to that great actor, the
year before his death, at his country house at
Reading. It was on this occasion that Gildon
came into the possession of Betterton's manuscripts.
Thirty-one years after the publication of
Betterton's Life, Curll, the notorious bookseller,
put forth a mutilated copy of the <i>Instructions on
Playing</i>, in a work bearing the following title:&mdash;"The
History of the English Stage, from the
Restauration to the Present Time, Including the
Lives, Character, and Amours, of the most Eminent
Actors and Acresses; with Instructions for
Public Speaking, wherein the Action and Utterance
of the Bar, Stage, and Pulpit, are distinctly
considered. By Thomas Betterton. <i>London,
Printed for E. Curll, at Pope's Head in Rose-Street,
Covent Garden</i>, 1741. 8vo." From this title it
would appear (as indeed Curll wished it) that
Betterton was the author of the entire work;
but he is only accountable for the brief <i>Instructions
for Public Speaking</i>, which, as before stated, were
pillaged from Gildon.</p>

<p>Reverting to Colley Cibber's <i>Lives</i>, I beg to
point out a curious and rare tract in connection
with them, entitled, "A Brief Supplement to Colley
Cibber, Esq.; his Lives of the Late Famous Actors and
Actresses. By Anthony (vulg Tony)
Aston. Printed for the Author. 8vo. pp. 24."
The copy now before me, which was Isaac Reed's,
sold at his sale for 2<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. It is reprinted in a
literary journal called <i>The Cabinet</i>, and in Bell-chambers'
excellent edition of Cibber's <i>Apology</i>.</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of the stage, I should be
glad if any of your correspondents could inform me
what has become of "Dick Leveridge's History of
the Stage and Actors in his own Time?" Leveridge
himself informed Oldys that he had compiled
such a work, and Oldys, with his usual care, noted
the fact in one of his numerous memorandum
books. I have been long engaged in a history of
<i>The Life and Times of Henry Purcell</i>, and the
said MS., if it could be recovered, would, without
doubt, enlighten us much upon the subject of
Purcell's career as a dramatic composer.</p>

<p><i>Betterton's Essay.</i></p>

<p>The "best piece" of Betterton, for which T. J. L.
inquires (p. 68.), is contained in his Life, printed
by Gosling, 1710; in fact, this is merely a vehicle
to intriduce the treatise, the Life filling only from
p. 5. to 11., and thus concluding:&mdash;"He was bury'd
with great decency in Westminster Abbey."</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The year before his death, (he) being at his
country house in Reading, my friend and I travelled that
way.... One day, after dinner, we
retired to his garden, and fell into the discourse of
acting." Thus is introduced his <i>Essay</i>, &amp;c., continuing
to p. 174., where it abruptly ends thus:&mdash;"After
this discourse, we took our leaves of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
Betterton, and returned to London. I was pleased
with his story," &amp;c.
</p></blockquote>

<p>My copy is dedicated to Richard Steele, Esq.,
by Charles Gildon, and has prefixed to it the
beautiful portrait of Betterton, engraved by Vander
Gucht, from Kneller's picture, and, at its close
(but separately paged), "The Amorous Widow or
the Wanton Wife, now first printed from the original
copy," 1710.                                                     E.</p>


<p><i>Incumbents of Church Livings.</i></p>

<p>A correspondent in Number 4., writes to inquire
for information relative to the "names and
birthplaces of incumbents of church livings prior
to 1680, and the patrons of them."</p>

<p>It may slightly help his investigations to know
that there is a Latin MS. in the British Museum,
numbered Additional MSS. 12,483, with the title
"Ecclesiastical Visitation of Hampshire and the
Isle of Wight, held in March and April 1543, by
Nicholas Harpisfelde, Official of the Archdeacon
of Winchester," folio, containing the names of the
incumbents and churchwardens of the livings in
those counties.</p>

<p>The first appears to be Soham, in Cambridgeshire;
described in <i>Liber Eliensis</i> as "terra de

"mare" stand for "stagnum," "palus," "mariscus,"
or our English "mere?" Can Portum Pusillum

<p><i>Reinerius&mdash;Inquisition in France.</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Faber, in his work on the Waldenses,
quotes <i>Reinerius</i>, <i>in Biblio. Patrum</i>. I have in
vain looked in modern biographical dictionaries
for any account of Reinerius, so am constrained
to inquire of some of your readers, who and what
he was, or to beg the favour of a reference to
some accessible account of him. I think Faber
says he was an inquisitor; and this is the extent
of the information which I have been able to collect
respecting him.</p>

<p>I wish also to inquire whether his work on
Heretics (his only work, I presume) has been
published in any other and more accessible form
than that in which it was referred to by Faber;
and, particularly, whether it has ever been translated
into English.</p>

<p>I have often wished to know whether the
tribunal of the Inquisition was ever established
elsewhere in France than at Toulouse. Can any of
your correspondents enlighten me on the point,
and give me references in proof?</p>

<p class="note">
[The work of Reinerius Saccho was first published
by the Jesuit Gretser in 1613, and has since been
reprinted in the different editions of the <i>Bibliotheca
Patrum</i>. It has never been translated into English.]

<p><i>Whelps.</i></p>

<p>The following extracts from the <i>Travels of Sir
William Brereton</i> may answer the inquiry respecting
the ships called "Whelps":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Waterford, 25 July, 1635. About six hour I went
aboard one of the kings ships, called the ninth <i>whelp</i>,
which is in the king's books 215 ton and tonnage in
kings books. She carries sixteen pieces of ordinance,
two brass rakers, six iron demiculverin drakes, four
iron whole culverin drakes, and four iron demicannon
drakes. They are called drakes. They are taper-bored
in the camber, and are tempered with extraordinary
metal to carry that shot; these are narrower where
the powder is put in, and wider where the shot is put
in, and with this kind of ordinance his majesty is much
affected. This ship is manned with sixty men."&mdash;p. 164.</p>

<p>"1627. This 26th of February, attending the
officers of the navy at Sir Sackville Crowes house by
Charing Cross, Sir John Pennington came thither to
acquaint them with a warrant from the Lord Duke
(of Buckingham) directed to him and myself, for present
bargaining with the yard keepers of the river for
the building of ten small vessels, for the enterprise of
Rochel, of some 120 tons a piece, with one deck and
quarter only, to row as well as sail. The 28th of the
same month we concluded our bargains with the general
yard keepers, and drew convenants between us, and
delivered to them accordingly. In this business I was
employed till the latter end of July that the ships set
sail to Portsmouth. My son John was placed captain
in the sixth <i>whelp</i>, built by my kinsman Peter Pett.
Having liberty from my lord Duke to make choice
from among them all, I chose that pinnace before the
rest, supposing she would have proved the best, which
fell out afterwards cleane contrary. The 4th September
my son John took leave of me in the evening, and went
on board his ship, whom I never saw after, being
unfortunately cast away in the return from Rochel.</p>

<p>"1628. In this interim I received certain intelligence
of the great loss of my son John, his ship and
all his company, who foundered in the sea about the
Seames in a great storm, about the beginning of
November; not one man saved to bring the doleful news,
nor no ship near them to deliver the certainty but a
small pinnace belonging to the fleet that was within
ken of her, and saw her shoot nine pieces of ordinance
hoping of succour."&mdash;<i>Journal of Phineas Pett. MSS. in
Brit. Mus.</i> 9298.</p>

<p>"At the return of this fleet (from Rochel) two of
the <i>whelps</i> were cast away, and three ships more, and
some five ships who had some of those great stones,
that were brought to build Pauls, for ballast and for
other uses within them, which could promise no good
success, for I never heard of any thing that prospered
which being once designed for the honour of God was
alienated from that use."&mdash;Howel's <i>Letters</i>, sect. v.
lett. 9.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The name <i>whelp</i> was probably given them
facetiously in reference to their designation as barks.</p>

<p><i>Cowley or Cowleas</i>.</p>

<p>Your correspondent W. asks the etymon of
"Cowley;"&mdash;probably "Cow leas," or Cow pasture.
In ancient records it is written "Couelee." I
have before me a survey or "extent" of the Hospitalers'
lands in England, including those formerly
belonging to the Templars. In this record, as in
most that I have seen, it is written, "Templecouelee,"
and it is entered as a limb of the commandry
of Saunford or Sandford.</p>

<p class="author">L.B.L.</p>


<p><i>Cowley or Coverley&mdash;Statistics of Roman Catholic
Church&mdash;Whelps&mdash;Discovery of America</i>.</p>

<p>I can answer pretty confidently the query II. in
Number 4., p. 59., about the etymon of <i>Cowley</i>,
for I have, on a farm of my own, two denominations
of land, called <i>Ox-ley</i> and <i>Cow-ley</i>, and I
believe that both these names are common all
through England. Like <i>Horseley, Ashley, Oakley</i>
and a thousand other <i>leas</i> or <i>leys</i> distinguished
from each other by some local characteristic. <i>Coverley</i>
was probably not <i>Cowley</i>, but, like <i>Woodley</i>,
<i>Orchardleigh</i>, &amp;c., derived from its local position.</p>

<p>In answer to the query as to the statistics of
the Roman Catholic Church, p. 61. Number 4.,
I think I may say there is no such <i>general</i> work,
though the <i>Propaganda</i> of Rome was said to register
something of that sort. The information is
only to be picked up from various and (as far as I
know) all imperfect publications. The least so
that I can just now refer to is the <i>Statistics of the
Roman Catholic Church of Ireland</i>, in Thom's
<i>Dublin Almanack</i>&mdash;a very curious and useful compilation.</p>

<p>In reply to the inquiry as to a <i>priest's wife</i>,
p. 77. Number 5., I would suggest that married
persons may have separated, and retired each into
the celibacy of a convent, yet might join, when
necessary, in a legal conveyance; but I should
examine closely the word deciphered <i>clericus</i>.</p>

<p>To J.J., who inquires about "<i>Whelps</i>," and
refers to Howell's <i>Letters</i>, sect. 5. p. 9., I beg
leave to suggest more precision in his future references.
The passage is in one (viz. the viii.) of
the 42 letters of the 5th section; but in the last
and best edition (Lond. 1754) it is p. 204. I note
this to inculcate the necessity of accurate references
and mention of the edition quoted. As to
the query itself, I can answer that the "<i>whelps</i>"
were a class, perhaps I might say a <i>litter</i>, of light
men-of-war of the fifth rate, which were so called,
perhaps, after one named the "<i>Lion's Whelp</i>,"
in Queen Elizabeth's navy, and distinguished by
numbers, as "<i>1st Whelp</i>," "<i>2nd Whelp</i>," and so on
to at least "<i>10th Whelp</i>," which is to be found in
a list of the navy in 1651. She was of 180 tons,
and carried 18 guns and 60 men. It seems not
easy to account for this class of vessels having
been rated so high as 5th rates, but I suppose they
were a favourite and favoured class.</p>

<p>In reference to the discovery of America by
Madoc, pp. 7. 12. 25. 57., it may amuse your readers
to be informed that Seneca shadows forth such
a discovery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Venient annis scula seris</p>
<p> Quibus Oceanus vincula rerum</p>
<p> Laxet, et ingens pateat tellus,</p>

<p class="author"><i>Medea</i>, act ii, ad finem, v. 375.</p>

<p>"A vaticination," says the commentator, "of
the Spanish discovery of America." It is certainly

<h3>BERKELEY'S THEORY OF VISION VINDICATED.</h3>

<p>In Mr. Dugald Stewart's <i>Dissertation on the

Lord Shaftesbury's work entitled <i>Characteristics</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"It seemed to have the power of changing the
temper of its critics. It provoked the amiable Berkeley
to a harshness equally unwonted and unwarranted;
while it softened the rugged Warburton so far as to
dispose the fierce, yet not altogether ungenerous, polemic
to price an enemy in the very heat of conflict."

<blockquote><p>
"Berkeley's <i>Minute Philosopher</i>, Dialogue 3.; but
especially his <i>Theory of Vision Vindicated</i>, London,

moment to the level of a railing polemic."

<h3>DR. JOHNSON AND PROFESSOR DE MORGAN.</h3>

<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;Although your cleverly conceived
publication may be considered as more applicable
to men of letters than to men of figures, yet I
doubt not you will entertain the subject I am
about to propound: because, in the first place,
"whole generations of men of letters" are implicated
in the criticism; and, in the next place,
because however great, as a man of figures, the
critic may be, the man of letters criticised was
assuredly greater.</p>

<p>Professor de Morgan has discovered a flaw in
the great Johnson! and, in obedience to your
epigraph, "<i>when found make a note of it</i>," he <i>has</i>
made a note of it at the foot of page 7, of <i>The
Companion to the Almanac for 1850</i>,&mdash;eccola:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The following will show that a palpable absurdity
will pass before the eyes of <i>generations of men of letters</i>
without notice. In Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i> (chapter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
viii. of the edition with chapters), there is given a
conversation between Dr. Adams and Johnson, in
which the latter asserts that he could finish his
Dictionary
in three years.</p>

<p>"ADAMS. 'But the French Academy, which consists
of forty members, took forty years to compile
their Dictionary.'&mdash;JOHNSON.  'Sir, thus it is. This
is the proportion. Let me see: forty times forty is
sixteen hundred, so is the proportion of an Englishman
to a Frenchman.'</p>

<p>No one of the numerous editors of Boswell has
<i>made a note upon this</i>, although many things as slight
have been commented upon: it was certainly not
Johnson's mistake, for he was a clear-headed arithmetician.
How many of our readers will stare and
wonder what we are talking about, and what the
mistake is!"
</p></blockquote>

<p>Certes, I for one, plead guilty to staring, and
wondering what the Professor is talking about.</p>

<p>I cannot for a moment imagine it possible, that
he could base such a criticism, so announced, upon
no better foundation than that mere verbal transposition
of the words Englishman and Frenchman.</p>

<p>The inversion deceives no person, and it is
almost more appropriate to the colloquial jocularity
of the great Lexicographer's bombast than if the
enunciation had been more strictly according to
rule. Besides, the correctness of the expression,
even as it stand, is capable of defence. Let the
third and fourth terms be understood as referring
to <i>time</i> instead of to <i>power</i>, and the proportion
becomes "as three to sixteen hundred, so is" (the
time required by) "an Englishman to" (that
required for the same work by) "a Frenchman."</p>

<p>Or, if natives be referred to in the plural,&mdash;then,
as three to sixteen hundred, so are</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  Englishmen to Frenchmen;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is, such is the number of each required for
the same amount of work.</p>

<p>But I repeat that I cannot conceive a criticism
so trifling and questionable can have been the true
aim of professor de Morgan's note, and as I am
unable to discover any other flaw in the Doctor's
proportion, according to the premises, <i>my query</i>,
Mr. Editor, has for its object to learn</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  <i>"What the mistake is?"</i>

<h3>CARACCIOLLI'S LIFE OF LORD CLIVE.</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Can you, or any of your readers, give me
any information relating to Caraccioli's <i>Life of
Lord Clive</i>? It is a book in four bulky octavo
volumes, without date published, I believe, at
different periods, about the year 1780&mdash;perhaps
some years later. It enjoys the distinction of
being about the worst book that was ever
published. It bears, on its title-page, the name of
"Charles Caraccioli, Gent." A writer in the
<i>Calcutta Review</i>, incidentally alluding to the book,
says that "it is said to have been written by a
member of one of the councils over which Clive
presided; but the writer, being obviously better
acquainted with his lordship's personal doings in
Europe than in Asia, the work savours strongly of
home-manufacture, and has all the appearance of
being the joint composition of a discarded valet
and a bookseller's hack." The last hypothesis
appears very probable. Internal evidence is
greatly in its favour. Can any of your readers
tell me who was "Charles Caraccioli, Gent.,"&mdash;when
the atrocity which bears his name was
published,&mdash;or any thing about the man or his book?
Probably some notice of it may be found in the
<i>Monthly Review</i>, the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, or
some other periodical of the last century. The
writer, indeed, speaks of his first volume having
been reviewed with "unprecedented" severity.
Perhaps you can help me to the dates of some
notices of this book. The work I believe to be
scarce. The copy in my possession is the only
complete one I have seen; but I once stumbled
upon an odd volume at a book-stall. It is such a
book as Lord Clive's family would have done well
in buying up; and it is not improbable that an
attempt was made to suppress it. The success of
your journal is greatly dependent upon the brevity
of your correspondents; so no more, even in
commendation of its design, from yours obediently,</p>

<h3>ON SOME SUPPRESSED PASSAGES IN W. CARTWRIGHT'S POEMS.</h3>

<p>As I want my doubts cleared up on a literary
point of some importance, I thought I could not
do better than state them in your "NOTES AND
QUERIES."</p>

<p>I have before me a copy of the not by any means
rare volume, called <i>Comedies, Tragi-Comedies,
with other Poems, by Mr. William Cartwright</i>, 8vo.
1651, with the portrait by Lombart. Though the
book may be called a common one, I apprehend
that my copy of it is in an uncommon state, for
I find in it certain leaves as they were originally
printed, and certain other leaves as they were
afterwards substituted. The fact must have been
that after the volume was published by H. Moseley,
the bookseller, it was called in again, and particular
passages suppressed and excluded.</p>

<p>These passages are three in number, and occur
respectively on pp. 301, 302, and 305; and the two
first occur in a poem headed "On the Queen's
Return from the Low Countries," an event which
occurred only shortly before the death of Cartwright,
which took place on 23d Dec. 1643.</p>

<p>This poem consists, in my perfect copy, of eight
stanzas, but two stanzas are expunged on the
cancelled leaf, viz. the second and the fifth; the
second runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When greater tempests, than on sea before,</p>
<p class="i2">Receiv'd her on the shore,</p>
<p> When she was shot at <i>for the king's own good</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">By legions hir'd to bloud;</p>
<p> How bravely did she do, how bravely bear!</p>
<p> And shew'd, though they durst rage, she durst not fear."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The queen landed at Burlington on 22nd Feb.
1642, so that Cartwright may have written what
precedes; but how could he have written what
follows, the fifth stanza of the poem, which mentions
an event that did not occur until six or seven
years afterwards?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Look on her enemies, on their Godly lies,</p>
<p class="i2">     Their holy perjuries,</p>
<p> Their curs'd encrease of much ill gotten wealth,</p>
<p class="i2">     By rapine or by stealth,</p>
<p> Their crafty friendship knit in equall guilt,</p>
<p> And the Crown-Martyr's bloud so lately spilt."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hence arises my first question&mdash;if Cartwright
were not the author of this poem, who was?
Although Izaac Walton, Jasper Mayne, James
Howell, Sir John Birkenhead, and a host of other
versifyers, introduce the volume with "laudatory
lays," we are not to suppose that they meant to
vouch for the genuineness of every production
therein inserted and imputed to Cartwright. Was
the whole poem "On the Queen's Return" foisted
in, or only the two stanzas above quoted, which
were excluded when the book was called in?</p>

<p>The next poem on which I have any remark to
make immediately succeeds that "on the Queen's
Return," and is entitled "Upon the Death of the
Right Valiant Sir Bevill Grenvill, Knight," who,
we know from Lord Clarendon, was killed at
Lansdown on 5th July, 1643, only five months
before the death of Cartwright, who is supposed
to have celebrated his fall. This production is
incomplete, and the subsequent twelve lines on
p. 305, are omitted in the ordinary copies of
Cartwright's <i>Comedies, Tragi-Comedies, with other
Poems</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"You now that boast the spirit, and its sway,</p>
<p> Shew us his second, and wee'l give the day:</p>
<p> We know your politique axiom, <i>Lurk, or fly</i>;</p>
<p> Ye cannot conquer, 'cause you dare not dye:</p>
<p> And though you thank God that you lost none there,</p>
<p> 'Cause they were such who <i>liv'd</i> not when they were;</p>
<p> Yet your great Generall (who doth rise and fall,</p>
<p> As his successes do, whom you dare call,</p>
<p> As Fame unto you doth reports dispence,</p>
<p> Either a &mdash;&mdash; or his Excellence)</p>
<p> Howe'r he reigns now by unheard-of laws,</p>
<p> Could wish his fate together with his cause."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is clear to me, that these lines could not
have been written in 1643, soon after the death of
Sir B. Grenvill; and, supposing any part of the
poem to have come from the pen of Cartwright,
they must have been interpolated after the
elevation of Cromwell to supreme power.</p>

<p>I have thrown out these points for information,
and it is probable that some of your readers will
be able to afford it: if able, I conclude they will
be willing.</p>

<p>It may be an error to fancy that the copy of
Cartwright now in my hands, containing the
cancelled and uncancelled leaves, is a rarity; but
although in my time I have inspected at least
thirty copies of his <i>Comedies, Tragi-Comedies,
with other Poems</i>, I certainly never met with one
before with this peculiarity. On this matter, also,
I hope for enlightenment.</p>

<p><i>Christencat.</i></p>

<p>In Day's edition of Tyndale's Works, Lond.
1573, at p. 476., Tyndale says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Had he" [Sir Thomas More] "not come begging
for the clergy from purgatory, with his <i>supplication of
souls</i>&mdash;nor the poor soul and proctor been there with
his bloody bishop Christen catte, so far conjured into his
own Utopia."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I take the word to be <i>Christencat</i>; but its two
parts are so divided by the position of <i>Christen</i>
at the end of one line, and <i>catte</i> at the beginning
of the next as to prevent it from being certain
that they form one word. But I would gladly
learn from any of your correspondents, whether
the name of Christencat, or Christian-cat, is that
of any bishop personified in the <i>Old Moralities</i>, or
known to have been the satirical sobriquet for
any bishop of Henry VIII.'s time. The text would
suggest the expectation of its occurring either in
More's <i>Utopia</i>, or in his <i>Supplication of Souls</i>, but
I cannot find it in either of them.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS&mdash;CATALOGUES, SALES, ETC.</h3>

<p>The extraordinary collection of the works of
Daniel Defoe formed by Mr. Walter Wilson, his
biographer, which at his sale realised the sum of
50<i>l</i>., and which had been rendered still further
complete by the addition of upwards of forty
pieces by the recent possessor, when sold by
Messrs. Puttick and Simpson, on Wednesday, the
5th instant, produced no less than 71<i>l</i>. Mr. Toovey
was the purchaser.</p>

<p>The Shakspeare Society have just issued a very
interesting volume, the nature of which is well
described by its ample title-page:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Inigo Jones. A Life of the Architect, by Peter
Cunningham, Esq. Remarks on some of his Sketches
for Masques and Dramas, by J.R. Planch, Esq.; and
Five Court Masques.  Edited from the original MSS.
of Ben Jonson, John Marston, etc., by John Payne
Collier, Esq.; accompanied by Facsimiles of Drawings
by Inigo Jones; and by a Portrait from a Painting by
Vandyck."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Many particulars in the memoir are new in the
biography of the great architect. Mr. Planch's
too brief <i>Remarks on the Costume</i> make us join
with Mr. Collier in regretting that he did not
extend to all the plates "the resources of his
attainments and talents;" while the five masques
and the general preface, contributed by Mr.
Collier, form by no means the least valuable
portion of a volume which cannot fail to give
satisfaction to all the members of the society by
which it is issued.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerslake, of Bristol, has just issued a
small Catalogue of Books bought at Brockley
Hall, and some which formerly belonged to
Browne Willis, which contains some interesting
articles, such as No. 222., M'Cormick's Memoirs
of Burke, with numerous MS. notes throughout
by J. Horne Tooke; the first edition of Wit's
Recreation, 1640, with a MS. note by Sir F.
Freeling:&mdash;"I have never seen another perfect
copy of the first edition." That in Longman's
<i>Bib. Ang. Poetica</i>, wanted frontispiece and 4 leaves,
and was priced 7<i>l</i>. 7<i>s</i>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson, who have during
the present week been selling the curious Dramatic
Library, printed and manuscript, and the
theatrical portraits of the late Mr. James Winston,
will commence, on Monday, the sale of Mr.
Mitchell's Collection of Autograph Letters. The
most interesting portion of these are eight-and-forty
unpublished letters by Garrick, among
which is one written to his brother Peter, commenced
on the day on which he made his appearance
on the London boards and finished on the
following. In it he communicates his change of
occupation to his brother, premising that since he
had been in business he had "run out four hundred
pounds, and found trade not increasing," and
had now begun to think of some way of redeeming
his fortune. "<i>My mind (as you know) has always
been inclined to the stage</i>; nay, so strongly so, that
all my illness and lowness of spirits was owing
to my want of resolution to tell you my thoughts
when here.... Though I know you will be displeased
with me, yet I hope when you shall find
that I may have the genius of an actor without
the vices, you will think less severe of me, and not
be ashamed to own me for a brother." He makes
an offer as to the transfer of his business, stock,
&amp;c. "<i>Last night I played Richard the Third to
the surprise of every body</i>; and as I shall make
very near 300<i>l</i>. per annum of it, and as it is really
what I doat upon, I am resolved to pursue it."
In a postscript, he adds, "I have a farce (<i>The
Lying Valet</i>), coming out at Drury-lane." And
his progress in his new profession is shown in another
letter, addressed also to his brother Peter,
on the 19th of April following, in which, after
mentioning some affairs of business connected with
their wine trade, he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The favour I have met with from the greatest
men has made me far from repenting of my choice. I
am very intimate with Mr. Glover, who will bring out
a Tragedy next winter on my account. I have supp'd
with the great Mr. Murray, Counsellor, and shall with
Mr. Pope by his introduction. I supp'd with Mr.
Littleton, the prince's favourite, last Thursday night,
and met with the highest civility and complaisance;
he told me he never knew what acting was till I appeared,
and said I was only born to act what Shakspeare
writ.... I believe nobody as an Actor was
ever more caressed, and my character as a private man
makes 'em more desirous of my company (all this <i>entre
nous</i> as one brother to another). I am not fixed for
next year, but shall certainly be at the other end of the
town. I am offered 500 guineas and a clear benefit,
or part of the management," &amp;c.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole collection forms, indeed, a curious
and new contribution towards the biography of
that distinguished actor.</p>

<p>Preparing for Publication, handsomely printed in 8vo.</p>

<p>A SERIES OF EDITIONS OF THE GREEK AND LATIN CLASSICS,</p>

<p>To be issued under the general title of</p>

<p><b>BIBLIOTHECA CLASSICA</b></p>

<p>Edited by various hands, under the direction of GEORGE LONG, Esq., M.A., late Fellow of Trinity College,
  Cambridge, Classical Lecturer of Brighton College; and the Rev. ARTHUR JOHN MACLEANE, M.A., Trinity
  College, Cambridge, and Principal of Brighton College.</p>

<p>Early in the ensuing year will be commenced a
Series of the Greek and Roman Authors, carefully
edited with English Notes, on a uniform plan. The
series will be especially adapted to the wants of students
in the higher forms of public schools and at the universities,
and will embrace, in the first instance, those
works which are usually read in the course of a classical
education.</p>

<p>The works will be edited by various hands; and, to
secure uniformity and consistency in execution, the
series will be under the united management of Mr.
Long and Mr. Macleane.</p>

<p>The first volume will be ready early in 1850. The
subsequent volumes will be published at intervals, as
regularly as may be found practicable, at the rate of
four or five volumes in the year.</p>

<p>The following works are undertaken by the gentlemen

expect that they will be enabled to extend the
series until it shall approximate to a complete collection
of the Greek and Latin Classics, and as they have
reason to think that such a collection would be found
an acceptable addition to all public and private Libraries,
they hope to receive the names of persons who
are willing to give encouragement to the scheme, as
Subscribers to the entire Series.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
