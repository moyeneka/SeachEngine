<h3>DOMINGO LOMELYN, JESTER TO HENRY VIII.</h3>

<p>Shakespeare, in the <i>Second Part of Henry IV.</i>
act v. sc. 3 makes Silence sing the following
scrap:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Do me right,</p>
<p>And dub me knight:</p>
<p><i>Samingo</i>."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And Nash, in his <i>Summer's Last Will and Testament</i>,
1600 (reprinted in the last edition of
Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i>, vol. xi. p. 47.) has</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Monsieur Mingo for quaffing doth surpass,</p>
<p>In cup, in can, or glass;</p>
<p>God Bacchus, do me right,</p>
<p>And dub me knight,</p>
<p><i>Domingo</i>"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>T. Warton, in a note in vol. xvii. of the <i>Variorum</i>
Shakespeare, says, "<i>Samingo</i>, that is <i>San Domingo</i>,
as some of the commentators have observed. But
what is the meaning and propriety of the name
here, has not yet been shown. Justice Silence is
here introduced as in the midst of his cups; and I
remember a black-letter ballad, in which either a
<i>San Domingo</i> or a <i>Signior Domingo</i>, is celebrated
for his miraculous feats in drinking. Silence, in
the abundance of his festivity, touches upon some
old song, in which this convivial <i>saint</i>, or <i>signior</i>,
was the burden. Perhaps, too, the pronounciation
in here suited to the character." I must own that
I cannot see what San Domingo has to do with a
drinking song. May it not be an allusion to a
ballad or song on <i>Domingo</i>, one of King Henry
the Eighth's jesters?</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;<i>Domyngo Lomelyn</i>,</p>
<p>That was wont to wyn</p>
<p>Moche money of the kynge,</p>
<p>At the cardys and haserdynge."</p>
<p>Skelton's <i>Why come ye not to Courte</i>,</p>
<p>ed. Dyce, ii. p. 63.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>None of the commentators have noticed this, but
I think my suggestion carries with it some weight.</p>

<p>In the <i>Privy Purse Expenses of King Henry the
Eighth</i> (published by Sir H. Nichols, in 1827),
are many entries concerning this <i>Domingo</i>, most
of which relate to payments of money that he had
won from the king at cards and dice. He was
evidently, as Sir Harris Nichols observes, one of
King Henry's "diverting vagabonds," and seems
to have accompanied his majesty wherever he
went, for we find that he was with him at Calais
in 1532. In all these entries he is only mentioned
as Domingo; his surname, and the fact of his
being a Lombard, we learn from Skelton's poem,
mentioned above.</p>

<p>The following story, told of <i>Domingo</i>, occurs in
Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Harington's <i>Treatise
on Playe</i>, 1597, printed in the <i>Nugae Antiquae</i>,
edit. Park, vol. i. p.222.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The other tale I wold tell of a willinge and wise
loss I have hearde dyversly tolde. Some tell it of
Kyng Phillip and a favoryte of his; some of our
worthy King Henry VIII. and <i>Domingo</i>; and I may
call it a tale; becawse perhappes it is but a tale, but
thus they tell it:&mdash;The kinge, 55 eldest hand, set up
all restes, and discarded flush; <i>Domingo</i> or <i>Dundego</i>
(call him how you will), helde it upon 49, or som
such game; when all restes were up and they had discarded,
the kinge threw his 55 on the boord open,
with great lafter, supposing the game (as it was) in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>{194}</span>
manner sewer. <i>Domingo</i> was at his last carde incownterd
flush, as the standers by saw, and tolde the
day after; but seeing the king so mery, would not for
a reste at primero, put him owt of that pleasawnt
conceyt, and put up his cardes quietly, yielding it
lost."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Park was not acquainted with any particulars
of this <i>Domingo Lomelyn</i>, for he says, in a note,
"Query, jester to the king?"</p>

<p>The first epigram in Samuel Rowland's entertaining
tract, <i>The Letting of Humours Blood in
the Head-waine</i>, &amp;c. 1600, is upon "Monsieur
Domingo;" but whether it relates to King Henry's
jester is a matter of some question.</p>

<h3>MARLOWE AND THE OLD "TAMING OF A SHREW."</h3>

<p>Having only just observed an announcement of
a new edition of the works of Marlowe, I take the
earliest opportunity of calling the attention of the
editor to a circumstance which it is important
that he should know, and the knowledge of which,&mdash;should
it have escaped his notice, as it has that
of all other writers on the subject,&mdash;I trust may
not be too late for his present purpose. Without
farther preface, I will introduce the subject, by
asking Mr. Dyce to compare two passages which
I shall shortly point out; and, having done so, I
think he will agree with me in the opinion that
the internal evidence, relating to our old dramatic
literature, cannot have been very much studied,
while such a discovery as he will then make still
remained to be made. The first passage is from the
so-called <i>old "Taming of a Shrew"</i> (six old plays,
1779, p. 161.), and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Now that the gloomy shadow of the night,</p>
<p>Longing to view Orion's drisling looks,</p>
<p>Leaps from th'Antarctic world unto the sky,</p>
<p>And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath;"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>the second is from <i>Doctor Faustus</i> (Marlowe's
Works, vol. ii. p. 127.), which, however, I shall
save myself the trouble of transcribing; as, with
the exception of "look" for "looks," in the second
line, and "his" for "her," in the fourth, the two
passages will be found identical. Being, some
years ago, engaged, in connection with the first of
these plays, in the pursuit of a very different
object,&mdash;in which I cannot say that I altogether
failed, and the result of which I may take an opportunity
of communicating,&mdash;I made a note of
the above; and at the same time followed it up by
a general examination of the style of Marlowe.
And, to make a long matter short, I may say that
in this examination, besides meeting with a dozen
instances of the identity of the writer of passages
in the <i>Taming of a Shrew</i> and of passages in
Marlowe's two plays, <i>Doctor Faustus</i> and <i>Tamburlaine</i>,
I found such general resemblance in style as
left no doubt upon my mind that, if one of these
plays be his acknowledged work, as indisputable
will be his claim to the other two. I was not
aware at that time of the evidence, in Henslow's
<i>Diary</i>, of Marlowe's authorship of <i>Tamburlaine</i>;
but, so far from considering it inferior, I was inclined
to place it, in some important respects, at
the very head of his plays.</p>

<p>I will not take up your space now with the
parallel passages which I noted; but, should you
wish it, and be able to make room for them, I will
furnish you with a list. It is, of course, obvious
that the one I have quoted proves nothing by
itself; accumulated instances, in connection with
the general question of style, alone become important.
I will conclude, by giving a list which I
have made out of Marlowe's plays, in favour of
which I conceive there to be either internal or
external evidence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Locrine.</p>

<p>Tamburlaine the Great (two parts).</p>

<p>Jew of Malta.</p>

<p>Doctor Faustus.</p>

<p>Edward the Second.</p>

<p>Massacre of Paris.</p>

<p>Taming of a Shrew.</p>

<p>Dido, Queen of Carthage (with Nash)."

<h3>BEETLE MYTHOLOGY.</h3>

<p>Mr. Editor,&mdash;I never thought of asking my
Low-Norman fellow-rustics whether the ladybird
had a name and a legend in the best preserved
of the northern Romance dialects: on the
score of a long absence (eight-and-twenty years),
might not a veteran wanderer plead forgiveness?
Depend upon it, Sir, nevertheless, that should
any reminiscences exist among my chosen friends,
the stout-hearted and industrious tenants of a soil
where every croft and paddock is the leaf of a
chronicle, it will be communicated without delay.
There is more than usual attractiveness in the astronomical
German titles of this tiny "red chafer,"
or <i>rother kaefer</i>, SONNEN KAEFER and VNSER
FRAWEN KVHLEIN, the Sun-chafer, and our Lady's
little cow. (<i>Isis</i> or <i>Io?</i>)</p>

<p>With regard to its provincial English name,
<i>Barnabee</i>, the correct interpretation might be
found in <i>Barn-bie</i>, the burning, or fire-fly, a compound
word of Low-Dutch origin.</p>

<p>We have a small black beetle, common enough
in summer, called PN, nearly hemispherical: you
must recollect that the <i></i> is as broad as you can
afford to make it, and the final <i>n</i> is nasal. Children
never forgot, whenever they caught this beetle, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>{195}</span>
place it in the palm of their left hand, when it was
invoked as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"PN, PN, mourtre m ten sang,</p>
<p class="i2">Et j'te dorai de bouan vin blianc!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>which means, being interpreted,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"PN, PN, show me thy blood,</p>
<p class="i2">And I will give thee good white wine!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>As he uttered the charm, the juvenile pontiff spat
on poor Thammuz, till a torrent of blood, or
what seemed such, "ran purple" over the urchin's
fingers.</p>

<p>Paul-Ernest Jablonski's numerous readers need
not be told that the said beetle is an Egyptian
emblem of the everlasting and universal soul, and
that its temple is the equinoctial circle, the upper
hemisphere.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>As a solar emblem, it offers an instructive object
of inquiry to the judicious gleaners of the old
world's fascinating nursery traditions. Sicilian
Diodorus tells us that the earth's lover, Attis (or
Adonis), after his resuscitation, acquired the divine
title of PAPAN.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> To hazard the inoffensive
query, why one of our commonest great beetles is
still allowed to figure under so distinguished a
name, will therefore reflect no discredit upon a
cautious student of nearly threescore years. The
very Welsh talked, in William Baxter's time, of
"Heaven, as <i>bugarth</i> PAPAN," the sun's ox-stall or
resting-place; and here you likewise find his
beetle-majesty, in a Low-Norman collection of
insular rhymes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Sus l'bord pisottaient, cte--cte,</p>
<p class="i2"> Les querbots et leas PAPANS,</p>
<p class="i2"> Et ratte et rat laissaient leux crotte</p>
<p class="i2"> Sus les vieilles casses et mme dedans."<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>By the help of Horapollo, Chiflet's gnostic gems,
and other repertories of the same class, one might,
peradventure, make a tolerable case in favour of
the mythological identity of the legend of Ladybird&mdash;that
is, the <i>sun-chafer</i>, or <i>barn-bie</i>, the <i>fire-fly</i>,
"whose house is burnt, and whose bairns are
ten," of course the first ten days of the Egyptian
year<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>&mdash;with the mystical stories of the said black
or dark blue lords of radiance, <i>Pn</i> and <i>Papn</i>.</p>

<p>The Egyptians revere the beetle as a living and
breathing image of the sun, quoth Porphyry.<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
That will account for this restless delver's extraordinary
talismanic renown. I think the lady-bird
is "the speckled beetle" which was flung in hot
water to avert storms.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> Pignorius gives us the
figure of the beetle, crowned with the sun, and encircled
with the serpent of eternity; while another,
an onyx in the collection of Abraham Gorlus,
threatens to gnaw at a thunderbolt.<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Reuven's book on the Egyptian Museum, which
I have not seen, notices an invocation to "the
winged beetle, the monarch ([Greek: tyrannos]) of mid-heaven,"
concluding with a devout wish that some
poor creature "may be dashed to pieces."</p>

<p>Can any of your readers inform me what is
meant by "the blood of the <i>Phun</i>?"</p>

<p>Yours truly, </p>

<p class="author">?</p>

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM CHURCHWARDENS' ACCOUNTS OF ST. MARGARET'S, WESTMINSTER&mdash;WEIGHT OF BELLS IN ANCIENT TIMES&mdash;HISTORY OF A ROOD-LOFT.</h3>

<p>I send you a few Notes, collected out of the
Churchwardens' Accounts of St. Margaret's,
Westminster.</p>

<p>1stly. Some regarding the weight of bells in
ancient days:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
"1526. The first bell weith                    ccccc lb.
       The second bell weith               ccccccxxj lb.
       The third bell weith                    ixCvj lb.
       The fourthe bell weith                    M.x lb.
       The fyfthe belonging to our grete Lady
         Bretherhed                        MvjCxiiij lb.
     The sume of all the weight          MMMMVIIC Li lb.

"1592. The broken Tennor waied               xvjCxxj lb.
       The new tennor ys.                      xiijC di
       The greatest bell ys     xxjC and di at lvjs. the C.
       The iiij bell ys       xvijC and di and xiiij lb.
       The xiiij bell taken awaie was         xiijC di.
       The ij bell carried awaie was    viijCiij qters.
       The new bell                           viijC di.
      Som totall of the bells, yron, tymber, and
      workmanshipp                     lxxvl. vs. vd."
</pre>

<p>This appears to have been a sorry bargain, for
soon after occur sad complaints of these bells,
"very falsly and deceytfully made by Valentyne
Trever." Perhaps your correspondent "CEPHAS"
may explain the following entry:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
"1846. Item, paid for makying of a newe clapper to
         Judas bell                                xd."
</pre>

<p>2ndly. Some entries, which make up a little
history of a rood-loft:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
"1460. Item, sol' pro le skoryng de la belles sup' le
          Rode lofte                             iiijd.

"1480. Item, paide for a doore in the rode lofte to

                                                 xijd.
       Item, paide to a carpynter for makyng of the
          Crucyfix and the beme He standeth upon   xls.

       Item, paide for kervying of Mary and John
         and the makyng newe         xxxiij<i>s</i>. iiij<i>d</i>.

       Item, for gilding of the same Mary and John
         and the Crosse and iiij'or Evangelysts
                                 vj<i>l</i>. vj<i>s</i>. viij<i>d</i>.

"1530. Item, payd to a labourer for helpying up the
         Roode Loft into the stepull          viij<i>d</i>.

"1534. Payd for a present for Mr. Alford and Mr.
         Herytage for ther good wyll for tymber for
         the newe Rode lofte              ij<i>s</i>. ij<i>d</i>."
</pre>

<p>The fickle tyrant Henry VIII. dies; a more consistent
reign happily ensues.</p>

<pre>
"1548. Item, for the takying downe of the Roode, the
         Tabernacle, and the Images    iij<i>s</i>. vj<i>d</i>.
       Also payd to Thomas Stokedale for xxxv ells

</pre>

<p>Queen Mary succeeds the boy-king Edward VI.,
and restores the Ritual of her Church.</p>

<pre>

<h3>NOTES UPON CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK FOR LONDON.</h3>

<p><i>The Bagnio in Long Acre.</i>&mdash;Mr. Cunningham
mentions the Queen's Bagnio in Long Acre.
Query, was this the same as the Duke of York's
Bagnio? S. Haworth published, in a small 12mo.
volume, without date, "A Description of the
Duke of York's Bagnio, in Long Acre, and of the
Mineral Bath and new Spaw thereunto belonging."</p>

<p><i>Tavistock Street, Covent Garden.</i>&mdash;Richard
Leveridge, the celebrated singer, after his retirement
from the stage, kept a tavern in this street.
Here he brought out "A Collection of Songs,
with the Music, by Mr. Leveridge. In two
volumes. London, Engrav'd and Printed for the
Author in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, 1727."
The frontispiece was designed and engraved by
Hogarth.</p>

<p><i>Duke Street, Westminster.</i>&mdash;Miss Hawkins, in
her <i>Anecdotes</i>, p. 186., speaking of Lady Lucy
Meyrick, says, "On quitting her husband's family,
she came to reside in Duke Street, Westminster,
and lived in that house which had been <i>Prior's</i>,
and which <i>exactly faces Charles Street</i>."</p>

<p><i>Richmond Buildings, Soho.</i>&mdash;Horne Tooke
resided here in 1775. He afterwards removed to
Frith Street.</p>

<p><i>Clare Market</i>, originally called <i>New Market</i>,
was established about the year 1660, by Lord
Clare.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The city and my lord had a great lawsuit, which
lasted many years, to the great expence of the city;
but from the inequity of the times the city and my
lord agreed, and gave it up to the lord; and now it is
become one of the greatest markets in the adjacent
parts; and from the success of this noble lord, they
have got several charters for the erecting of several
others since the year 1660; as that of St. James, by
the Earl of St. Alban's; Bloomsbury, by the Earl of
Southampton; Brook Market, by the Lord Brook;
Hungerford Market; Newport Market; besides the
Hay Market, New Charingcross, and that at Petty
France at Westminster, with their Mayfair in the fields
behind Piccadilly."&mdash;<i>Harl. MS</i>. 5900.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>London House Yard.</i>&mdash;Here was formerly the
town house of the Bishop of London, which, being
consumed in the great fire, the house in
Aldersgate Street, formerly called <i>Petre House</i>, was
rented for the town residence of the bishop, since
which it obtained the title of <i>London House</i>.</p>

<h3>AELFRIC'S COLLOQUY.</h3>

<p>The singular error which Messrs. Lye and
Thorpe have fallen in the passage pointed out by
Mr. Hampson in Aelfric's very interesting <i>Colloquy</i>,
is the more remarkable as Aelfric himself
afforded a complete illustration of the passage, in
his <i>Glossary</i>, where we have "BULGA, <i>hdig-faet</i>."
It is possible, therefore, that <i>higdifatu</i> is a mere
error of the scribe. Now Du Cange, v. <i>Bulga</i>,
cites this very passage from Aelfric's <i>Glossary</i>,
and adds, "i.e. <i>vas ex corio confectum</i>," but his
whole article is worth consulting. That the Latin
word in the <i>Colloquy</i> should be <i>Cassidilia</i> is quite
clear. Thus in an old MS. English Gloss on the
Bible (penes me), the passage in Tobit, viii. 2.,
"Protulit de <i>Cassidili</i> suo," is rendered, "brouzt
forth of his <i>Scrippe</i>." Coverdale has it, "take out
of his <i>bagge</i>," and Luther, "langte aus seinem
<i>Scklein</i>," which word is exchanged for <i>bdel</i> in
the Saxon version. In two old Teutonic Glosses
on the Bible published by Graff (<i>Diutiska</i>, ii. 178.),
we have the following variations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>de cassidi</i> burssa, <i>de sacello t. sacciperio</i> kiula</p>
<p><i>de cassili</i> burissa, <i>de sacello t. sacciperio</i> kiulla.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Another Gloss in Graff's 1st vol. p. 192., on the
word <i>Cadus</i>, may perhaps throw some light on the
subject. The philological student need not be reminded
of the wide application of the word <i>vas</i>,
Lat., <i>fazz</i>, O.G., and <i>faet</i>. A.S.; but for my own
part, I conclude that the shoewright intended
to designate by <i>higdifatu</i> all sorts of <i>leathern budgets</i>.
Every Anglo-Saxon student must be so
sensible of the great obligation he is under to our
distinguished scholar Mr. Thorpe, that I trust it
will not be deemed invidious or ungracious to
point out another passage in this <i>Colloquy</i> which
seems to have hitherto baffled him, but which it
appears to me may be elucidated.</p>

<p>To the question, "Hwilce fixas gefehst thu?"
the fisherman answers, "Aelas aud hacodas, mynas,
aud aelputan, sceotan aud lampredan, aud
swa hwylce swa on waetere swymath, <i>sprote</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Thorpe, in the 1st edition of his <i>Analecta</i>,
says, "What is intended to be meant by this word
[<i>sprote</i>], as well as by <i>salu</i> [the correspondent
word in the Latin], I am at a loss to conjecture."
In his second edition, Mr. Thorpe repeats, "I am
unable to explain <i>salu</i> otherwise than by supposing
it may be an error for <i>salice</i>. In his <i>Glossary</i> he
has "spro't, ii. 2.? sprout, rod?" with a reference
to his note. I must confess I cannot see how the
substitution of <i>salice</i> for <i>salu</i> would make the passage
more intelligible, and the explanation of
<i>spro'te</i> in the <i>Glossary</i> does not help us. The
sense required appears to me to be, <i>quickly, swiftly,</i>
and this will, I think, be found to be the meaning
of <i>sprote</i>. In the Moeso-Gothic Gospels the word
<i>sprauto</i> occurs several times and always in the sense
of <i>cito, subito</i>; and though we have hitherto, I believe,
no other example in Anglo-Saxon of this adverbial
use of the word, we are warranted, I think,
in concluding, from the analogy of a cognate language,
that it did exist. In regard to the evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>{198}</span>
corrupt Latin word <i>salu</i>, I have nothing better to
offer than the forlorn conjecture that, in monkish
Latin, "<i>saltu't</i>" may have been contractedly written
for <i>saltuatim</i>."</p>

<p>Dr. Leo, in his <i>Angelschsiche Sprachproben</i>,
has reprinted the <i>Colloquy</i>, but without the Latin,
and, among many other capricious deviations from
Mr. Thorpe's text, in the answer of the shoewright
has printed <i>hygefata</i>! but does not notice the
word in his <i>Glossary</i>. Herr Leo has entirely
omitted the word <i>sprote</i>.</p>

<h3>LOGOGRAPHIC PRINTING.</h3>

<p class="note">
[NASO has, in compliance with our request, furnished
us with a facsimile of the heading of his early number
of <i>The Times</i>, which is as follows:&mdash;"THE (here an
engraving of the King's Arms) TIMES, OR DAILY UNIVERSAL
REGISTER, PRINTED LOGOGRAPHICALLY, WEDNESDAY,
MARCH 12. 1788," and informs us that it was
printed "By R. Nutkins, at the Logographic Press,
Printing-House Square, near Apothecaries' Hall,
Blackfriars," and the height to which the Mr. Walter
of that day had brought his invention, by the same
energy by which his successor has raised THE TIMES
to its present position, is shown by the following note
from a kind and most able correspondent.]
</p>

<p>A much more remarkable specimen of Logographic
Printing than the number of the <i>Times</i>
newspaper mentioned by NASO, No. 9., p. 136., is
an edition of Anderson's <i>History of Commerce</i>,
with a continuation, in 4 vols. 4to., printed by
that method in 1787-1789, "at the Logographic
Press, by J. Walter, Printing-House Square,
Blackfriars." The work, which makes in all not
much short of 4000 pages, is very well printed in
all respects; and the following interesting note on
the subject of Logographic Printing is attached to
the preface heading the Continuation, or fourth
volume.</p>

<p>"Mr. Walter cannot here omit suggesting to the
Public a few observations on his improved mode of
printing LOGOGRAPHICALLY. In all projects for the
general benefit, the individual who conceives that the
trade in which he is engaged diminishes in its emoluments
from any improvement which another may produce
in it, is too much disposed to become its enemy;
and, perhaps, the interest of individuals never exerted
itself with more inveteracy than has been experienced
by Mr. Walter from many concerned in the trade into
which he had entered.</p>

<p>"The invention which he brought forward, promised
to be of essential service to the public, by expediting
the process and lessening the expense of printing. Dr.
Franklin sanctioned it with his approbation, and Sir
Joseph Banks encouraged him with the most decided
and animated opinion of the great advantages which
would arise to literature from the LOGOGRAPHIC PRESS.
Nevertheless Mr. Walter was left to struggle with the
interest of some, and the prejudice of others, and,
though he was honoured by the protection of several
persons of high rank, it happened in his predicament,
as it generally happens in predicaments of a similar
nature, that his foes were more active than his friends,
and he still continued to struggle with every difficulty
that could arise from a very determined opposition
to, and the most illiberal misrepresentations of, the
LOGOGRAPHIC IMPROVEMENT.</p>

<p>"Mr. Walter has, however, at length triumphed over
the falsehood and malignity of his opponents; LOGOGRAPHIC
PRINTING, after having produced such a work
as this, which he now presents to the public, with
many excellent publications that he has already printed,
can no longer be considered as an idle speculation: on
the contrary, it is proved to be a practical improvement,
that promises, under a due encouragement, to
produce a great national benefit. To advance it to
the perfection of which it is capable, Mr. Walter engages
to employ his utmost exertions, and he takes the
liberty of expressing his confidence, that he shall not
be disappointed in the enjoyment of that public favour
which now promises to reward his labours."</p>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH'S LAST DAYS.<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a></h3>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Royal Irish Academy
in Dublin, Dr. Anster exhibited a manuscript
volume of 157 pages, which he declared to be the
identical "album filled with songs, recipes, prayers,
and charms," found in the Duke of Monmouth's
pocket when he was seized. It was purchased at
a book-stall in Paris in 1827 by an Irish divinity
student, was given by him to a priest in the county
of Kerry, and, on the priest's death, became the
property of the present possessor. Respecting in its
identity and history, from its removal from the rebel
duke's pocket down to its production at the
Royal Irish Academy, Dr. Anster showed that
after Monmouth was beheaded&mdash;which he was on
Tower Hill, by the too-celebrated John Ketch, on
the 15th July, 1685&mdash;the articles found on his
person were given to the king. At James's deposition,
three years afterwards, all his manuscripts,
including those that had belonged to Monmouth,
were carried into France, where they remained
till the Revolution in that country a century afterwards.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>{199}</span>
Dr Anster, in exhibiting the book, showed
that the remains of silver clasps had been destroyed,
and a part of the leather of the covers at
each side torn away, seemingly for the purpose
of removing some name on a coat of arms
with which it had been once marked; and this he
accounted for by the belief that at the period of
the French Revolution the persons in whose custody
they were, being fearful of the suspicions
likely to arise from their possession of books with
royal arms on them, tore off the covers, and sent
the books to St. Omer's. The after-fate of the
larger books was, that they were burned; some
small ones, we are distinctly told, were saved from
this fate, but seem to have been disregarded, and
all trace of them lost. The Abb Waters&mdash;a collateral
descendant of Lucy Waters, the Duke of
Monmouth's mother&mdash;was the person with whom
George IV. negotiated for the Stuart papers, and
from whom the volumes which have since appeared
as Clark's <i>Life of James the Second</i> were obtained;
and it is from the Abb Waters we have
the account of the destruction of King James's
autograph papers. Dr. Anster showed, written
on the inner cover of this volume, the words,
"Baron Watiers" or "Watrers."</p>

<p>As to the identity of the book, Dr. Anster
quoted several passages from contemporary authors
to test their account of the contents of the
"album" with those of the book he was describing.
In the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>, vol. vi. p.323.,
it is stated in Sir John Reresby's memoirs, that
"out of his [Monmouth's] pocket were taken
books, in his own handwriting, containing charms
or spells to open the doors of a prison, to obviate
the danger of being wounded in battle, together
with songs and prayers." Barillon describes the
book in what is nearly a translation of this&mdash;"Il
y avoit des secrets de magie et d'enchantment,
avec des chansons des recettes pour des maladies
et des prieres." Again, in a note by Lord Dartmouth
to the modern editions of <i>Burnet's Own
Times</i>, we have the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"My uncle Colonel William Legge, who went in
the coach with him [Monmouth] to London as a guard,
with orders to stab him if there were any disorders on
the road, showed me several charms that were tied
about him when he was taken, and his table-book,
which was full of astrological figures that nobody could
understand; but he told my uncle that they had been
given to him some years before in Scotland, and he
now found they were but foolish conceits."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The actual contents of the manuscript volume
show a great resemblance to these descriptions.
The most curious passages which it contains are
the duke's memorandums of his journey on two
visits to the Prince of Orange, in the year previous
to his last rash adventure. His movements
up to the 14th of March, 1684-85, are given. The
entries do not seem to be of much moment; but
they may accidentally confirm or disprove some
disputed points of history. There is an entry
without a date, describing the stages of a journey
in England, commencing with London and Hampstead:
it ends with Toddington. This forms a
strong link in the chain of identity; for Toddington
is a place remarkable in the history of the
duke. Near it was the residence of Lady Henrietta
Maria Wentworth, baroness (in her own
right) of Nettlestead, only daughter and heir of
Thomas Lord Wentworth, grandchild and heir of
the Earl of Cleveland. Five years before the
execution, her mother observed that, despite the
duke being a married man, her daughter had,
while at court, attracted his admiration, and she
hurried her away to Toddington. In 1683, after
the failure of the Rye-House Plot, Monmouth was
banished from the royal presence, and it was to
Toddington he retired. When, on retracting the
confession he had made on the occasion, he
was banished the kingdom, the companion of his
exile was Lady Henrietta Wentworth.</p>

<p>"I dwell on this," said Dr. Anster, "because the
accidental mention of Toddington seems to authenticate
the book: the name of Lady Henrietta Wentworth
does not occur in it, and the persons in whose
hands the book has been since it was purchased in
Paris do not seem to have noticed the name of Toddington,
or to have known that it had any peculiar
relation to the duke's history. It occurs twice in the
book&mdash;once in the itinerary, and again in a trifling
and unmetrical song, which is probably the duke's own
composition; written probably on the eve of his flight
with his romantic but guilty companion to Holland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"'With joy we leave thee,</p>
<p class="i2">False world, and do forgive</p>
<p class="i2">All thy false treachery.</p>
<p class="i2">For now we'll happy live.</p>
<p class="i2">We'll to our bowers,</p>
<p class="i2">And there spend our hours;</p>
<p class="i2">Happy there we'll be,</p>
<p class="i2">We no strifes can see;</p>
<p class="i2">No quarrelling for crowns,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor fear the great one's frowns;</p>
<p class="i2">Nor slavery of state,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor changes in our fate.</p>
<p class="i2">From plots this place is free,</p>
<p class="i2">There we'll ever be;</p>
<p class="i2">We'll sit and bless our stars</p>
<p class="i2">That from the noise of wars</p>
<p class="i2">Did this glorious place give</p>
<p class="i2">(Or did us Toddington give)</p>
<p class="i2">That thus we happy live.'"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>In Macaulay's history we find that the latest
act of the duke on the scaffold, before submitting
to the stroke of the executioner, was to call his
servant, and put into the man's hand a toothpick-case,
the last token of ill-starred love. "Give it,"
he said, "<i>to that person!</i>" After the description
of Monmouth's burial occurs the following affecting
passage:&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>{200}</span>
<blockquote><p>
"Yet a few months and the quiet village of Toddington,
in Bedfordshire, witnessed a yet sadder funeral.
Near that village stood an ancient and stately
hall, the seat of the Wentworths. The transept of the
parish church had long been their burial-place. To
that burial-place, in the spring which followed the
death of Monmouth, was borne the coffin of the young
Baroness Wentworth of Nettlestead. Her family
reared a sumptuous mausoleum over her remains; but
a less costly memorial of her was long contemplated
with far deeper interest: her name, carved by the hand
of him she loved too well, was, a few years ago, still
discernible on a tree in the adjoining park."
</p></blockquote>

<p>In further proof of identity, Dr. Anster pointed
out several charms and recipes which the manuscript
volume contains. The conjurations are in
general for the purpose of learning the results of
sickness in any particular case, and of determining
whether friends will be in certain circumstances
faithful. There are also incantations for the use
of several maladies, and one to make gray hair
grow black. No "charms against being wounded
in battle," such are Sir John Reresby mentions,
are to be found in the volume; but there are some
prayers against violent death, which have the appearance
of having been transcribed from some
devotional book. There is evidently a mistake
in supposing that this book contains any charm for
breaking open prison doors, and it is likely that
Sir John Reresby was misled in this way:&mdash;There
is in p. 7. a charm in French to procure repose
of body and mind, and deliverance from pains;
and the word for "pains" is written in a contracted
form; it might as well stand for prisons;
but, examining the context, it is plainly the former
word which is meant.</p>

<p>The rest of the entries consist of extracts from
old recipe-books, mixed in the oddest way with
abridgements of English history, and the most
trifling memorandums, chiefly of a private and
personal kind. Altogether, this commonplace work
is highly indicative of the weakness, vanity, and
superstition which stood forward so prominently
in the character of the rash but unfortunate Duke
of Monmouth.</p>

<a name="queries1" id="queries1"></a>
<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3>CATHERINE PEGGE.</h3>

<p>Mr. Cunningham was mistaken in supposing
that I had overlooked Catherine Pegge, for I was
well aware that she could not have been Pepys's
"pretty Lady." She must, in fact, have attained
her fortieth year, and there is no record of her
being on the stage; whereas Margaret Hughes
had, when Pepys saluted her, recently joined the
Theatre Royal, and she is expressly styled "Peg
Hughes" by Tom Browne, in one of his "Letters
from the Dead to the Living." Having disposed of
this question, I am tempted to add that Morant
does not confirm the statement that Catherine
Pegge married Sir Edward Green, for he says that</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Sir Edward Greene, created a Baronet, 26 July,
1660, was seated at Little Sampford in Essex; he had
3 wives, the first was Jeronyma, daughter and coheir
of William Everard, of Linsted, Esq., and by her he
had 6 daughters; by Mary, daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Tasborough,
he had a son; and by the third lady &mdash;&mdash;, daughter of
&mdash;&mdash; Simonds, he had a daughter. He was the last of
the Greenes that enjoyed this estate, having lost it by
gaming."&mdash;Morant's <i>Essex</i>, vol. ii. p. 525.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This account of the Greene family is stated in a
note to have been taken from a fine pedigree on
vellum, penes T. Wotton, Gent.</p>

<p>If Catherine Pegge was one the three ladies
mentioned above, she must have changed her name
previously to her marriage, in hopes of concealing
her former history; but the circumstance of the
baronetcy being conferred upon Sir Edward is
very suspicious. Probably some of your correspondents
can settle the question.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM BASSE, AND HIS POEMS.</h3>

<p>Can any of your readers inform me where a
perfect or imperfect copy is to be found of a poem,
of which I possess only a single half sheet, under
the following title:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<i>Great Brittaines Sunnes-set, bewailed with a
Shower of Teares</i>. By William Basse. At Oxford,
Printed by Ioseph Barnes. 1613"?
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is one of the many poems published on the
death of Prince Henry; and although I have been
in search of it, or of a fragment of it, for more
than twenty years, I have never been able to
obtain tidings of more than of that small portion
in my possession; nor am I aware of the
mention of it in any bibliographical authority.
I have not at hand Sir H. Nicolas's edition of
Walton's <i>Angler</i>, in which Basse is spoken of, but
I remember looking at that beautiful and costly
work a long time ago, and, as far as I recollect,
not finding in it anything to my purpose. I observe
that a William Basse (or <i>Bas</i>, as the name
is there spelt) printed in 1602, 4to., a tract called
<i>Sword and Buckler, or Serving Man's Defence</i>;
but I know no more of it than that it was sold in
Steevens's sale; and among the MSS. of the late
Mr. Heber was a volume of poems called <i>Polyhymnia</i>,
apparently prepared for the press, and
dedicated by William Basse to Lady Lindsey,
which contained an "Elegie on a rare Singing
Bull-finch," dated 19th June, 1648; so that he
was still living nearly half a century after he had
printed his earliest known performance.</p>

<p>The production that Izaac Walton refers to
must be the ballad preserved in the Pepys Collection
at Cambridge, under the heading "Maister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>{201}</span>
Basse his Careere, or the new Hunting of the
Hare. To a new Court tune;" and beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Long ere the morne expects the returne."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>It was "Printed at London by E.A.," <i>i.e.</i> Edward
Allde, without date; and it may have been duly
noticed by the last editor of <i>The Complete Angler</i>.
However, neither this nor Heber's MS. throw
any new light upon the small tract (in 8vo., and
of perhaps not more than two sheets) with the
title of which I commenced, and regarding which
I request information. It is a poem in eight-line
stanzas, and it is dedicated, at the back of the
title-page, "To his honourable Master, Sir Richard
Wenman, Knight," without another word addressed
to his patron.</p>

<p>My fragment of four leaves, or half an 8vo.
sheet, contains stanzas (one on each page), numbered
5, 6, 7, 8. 13, 14.; and the earliest of them
is this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"To you I therefore weepe: To you alone</p>
<p class="i2">I shew the image of your teares, in mine;</p>
<p class="i2">That mine (by shewing your teares) may be show'n</p>
<p class="i2">To be like yours, so faithfull so divine:</p>
<p class="i2">Such as more make the publique woe their owne,</p>
<p class="i2">Then their woe publique, such as not confine</p>
<p>Themselves to times, nor yet forms from examples borrow:</p>
<p>Where losse is infinit, there boundlesse is the sorrow."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>I have preserved even the printer's punctuation,
for the sake of more perfect identification,
if any of your readers are acquainted with the
existence of a copy of the production, or of any
portion of it. The above stanza, being numbered
"5," of course it was preceded by four others, of
which I can give no account. Another stanza,
from this literary and bibliographical rarity, may
not be unacceptable; it is the eighth&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Here then run forth thou River of my woes</p>
<p class="i2">In cease lesse currents of complaining verse:</p>
<p class="i2">Here weepe (young Muse) while elder pens compose</p>
<p class="i2">More solemne Rites unto his sacread Hearse.</p>
<p class="i2">And, as when happy earth did, here, enclose</p>
<p class="i2">His heavn'ly minde, his Fame then Heav'n did pierce.</p>
<p>Now He in Heav'n doth rest, now let his Fame earth fill;</p>
<p>So, both him then posses'd: so both possesse him still."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Therefore, although Basse had written his <i>Sword
and Buckler</i> in 1602 (if it were the same man), he
still called his Muse "young" in 1613. I cannot
call to mind any precedent for the form of stanza
adopted by him, consisting, as it does, of six ten-
syllable lines, rhyming alternately, followed by a
twelve-syllable couplet. None of the other stanzas
contain personal matter; the grief of the author
of <i>Great Britain's Sun's-set</i> seems as artificial as
might be expected; and his tears were probably
brought to the surface by the usual pecuniary
force-pump.</p>

<p>I have some notion that William Basse was a
musical composer, as well as a writer of verses;
but here, again, I am at fault, and particularly
request the aid of Dr. Rimbault, who has paid
special attention to such matters, and who has just
published a learned and valuable work on the
music of the ballads in Percy's <i>Reliques</i>. If the
volume were not so indisputably excellent in its
kind, there are reasons, connected with its dedication,
which might make me hesitate in giving it
even a just tribute of praise.</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

<p><i>Christmas Hymn</i>.&mdash;Can any of your readers inform
me who was the author of the well-known
Christmas Hymn, "Hark the Herald Angels sing,"
which is so often found (of course without the
slightest shadow of authority), at the end of our
Prayer-Books? In the collection of poems entitled
<i>Christmas Tyde</i>, published by Pickering, the initials
"J.C.W." are appended to it; the same in
Bickersteth's <i>Hymn Book</i>. In the last number of
the <i>Christian Remembrancer</i>, it is incorrectly attributed
to Doddridge, who was the author of the
other Christmas Hymn, "High let us swell our
tuneful notes," frequently appended to Tate and
Brady; as well as of the Sacramental Hymn, "My
God and is Thy table spread?" If the author of
this hymn cannot be determined, it would be interesting
to know its probable date, and the time
when this and the other unauthorised additions
were made to our Prayer-Book. The case of
Doddridge's hymn is more remarkable, as being
the composition of a dissenter.</p>

<p class="author">E.V.</p>

<p><i>On a Passage in Pope</i>.&mdash;"P.C.S.S.," who is
old-fashioned enough to admire and to study
Pope, would feel greatly obliged if any of your
correspondents could help him to the interpretation
of the following lines, in the "Imitation" of
Horace's <i>Epistle to Augustus</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"The Hero William, and the Martyr Charles,</p>
<p>One knighted Blackmore, and one pensioned Quarles,</p>
<p>Which made old Ben, and sturdy Dennis swear,</p>
<p><i>No Lord's Annointed, but a Russian bear!</i>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The passage in Horace, of which this purports to
be an "Imitation," is the well-known</p>

<p class="poem">
"Boeotum in crasso jurares ere natum,"
</p>

<p>and it is clear enough that Pope meant to represent
kings Charles and William as so devoid of the
taste which should guide royal patronage, that, in
selecting such objects of their favour as Blackmore
and Quarles, they showed themselves to be
as uncouth and unpolished as the animal to which
he likens them. But the principal motive of this
inquiry is to ascertain whether there exist in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>{202}</span>
their writings any record of the indignation supposed
to have been expressed by Jonson and
Dennis at the favour shown by majesty to their
less worthy rivals.</p>

<p class="author">P.C.S.S.</p>

<p><i>Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood</i>.&mdash;
There is a passage in Longinus (ch. xxii.), familiar
perhaps to some of the readers of the "NOTES AND
QUERIES," which indicates that the fact of the
circulation of the blood was well established in the
days of Plato. The father of critics, to exemplify,
and illustrate the use and value of <i>trope</i> in
writing, has garbled from the Timaeus, a number
of sentences descriptive of the anatomy of the
human body, where the circulation of the blood is
pointed at in terms singularly graphic. The exact
extent of professional knowledge arrived at in the
time of the great philosopher is by no means
clearly defined: he speaks of the fact, however,
not with a view to prove what was contested or
chimerical, but avails himself of it to figure out
the surpassing wisdom of the gods in constructing
the human frame. Perhaps some of the readers of
the "NOTES," who are more thoroughly conversant
with the subject, may think it worth while to
inquire how much was known on that subject
before Harvey wrote his <i>Exercitationes Anatomiae</i>.
The <i>Prooemium</i> of that author seems hardly sufficient
to satisfy the desire of every reader, who has
looked with some care to the passage in Longinus
to which I have taken the liberty of calling public
attention.</p>

credit, or if any, is due to the Count's conjecture,
that Oliver Cromwell was the author of the book
entitled <i>The New Star of the North, shining upon

and <i>savegard of freseadon</i>." I shall be obliged by
any description of the garment known as the <i>savegard</i>,
and of the <i>russells quilt</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pandoxare</i>.&mdash;Having met with an old volume
containing the entire household expenses, as well
as in some degree a diary, kept by a country gentleman
during the reigns of James II., William
and Mary, and Anne, I observed that he has made
use of a species of hieroglyphics, to facilitate his
reference to his book, as it contained all the entries
of all kinds, in chronological order. For instance,
where mention is made of money spent on behalf
of one person in his house, he puts at the side of
the page a clay pipe, rudely drawn; an entry of
the payment of wages to another servant has a jug
of ale; another a quill pen; another a couple of
brooms, as the housemaid; a fiddle for the dancing
master for his daughter; payment made to the
sexton or parish-clerk has a representation of the
village church by its side, and the window-tax a
small lattice-window; and on the days that they
brewed, a small barrel is drawn by the side of the
date. And the chief object of my letter is with
respect to this last; a barrel is often drawn, and
by its side the words, <i>prim relinitus</i>, and the date,
naturally meaning the day it was tapped; and
then shortly after comes another barrel, and to
it is written the word <i>Pandox</i>., or sometimes in
full <i>Pandoxavimus</i>; in some places at the end of
the year there is a list to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
                 "(1705.)
                (&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;)
                 <i>Memoranda</i>.
              29. Mar.&mdash;Pandoxe.
               6. Apr.&mdash;relinit.
              28. Apr.&mdash;relinit.
               3. May.&mdash;Pandoxe.
              17. May.&mdash;relinit.
              31. May.&mdash;relinit.
               5. Iun.&mdash;Pandoxe."
</pre>

<p>and at the top of the list the figure of a barrel.</p>

<p>I should be glad if any of the readers of your
paper could tell me the meaning of the word <i>Pandoxare?</i>
Whatever it was, it took place about
once a month.</p>

<p><i>Lord Bacon's Metrical Version of the Psalms</i>.&mdash;
In old Izaak Walton's <i>Life of George Herbert</i>, I
find the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"He (<i>i.e</i>. Lord Bacon) thought him so worthy of
his friendship, that having translated many of the
Prophet David's Psalms into English verse, he made
George Herbert his patron by a public dedication of
them to him, as the best judge of divine poetry."

<p><i>Wood-cut Likeness of Luther and Erasmus</i>.&mdash;
Perhaps you will permit me to inquire what are
the earliest wood-cut likenesses of Luther and
Erasmus. Am I right in supposing that the image
of the great Reformer is found for the first time
on the verse of the title-page of his treatise <i>De
Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae</i>, 4to., s.l.v.a.;
and that the wished-for representation of Erasmus
may be seen in the small octavo volume, entitled
<i>Bellaria Epistolarum Erasmi Rot. et Ambrosii Pelargi
vicissim missarum</i>, Colon. 1539? Some of
your readers will doubtless be acquainted with
what seems to be a very accurate and complete
performance, the <i>Vita D. Martini Lutheri Nummis
atque Inconibus illustrata</i>, studio M. Christiani
Juncker, 8vo., Francof. 1699. In this work (p.129.)
there is an impression of a medal on which was
exhibited the <i>Imago ad vivam effigiem expressa</i>
of Erasmus, anno 1531.</p>

<p><i>Anglo-Saxon "Lay of the Phoenix</i>."&mdash;Has any
edition of the <i>Lay of the Phoenix</i> been published,

Grundtvig, 1840, 8vo"? Can any light be
thrown on the doubts respecting the era of the
author of this lay? And is there any published

<p><i>The Liturgy Version of the Psalms</i>.&mdash;In Beloe's
<i>Anecdotes of Literature</i> (edition 1807), vol. i. p.
181. and vol. ii. p.316. are notices of <i>The Bishops'
Bible</i>, where mention is made of one edition of it
containing two different versions of the Psalms.
The two statements, however, differ, making it
doubtful of what is intended; the first speaking
of one edition and the second of another.</p>

<p>Vol. i. p. 181. says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The first edition of this Bible was published in
1568. In this the new translation of the Psalms was
inserted alone. In the second edition the translation
of the Great Bible was added in opposite columns, and
in a different character."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Vol. ii. p. 316.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Bishops' Bible, first edition, 1568. There is also
a double translation of the Psalms, one from what is
called the Great Bible, the other entirely a new one."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Will any of your correspondents be so obliging
as to state what is the additional version&mdash;new
or other&mdash;there alluded to, other than the present
Liturgy version?</p>

<p><i>Lacedaemonian Black Broth</i>.&mdash;Your correspondent
"W." in No. 11., is amusing as well as
instructive; but it does not yet appear that we
must reject the notion of coffee as an ingredient
of the Lacedaemonian black broth upon the score
of <i>colour</i> or <i>taste</i>.</p>

<p>That it <i>was</i> an ingredient has only as yet been
mooted as a <i>probability</i>.</p>

<p>Pollux, to whom your correspondent refers us,
says that [Greek: zomos melas] was a Lacedaemonian food;
and that it was called [Greek: aimatia], translated in Scott
and Liddell's <i>Lexicon</i>, "<i>blood-broth</i>." These
lexicographers add, "The Spartan black broth was
made with blood," and refer to Manso's <i>Sparta</i>, a
German work, which I have not the advantage of
consulting.</p>

<p>Gesner, in his <i>Thesaurus</i>, upon the word "jus,"
quotes the known passage of Cicero, <i>Tusc. Disp</i>.
v. 34., and thinks the "jus nigrum" was probably
the [Greek: aimatia], and made with an admixture of blood,
as the "botuli," the <i>black</i> puddings of modern
time, were.</p>

<p>Coffee would not be of much lighter colour than
blood. A decoction of senna, though of a red-
brown, is sometimes administered in medicine
under the common name of a "<i>black</i> dose."</p>

<p>As regards the <i>colour</i>, then, whether blood or
coffee were the ingredient, the mess would be
sufficiently dark to be called "<i>black</i>."</p>

<p>In respect of <i>taste</i>, it is well known, from the
story told by Cicero in the passage above referred
to, that the Lacedaemonian black broth was <i>disagreeable</i>,
at least to Dionysius, and the Lacedaemonians,
who observed to him that he wanted that
best of sauces, hunger, convey a confession that
their broth was not easily relished.</p>

<p>The same story is told with a little variation by
Stobaeus, <i>Serm</i>. xxix., and Plutarch, <i>Institut. Lacon</i>., 2. The latter writer says, that the
Syracusan, having tasted the Spartan broth, "spat it out
in disgust," [Greek: dyscheranunta apoptusai].</p>

<p>It would not have been unlike the Lacedaemonians
purposely to have established a disagreeable
viand in their system of public feeding. Men that
used iron money to prevent the accumulation of
wealth, and, as youths, had volunteered to be
scourged, scratched, beat about, and kicked about,
to inure them to pain, were just the persons to
affect a nauseous food to discipline the appetite.</p>

<p class="author">R.O.</p>

<p><i>Lacedaemonian Black Broth</i>.&mdash;I should be glad
to know in what passages of ancient authors the
Lacedaemonian black broth is mentioned, and
whether it is alluded to in such terms as to
indicate the nature of the food. It has occurred to
me that it is much more probable that it was the
same <i>black broth</i> which is now cooked in Greece,
where I have eaten of it and found it very good,
although it looked as if a bottle of ink had been
poured into the mess.</p>

<p>The dish is composed of small cuttle-fish (with
their ink-bags) boiled with rice or other vegetables.

<p><i>Bigotry.</i>&mdash;The word Bigotry pervades almost
all the languages of Europe, but its etymology has
not been satisfactory to Noah Webster. The application
of it is generally intelligible enough;
being directed against those who pertinaciously
adhere to their own system of religious faith. But
as early as the tenth century it appears, that the
use of the word Bigot originated in a circumstance,
or incident, unconnected with religious
views. An old chronicle, published by Duchesne
in the 3rd vol. of his <i>Hist. Francorum Scriptores</i>,
states that Rollo, on receiving Normandy from the
King of France, or at least of that part of it, was
called upon to kiss the foot of the king, a
ceremony, it seems, in use not at the Vatican only;
but he refused "unless the king would raise his
foot to his mouth." When the counts in attendance
admonished him to comply with this usual
form of accepting so valuable a fief, he still declined,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>{205}</span>
exclaiming in pure Anglo-Saxon, "Not
He, By God,"&mdash;<i>Ne se bigoth</i>; "quod interpetatur,"
says the chronicler, "non [ille] per Deum."
The king and his peers, deriding him, called him
afterwards Bigoth, or Bigot, instead of Rollo.
"Unde Normanni," adds the writer, who brings
his history down to the year 1137, "adhuc Bigothi
dicuntur." This will account for the prepositive
article "Le" prefixed to the Norman Bigods, the
descendants of those who followed William the
Conqueror into England, such as Hugh Le Bigod,
&amp;c. Among other innovations in France, the
word Bigotisme has been introduced, of which
Boiste gives an example as combined with Philosophisme:&mdash;
"Le Bigotisme n'est, comme le
Philosophisme, qu'un Egosme systmatique. Le
Philosophisme et le Bigotisme se traitent comme
les chiens et les loups; cependant leurs espces se
rapprochent, et produisent des monstres."</p>

<p><i>Gowghe's Dore of Holy Scripture</i>.&mdash;If your correspondent
"F.M." (No.9. p.139.) has not received
a reply to his third query, I beg to submit that he
will find the perusers of Gowghe's work to be the
individuals mentioned in different portions of Foxe's
<i>Acts and Monuments</i>, vol. v. edit. 8vo. pp. 414.449.
482.; the less intelligible names, "Doctor Barons,
Master Ceton," being intended for Dr. Barnes and
Alexander Seton. Anyhow, this reference may, it
is hoped, lead to a fuller discovery of the parties
intended.</p>

<p><i>Reinerius Saccho</i>.&mdash;Your correspondent "D."

Saccho, if the source is accessible, in Quetif
and Echard's <i>Scriptores Ord. Praedicatt</i>. tom. i.
154.</p>

<p><i>Discurs Modest</i>.&mdash;Your correspondent "A.T."
(No.9. p.142) may be informed that there can be
no reasonable doubt, that the <i>original</i> authority, for
<i>Rem transubstantiationis patres ne attigisse quidem</i>,
is William Watson in his <i>Quodlibet</i>, ii. 4. p.31.;
that the <i>Discurs. Modest. de Jesuitis</i> borrowed it
from him; that Andrews <i>most probably</i> derived it
from the borrower; and that the date of the <i>Discurs</i>.
&amp;c. must, therefore, be between 1602 and
1610. Probably there may be a copy in the Lambeth
Library; there is none in the Bodleian,
British Museum, or Sion College, and Placcius
affords no reference. The <i>author</i> may never have
been known.</p>

<p><i>Defoe's Tour through Great Britain</i>.&mdash;I am
much obliged to your correspondent "D.S.Y" for
the suggestion that the <i>Tour through Great
Britain, by a Gentleman</i>, from which I sent you
some extracts relating to the Ironworks of Sussex,
is from the pen of Daniel Defoe. On referring
to the list of his writings, given in vol. xx.
of C. Talboy's edition of Defoe's Works, I find this
idea is correct. Chalmers notices three editions
of the work, in 1724, 1725, and 1727, (numbered
in his list "154," "156," "163,") and remarks that
"all the subsequent editions vary considerably
from the original" of 1724. He states that "this
work is frequently confounded with 'John Macky's
Journey through England, in familiar Letters
from a Gentleman here to his Friend abroad,'
1722." I may take this opportunity of mentioning
that, in the first volume of Defoe's work, there
are some very interesting particulars of the skirmish
at Reading, between the troops of the Prince
of Orange and the Irish forces of James II., and
the panic known as the "Irish night," which deserve
to be consulted by Mr. Macaulay, for the
next edition of his History. The whole work will
well repay a perusal, and what is there of Defoe's
writing which will not?</p>

<p class="author">D.S.</p>

<p><i>Muffins</i>.&mdash;The correspondent who, in No.11.,
p. 173., inquires the origin of the word "Muffin,"
is referred to Urquhart's <i>Pillars of Hercules</i>,
vol. ii. p. 143., just published, where he will find
a large excursus on this subject. The word, he
avers, is <i>Phoenician</i>: from <i>maphula</i>, one of those
kinds of bread named as such by Athenaeus. "It
was a <i>cake</i>," says Athenaeus, "baked on a hearth or
griddle." He derives this by taking away the
final vowel, and then changing <i>l</i> for <i>n</i>; thus:
"maphula," "maphul," "mufun!!!"</p>

<p>In this strange book there are fifty other etymologies
as remarkable as this. The author plainly
offers them in hard earnest. This is something
worth <i>noting</i>.</p>

<p class="author">V.</p>

<p><i>By Hook or Crook</i>.&mdash;"As in the phrase 'to
get by hook or crook;' in the sense of, to get
by any expedient, to stick at nothing to obtain
the end; not to be over nice in obtaining your
ends&mdash;<i>By hucke o'er krooke</i>; e.g. <i>by bending the
knees, and by bowing low</i>, or as we now say, by
bowing and scraping, by crouching and cringing."
&mdash;Bellenden Ker's <i>Essay on the Archaeology
our Popular Phrases and Nursery Rhymes</i>, vol. i.
p. 21. ed. 1837.</p>

<p>I wish your correspondent, "J.R.F.," had
given a reference to the book or charter from
which he copied his note.</p>

<p>Has Mr. B. Ker's work ever been reviewed?</p>

<p class="author">MELANION.</p>

<p class="note">
[Mr. Ker's book was certainly reviewed in <i>Fraser's
Magazine</i> at the time of its appearance, and probably
in other literary journals.]
</p>

<p><i>By Hook or By Crook</i>.&mdash;I have met with it
somewhere, but have lost my note, that Hooke
and Crooke were two judges, who in their day
decided most unconscientiously whenever the interests
of the crown were affected, and it used to
be said that the king could get anything by Hooke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>{206}</span>
or by Crooke. Query, is <i>this</i> the origin of the
phrase?</p>

<p>If I cannot give <i>my</i> authority, perhaps "J.R.F."
may be able to give <i>his</i>, for deriving it from "<i>Forest
Customs</i>?"</p>

<p><i>El Buscapi</i>.&mdash;A very full and able disquisition
on the subject of MR. SINGER's query (No. 11.,
p. 171.), respecting <i>El Buscapi</i>, will be found in
the appendix to a work which is just published, viz.
Ticknor's <i>History of Spanish Literature</i>, vol. iii.
Appendix D. 371. <i>et seq</i>. That writer, whose
opinion is entitled to credit as that of a consummate
student of Spanish letters, and who gives
good reasons for his conclusions in this instance,
pronounces against the authenticity of the poor
little pamphlet recently put forth as belonging to
Cervantes.</p>

<p>Those who take an interest in Spanish literature
will find this book of Ticknor's a most valuable
contribution to their knowledge of its whole compass,
and worth "making a note of."</p>

<p><i>Richard of Cirencester, &amp;c.&mdash;Bishop Barlow</i>.&mdash;Your
correspondent "S.A.A." (No. 6., p. 93),
who is desirous of further information respecting
Richard of Cirencester, will, I am sure, peruse
with much interest and gratification a dissertation
on that writer by K. Wex, which first appeared in
the <i>Rheinisches Museum fr Philologie</i> for 1846,
and was shortly after translated and inserted in
the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, with valuable notes by
the translator.&mdash;Respecting the writers of notes
on the margin of books, few notes of the kind, I
apprehend, deserve better to be collected and
published than those by the very learned Bishop
Barlow, Provost of Queen's College from the year
1657 to 1677, and who left the chief part of his
library to that society. The rest of his books,
being such as were not in the Bodleian, he bequeathed
to that library, of which he was for
some years the librarian. The <i>Biographia Britannica</i>
represents him to have been "an universal
lover and favourer of learned men, of what country
or denomination soever."</p>

<p><i>Rev. J. Edwards on Metal for Telescopes</i>.&mdash;"T.J."
informs the correspondent who inquired
(No. 11, p. 174.) respecting this valuable paper,
that it was printed in the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> for
1787. E.B. PRICE adds, "<i>A Treatise on Optical
Instruments</i>, published about twenty years ago by
the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,
contains much useful and general information
upon this subject; and it is stated in that
work that Mr. Edward's treatise, which is now
very scarce, is republishing in the <i>Technological
Repository</i>."  While "G.B.S." furnishes the information
that the treatise in question may be
procured from Mr. Murray, of Albemarle Street.</p>

<p><i>Ordination Pledges</i>.&mdash;In reply to the inquiry of
"CLERICUS" (No. 10., p. 156.) for manuals containing
a complete list of Ordination Pledges, may be
mentioned Johnson's <i>Clergyman's Vade Mecum</i>,
2 vols. 12mo., and William's <i>Laws relating to the
Clergy, being a Practical Guide to the Clerical
Profession on the Legal and Canonical Discharge
of their various Duties</i>, 8vo. The author of this
useful work, which appears not to have been seen
by Lowndes, says, in his advertisement, "The
works which are already extant on Ecclesiastical
Law, being either too diffuse or too concise for
ready reference and practical use, the compiler of
this volume has endeavored to remedy this defect by
the publication of the following compendium."</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

<p>The Percy Society have just issued <i>A New and
Mery Enterlude called the Triall of Treasure</i>,
from the edition printed at London by Thomas
Purfoote, 1567, edited by Mr. Halliwell. The
other works issued by the Society since May last
(when the year's subscription became due) have
been <i>A Poem</i> (satirical) <i>of The Times of Edward II</i>.,
edited by the Rev. C. Hardwick, from a MS. at
St. Peter's College, Cambridge, of which a less
perfect copy from an Edinburgh MS. was printed
by Mr. Wright, in the volume of <i>Political Songs</i>,
edited by him for the Camden Society; <i>Notices
of Fugitive Tracts and Chap-Books, printed at
Aldermary Churchyard, Bow Churchyard, &amp;c.</i> by
Mr. Halliwell; <i>The Man in the Moone, or The
English Fortune Teller</i>, edited by the same gentleman,
from the unique copy printed in 1609,
now in the Bodleian; and lastly, <i>The Religious
Poems of William de Shoreham, Vicar of Chart-Sutton
in Kent, in the Reign of Edward II</i>., edited
by Mr. Wright, from a contemporary manuscript.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether Mr. Shaw's skill as an
artist, fidelity as a copyist, or taste in the selection
of his subjects, entitle him to the higher praise.
We leave to those who are familiar with his
<i>Dresses and Decorations of the Middle Ages</i>, and
other admirable productions, the settlement of
this point. He has just published the first number
of a new work, <i>The Decorative Arts of the Middle
Ages</i>, the object of which is to exhibit the peculiar
features and general characteristics of decorative
art, from the Byzantine or early Christian
period to the decline of that termed the <i>Renaissance</i>.
This beautiful work&mdash;for beautiful it is&mdash;is extremely
well timed, as it appears at a moment
when our manufacturers who desire to display
their skill at the great exhibition of 1851, must be
most anxious to see "the principles by which our
ancestors controlled their genius in producing
articles of taste and beauty, from the precious
metals, from enamels, from glass, from embroidery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>{207}</span>
and from the various other textures and materials
on which they delighted to lavish their skill and
ingenuity (both for the various services of the
Church, and also as accessories to the luxuries of
the wealthy of all classes)." The present number
contains: 1. "An exquisite Cup, designed by
Holbein for Queen Jane Seymour;" 2. "Stained
Glass of the 13th Century, from the Cathedral of
Chartres;" 3. "An exquisite Specimen of Embroidery
(of the date of 1554), from a picture of
Queen Mary belonging to the Society of Antiquaries;"
and, 4. "Iron-work from the Tomb of
Eleanor of Castile." It will be seen, from this
enumeration of them, how varied and well selected
are the subjects of this new work of Mr. Shaw,
and how well they are adapted to answer the end
which he has in view.</p>

Edition.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"In the statements of Christian doctrine, the reality of Mr.
Blencowe's mind is very striking. There is a strength, and a
warmth, and a life, in his mention of the great truths of the
Gospel, which show that he spoke from the heart, and that, like
the Apostle of old, he could say.&mdash;'I believe, and therefore have
I spoken.'"&mdash;<i>Theologian</i>.

SERMONS. By ALFRED GATTY M.A., Vicar
of Ecclesfield.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"We say willingly of these Sermons, what we can seldom say
of sermons published at the request of parishioners, that they
justify the respect paid to them; and appear to us in somewhat
the same light as we should suppose they seemed to those who
listened to and admired them. They are sermons of a high and
solid character, and are the production of a good Churchman.
They are earnest and affectionate, and follow out of the Church's
doctrine."&mdash;<i>Theologian</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
"Warm-hearted and thoughtful."&mdash;<i>Guardian</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
"When the first edition of theses Sermons appeared, we noticed
them as a series of plain and practical, but close and scholarly
discourses. The appearance of a second edition, in a short time,
justifies our recommendation."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>.

THE UNITY OF GOD'S MORAL LAW,
AS REVEALED IN THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT.
By the Rev. A.J. MACLEANE, M.A., Trinity College, Cambridge,
Principal of Brighton College.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"We can recommend it not only as an answer to charges and
insinuations, but also as an able and clear exposition of the meeting
point of the Jewish and Christian dispensations; a distinct
and lucid delineation, amidst apparent divergencies, of the coincidences
of the animating principles of the law and the gospel."

<p>By the Rev. A.J. MACLEANE, M.A., Trinity College, Cambridge;
Principal of Brighton College: Author of "The Unity of God's
Moral Law, as revealed in the Old and New Testament."</p>

<blockquote><p>
"This volume of sermons is of a different stamp from the generality
of those which come under our notice.  There is a vigour of
thought and language throughout, without the slightest extravagance
or exaggeration.  There is no far-fetched strain of reasoning,
nor any attempt at fine writing in these discourses; but the
mind of the reader is directed, by a well-managed series of divisions,
to the principal doctrines and duties derivable from the
passages under consideration.  These sermons will afford to the
young clergyman excellent examples of the kind of composition
which is calculated to render his pulpit-ministration
effectual."&mdash;<i>English Review</i>.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
