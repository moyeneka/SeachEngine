    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; INTRODUCES MR. LEWISHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The opening chapter does not concern itself with Love&mdash;indeed that
      antagonist does not certainly appear until the third&mdash;and Mr.
      Lewisham is seen at his studies. It was ten years ago, and in those days
      he was assistant master in the Whortley Proprietary School, Whortley,
      Sussex, and his wages were forty pounds a year, out of which he had to
      afford fifteen shillings a week during term time to lodge with Mrs.
      Munday, at the little shop in the West Street. He was called &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;
      to distinguish him from the bigger boys, whose duty it was to learn, and
      it was a matter of stringent regulation that he should be addressed as
      &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore ready-made clothes, his black jacket of rigid line was dusted
      about the front and sleeves with scholastic chalk, and his face was downy
      and his moustache incipient. He was a passable-looking youngster of
      eighteen, fair-haired, indifferently barbered, and with a quite
      unnecessary pair of glasses on his fairly prominent nose&mdash;he wore
      these to make himself look older, that discipline might be maintained. At
      the particular moment when this story begins he was in his bedroom. An
      attic it was, with lead-framed dormer windows, a slanting ceiling and a
      bulging wall, covered, as a number of torn places witnessed, with
      innumerable strata of florid old-fashioned paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      To judge by the room Mr. Lewisham thought little of Love but much on
      Greatness. Over the head of the bed, for example, where good folks hang
      texts, these truths asserted themselves, written in a clear, bold,
      youthfully florid hand:&mdash;&ldquo;Knowledge is Power,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;What man has done man can do,&rdquo;&mdash;man in the second
      instance referring to Mr. Lewisham. Never for a moment were these things
      to be forgotten. Mr. Lewisham could see them afresh every morning as his
      head came through his shirt. And over the yellow-painted box upon which&mdash;for
      lack of shelves&mdash;Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s library was arranged, was a
      &ldquo;<i>Schema</i>.&rdquo; (Why he should not have headed it &ldquo;Scheme,&rdquo;
      the editor of the <i>Church Times</i>, who calls his miscellaneous notes
      &ldquo;<i>Varia</i>,&rdquo; is better able to say than I.) In this scheme,
      1892 was indicated as the year in which Mr. Lewisham proposed to take his
      B.A. degree at the London University with &ldquo;hons. in all subjects,&rdquo;
      and 1895 as the date of his &ldquo;gold medal.&rdquo; Subsequently there
      were to be &ldquo;pamphlets in the Liberal interest,&rdquo; and such like
      things duly dated. &ldquo;Who would control others must first control
      himself,&rdquo; remarked the wall over the wash-hand stand, and behind the
      door against the Sunday trousers was a portrait of Carlyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were no mere threats against the universe; operations had begun.
      Jostling Shakespeare, Emerson&rsquo;s Essays, and the penny Life of
      Confucius, there were battered and defaced school books, a number of the
      excellent manuals of the Universal Correspondence Association, exercise
      books, ink (red and black) in penny bottles, and an india-rubber stamp
      with Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s name. A trophy of bluish green South Kensington
      certificates for geometrical drawing, astronomy, physiology, physiography,
      and inorganic chemistry adorned his further wall. And against the Carlyle
      portrait was a manuscript list of French irregular verbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attached by a drawing-pin to the roof over the wash-hand stand, which&mdash;the
      room being an attic&mdash;sloped almost dangerously, dangled a Time-Table.
      Mr. Lewisham was to rise at five, and that this was no vain boasting, a
      cheap American alarum clock by the books on the box witnessed. The lumps
      of mellow chocolate on the papered ledge by the bed-head indorsed that
      evidence. &ldquo;French until eight,&rdquo; said the time-table curtly.
      Breakfast was to be eaten in twenty minutes; then twenty-five minutes of
      &ldquo;literature&rdquo; to be precise, learning extracts (preferably
      pompous) from the plays of William Shakespeare&mdash;and then to school
      and duty. The time-table further prescribed Latin Composition for the
      recess and the dinner hour (&ldquo;literature,&rdquo; however, during the
      meal), and varied its injunctions for the rest of the twenty-four hours
      according to the day of the week. Not a moment for Satan and that &ldquo;mischief
      still&rdquo; of his. Only three-score and ten has the confidence, as well
      as the time, to be idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just think of the admirable quality of such a scheme! Up and busy at
      five, with all the world about one horizontal, warm, dreamy-brained or
      stupidly hullish, if roused, roused only to grunt and sigh and roll over
      again into oblivion. By eight three hours&rsquo; clear start, three hours&rsquo;
      knowledge ahead of everyone. It takes, I have been told by an eminent
      scholar, about a thousand hours of sincere work to learn a language
      completely&mdash;after three or four languages much less&mdash;which gives
      you, even at the outset, one each a year before breakfast. The gift of
      tongues&mdash;picked up like mushrooms! Then that &ldquo;literature&rdquo;&mdash;an
      astonishing conception! In the afternoon mathematics and the sciences.
      Could anything be simpler or more magnificent? In six years Mr. Lewisham
      will have his five or six languages, a sound, all-round education, a habit
      of tremendous industry, and be still but four-and-twenty. He will already
      have honour in his university and ampler means. One realises that those
      pamphlets in the Liberal interests will be no obscure platitudes. Where
      Mr. Lewisham will be at thirty stirs the imagination. There will be
      modifications of the Schema, of course, as experience widens. But the
      spirit of it&mdash;the spirit of it is a devouring flame!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting facing the diamond-framed window, writing, writing fast, on
      a second yellow box that was turned on end and empty, and the lid was
      open, and his knees were conveniently stuck into the cavity. The bed was
      strewn with books and copygraphed sheets of instructions from his remote
      correspondence tutors. Pursuant to the dangling time-table he was, you
      would have noticed, translating Latin into English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperceptibly the speed of his writing diminished. &ldquo;<i>Urit me
      Glycerae nitor</i>&rdquo; lay ahead and troubled him. &ldquo;Urit me,&rdquo;
      he murmured, and his eyes travelled from his book out of window to the
      vicar&rsquo;s roof opposite and its ivied chimneys. His brows were knit at
      first and then relaxed. &ldquo;<i>Urit me</i>!&rdquo; He had put his pen
      into his mouth and glanced about for his dictionary. <i>Urare</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his expression changed. Movement dictionary-ward ceased. He was
      listening to a light tapping sound&mdash;it was a footfall&mdash;outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up abruptly, and, stretching his neck, peered through his
      unnecessary glasses and the diamond panes down into the street. Looking
      acutely downward he could see a hat daintily trimmed with pinkish white
      blossom, the shoulder of a jacket, and just the tips of nose and chin.
      Certainly the stranger who sat under the gallery last Sunday next the
      Frobishers. Then, too, he had seen her only obliquely....
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her until she passed beyond the window frame. He strained to
      see impossibly round the corner....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he started, frowned, took his pen from his mouth. &ldquo;This
      wandering attention!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The slightest thing! Where was
      I? Tcha!&rdquo; He made a noise with his teeth to express his irritation,
      sat down, and replaced his knees in the upturned box. &ldquo;Urit me,&rdquo;
      he said, biting the end of his pen and looking for his dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Wednesday half-holiday late in March, a spring day glorious in
      amber light, dazzling white clouds and the intensest blue, casting a
      powder of wonderful green hither and thither among the trees and rousing
      all the birds to tumultuous rejoicings, a rousing day, a clamatory
      insistent day, a veritable herald of summer. The stir of that anticipation
      was in the air, the warm earth was parting above the swelling seeds, and
      all the pine-woods were full of the minute crepitation of opening bud
      scales. And not only was the stir of Mother Nature&rsquo;s awakening in
      the earth and the air and the trees, but also in Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s
      youthful blood, bidding him rouse himself to live&mdash;live in a sense
      quite other than that the Schema indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the dictionary peeping from under a paper, looked up &ldquo;Urit
      me,&rdquo; appreciated the shining &ldquo;nitor&rdquo; of Glycera&rsquo;s
      shoulders, and so fell idle again to rouse himself abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> fix my attention,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham. He
      took off the needless glasses, wiped them, and blinked his eyes. This
      confounded Horace and his stimulating epithets! A walk?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be beat,&rdquo; he said&mdash;incorrectly&mdash;replaced
      his glasses, brought his elbows down on either side of his box with
      resonant violence, and clutched the hair over his ears with both hands....
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes&rsquo; time he found himself watching the swallows curving
      through the blue over the vicarage garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ever man have such a bother with himself as me?&rdquo; he asked
      vaguely but vehemently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s self-indulgence does it&mdash;sitting
      down&rsquo;s the beginning of laziness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So he stood up to his work, and came into permanent view of the village
      street. &ldquo;If she has gone round the corner by the post office, she
      will come in sight over the palings above the allotments,&rdquo; suggested
      the unexplored and undisciplined region of Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s mind....
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not come into sight. Apparently she had not gone round by the post
      office after all. It made one wonder where she had gone. Did she go up
      through the town to the avenue on these occasions?... Then abruptly a
      cloud drove across the sunlight, the glowing street went cold and Mr.
      Lewisham&rsquo;s imagination submitted to control. So &ldquo;<i>Mater
      saeva cupidinum</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;The untamable mother of desires,&rdquo;&mdash;Horace
      (Book II. of the Odes) was the author appointed by the university for Mr.
      Lewisham&rsquo;s matriculation&mdash;was, after all, translated to its
      prophetic end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precisely as the church clock struck five Mr. Lewisham, with a punctuality
      that was indeed almost too prompt for a really earnest student, shut his
      Horace, took up his Shakespeare, and descended the narrow, curved,
      uncarpeted staircase that led from his garret to the living room in which
      he had his tea with his landlady, Mrs. Munday. That good lady was alone,
      and after a few civilities Mr. Lewisham opened his Shakespeare and read
      from a mark onward&mdash;that mark, by-the-bye, was in the middle of a
      scene&mdash;while he consumed mechanically a number of slices of bread and
      whort jam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munday watched him over her spectacles and thought how bad so much
      reading must be for the eyes, until the tinkling of her shop-bell called
      her away to a customer. At twenty-five minutes to six he put the book back
      in the window-sill, dashed a few crumbs from his jacket, assumed a
      mortar-board cap that was lying on the tea-caddy, and went forth to his
      evening &ldquo;preparation duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The West Street was empty and shining golden with the sunset. Its beauty
      seized upon him, and he forgot to repeat the passage from Henry VIII. that
      should have occupied him down the street. Instead he was presently
      thinking of that insubordinate glance from his window and of little chins
      and nose-tips. His eyes became remote in their expression....
    </p>
    <p>
      The school door was opened by an obsequious little boy with &ldquo;lines&rdquo;
      to be examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham felt a curious change of atmosphere on his entry. The door
      slammed behind him. The hall with its insistent scholastic suggestions,
      its yellow marbled paper, its long rows of hat-pegs, its disreputable
      array of umbrellas, a broken mortar-board and a tattered and scattered <i>Principia</i>,
      seemed dim and dull in contrast with the luminous stir of the early March
      evening outside. An unusual sense of the greyness of a teacher&rsquo;s
      life, of the greyness indeed of the life of all studious souls came, and
      went in his mind. He took the &ldquo;lines,&rdquo; written painfully over
      three pages of exercise book, and obliterated them with a huge G.E.L.,
      scrawled monstrously across each page. He heard the familiar mingled
      noises of the playground drifting in to him through the open schoolroom
      door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; &ldquo;AS THE WIND BLOWS.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      A flaw in that pentagram of a time-table, that pentagram by which the
      demons of distraction were to be excluded from Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s career
      to Greatness, was the absence of a clause forbidding study out of doors.
      It was the day after the trivial window peeping of the last chapter that
      this gap in the time-table became apparent, a day if possible more
      gracious and alluring than its predecessor, and at half-past twelve,
      instead of returning from the school directly to his lodging, Mr. Lewisham
      escaped through the omission and made his way&mdash;Horace in pocket&mdash;to
      the park gates and so to the avenue of ancient trees that encircles the
      broad Whortley domain. He dismissed a suspicion of his motive with perfect
      success. In the avenue&mdash;for the path is but little frequented&mdash;one
      might expect to read undisturbed. The open air, the erect attitude, are
      surely better than sitting in a stuffy, enervating bedroom. The open air
      is distinctly healthy, hardy, simple....
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was breezy, and there was a perpetual rustling, a going and coming
      in the budding trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The network of the beeches was full of golden sunlight, and all the lower
      branches were shot with horizontal dashes of new-born green.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;<i>Tu, nisi ventis
    Debes ludibrium, cave</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      was the appropriate matter of Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s thoughts, and he was
      mechanically trying to keep the book open in three places at once, at the
      text, the notes, and the literal translation, while he turned up the
      vocabulary for <i>ludibrium</i>, when his attention, wandering dangerously
      near the top of the page, fell over the edge and escaped with incredible
      swiftness down the avenue....
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl, wearing a straw hat adorned with white blossom, was advancing
      towards him. Her occupation, too, was literary. Indeed, she was so busy
      writing that evidently she did not perceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unreasonable emotions descended upon Mr. Lewisham&mdash;emotions that are
      unaccountable on the mere hypothesis of a casual meeting. Something was
      whispered; it sounded suspiciously like &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her!&rdquo; He
      advanced with his fingers in his book, ready to retreat to its pages if
      she looked up, and watched her over it. <i>Ludibrium</i> passed out of his
      universe. She was clearly unaware of his nearness, he thought, intent upon
      her writing, whatever that might be. He wondered what it might be. Her
      face, foreshortened by her downward regard, seemed infantile. Her
      fluttering skirt was short, and showed her shoes and ankles. He noted her
      graceful, easy steps. A figure of health and lightness it was, sunlit, and
      advancing towards him, something, as he afterwards recalled with a certain
      astonishment, quite outside the Schema.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer she came and nearer, her eyes still downcast. He was full of vague,
      stupid promptings towards an uncalled-for intercourse. It was curious she
      did not see him. He began to expect almost painfully the moment when she
      would look up, though what there was to expect&mdash;! He thought of what
      she would see when she discovered him, and wondered where the tassel of
      his cap might be hanging&mdash;it sometimes occluded one eye. It was of
      course quite impossible to put up a hand and investigate. He was near
      trembling with excitement. His paces, acts which are usually automatic,
      became uncertain and difficult. One might have thought he had never passed
      a human being before. Still nearer, ten yards now, nine, eight. Would she
      go past without looking up?...
    </p>
    <p>
      Then their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hazel eyes, but Mr. Lewisham, being quite an amateur about eyes,
      could find no words for them. She looked demurely into his face. She
      seemed to find nothing there. She glanced away from him among the trees,
      and passed, and nothing remained in front of him but an empty avenue, a
      sunlit, green-shot void.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      From far away the soughing of the breeze swept towards him, and in a
      moment all the twigs about him were quivering and rustling and the boughs
      creaking with a gust of wind. It seemed to urge him away from her. The
      faded dead leaves that had once been green and young sprang up, raced one
      another, leapt, danced and pirouetted, and then something large struck him
      on the neck, stayed for a startling moment, and drove past him up the
      avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something vividly white! A sheet of paper&mdash;the sheet upon which she
      had been writing!
    </p>
    <p>
      For what seemed a long time he did not grasp the situation. He glanced
      over his shoulder and understood suddenly. His awkwardness vanished.
      Horace in hand, he gave chase, and in ten paces had secured the fugitive
      document. He turned towards her, flushed with triumph, the quarry in his
      hand. He had as he picked it up seen what was written, but the situation
      dominated him for the instant. He made a stride towards her, and only then
      understood what he had seen. Lines of a measured length and capitals!
      Could it really be&mdash;? He stopped. He looked again, eyebrows rising.
      He held it before him, staring now quite frankly. It had been written with
      a stylographic pen. Thus it ran:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Come! Sharp&rsquo;s the word.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then again,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Come! Sharp&rsquo;s the word.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Come! Sharp&rsquo;s the word.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Come! Sharp&rsquo;s the word.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so on all down the page, in a boyish hand uncommonly like Frobisher
      ii.&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely! &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, struggling with, the new
      aspect and forgetting all his manners in his surprise.... He remembered
      giving the imposition quite well:&mdash;Frobisher ii. had repeated the
      exhortation just a little too loudly&mdash;had brought the thing upon
      himself. To find her doing this jarred oddly upon certain vague
      preconceptions he had formed of her. Somehow it seemed as if she had
      betrayed him. That of course was only for the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come up with him now. &ldquo;May I have my sheet of paper, please?&rdquo;
      she said with a catching of her breath. She was a couple of inches less in
      height than he. Do you observe her half-open lips? said Mother Nature in a
      noiseless aside to Mr. Lewisham&mdash;a thing he afterwards recalled. In
      her eyes was a touch of apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said, with protest still uppermost, &ldquo;you
      oughtn&rsquo;t to do this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This. Impositions. For my boys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows, then knitted them momentarily, and looked at him.
      &ldquo;Are <i>you</i> Mr. Lewisham?&rdquo; she asked with an affectation
      of entire ignorance and discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew him perfectly well, which was one reason why she was writing the
      imposition, but pretending not to know gave her something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all people! Then&rdquo;&mdash;frankly&mdash;&ldquo;you have just
      found me out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;I am afraid I <i>have</i>
      found you out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another for the next move. She decided to plead in
      extenuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teddy Frobisher is my cousin. I know it&rsquo;s very wrong, but he
      seemed to have such a lot to do and to be in <i>such</i> trouble. And I
      had nothing to do. In fact, it was <i>I</i> who offered....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and looked at him. She seemed to consider her remark complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      That meeting of the eyes had an oddly disconcerting quality. He tried to
      keep to the business of the imposition. &ldquo;You ought not to have done
      that,&rdquo; he said, encountering her steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down and then into his face again. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought not to. I&rsquo;m very sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her looking down and up again produced another unreasonable effect. It
      seemed to Lewisham that they were discussing something quite other than
      the topic of their conversation; a persuasion patently absurd and only to
      be accounted for by the general disorder of his faculties. He made a
      serious attempt to keep his footing of reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have detected the writing, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you would. It was very wrong of me to persuade him. But I
      did&mdash;I assure you. He seemed in such trouble. And I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made another break, and there was a faint deepening of colour in her
      cheeks. Suddenly, stupidly, his own adolescent cheeks began to glow. It
      became necessary to banish that sense of a duplicate topic forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; he said, now very earnestly, &ldquo;I
      never give a punishment, never, unless it is merited. I make that a rule.
      I&mdash;er&mdash;<i>always</i> make that a rule. I am very careful indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really sorry,&rdquo; she interrupted with frank contrition.
      &ldquo;It <i>was</i> silly of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham felt unaccountably sorry she should have to apologise, and he
      spoke at once with the idea of checking the reddening of his face. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think <i>that</i>,&rdquo; he said with a sort of belated
      alacrity. &ldquo;Really, it was kind of you, you know&mdash;very kind of
      you indeed. And I know that&mdash;I can quite understand that&mdash;er&mdash;your
      kindness....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ran away with me. And now poor little Teddy will get into worse
      trouble for letting me....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, perceiving an opportunity and
      trying not to smile his appreciation of what he was saying. &ldquo;I had
      no business to read this as I picked it up&mdash;absolutely no business.
      Consequently....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take any notice of it? Really!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face lit with a smile, and Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s relaxed in sympathy.
      &ldquo;It is nothing&mdash;it&rsquo;s the proper thing for me to do, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But so many people won&rsquo;t do it. Schoolmasters are not usually
      so&mdash;chivalrous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was chivalrous! The phrase acted like a spur. He obeyed a foolish
      impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needn&rsquo;t do this. The Impot., I mean. I&rsquo;ll let him
      off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing much.
      If you really think ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was full of self-applause for this scandalous sacrifice of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, really,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most people wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Really.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have given worlds for something more to say, something witty and
      original, but nothing came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause lengthened. She glanced over her shoulder down the vacant
      avenue. This interview&mdash;this momentous series of things unsaid was
      coming to an end! She looked at him hesitatingly and smiled again. She
      held out her hand. No doubt that was the proper thing to do. He took it,
      searching a void, tumultuous mind in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you,&rdquo; she said again as she did
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter a bit,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, and sought
      vainly for some other saying, some doorway remark into new topics. Her
      hand was cool and soft and firm, the most delightful thing to grasp, and
      this observation ousted all other things. He held it for a moment, but
      nothing would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discovered themselves hand in hand. They both laughed and felt
      &ldquo;silly.&rdquo; They shook hands in the manner of quite intimate
      friends, and snatched their hands away awkwardly. She turned, glanced
      timidly at him over her shoulder, and hesitated. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo;
      she said, and was suddenly walking from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to her receding back, made a seventeenth-century sweep with his
      college cap, and then some hitherto unexplored regions of his mind flashed
      into revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had she gone six paces when he was at her side again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said with a fearful sense of his temerity, and
      raising his mortar-board awkwardly as though he was passing a funeral.
      &ldquo;But that sheet of paper ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said surprised&mdash;quite naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a breathless pleasure, like that of sliding down a slope of snow.
      &ldquo;I would like to have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and raised her eyebrows, but his excitement was now too great
      for smiling. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; she said, and displayed the sheet
      crumpled into a ball. She laughed&mdash;with a touch of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, laughing too. He
      captured the paper by an insistent gesture and smoothed it out with
      fingers that trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I keep it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause. Their eyes met again. There was an odd constraint about both of
      them, a palpitating interval of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really <i>must</i> be going,&rdquo; she said suddenly, breaking
      the spell by an effort. She turned about and left him with the crumpled
      piece of paper in the fist that held the book, the other hand lifting the
      mortar board in a dignified salute again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her receding figure. His heart was beating with remarkable
      rapidity. How light, how living she seemed! Little round flakes of
      sunlight raced down her as she went. She walked fast, then slowly, looking
      sideways once or twice, but not back, until she reached the park gates.
      Then she looked towards him, a remote friendly little figure, made a
      gesture of farewell, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was flushed and his eyes bright. Curiously enough, he was out of
      breath. He stared for a long time at the vacant end of the avenue. Then he
      turned his eyes to his trophy gripped against the closed and forgotten
      Horace in his hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE WONDERFUL DISCOVERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Sunday it was Lewisham&rsquo;s duty to accompany the boarders twice to
      church. The boys sat in the gallery above the choirs facing the organ loft
      and at right angles to the general congregation. It was a prominent
      position, and made him feel painfully conspicuous, except in moods of
      exceptional vanity, when he used to imagine that all these people were
      thinking how his forehead and his certificates accorded. He thought a lot
      in those days of his certificates and forehead, but little of his honest,
      healthy face beneath it. (To tell the truth there was nothing very
      wonderful about his forehead.) He rarely looked down the church, as he
      fancied to do so would be to meet the collective eye of the congregation
      regarding him. So that in the morning he was not able to see that the
      Frobishers&rsquo; pew was empty until the litany.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the evening, on the way to church, the Frobishers and their guest
      crossed the market-square as his string of boys marched along the west
      side. And the guest was arrayed in a gay new dress, as if it was already
      Easter, and her face set in its dark hair came with a strange effect of
      mingled freshness and familiarity. She looked at him calmly! He felt very
      awkward, and was for cutting his new acquaintance. Then hesitated, and
      raised his hat with a jerk as if to Mrs. Frobisher. Neither lady
      acknowledged his salute, which may possibly have been a little unexpected.
      Then young Siddons dropped his hymn-book; stooped to pick it up, and
      Lewisham almost fell over him.... He entered church in a mood of black
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But consolation of a sort came soon enough. As <i>she</i> took her seat
      she distinctly glanced up at the gallery, and afterwards as he knelt to
      pray he peeped between his fingers and saw her looking up again. She was
      certainly not laughing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days much of Lewisham&rsquo;s mind was still an unknown land to
      him. He believed among other things that he was always the same consistent
      intelligent human being, whereas under certain stimuli he became no longer
      reasonable and disciplined but a purely imaginative and emotional person.
      Music, for instance, carried him away, and particularly the effect of many
      voices in unison whirled him off from almost any state of mind to a fine
      massive emotionality. And the evening service at Whortley church&mdash;at
      the evening service surplices were worn&mdash;the chanting and singing,
      the vague brilliance of the numerous candle flames, the multitudinous
      unanimity of the congregation down there, kneeling, rising, thunderously
      responding, invariably inebriated him. Inspired him, if you will, and
      turned the prose of his life into poetry. And Chance, coming to the aid of
      Dame Nature, dropped just the apt suggestion into his now highly
      responsive ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second hymn was a simple and popular one, dealing with the theme of
      Faith, Hope, and Charity, and having each verse ending with the word
      &ldquo;Love.&rdquo; Conceive it, long drawn out and disarticulate,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Faith will van ... ish in ... to sight,
    Hope be emp ... tied in deli ... ight,
    Love in Heaven will shine more bri ... ight,
      There ... fore give us Love.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At the third repetition of the refrain, Lewisham looked down across the
      chancel and met her eyes for a brief instant....
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped singing abruptly. Then the consciousness of the serried ranks
      of faces below there came with almost overwhelming force upon him, and he
      dared not look at her again. He felt the blood rushing to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love! The greatest of these. The greatest of all things. Better than fame.
      Better than knowledge. So came the great discovery like a flood across his
      mind, pouring over it with the cadence of the hymn and sending a tide of
      pink in sympathy across his forehead. The rest of the service was
      phantasmagorial background to that great reality&mdash;a phantasmagorial
      background a little inclined to stare. He, Mr. Lewisham, was in Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ... men.&rdquo; He was so preoccupied that he found the whole
      congregation subsiding into their seats, and himself still standing, rapt.
      He sat down spasmodically, with an impact that seemed to him to re-echo
      through the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came out of the porch into the thickening night, he seemed to see
      her everywhere. He fancied she had gone on in front, and he hurried up the
      boys in the hope of overtaking her. They pushed through the throng of dim
      people going homeward. Should he raise his hat to her again?... But it was
      Susie Hopbrow in a light-coloured dress&mdash;a raven in dove&rsquo;s
      plumage. He felt a curious mixture of relief and disappointment. He would
      see her no more that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried from the school to his lodging. He wanted very urgently to be
      alone. He went upstairs to his little room and sat before the upturned box
      on which his Butler&rsquo;s Analogy was spread open. He did not go to the
      formality of lighting the candle. He leant back and gazed blissfully at
      the solitary planet that hung over the vicarage garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out of his pocket a crumpled sheet of paper, smoothed and
      carefully refolded, covered with a writing not unlike that of Frobisher
      ii., and after some maidenly hesitation pressed this treasure to his lips.
      The Schema and the time-table hung in the darkness like the mere ghosts of
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munday called him thrice to his supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out immediately after it was eaten and wandered under the stars
      until he came over the hill behind the town again, and clambered up the
      back to the stile in sight of the Frobishers&rsquo; house. He selected the
      only lit window as hers. Behind the blind, Mrs. Frobisher, thirty-eight,
      was busy with her curl-papers&mdash;she used papers because they were
      better for the hair&mdash;and discussing certain neighbours in a
      fragmentary way with Mr. Frobisher, who was in bed. Presently she moved
      the candle to examine a faint discolouration of her complexion that
      rendered her uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, Mr. Lewisham (eighteen) stood watching the orange oblong for the
      best part of half an hour, until it vanished and left the house black and
      blank. Then he sighed deeply and returned home in a very glorious mood
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke the next morning feeling extremely serious, but not clearly
      remembering the overnight occurrences. His eye fell on his clock. The time
      was six and he had not heard the alarum; as a matter of fact the alarum
      had not been wound up. He jumped out of bed at once and alighted upon his
      best trousers amorphously dropped on the floor instead of methodically
      cast over a chair. As he soaped his head he tried, according to his rules
      of revision, to remember the overnight reading. He could not for the life
      of him. The truth came to him as he was getting into his shirt. His head,
      struggling in its recesses, became motionless, the handless cuffs ceased
      to dangle for a minute....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his head came through slowly with a surprised expression upon his
      face. He remembered. He remembered the thing as a bald discovery, and
      without a touch of emotion. With all the achromatic clearness, the
      unromantic colourlessness of the early morning....
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. He had it now quite distinctly. There had been no overnight reading.
      He was in Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposition jarred with some vague thing in his mind. He stood staring
      for a space, and then began looking about absent-mindedly for his
      collar-stud. He paused in front of his Schema, regarding it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; RAISED EYEBROWS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work must be done anyhow,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      But never had the extraordinary advantages of open-air study presented
      themselves so vividly. Before breakfast he took half an hour of open-air
      reading along the allotments lane near the Frobishers&rsquo; house, after
      breakfast and before school he went through the avenue with a book, and
      returned from school to his lodgings circuitously through the avenue, and
      so back to the avenue for thirty minutes or so before afternoon school.
      When Mr. Lewisham was not looking over the top of his book during these
      periods of open-air study, then commonly he was glancing over his
      shoulder. And at last who should he see but&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her out of the corner of his eye, and he turned away at once,
      pretending not to have seen her. His whole being was suddenly irradiated
      with emotion. The hands holding his book gripped it very tightly. He did
      not glance back again, but walked slowly and steadfastly, reading an ode
      that he could not have translated to save his life, and listening acutely
      for her approach. And after an interminable time, as it seemed, came a
      faint footfall and the swish of skirts behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt as though his head was directed forward by a clutch of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lewisham,&rdquo; she said close to him, and he turned with a
      quality of movement that was almost convulsive. He raised his cap
      clumsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her extended hand by an afterthought, and held it until she
      withdrew it. &ldquo;I am so glad to have met you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Lewisham simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood facing one another for an expressive moment, and then by a
      movement she indicated her intention to walk along the avenue with him.
      &ldquo;I wanted so much,&rdquo; she said, looking down at her feet,
      &ldquo;to thank you for letting Teddy off, you know. That is why I wanted
      to see you.&rdquo; Lewisham took his first step beside her. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s
      odd, isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; she said, looking up into his face, &ldquo;that
      I should meet you here in just the same place. I believe ... Yes. The very
      same place we met before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham was tongue-tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you often come here?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he considered&mdash;and his voice was most
      unreasonably hoarse when he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;no. No.... That is&mdash;At
      least not often. Now and then. In fact, I like it rather for reading and
      that sort of thing. It&rsquo;s so quiet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you read a great deal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When one teaches one has to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather fond of reading, certainly. Are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>love</i> it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham was glad she loved reading. He would have been disappointed
      had she answered differently. But she spoke with real fervour. She <i>loved</i>
      reading! It was pleasant. She would understand him a little perhaps.
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not clever like
      some people are. And I have to read books as I get hold of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, &ldquo;for the matter of
      that.... Have you read ... Carlyle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was now fairly under way. They were walking side by side
      beneath the swaying boughs. Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s sensations were ecstatic,
      marred only by a dread of some casual boy coming upon them. She had not
      read <i>much</i> Carlyle. She had always wanted to, even from quite a
      little girl&mdash;she had heard so much about him. She knew he was a
      Really Great Writer, a <i>very</i> Great Writer indeed. All she <i>had</i>
      read of him she liked. She could say that. As much as she liked anything.
      And she had seen his house in Chelsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham, whose knowledge of London had been obtained by excursion trips
      on six or seven isolated days, was much impressed by this. It seemed to
      put her at once on a footing of intimacy with this imposing Personality.
      It had never occurred to him at all vividly that these Great Writers had
      real abiding places. She gave him a few descriptive touches that made the
      house suddenly real and distinctive to him. She lived quite near, she
      said, at least within walking distance, in Clapham. He instantly forgot
      the vague design of lending her his &ldquo;<i>Sartor Resartus</i>&rdquo;
      in his curiosity to learn more about her home. &ldquo;Clapham&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      almost in London, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; she said, but she volunteered no further information
      about her domestic circumstances, &ldquo;I like London,&rdquo; she
      generalised, &ldquo;and especially in winter.&rdquo; And she proceeded to
      praise London, its public libraries, its shops, the multitudes of people,
      the facilities for &ldquo;doing what you like,&rdquo; the concerts one
      could go to, the theatres. (It seemed she moved in fairly good society.)
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always something to see even if you only go out for a
      walk,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and down here there&rsquo;s nothing to read
      but idle novels. And those not new.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham had regretfully to admit the lack of such culture and mental
      activity in Whortley. It made him feel terribly her inferior. He had only
      his bookishness and his certificates to set against it all&mdash;and she
      had seen Carlyle&rsquo;s house! &ldquo;Down here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      nothing to talk about but scandal.&rdquo; It was too true.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner by the stile, beyond which the willows were splendid against
      the blue with silvery aments and golden pollen, they turned by mutual
      impulse and retraced their steps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve simply had no one to
      talk to down here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not what <i>I</i> call talking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Lewisham, making a resolute plunge, &ldquo;perhaps
      while you are staying at Whortley ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused perceptibly, and she, following his eyes, saw a voluminous black
      figure approaching. &ldquo;We may,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, resuming his
      remark, &ldquo;chance to meet again, perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been about to challenge her to a deliberate meeting. A certain
      delightful tangle of paths that followed the bank of the river had been in
      his mind. But the apparition of Mr. George Bonover, headmaster of the
      Whortley Proprietary School, chilled him amazingly. Dame Nature no doubt
      had arranged the meeting of our young couple, but about Bonover she seems
      to have been culpably careless. She now receded inimitably, and Mr.
      Lewisham, with the most unpleasant feelings, found himself face to face
      with a typical representative of a social organisation which objects very
      strongly <i>inter alia</i> to promiscuous conversation on the part of the
      young unmarried junior master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;chance to meet again, perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham,
      with a sudden lack of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so too,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause. Mr. Bonover&rsquo;s features, and particularly a bushy pair of
      black eyebrows, were now very near, those eyebrows already raised,
      apparently to express a refined astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Mr. Bonover approaching?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Prolonged pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he stop and accost them? At any rate this frightful silence must
      end. Mr. Lewisham sought in his mind for some remark wherewith to cover
      his employer&rsquo;s approach. He was surprised to find his mind a desert.
      He made a colossal effort. If they could only talk, if they could only
      seem at their ease! But this blank incapacity was eloquent of guilt. Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely day, though,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed with him. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Mr. Bonover passed, forehead tight reefed so to speak, and lips
      impressively compressed. Mr. Lewisham raised his mortar-board, and to his
      astonishment Mr. Bonover responded with a markedly formal salute&mdash;mock
      clerical hat sweeping circuitously&mdash;and the regard of a searching,
      disapproving eye, and so passed. Lewisham was overcome with astonishment
      at this improvement on the nod of their ordinary commerce. And so this
      terrible incident terminated for the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a momentary gust of indignation. After all, why should Bonover or
      anyone interfere with his talking to a girl if he chose? And for all he
      knew they might have been properly introduced. By young Frobisher, say.
      Nevertheless, Lewisham&rsquo;s spring-tide mood relapsed into winter. He
      was, he felt, singularly stupid for the rest of their conversation, and
      the delightful feeling of enterprise that had hitherto inspired and
      astonished him when talking to her had shrivelled beyond contempt. He was
      glad&mdash;positively glad&mdash;when things came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the park gates she held out her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have
      interrupted your reading,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, warming slightly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know when I&rsquo;ve enjoyed a conversation....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;a breach of etiquette, I am afraid, my speaking to
      you, but I did so want to thank you....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, secretly
      impressed by the etiquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; He stood hesitating by the lodge, and then turned
      back up the avenue in order not to be seen to follow her too closely up
      the West Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, still walking away from her, he remembered that he had not lent
      her a book as he had planned, nor made any arrangement ever to meet her
      again. She might leave Whortley anywhen for the amenities of Clapham. He
      stopped and stood irresolute. Should he run after her? Then he recalled
      Bonover&rsquo;s enigmatical expression of face. He decided that to pursue
      her would be altogether too conspicuous. Yet ... So he stood in inglorious
      hesitation, while the seconds passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached his lodging at last to find Mrs. Munday halfway through dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get them books of yours,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munday, who took a
      motherly interest in him, &ldquo;and you read and you read, and you take
      no account of time. And now you&rsquo;ll have to eat your dinner half
      cold, and no time for it to settle proper before you goes off to school.
      It&rsquo;s ruination to a stummik&mdash;such ways.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind my stomach, Mrs. Munday,&rdquo; said Lewisham,
      roused from a tangled and apparently gloomy meditation; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      <i>my</i> affair.&rdquo; Quite crossly he spoke for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have a good sensible actin&rsquo; stummik than a
      full head,&rdquo; said Mrs. Monday, &ldquo;any day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m different, you see,&rdquo; snapped Mr. Lewisham, and
      relapsed into silence and gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Hoity toity!&rdquo; said Mrs. Monday under her breath.)
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; HESITATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Bonover, having fully matured a Hint suitable for the occasion,
      dropped it in the afternoon, while Lewisham was superintending cricket
      practice. He made a few remarks about the prospects of the first eleven by
      way of introduction, and Lewisham agreed with him that Frobisher i. looked
      like shaping very well this season.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed and the headmaster hummed. &ldquo;By-the-bye,&rdquo; he
      said, as if making conversation and still watching the play; &ldquo;I, ah,&mdash;understood
      that you, ah&mdash;were a <i>stranger</i> to Whortley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made friends in the neighbourhood?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham was troubled with a cough, and his ears&mdash;those confounded
      ears&mdash;brightened, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, recovering, &ldquo;Oh
      yes. Yes, I have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Local people, I presume.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no. Not exactly.&rdquo; The brightness spread from Lewisham&rsquo;s
      ears over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you,&rdquo; said Bonover, &ldquo;talking to a young lady in
      the avenue. Her face was somehow quite familiar to me. Who <i>was</i> she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he say she was a friend of the Frobishers? In that case Bonover, in
      his insidious amiable way, might talk to the Frobisher parents and make
      things disagreeable for her. &ldquo;She was,&rdquo; said Lewisham,
      flushing deeply with the stress on his honesty and dropping his voice to a
      mumble, &ldquo;a ... a ... an old friend of my mother&rsquo;s. In fact, I
      met her once at Salisbury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salisbury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; said Lewisham, a little hastily, and repenting the
      lie even as it left his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well <i>hit</i>, Harris!&rdquo; shouted Bonover, and began to clap
      his hands. &ldquo;Well <i>hit</i>, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harris shapes very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Mr. Bonover. &ldquo;And&mdash;what was it? Ah! I
      was just remarking the odd resemblances there are in the world. There is a
      Miss Henderson&mdash;or Henson&mdash;stopping with the Frobishers&mdash;in
      the very same town, in fact, the very picture of your Miss ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; said Lewisham, meeting his eye and recovering the
      full crimson note of his first blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; said Bonover, regarding him pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; mumbled Lewisham, cursing his own stupidity and
      looking away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Very</i>&mdash;very odd,&rdquo; said Bonover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Bonover, turning towards the school-house,
      &ldquo;I hardly expected it of you, Mr. Lewisham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expected what, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Bonover feigned to be already out of earshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham. &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;<i>damn</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;a
      most objectionable expression and rare with him in those days. He had half
      a mind to follow the head-master and ask him if he doubted his word. It
      was only too evident what the answer would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a minute undecided, then turned on his heel and marched
      homeward with savage steps. His muscles quivered as he walked, and his
      face twitched. The tumult of his mind settled at last into angry
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound him!&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, arguing the matter out with
      the bedroom furniture. &ldquo;Why the <i>devil</i> can&rsquo;t he mind his
      own business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind your own business, sir!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Lewisham at the
      wash-hand stand. &ldquo;Confound you, sir, mind your own business!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wash-hand stand did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overrate your power, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, a little
      mollified. &ldquo;Understand me! I am my own master out of school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, for four days and some hours after Mr. Bonover&rsquo;s Hint,
      Mr. Lewisham so far observed its implications as to abandon open-air study
      and struggle with diminishing success to observe the spirit as well as the
      letter of his time-table prescriptions. For the most part he fretted at
      accumulating tasks, did them with slipshod energy or looked out of window.
      The Career constituent insisted that to meet and talk to this girl again
      meant reproof, worry, interference with his work for his matriculation,
      the destruction of all &ldquo;Discipline,&rdquo; and he saw the entire
      justice of the insistence. It was nonsense this being in love; there wasn&rsquo;t
      such a thing as love outside of trashy novelettes. And forthwith his mind
      went off at a tangent to her eyes under the shadow of her hat brim, and
      had to be lugged back by main force. On Thursday when he was returning
      from school he saw her far away down the street, and hurried in to avoid
      her, looking ostentatiously in the opposite direction. But that was a
      turning-point. Shame overtook him. On Friday his belief in love was warm
      and living again, and his heart full of remorse for laggard days.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday morning his preoccupation with her was so vivid that it
      distracted him even while he was teaching that most teachable subject,
      algebra, and by the end of the school hours the issue was decided and the
      Career in headlong rout. That afternoon he would go, whatever happened,
      and see her and speak to her again. The thought of Bonover arose only to
      be dismissed. And besides&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonover took a siesta early in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he would go out and find her and speak to her. Nothing should stop
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once that decision was taken his imagination became riotous with things he
      might say, attitudes he might strike, and a multitude of vague fine dreams
      about her. He would say this, he would say that, his mind would do nothing
      but circle round this wonderful pose of lover. What a cur he had been to
      hide from her so long! What could he have been thinking about? How <i>could</i>
      he explain it to her, when the meeting really came? Suppose he was very
      frank&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered the limits of frankness. Would she believe he had not seen
      her on Thursday?&mdash;if he assured her that it was so?
    </p>
    <p>
      And, most horrible, in the midst of all this came Bonover with a request
      that he would take &ldquo;duty&rdquo; in the cricket field instead of
      Dunkerley that afternoon. Dunkerley was the senior assistant master,
      Lewisham&rsquo;s sole colleague. The last vestige of disapprobation had
      vanished from Bonover&rsquo;s manner; asking a favour was his autocratic
      way of proffering the olive branch. But it came to Lewisham as a cruel
      imposition. For a fateful moment he trembled on the brink of acquiescence.
      In a flash came a vision of the long duty of the afternoon&mdash;she
      possibly packing for Clapham all the while. He turned white. Mr. Bonover
      watched his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No</i>,&rdquo; said Lewisham bluntly, saying all he was sure of,
      and forthwith racking his unpractised mind for an excuse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sorry I can&rsquo;t oblige you, but ... my arrangements ... I&rsquo;ve
      made arrangements, in fact, for the afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bonover&rsquo;s eyebrows went up at this obvious lie, and the glow of
      his suavity faded, &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mrs. Bonover
      expects a friend this afternoon, and we rather want Mr. Dunkerley to make
      four at croquet....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, still resolute, and
      making a mental note that Bonover would be playing croquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t play croquet by any chance?&rdquo; asked Bonover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Dunkerley had asked you?...&rdquo; persisted Bonover,
      knowing Lewisham&rsquo;s respect for etiquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it wasn&rsquo;t on that account,&rdquo; said Lewisham, and
      Bonover with eyebrows still raised and a general air of outraged
      astonishment left him standing there, white and stiff, and wondering at
      his extraordinary temerity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE SCANDALOUS RAMBLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as school was dismissed Lewisham made a gaol-delivery of his
      outstanding impositions, and hurried back to his lodgings, to spend the
      time until his dinner was ready&mdash;Well?... It seems hardly fair,
      perhaps, to Lewisham to tell this; it is doubtful, indeed, whether a male
      novelist&rsquo;s duty to his sex should not restrain him, but, as the wall
      in the shadow by the diamond-framed window insisted, &ldquo;<i>Magna est
      veritas et prevalebit</i>.&rdquo; Mr. Lewisham brushed his hair with
      elaboration, and ruffled it picturesquely, tried the effect of all his
      ties and selected a white one, dusted his boots with an old
      pocket-handkerchief, changed his trousers because the week-day pair was
      minutely frayed at the heels, and inked the elbows of his coat where the
      stitches were a little white. And, to be still more intimate, he studied
      his callow appearance in the glass from various points of view, and
      decided that his nose might have been a little smaller with advantage....
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly after dinner he went out, and by the shortest path to the
      allotment lane, telling himself he did not care if he met Bonover
      forthwith in the street. He did not know precisely what he intended to do,
      but he was quite clear that he meant to see the girl he had met in the
      avenue. He knew he should see her. A sense of obstacles merely braced him
      and was pleasurable. He went up the stone steps out of the lane to the
      stile that overlooked the Frobishers, the stile from which he had watched
      the Frobisher bedroom. There he seated himself with his arms, folded, in
      full view of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was at ten minutes to two. At twenty minutes to three he was still
      sitting there, but his hands were deep in his jacket pockets, and he was
      scowling and kicking his foot against the step with an impatient monotony.
      His needless glasses had been thrust into his waistcoat pocket&mdash;where
      they remained throughout the afternoon&mdash;and his cap was tilted a
      little back from his forehead and exposed a wisp of hair. One or two
      people had gone down the lane, and he had pretended not to see them, and a
      couple of hedge-sparrows chasing each other along the side of the sunlit,
      wind-rippled field had been his chief entertainment. It is unaccountable,
      no doubt, but he felt angry with her as the time crept on. His expression
      lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard someone going by in the lane behind him. He would not look round&mdash;it
      annoyed him to think of people seeing him in this position. His once
      eminent discretion, though overthrown, still made muffled protests at the
      afternoon&rsquo;s enterprise. The feet down the lane stopped close at
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stare away,&rdquo; said Lewisham between his teeth. And then began
      mysterious noises, a violent rustle of hedge twigs, a something like a
      very light foot-tapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity boarded Lewisham and carried him after the briefest struggle. He
      looked round, and there she was, her back to him, reaching after the spiky
      blossoming blackthorn that crested the opposite hedge. Remarkable
      accident! She had not seen him!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Lewisham&rsquo;s legs were flying over the stile. He went down
      the steps in the bank with such impetus that it carried him up into the
      prickly bushes beside her. &ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; he said, too excited to
      see she was not astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lewisham!&rdquo; she said in feigned surprise, and stood away
      to give him room at the blackthorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which spike will you have?&rdquo; he cried, overjoyed. &ldquo;The
      whitest? The highest? Any!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That piece,&rdquo; she chose haphazard, &ldquo;with the black spike
      sticking out from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A mass of snowy blossom it was against the April sky, and Lewisham,
      straggling for it&mdash;it was by no means the most accessible&mdash;saw
      with fantastic satisfaction a lengthy scratch flash white on his hand, and
      turn to red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Higher up the lane,&rdquo; he said, descending triumphant and
      breathless, &ldquo;there is blackthorn.... This cannot compare for a
      moment....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and looked at him as he stood there flushed, his eyes
      triumphant, with an unpremeditated approval. In church, in the gallery,
      with his face foreshortened, he had been effective in a way, but this was
      different. &ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; she said, though she knew this was the
      only place for blackthorn for a mile in either direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>knew</i> I should see you,&rdquo; he said, by way of answer,
      &ldquo;I felt sure I should see you to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was our last chance almost,&rdquo; she answered with as frank a
      quality of avowal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home to London on Monday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; he cried in triumph. &ldquo;To Clapham?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have got a situation. You did not know that I was a
      shorthand clerk and typewriter, did you? I am. I have just left the
      school, the Grogram School. And now there is an old gentleman who wants an
      amanuensis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you know shorthand?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That accounts for the
      stylographic pen. Those lines were written.... I have them still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham,
      tapping his breast-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lane,&rdquo; he said&mdash;their talk was curiously
      inconsecutive&mdash;&ldquo;some way along this lane, over the hill and
      down, there is a gate, and that goes&mdash;I mean, it opens into the path
      that runs along the river bank. Have you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best walk about Whortley. It brings you out upon
      Immering Common. You <i>must</i>&mdash;before you go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now</i>?&rdquo; she said with her eyes dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Mrs. Frobisher I should be back by four,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a walk not to be lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trees are all budding,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham, &ldquo;the
      rushes are shooting, and all along the edge of the river there are
      millions of little white flowers floating on the water, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t
      know the names of them, but they&rsquo;re fine.... May I carry that branch
      of blossom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he took it their hands touched momentarily ... and there came another
      of those significant gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at those clouds,&rdquo; said Lewisham abruptly, remembering
      the remark he had been about to make and waving the white froth of
      blackthorn, &ldquo;And look at the blue between them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly splendid. Of all the fine weather the best has
      been kept for now. My last day. My very last day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And off these two young people went together in a highly electrical state&mdash;to
      the infinite astonishment of Mrs. Frobisher, who was looking out of the
      attic window&mdash;stepping out manfully and finding the whole world lit
      and splendid for their entertainment. The things they discovered and told
      each other that afternoon down by the river!&mdash;that spring was
      wonderful, young leaves beautiful, bud scales astonishing things, and
      clouds dazzling and stately!&mdash;with an air of supreme originality! And
      their naove astonishment to find one another in agreement upon these novel
      delights! It seemed to them quite outside the play of accident that they
      should have met each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went by the path that runs among the trees along the river bank, and
      she must needs repent and wish to take the lower one, the towing path,
      before they had gone three hundred yards. So Lewisham had to find a place
      fit for her descent, where a friendly tree proffered its protruding roots
      as a convenient balustrade, and down she clambered with her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a water-vole washing his whiskers gave occasion for a sudden touching
      of hands and the intimate confidence of whispers and silence together.
      After which Lewisham essayed to gather her a marsh mallow at the peril, as
      it was judged, of his life, and gained it together with a bootful of
      water. And at the gate by the black and shiny lock, where the path breaks
      away from the river, she overcame him by an unexpected feat, climbing
      gleefully to the top rail with the support of his hand, and leaping down,
      a figure of light and grace, to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      They struck boldly across the meadows, which were gay with lady&rsquo;s
      smock, and he walked, by special request, between her and three matronly
      cows&mdash;feeling as Perseus might have done when he fended off the
      sea-monster. And so by the mill, and up a steep path to Immering Common.
      Across the meadows Lewisham had broached the subject of her occupation.
      &ldquo;And are you really going away from here to be an amanuensis?&rdquo;
      he said, and started her upon the theme of herself, a theme she treated
      with a specialist&rsquo;s enthusiasm. They dealt with it by the
      comparative methods and neither noticed the light was out of the sky until
      the soft feet of the advancing shower had stolen right upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yonder! A shed,&rdquo; and they ran
      together. She ran laughing, and yet swiftly and lightly. He pulled her
      through the hedge by both hands, and released her skirt from an amorous
      bramble, and so they came into a little black shed in which a rusty harrow
      of gigantic proportions sheltered. He noted how she still kept her breath
      after that run.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the harrow and hesitated. &ldquo;I <i>must</i> take off my
      hat,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that rain will spot it,&rdquo; and so he had
      a chance of admiring the sincerity of her curls&mdash;not that he had ever
      doubted them. She stooped over her hat, pocket-handkerchief in hand,
      daintily wiping off the silvery drops. He stood up at the opening of the
      shed and looked at the country outside through the veil of the soft
      vehemence of the April shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s room for two on this harrow,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made inarticulate sounds of refusal, and then came and sat down beside
      her, close beside her, so that he was almost touching her. He felt a
      fantastic desire to take her in his arms and kiss her, and overcame the
      madness by an effort. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know your name,&rdquo; he
      said, taking refuge from his whirling thoughts in conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henderson,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Miss</i> Henderson?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled in his face&mdash;hesitated. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;<i>Miss</i>
      Henderson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, her atmosphere were wonderful. He had never felt quite the same
      sensation before, a strange excitement, almost like a faint echo of tears.
      He was for demanding her Christian name. For calling her &ldquo;dear&rdquo;
      and seeing what she would say. He plunged headlong into a rambling
      description of Bonover and how he had told a lie about her and called her
      Miss Smith, and so escaped this unaccountable emotional crisis....
    </p>
    <p>
      The whispering of the rain about them sank and died, and the sunlight
      struck vividly across the distant woods beyond Immering. Just then they
      had fallen on a silence again that was full of daring thoughts for Mr.
      Lewisham. He moved his arm suddenly and placed it so that it was behind
      her on the frame of the harrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on now,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;The rain has
      stopped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little path goes straight to Immering,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, four o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew out his watch, and his eyebrows went up. It was already nearly a
      quarter past four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it past four?&rdquo; she asked, and abruptly they were face to
      face with parting. That Lewisham had to take &ldquo;duty&rdquo; at
      half-past five seemed a thing utterly trivial. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he
      said, only slowly realising what this parting meant. &ldquo;But must you?
      I&mdash;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been talking to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that. Besides&mdash;no.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood looking at him. &ldquo;I promised to be home by four,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Mrs. Frobisher has tea....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may never have a chance to see one another again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham suddenly turned very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me,&rdquo; he said, breaking a tense silence and
      with a sudden stress in his voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me. Stop with
      me yet&mdash;for a little while.... You ... You can lose your way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to think,&rdquo; she said, forcing a laugh, &ldquo;that I
      live without eating and drinking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wanted to talk to you so much. The first time I saw you....
      At first I dared not.... I did not know you would let me talk.... And now,
      just as I am&mdash;happy, you are going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped abruptly. Her eyes were downcast. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said,
      tracing a curve with the point of her shoe. &ldquo;No. I am not going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham restrained an impulse to shout. &ldquo;You will come to Immering?&rdquo;
      he cried, and as they went along the narrow path through the wet grass, he
      began to tell her with simple frankness how he cared for her company,
      &ldquo;I would not change this,&rdquo; he said, casting about for an offer
      to reject, &ldquo;for&mdash;anything in the world.... I shall not be back
      for duty. I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t care what happens so long as
      we have this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for coming,&rdquo; he said in an outburst of gratitude.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      thank you for coming,&rdquo; and held out his hand. She took it and
      pressed it, and so they went on hand in hand until the village street was
      reached. Their high resolve to play truant at all costs had begotten a
      wonderful sense of fellowship. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t call you Miss
      Henderson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t. You know ... I
      must have your Christian name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; he said and looked at her, gathering courage as he
      did so. &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;It is a pretty name. But
      no name is quite pretty enough for you, Ethel ... <i>dear</i>.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      The little shop in Immering lay back behind a garden full of wallflowers,
      and was kept by a very fat and very cheerful little woman, who insisted on
      regarding them as brother and sister, and calling them both &ldquo;dearie.&rdquo;
      These points conceded she gave them an admirable tea of astonishing
      cheapness. Lewisham did not like the second condition very much, because
      it seemed to touch a little on his latest enterprise. But the tea and the
      bread and butter and the whort jam were like no food on earth. There were
      wallflowers, heavy scented, in a jug upon the table, and Ethel admired
      them, and when they set out again the little old lady insisted on her
      taking a bunch with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after they left Immering that this ramble, properly speaking,
      became scandalous. The sun was already a golden ball above the blue hills
      in the west&mdash;it turned our two young people into little figures of
      flame&mdash;and yet, instead of going homeward, they took the Wentworth
      road that plunges into the Forshaw woods. Behind them the moon, almost
      full, hung in the blue sky above the tree-tops, ghostly and indistinct,
      and slowly gathered to itself such light as the setting sun left for it in
      the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going out of Immering they began to talk of the future. And for the very
      young lover there is no future but the immediate future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must write to me,&rdquo; he said, and she told him she wrote
      such <i>silly</i> letters. &ldquo;But I shall have reams to write to you,&rdquo;
      he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you to write to me?&rdquo; she asked, and they discussed a
      new obstacle between them. It would never do to write home&mdash;never.
      She was sure of that with an absolute assurance. &ldquo;My mother&mdash;&rdquo;
      she said and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      That prohibition cut him, for at that time he had the makings of a
      voluminous letter-writer. Yet it was only what one might expect. The whole
      world was unpropitious&mdash;obdurate indeed.... A splendid isolation <i>`
      deux</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she might find some place where letters might be sent to her? Yet
      that seemed to her deceitful.
    </p>
    <p>
      So these two young people wandered on, full of their discovery of love,
      and yet so full too of the shyness of adolescence that the word &ldquo;Love&rdquo;
      never passed their lips that day. Yet as they talked on, and the kindly
      dusk gathered about them, their speech and their hearts came very close
      together. But their speech would seem so threadbare, written down in cold
      blood, that I must not put it here. To them it was not threadbare.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last they came down the long road into Whortley, the silent trees
      were black as ink and the moonlight made her face pallid and wonderful,
      and her eyes shone like stars. She still carried the blackthorn from which
      most of the blossoms had fallen. The fragrant wallflowers were fragrant
      still. And far away, softened by the distance, the Whortley band,
      performing publicly outside the vicarage for the first time that year, was
      playing with unctuous slowness a sentimental air. I don&rsquo;t know if
      the reader remembers it that, favourite melody of the early eighties:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Sweet dreamland faces, passing to and fro, (pum, pum)
    Bring back to Mem&rsquo;ry days of long ago-o-o-oh,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      was the essence of it, very slow and tender and with an accompaniment of
      pum, pum. Pathetically cheerful that pum, pum, hopelessly cheerful indeed
      against the dirge of the air, a dirge accentuated by sporadic
      vocalisation. But to young people things come differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>love</i> music,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came on down the steepness of West Street. They walked athwart the
      metallic and leathery tumult of sound into the light cast by the little
      circle of yellow lamps. Several people saw them and wondered what the boys
      and girls were coming to nowadays, and one eye-witness even subsequently
      described their carriage as &ldquo;brazen.&rdquo; Mr. Lewisham was wearing
      his mortarboard cap of office&mdash;there was no mistaking him. They
      passed the Proprietary School and saw a yellow picture framed and glazed,
      of Mr. Bonover taking duty for his aberrant assistant master. And outside
      the Frobisher house at last they parted perforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said for the third time. &ldquo;Good-bye,
      Ethel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. Then suddenly she darted towards him. He felt her hands
      upon his shoulders, her lips soft and warm upon his cheek, and before he
      could take hold of her she had eluded him, and had flitted into the shadow
      of the house. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; came her sweet, clear voice out of
      the shadow, and while he yet hesitated an answer, the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her, black in the doorway, heard some indistinct words, and then
      the door closed and he was alone in the moonlight, his cheek still glowing
      from her lips....
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s first day with Love.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE RECKONING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And after the day of Love came the days of Reckoning. Mr. Lewisham was
      astonished&mdash;overwhelmed almost&mdash;by that Reckoning, as it slowly
      and steadily unfolded itself. The wonderful emotions of Saturday carried
      him through Sunday, and he made it up with the neglected Schema by
      assuring it that She was his Inspiration, and that he would work for Her a
      thousand times better than he could possibly work for himself. That was
      certainly not true, and indeed he found himself wondering whither the
      interest had vanished out of his theological examination of Butler&rsquo;s
      Analogy. The Frobishers were not at church for either service. He
      speculated rather anxiously why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday dawned coldly and clearly&mdash;a Herbert Spencer of a day&mdash;and
      he went to school sedulously assuring himself there was nothing to
      apprehend. Day boys were whispering in the morning apparently about him,
      and Frobisher ii. was in great request. Lewisham overheard a fragment
      &ldquo;My mother <i>was</i> in a wax,&rdquo; said Frobisher ii.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve came an interview with Bonover, and voices presently rising in
      angry altercation and audible to Senior-assistant Dunkerley through the
      closed study door. Then Lewisham walked across the schoolroom, staring
      straight before him, his cheeks very bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereby Dunkerley&rsquo;s mind was prepared for the news that came the
      next morning over the exercise books. &ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Dunkerley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;End of next term,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this girl that&rsquo;s been staying at the Frobishers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pretty bit of goods. But it will mess up your matric
      next June,&rdquo; said Dunkerley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m sorry for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s scarcely to be expected he&rsquo;ll give you leave to
      attend the exam....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lewisham shortly, and opened his first
      exercise book. He found it difficult to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a greaser,&rdquo; said Dunkerley. &ldquo;But there!&mdash;what
      can you expect from Durham?&rdquo; For Bonover had only a Durham degree,
      and Dunkerley, having none, inclined to be particular. Therewith Dunkerley
      lapsed into a sympathetic and busy rustling over his own pile of
      exercises. It was not until the heap had been reduced to a book or so that
      he spoke again&mdash;an elaborate point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Male and female created He them,&rdquo; said Dunkerley, ticking his
      way down the page. &ldquo;Which (tick, tick) was damned hard (tick, tick)
      on assistant masters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the book with a snap and flung it on the floor behind him.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I <i>did</i> think I
      should be first to get out of this scandalising hole. You&rsquo;re lucky.
      It&rsquo;s always acting down here. Running on parents and guardians round
      every corner. That&rsquo;s what I object to in life in the country: it&rsquo;s
      so confoundedly artificial. <i>I</i> shall take jolly good care <i>I</i>
      get out of it just as soon as ever I can. You bet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And work those patents?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather, my boy. Yes. Work those patents. The Patent Square Top
      Bottle! Lord! Once let me get to London....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think <i>I</i> shall have a shot at London,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the experienced Dunkerley, being one of the kindest young men
      alive, forgot certain private ambitions of his own&mdash;he cherished
      dreams of amazing patents&mdash;and bethought him of agents. He proceeded
      to give a list of these necessary helpers of the assistant master at the
      gangway&mdash;Orellana, Gabbitas, The Lancaster Gate Agency, and the rest
      of them. He knew them all&mdash;intimately. He had been a &ldquo;nix&rdquo;
      eight years. &ldquo;Of course that Kensington thing may come off,&rdquo;
      said Dunkerley, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s best not to wait. I tell you frankly&mdash;the
      chances are against you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Kensington thing&rdquo; was an application for admission to the
      Normal School of Science at South Kensington, which Lewisham had made in a
      sanguine moment. There being an inadequate supply of qualified science
      teachers in England, the Science and Art Department is wont to offer free
      instruction at its great central school and a guinea a week to select
      young pedagogues who will bind themselves to teach science after their
      training is over. Dunkerley had been in the habit of applying for several
      years, always in vain, and Lewisham had seen no harm in following his
      example. But then Dunkerley had no green-grey certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Lewisham spent all that &ldquo;duty&rdquo; left him of the next day
      composing a letter to copy out and send the several scholastic agencies.
      In this he gave a brief but appreciative sketch of his life, and enlarged
      upon his discipline and educational methods. At the end was a long and
      decorative schedule of his certificates and distinctions, beginning with a
      good-conduct prize at the age of eight. A considerable amount of time was
      required to recopy this document, but his modesty upheld him. After a
      careful consideration of the time-table, he set aside the midday hour for
      &ldquo;Correspondence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that his work in mathematics and classics was already some time
      in arrears, and a &ldquo;test&rdquo; he had sent to his correspondence
      Tutor during those troublous days after the meeting with Bonover in the
      Avenue, came back blottesquely indorsed: &ldquo;Below Pass Standard.&rdquo;
      This last experience was so unprecedented and annoyed him so much that for
      a space he contemplated retorting with a sarcastic letter to the tutor.
      And then came the Easter recess, and he had to go home and tell his
      mother, with a careful suppression of details, that he was leaving
      Whortley, &ldquo;Where you have been getting on so well!&rdquo; cried his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that dear old lady had one consolation. She observed he had given up
      his glasses&mdash;he had forgotten to bring them with him&mdash;and her
      secret fear of grave optical troubles&mdash;that were being &ldquo;kept&rdquo;
      from her&mdash;-was alleviated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he had moods of intense regret for the folly of that walk. One
      such came after the holidays, when the necessity of revising the dates of
      the Schema brought before his mind, for the first time quite clearly, the
      practical issue of this first struggle with all those mysterious and
      powerful influences the spring-time sets a-stirring. His dream of success
      and fame had been very real and dear to him, and the realisation of the
      inevitable postponement of his long anticipated matriculation, the doorway
      to all the other great things, took him abruptly like an actual physical
      sensation in his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up, pen in hand, in the midst of his corrections, and began
      pacing up and down the room. &ldquo;What a fool I have been!&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;What a fool I have been!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung the pen on the floor and made a rush at an ill-drawn attempt upon
      a girl&rsquo;s face that adorned the end of his room, the visible witness
      of his slavery. He tore this down and sent the fragments of it
      scattering....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief&mdash;a definite abandonment. He stared for a moment at
      the destruction he had made, and then went back to the revision of the
      time-table, with a mutter about &ldquo;silly spooning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was one mood. The rarer one. He watched the posts with far more
      eagerness for the address to which he might write to her than for any
      reply to those reiterated letters of application, the writing of which now
      ousted Horace and the higher mathematics (Lewisham&rsquo;s term for
      conics) from his attention. Indeed he spent more time meditating the
      letter to her than even the schedule of his virtues had required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the letters of application were wonderful compositions; each had a new
      pen to itself and was for the first page at least in a handwriting far
      above even his usual high standard. And day after day passed and that
      particular letter he hoped for still did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      His moods were complicated by the fact that, in spite of his studied
      reticence on the subject, the reason of his departure did in an amazingly
      short time get &ldquo;all over Whortley.&rdquo; It was understood that he
      had been discovered to be &ldquo;fast,&rdquo; and Ethel&rsquo;s behaviour
      was animadverted upon with complacent Indignation&mdash;if the phrase may
      be allowed&mdash;by the ladies of the place. Pretty looks were too often a
      snare. One boy&mdash;his ear was warmed therefor&mdash;once called aloud
      &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; as Lewisham went by. The curate, a curate of the
      pale-faced, large-knuckled, nervous sort, now passed him without
      acknowledgment of his existence. Mrs. Bonover took occasion to tell him
      that he was a &ldquo;mere boy,&rdquo; and once Mrs. Frobisher sniffed
      quite threateningly at him when she passed him in the street. She did it
      so suddenly she made him jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      This general disapproval inclined him at times to depression, but in
      certain moods he found it exhilarating, and several times he professed
      himself to Dunkerley not a little of a blade. In others, he told himself
      he bore it for <i>her</i> sake. Anyhow he had to bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to find out, too, how little the world feels the need of a young
      man of nineteen&mdash;he called himself nineteen, though he had several
      months of eighteen still to run&mdash;even though he adds prizes for good
      conduct, general improvement, and arithmetic, and advanced certificates
      signed by a distinguished engineer and headed with the Royal Arms,
      guaranteeing his knowledge of geometrical drawing, nautical astronomy,
      animal physiology, physiography, inorganic chemistry, and building
      construction, to his youth and strength and energy. At first he had
      imagined headmasters clutching at the chance of him, and presently he
      found himself clutching eagerly at them. He began to put a certain urgency
      into his applications for vacant posts, an urgency that helped him not at
      all. The applications grew longer and longer until they ran to four sheets
      of note-paper&mdash;a pennyworth in fact. &ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo;
      he would write, &ldquo;that you will find me a loyal and devoted
      assistant.&rdquo; Much in that strain. Dunkerley pointed out that Bonover&rsquo;s
      testimonial ignored the question of moral character and discipline in a
      marked manner, and Bonover refused to alter it. He was willing to do what
      he could to help Lewisham, in spite of the way he had been treated, but
      unfortunately his conscience....
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice Lewisham misquoted the testimonial&mdash;to no purpose. And
      May was halfway through, and South Kensington was silent. The future was
      grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the depths of his doubt and disappointment came her letter. It was
      typewritten on thin paper. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she wrote simply, and it
      seemed to him the most sweet and wonderful of all possible modes of
      address, though as a matter of fact it was because she had forgotten his
      Christian name and afterwards forgotten the blank she had left for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, I could not write before because I have no room at home now
      where I can write a letter, and Mrs. Frobisher told my mother falsehoods
      about you. My mother has surprised me dreadfully&mdash;I did not think it
      of her. She told me nothing. But of that I must tell you in another
      letter. I am too angry to write about it now. Even now you cannot write
      back, for <i>you must not send letters here</i>. It would <i>never</i> do.
      But I think of you, dear,&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;dear&rdquo; had been
      erased and rewritten&mdash;&ldquo;and I must write and tell you so, and of
      that nice walk we had, if I never write again. I am very busy now. My work
      is rather difficult and I am afraid I am a little stupid. It is hard to be
      interested in anything just because that is how you have to live, is it
      not? I daresay you sometimes feel the same of school. But I suppose
      everybody is doing things they don&rsquo;t like. I don&rsquo;t know when I
      shall come to Whortley again, if ever, but very likely you will be coming
      to London. Mrs. Frobisher said the most horrid things. It would be nice If
      you could come to London, because then perhaps you might see me. There is
      a big boys&rsquo; school at Chelsea, and when I go by it every morning I
      wish you were there. Then you would come out in your cap and gown as I
      went by. Suppose some day I was to see you there suddenly!!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it ran, with singularly little information in it, and ended quite
      abruptly, &ldquo;Good-bye, dear. Good-bye, dear,&rdquo; scribbled in
      pencil. And then, &ldquo;Think of me sometimes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading it, and especially that opening &ldquo;dear,&rdquo; made Lewisham
      feel the strangest sensation in his throat and chest, almost as though he
      was going to cry. So he laughed instead and read it again, and went to and
      fro in his little room with his eyes bright and that precious writing held
      in his hand. That &ldquo;dear&rdquo; was just as if she had spoken&mdash;a
      voice suddenly heard. He thought of her farewell, clear and sweet, out of
      the shadow of the moonlit house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why that &ldquo;If I never write again,&rdquo; and that abrupt ending?
      Of course he would think of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her only letter. In a little time its creases were worn through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in June came a loneliness that suddenly changed into almost
      intolerable longing to see her. He had vague dreams of going to London, to
      Clapham to find her. But you do not find people in Clapham as you do in
      Whortley. He spent an afternoon writing and re-writing a lengthy letter,
      against the day when her address should come. If it was to come. He
      prowled about the village disconsolately, and at last set off about seven
      and retraced by moonlight almost every step of that one memorable walk of
      theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the blackness of the shed he worked himself up to the pitch of talking
      as if she were present. And he said some fine brave things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the little old lady of the wallflowers with a candle in her
      window, and drank a bottle of ginger beer with a sacramental air. The
      little old lady asked him, a trifle archly, after his sister, and he
      promised to bring her again some day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly bring
      her,&rdquo; he said. Talking to the little old lady somehow blunted his
      sense of desolation. And then home through the white indistinctness in a
      state of melancholy that became at last so fine as to be almost
      pleasurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after that mood a new &ldquo;text&rdquo; attracted and perplexed
      Mrs. Munday, an inscription at once mysterious and familiar, and this
      inscription was:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mizpah.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in Old English lettering and evidently very carefully executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where had she seen it before?
    </p>
    <p>
      It quite dominated all the rest of the room at first, it flaunted like a
      flag of triumph over &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; and the time-table and the
      Schema. Once indeed it was taken down, but the day after it reappeared.
      Later a list of scholastic vacancies partially obscured it, and some
      pencil memoranda were written on the margin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when at last the time came for him to pack up and leave Whortley, he
      took it down and used it with several other suitable papers&mdash;the
      Schema and the time-table were its next-door neighbours&mdash;to line the
      bottom of the yellow box in which he packed his books: chiefly books for
      that matriculation that had now to be postponed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE CAREER PREVAILS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is an interval of two years and a half and the story resumes with a
      much maturer Mr. Lewisham, indeed no longer a youth, but a man, a legal
      man, at any rate, of one-and-twenty years. Its scene is no longer little
      Whortley embedded among its trees, ruddy banks, parks and common land, but
      the grey spaciousness of West London.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it does not resume with Ethel at all. For that promised second letter
      never reached him, and though he spent many an afternoon during his first
      few months in London wandering about Clapham, that arid waste of people,
      the meeting that he longed for never came. Until at last, after the manner
      of youth, so gloriously recuperative in body, heart, and soul, he began to
      forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quest of a &ldquo;crib&rdquo; had ended in the unexpected fruition of
      Dunkerley&rsquo;s blue paper. The green-blue certificates had, it seemed,
      a value beyond mural decoration, and when Lewisham was already despairing
      of any employment for the rest of his life, came a marvellous blue
      document from the Education Department promising inconceivable things. He
      was to go to London and be paid a guinea a week for listening to lectures&mdash;lectures
      beyond his most ambitious dreams! Among the names that swam before his
      eyes was Huxley&mdash;Huxley and then Lockyer! What a chance to get! Is it
      any wonder that for three memorable years the Career prevailed with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      You figure him on his way to the Normal School of Science at the opening
      of his third year of study there. (They call the place the Royal College
      of Science in these latter days.) He carried in his right hand a shiny
      black bag, well stuffed with text-books, notes, and apparatus for the
      forthcoming session; and in his left was a book that the bag had no place
      for, a book with gilt edges, and its binding very carefully protected by a
      brown paper cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lapse of time had asserted itself upon his upper lip in an
      inaggressive but indisputable moustache, in an added inch or so of
      stature, and in his less conscious carriage. For he no longer felt that
      universal attention he believed in at eighteen; it was beginning to dawn
      on him indeed that quite a number of people were entirely indifferent to
      the fact of his existence. But if less conscious, his carriage was
      decidedly more confident&mdash;as of one with whom the world goes well.
    </p>
    <p>
      His costume was&mdash;with one exception&mdash;a tempered black,&mdash;mourning
      put to hard uses and &ldquo;cutting up rusty.&rdquo; The mourning was for
      his mother, who had died more than a year before the date when this story
      resumes, and had left him property that capitalized at nearly a hundred
      pounds, a sum which Lewisham hoarded jealously in the Savings Bank, paying
      only for such essentials as university fees, and the books and instruments
      his brilliant career as a student demanded. For he was having a brilliant
      career, after all, in spite of the Whortley check, licking up paper
      certificates indeed like a devouring flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Surveying him, Madam, your eye would inevitably have fallen to his collar&mdash;curiously
      shiny, a surface like wet gum. Although it has practically nothing to do
      with this story, I must, I know, dispose of that before I go on, or you
      will be inattentive. London has its mysteries, but this strange gloss on
      his linen! &ldquo;Cheap laundresses always make your things blue,&rdquo;
      protests the lady. &ldquo;It ought to have been blue-stained, generously
      frayed, and loose about the button, fretting his neck. But this gloss ...&rdquo;
      You would have looked nearer, and finally you would have touched&mdash;a
      charnel-house surface, dank and cool! You see, Madam, the collar was a
      patent waterproof one. One of those you wash over night with a
      tooth-brush, and hang on the back of your chair to dry, and there you have
      it next morning rejuvenesced. It was the only collar he had in the world,
      it saved threepence a week at least, and that, to a South Kensington
      &ldquo;science teacher in training,&rdquo; living on the guinea a week
      allowed by a parental but parsimonious government, is a sum to consider.
      It had come to Lewisham as a great discovery. He had seen it first in a
      shop window full of indiarubber goods, and it lay at the bottom of a glass
      bowl in which goldfish drifted discontentedly to and fro. And he told
      himself that he rather liked that gloss.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But the wearing of a bright red tie would have been unexpected&mdash;a
      bright red tie after the fashion of a South-Western railway guard&rsquo;s!
      The rest of him by no means dandiacal, even the vanity of glasses long
      since abandoned. You would have reflected.... Where had you seen a crowd&mdash;red
      ties abundant and in some way significant? The truth has to be told. Mr.
      Lewisham had become a Socialist!
    </p>
    <p>
      That red tie was indeed but one outward and visible sign of much inward
      and spiritual development. Lewisham, in spite of the demands of a studious
      career, had read his Butler&rsquo;s Analogy through by this time, and some
      other books; he had argued, had had doubts, and called upon God for
      &ldquo;Faith&rdquo; in the silence of the night&mdash;&ldquo;Faith&rdquo;
      to be delivered immediately if Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s patronage was valued,
      and which nevertheless was not so delivered.... And his conception of his
      destiny in this world was no longer an avenue of examinations to a remote
      Bar and political eminence &ldquo;in the Liberal interest (D.V.).&rdquo;
      He had begun to realise certain aspects of our social order that Whortley
      did not demonstrate, begun to feel something of the dull stress deepening
      to absolute wretchedness and pain, which is the colour of so much human
      life in modern London. One vivid contrast hung in his mind symbolical. On
      the one hand were the coalies of the Westbourne Park yards, on strike and
      gaunt and hungry, children begging in the black slush, and starving
      loungers outside a soup kitchen; and on the other, Westbourne Grove, two
      streets further, a blazing array of crowded shops, a stirring traffic of
      cabs and carriages, and such a spate of spending that a tired student in
      leaky boots and graceless clothes hurrying home was continually impeded in
      the whirl of skirts and parcels and sweetly pretty womanliness. No doubt
      the tired student&rsquo;s own inglorious sensations pointed the moral. But
      that was only one of a perpetually recurring series of vivid
      approximations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham had a strong persuasion, an instinct it may be, that human beings
      should not be happy while others near them were wretched, and this gay
      glitter of prosperity had touched him with a sense of crime. He still
      believed people were responsible for their own lives; in those days he had
      still to gauge the possibilities of moral stupidity in himself and his
      fellow-men. He happened upon &ldquo;Progress and Poverty&rdquo; just then,
      and some casual numbers of the &ldquo;Commonweal,&rdquo; and it was only
      too easy to accept the theory of cunning plotting capitalists and
      landowners, and faultless, righteous, martyr workers. He became a
      Socialist forthwith. The necessity to do something at once to manifest the
      new faith that was in him was naturally urgent. So he went out and
      (historical moment) bought that red tie!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood colour, please,&rdquo; said Lewisham meekly to the young lady
      at the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i> colour?&rdquo; said the young lady at the counter,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bright scarlet, please,&rdquo; said Lewisham, blushing. And he
      spent the best part of the evening and much of his temper in finding out
      how to tie this into a neat bow. It was a plunge into novel handicraft&mdash;for
      previously he had been accustomed to made-up ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that Lewisham proclaimed the Social Revolution. The first time
      that symbol went abroad a string of stalwart policemen were walking in
      single file along the Brompton Road. In the opposite direction marched
      Lewisham. He began to hum. He passed the policemen with a significant eye
      and humming the <i>Marseillaise</i>....
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was months ago, and by this time the red tie was a thing of use
      and wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned out of the Exhibition Road through a gateway of wrought iron,
      and entered the hall of the Normal School. The hall was crowded with
      students carrying books, bags, and boxes of instruments, students standing
      and chattering, students reading the framed and glazed notices of the
      Debating Society, students buying note-books, pencils, rubber, or drawing
      pins from the privileged stationer. There was a strong representation of
      new hands, the paying students, youths and young men in black coats and
      silk hats or tweed suits, the scholar contingent, youngsters of Lewisham&rsquo;s
      class, raw, shabby, discordant, grotesquely ill-dressed and awe-stricken;
      one Lewisham noticed with a sailor&rsquo;s peaked cap gold-decorated, and
      one with mittens and very genteel grey kid gloves; and Grummett the
      perennial Official of the Books was busy among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Der Zozalist!&rdquo; said a wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham pretended not to hear and blushed vividly. He often wished he did
      not blush quite so much, seeing he was a man of one-and-twenty. He looked
      studiously away from the Debating Society notice-board, whereon &ldquo;G.E.
      Lewisham on Socialism&rdquo; was announced for the next Friday, and
      struggled through the hall to where the Book awaited his signature.
      Presently he was hailed by name, and then again. He could not get to the
      Book for a minute or so, because of the hand-shaking and clumsy friendly
      jests of his fellow-&ldquo;men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pointed out to a raw hand, by the raw hand&rsquo;s experienced
      fellow-townsman, as &ldquo;that beast Lewisham&mdash;awful swat. He was
      second last year on the year&rsquo;s work. Frightful mugger. But all these
      swats have a touch of the beastly prig. Exams&mdash;Debating Society&mdash;more
      Exams. Don&rsquo;t seem to have ever heard of being alive. Never goes near
      a Music Hall from one year&rsquo;s end to the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham heard a shrill whistle, made a run for the lift and caught it
      just on the point of departure. The lift was unlit and full of black
      shadows; only the sapper who conducted it was distinct. As Lewisham peered
      doubtfully at the dim faces near him, a girl&rsquo;s voice addressed him
      by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Miss Heydinger?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      see, I hope you have had a pleasant vacation.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; ALICE HEYDINGER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When he arrived at the top of the building he stood aside for the only
      remaining passenger to step out before him. It was the Miss Heydinger who
      had addressed him, the owner of that gilt-edged book in the cover of brown
      paper. No one else had come all the way up from the ground floor. The rest
      of the load in the lift had emerged at the &ldquo;astronomical&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;chemical&rdquo; floors, but these two had both chosen &ldquo;zoology&rdquo;
      for their third year of study, and zoology lived in the attics. She
      stepped into the light, with a rare touch of colour springing to her
      cheeks in spite of herself. Lewisham perceived an alteration in her dress.
      Perhaps she was looking for and noticed the transitory surprise in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous session&mdash;their friendship was now nearly a year old&mdash;it
      had never once dawned upon him that she could possibly be pretty. The
      chief thing he had been able to recall with any definiteness during the
      vacation was, that her hair was not always tidy, and that even when it
      chanced to be so, she was nervous about it; she distrusted it. He
      remembered her gesture while she talked, a patting exploration that verged
      on the exasperating. From that he went on to remember that its colour was,
      on the whole, fair, a light brown. But he had forgotten her mouth, he had
      failed to name the colour of her eyes. She wore glasses, it is true. And
      her dress was indefinite in his memory&mdash;an amorphous dinginess.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he had seen a good deal of her. They were not in the same course,
      but he had made her acquaintance on the committee of the school Debating
      Society. Lewisham was just then discovering Socialism. That had afforded a
      basis of conversation&mdash;an incentive to intercourse. She seemed to
      find something rarely interesting in his peculiar view of things, and, as
      chance would have it, he met her accidentally quite a number of times, in
      the corridors of the schools, in the big Education Library, and in the Art
      Museum. After a time those meetings appear to have been no longer
      accidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham for the first time in his life began to fancy he had
      conversational powers. She resolved to stir up his ambitions&mdash;an easy
      task. She thought he had exceptional gifts and that she might serve to
      direct them; she certainly developed his vanity. She had matriculated at
      the London University and they took the Intermediate Examination in
      Science together in July&mdash;she a little unwisely&mdash;which served,
      as almost anything will serve in such cases, as a further link between
      them. She failed, which in no way diminished Lewisham&rsquo;s regard for
      her. On the examination days they discoursed about Friendship in general,
      and things like that, down the Burlington Arcade during the lunch time&mdash;Burlington
      Arcade undisguisedly amused by her learned dinginess and his red tie&mdash;and
      among other things that were said she reproached him for not reading
      poetry. When they parted in Piccadilly, after the examination, they agreed
      to write, about poetry and themselves, during the holidays, and then she
      lent him, with a touch of hesitation, Rossetti&rsquo;s poems. He began to
      forget what had at first been very evident to him, that she was two or
      three years older than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham spent the vacation with an unsympathetic but kindly uncle who was
      a plumber and builder. His uncle had a family of six, the eldest eleven,
      and Lewisham made himself agreeable and instructive. Moreover he worked
      hard for the culminating third year of his studies (in which he had
      decided to do great things), and he learnt to ride the Ordinary Bicycle.
      He also thought about Miss Heydinger, and she, it would seem, thought
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He argued on social questions with his uncle, who was a prominent local
      Conservative. His uncle&rsquo;s controversial methods were coarse in the
      extreme. Socialists, he said, were thieves. The object of Socialism was to
      take away what a man earned and give it to &ldquo;a lot of lazy
      scoundrels.&rdquo; Also rich people were necessary. &ldquo;If there weren&rsquo;t
      well-off people, how d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;d get a livin&rsquo;? Hey?
      And where&rsquo;d <i>you</i> be then?&rdquo; Socialism, his uncle assured
      him, was &ldquo;got up&rdquo; by agitators. &ldquo;They get money out of
      young Gabies like you, and they spend it in champagne.&rdquo; And
      thereafter he met Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s arguments with the word &ldquo;Champagne&rdquo;
      uttered in an irritating voice, followed by a luscious pantomime of
      drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally Lewisham felt a little lonely, and perhaps he laid stress upon
      it in his letters to Miss Heydinger. It came to light that she felt rather
      lonely too. They discussed the question of True as distinguished from
      Ordinary Friendship, and from that they passed to Goethe and Elective
      Affinities. He told her how he looked for her letters, and they became
      more frequent. Her letters were Indisputably well written. Had he been a
      journalist with a knowledge of &ldquo;<i>per thou</i>.&rdquo; he would
      have known each for a day&rsquo;s work. After the practical plumber had
      been asking what he expected to make by this here science of his,
      re-reading her letters was balsamic. He liked Rossetti&mdash;the exquisite
      sense of separation in &ldquo;The Blessed Damozel&rdquo; touched him. But,
      on the whole, he was a little surprised at Miss Heydinger&rsquo;s taste in
      poetry. Rossetti was so sensuous ... so florid. He had scarcely expected
      that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether he had returned to the schools decidedly more interested in her
      than when they had parted. And the curious vague memories of her
      appearance as something a little frayed and careless, vanished at sight of
      her emerging from the darkness of the lift. Her hair was in order, as the
      light glanced through it it looked even pretty, and she wore a well-made,
      dark-green and black dress, loose-gathered as was the fashion in those
      days, that somehow gave a needed touch of warmth to her face. Her hat too
      was a change from the careless lumpishness of last year, a hat that, to a
      feminine mind, would have indicated design. It suited her&mdash;these
      things are past a male novelist&rsquo;s explaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have this book of yours, Miss Heydinger,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you have written that paper on Socialism,&rdquo; she
      replied, taking the brown-covered volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along the little passage towards the biological laboratory
      side by side, and she stopped at the hat pegs to remove her hat. For that
      was the shameless way of the place, a girl student had to take her hat off
      publicly, and publicly assume the holland apron that was to protect her in
      the laboratory. Not even a looking-glass!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come and hear your paper,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will like it,&rdquo; said Lewisham at the door of the
      laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the vacation I have been collecting evidence about ghosts&mdash;you
      remember our arguments. Though I did not tell you in my letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re still obdurate,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
      &ldquo;I thought that was over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you read &lsquo;Looking Backward&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it here with my other books, if you&rsquo;d care for me to
      lend it to you. Wait till I reach my table. My hands are so full.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the laboratory together, Lewisham holding the door open
      courtly-wise, Miss Heydinger taking a reassuring pat at her hair. Near the
      door was a group of four girls, which group Miss Heydinger joined, holding
      the brown-covered book as inconspicuously as possible. Three of them had
      been through the previous two years with her, and they greeted her by her
      Christian name. They had previously exchanged glances at her appearance in
      Lewisham&rsquo;s company.
    </p>
    <p>
      A morose elderly young demonstrator brightened momentarily at the sight of
      Lewisham. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got one of the decent ones anyhow,&rdquo;
      said the morose elderly young demonstrator, who was apparently taking an
      inventory, and then brightening at a fresh entry. &ldquo;Ah! and here&rsquo;s
      Smithers.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. &mdash; IN THE GALLERY OF OLD IRON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As one goes into the South Kensington Art Museum from the Brompton Road,
      the Gallery of Old Iron is overhead to the right. But the way thither is
      exceedingly devious and not to be revealed to everybody, since the young
      people who pursue science and art thereabouts set a peculiar value on its
      seclusion. The gallery is long and narrow and dark, and set with iron
      gates, iron-bound chests, locks, bolts and bars, fantastic great keys,
      lamps, and the like, and over the balustrade one may lean and talk of one&rsquo;s
      finer feelings and regard Michael Angelo&rsquo;s horned Moses, or Trajan&rsquo;s
      Column (in plaster) rising gigantic out of the hall below and far above
      the level of the gallery. And here, on a Wednesday afternoon, were
      Lewisham and Miss Heydinger, the Wednesday afternoon immediately following
      that paper upon Socialism, that you saw announced on the notice-board in
      the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper had been an immense success, closely reasoned, delivered with a
      disciplined emotion, the redoubtable Smithers practically converted, the
      reply after the debate methodical and complete, and it may be there were
      symptoms of that febrile affection known to the vulgar as &ldquo;swelled
      &lsquo;ed.&rdquo; Lewisham regarded Moses and spoke of his future. Miss
      Heydinger for the most part watched his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must bring these views prominently before people. I believe
      still in pamphlets. I have thought ...&rdquo; Lewisham paused, it is to be
      hoped through modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Luther, you know. There is room, I think, in Socialism,
      for a Luther.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger, imagining it. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that
      would be a grand way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it seemed to many people in those days. But eminent reformers have been
      now for more than seven years going about the walls of the Social Jericho,
      blowing their own trumpets and shouting&mdash;with such small result
      beyond incidental displays of ill-temper within, that it is hard to
      recover the fine hopefulness of those departed days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger. &ldquo;That would be a grand way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham appreciated the quality of personal emotion in her voice. He
      turned his face towards her, and saw unstinted admiration in her eyes.
      &ldquo;It would be a great thing to do,&rdquo; he said, and added, quite
      modestly, &ldquo;if only one could do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> could do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I could?&rdquo; Lewisham blushed vividly&mdash;with
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. Certainly you could set out to do it. Even to fail hopelessly
      would be Great. Sometimes ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. He looked expectation. &ldquo;I think sometimes it is
      greater even to fail than to succeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; said the proposed Luther, and his
      eyes went back to the Moses. She was about to speak, and changed her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contemplative pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, when a great number of people have heard of your views?&rdquo;
      she said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose we must form a party and ... bring things about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pause&mdash;full, no doubt, of elevated thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Lewisham quite suddenly. &ldquo;You do put&mdash;well&mdash;courage
      into a chap. I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that Socialism paper if it hadn&rsquo;t
      been for you.&rdquo; He turned round and stood leaning with his back to
      the Moses, and smiling at her. &ldquo;You do help a fellow,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was one of the vivid moments of Miss Heydinger&rsquo;s life. She
      changed colour a little. &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; she said, standing straight
      and awkward and looking into his face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ... glad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thanked you for your letters,&rdquo; said Lewisham,
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been thinking ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re first-rate friends, aren&rsquo;t we? The best of
      friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand and drew a breath. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said as
      they gripped. He hesitated whether to hold her hand. He looked into her
      eyes, and at that moment she would have given three-quarters of the years
      she had still to live, to have had eyes and features that could have
      expressed her. Instead, she felt her face hard, the little muscles of her
      mouth twitching insubordinate, and fancied that her self-consciousness
      made her eyes dishonest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I mean,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;is&mdash;that this will
      go on. We&rsquo;re always going to be friends, side by side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always. Just as I am able to help you&mdash;I will help you.
      However I can help you, I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We two,&rdquo; said Lewisham, gripping her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face lit. Her eyes were for a moment touched with the beauty of simple
      emotion. &ldquo;We two,&rdquo; she said, and her lips trembled and her
      throat seemed to swell. She snatched her hand back suddenly and turned her
      face away. Abruptly she walked towards the end of the gallery, and he saw
      her fumbling for her handkerchief in the folds of the green and black
      dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was going to cry!
    </p>
    <p>
      It set Lewisham marvelling&mdash;this totally inappropriate emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her and stood by her. Why cry? He hoped no one would come into
      the little gallery until her handkerchief was put away. Nevertheless he
      felt vaguely flattered. She controlled herself, dashed her tears away, and
      smiled bravely at him with reddened eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
      she said, gulping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we will fight together. We two. I <i>can</i> help you. I know I
      can help you. And there is such Work to be done in the world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good to help me,&rdquo; said Lewisham, quoting a
      phrase from what he had intended to say before he found out that he had a
      hold upon her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;how
      little a woman can do alone in the world?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a man,&rdquo; he answered after a momentary meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was Lewisham enrolled his first ally in the cause of the red tie&mdash;of
      the red tie and of the Greatness that was presently to come. His first
      ally; for hitherto&mdash;save for the indiscretion of his mural
      inscriptions&mdash;he had made a secret of his private ambitions. In that
      now half-forgotten love affair at Whortley even, he had, in spite of the
      considerable degree of intimacy attained, said absolutely nothing about
      his Career.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; MANIFESTATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Heydinger declined to disbelieve in the spirits of the dead, and this
      led to controversy in the laboratory over Tea. For the girl students,
      being in a majority that year, had organised Tea between four o&rsquo;clock
      and the advent of the extinguishing policeman at five. And the men
      students were occasionally invited to Tea. But not more than two of them
      at a time really participated, because there were only two spare cups
      after that confounded Simmons broke the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smithers, the square-headed student with the hard grey eyes, argued
      against the spirits of the dead with positive animosity, while Bletherley,
      who displayed an orange tie and lank hair in unshorn abundance, was
      vaguely open-minded, &ldquo;What is love?&rdquo; asked Bletherley, &ldquo;surely
      that at any rate is immortal!&rdquo; His remark was considered irrelevant
      and ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham, as became the most promising student of the year, weighed the
      evidence&mdash;comprehensively under headings. He dismissed the
      mediumistic <i>siances</i> as trickery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot and imposture,&rdquo; said Smithers loudly, and with an oblique
      glance to see if his challenge reached its mark. Its mark was a grizzled
      little old man with a very small face and very big grey eyes, who had been
      standing listlessly at one of the laboratory windows until the discussion
      caught him. He wore a brown velvet jacket and was reputed to be enormously
      rich. His name was Lagune. He was not a regular attendant, but one of
      those casual outsiders who are admitted to laboratories that are not
      completely full. He was known to be an ardent spiritualist&mdash;it was
      even said that he had challenged Huxley to a public discussion on
      materialism, and he came to the biological lectures and worked
      intermittently, in order, he explained, to fight disbelief with its own
      weapons. He rose greedily to Smithers&rsquo; controversial bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say <i>no</i>!&rdquo; he said, calling down the narrow laboratory
      and following his voice. He spoke with the ghost of a lisp. &ldquo;Pardon
      my interrupting, sir. The question interests me profoundly. I hope I don&rsquo;t
      intrude. Excuse me, sir. Make it personal. Am I a&mdash;fool, or an
      impostor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; parried Smithers, with all a South Kensington student&rsquo;s
      want of polish, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a bit personal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assume, sir, that I am an honest observer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have <i>seen</i> spirits, <i>heard</i> spirits, <i>felt</i> the
      touch of spirits,&rdquo; He opened his pale eyes very widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool, then,&rdquo; said Smithers in an undertone which did not
      reach the ears of the spiritualist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have been deceived,&rdquo; paraphrased Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you ... others can see, hear, feel. I have tested,
      sir. Tested! I have some scientific training and I have employed tests.
      Scientific and exhaustive tests! Every possible way. I ask you, sir&mdash;have
      you given the spirits a chance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only paying guineas to humbugs,&rdquo; said Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are! Prejudice! Here is a man denies the facts and
      consequently <i>won&rsquo;t</i> see them, won&rsquo;t go near them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t have every man in the three kingdoms, who
      disbelieved in spirits, attend <i>siances</i> before he should be allowed
      to deny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly yes. Most assuredly yes! He knows nothing about it
      till then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument became heated. The little old gentleman was soon under way.
      He knew a person of the most extraordinary gifts, a medium ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid?&rdquo; asked Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn?&rdquo; said
      Lagune promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smithers&rsquo; derision was manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you distrust a balance because you bought it? Come and see.&rdquo;
      Lagune was now very excited and inclined to gesticulate and raise his
      voice. He invited the whole class incontinently to a series of special <i>siances</i>.
      &ldquo;Not all at once&mdash;the spirits&mdash;new influences.&rdquo; But
      in sections. &ldquo;I warn you we may get nothing. But the chances are ...
      I would rejoice infinitely ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about that Lewisham consented to witness a spirit-raising. Miss
      Heydinger it was arranged should be there, and the sceptic Smithers,
      Lagune, his typewriter and the medium would complete the party. Afterwards
      there was to be another party for the others. Lewisham was glad he had the
      moral support of Smithers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an evening wasted,&rdquo;
      said Smithers, who had gallantly resolved to make the running for Lewisham
      in the contest for the Forbes medal. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll prove my case.
      You see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; They were given an address in Chelsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house, when Lewisham found it at last, proved a large one, with such
      an air of mellowed dignity that he was abashed. He hung his hat up for
      himself beside a green-trimmed hat of straw in the wide, rich-toned hall.
      Through an open door he had a glimpse of a palatial study, book shelves
      bearing white busts, a huge writing-table lit by a green-shaded electric
      lamp and covered thickly with papers. The housemaid looked, he thought,
      with infinite disdain at the rusty mourning and flamboyant tie, and
      flounced about and led him upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rapped, and there was a discussion within. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re at it
      already, I believe,&rdquo; she said to Lewisham confidentially. &ldquo;Mr.
      Lagune&rsquo;s always at it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sounds of chairs being moved, Smithers&rsquo; extensive voice
      making a suggestion and laughing nervously. Lagune appeared opening the
      door. His grizzled face seemed smaller and his big grey eyes larger than
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just going to begin without you,&rdquo; he whispered.
      &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was furnished even more finely than the drawing-room of the
      Whortley Grammar School, hitherto the finest room (except certain of the
      State Apartments at Windsor) known to Lewisham. The furniture struck him
      in a general way as akin to that in the South Kensington Museum. His first
      impression was an appreciation of the vast social superiority of the
      chairs; it seemed impertinent to think of sitting on anything quite so
      quietly stately. He perceived Smithers standing with an air of bashful
      hostility against a bookcase. Then he was aware that Lagune was asking
      them all to sit down. Already seated at the table was the Medium,
      Chaffery, a benevolent-looking, faintly shabby gentleman with bushy
      iron-grey side-whiskers, a wide, thin-lipped mouth tucked in at the
      corners, and a chin like the toe of a boot. He regarded Lewisham
      critically and disconcertingly over gilt glasses. Miss Heydinger was quite
      at her ease and began talking at once. Lewisham&rsquo;s replies were less
      confident than they had been in the Gallery of Old Iron; indeed there was
      almost a reversal of their positions. She led and he was abashed. He felt
      obscurely that she had taken an advantage of him. He became aware of
      another girlish figure in a dark dress on his right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone moved towards the round table in the centre of the room, on which
      lay a tambourine and a little green box. Lagune developed unsuspected
      lengths of knobby wrist and finger directing his guests to their seats.
      Lewisham was to sit next to him, between him and the Medium; beyond the
      Medium sat Smithers with Miss Heydinger on the other side of him, linked
      to Lagune by the typewriter. So sceptics compassed the Medium about. The
      company was already seated before Lewisham looked across Lagune and met
      the eyes of the girl next that gentleman. It was Ethel! The close green
      dress, the absence of a hat, and a certain loss of colour made her seem
      less familiar, but did not prevent the instant recognition. And there was
      recognition in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately she looked away. At first his only emotion was surprise. He
      would have spoken, but a little thing robbed him of speech. For a moment
      he was unable to remember her surname. Moreover, the strangeness of his
      surroundings made him undecided. He did not know what was the proper way
      to address her&mdash;and he still kept to the superstition of etiquette.
      Besides&mdash;to speak to her would involve a general explanation to all
      these people ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just leave a pin-point of gas, Mr. Smithers, please,&rdquo; said
      Lagune, and suddenly the one surviving jet of the gas chandelier was
      turned down and they were in darkness. The moment for recognition had
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joining of hands was punctiliously verified, the circle was linked
      little finger to little finger. Lewisham&rsquo;s abstraction received a
      rebuke from Smithers. The Medium, speaking in an affable voice, premised
      that he could promise nothing, he had no &ldquo;<i>directing</i>&rdquo;
      power over manifestations. Thereafter ensued a silence....
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space Lewisham was inattentive to all that happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in the breathing darkness, staring at the dim elusive shape that
      had presented that remembered face. His mind was astonishment mingled with
      annoyance. He had settled that this girl was lost to him for ever. The
      spell of the old days of longing, of the afternoons that he had spent
      after his arrival in London, wandering through Clapham with a fading hope
      of meeting her, had not returned to him. But he was ashamed of his stupid
      silence, and irritated by the awkwardness of the situation. At one moment
      he was on the very verge of breaking the compact and saying &ldquo;Miss
      Henderson&rdquo; across the table....
    </p>
    <p>
      How was it he had forgotten that &ldquo;Henderson&rdquo;? He was still
      young enough to be surprised at forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smithers coughed, one might imagine with a warning intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham, recalling his detective responsibility with an effort, peered
      about him, but the room was very dark. The silence was broken ever and
      again by deep sighs and a restless stirring from the Medium. Out of this
      mental confusion Lewisham&rsquo;s personal vanity was first to emerge.
      What did she think of him? Was she peering at him through the darkness
      even as he peered at her? Should he pretend to see her for the first time
      when the lights were restored? As the minutes lengthened it seemed as
      though the silence grew deeper and deeper. There was no fire in the room,
      and it looked, for lack of that glow, chilly. A curious scepticism arose
      in his mind as to whether he had actually seen Ethel or only mistaken
      someone else for her. He wanted the <i>siance</i> over in order that he
      might look at her again. The old days at Whortley came out of his memory
      with astonishing detail and yet astonishingly free from emotion....
    </p>
    <p>
      He became aware of a peculiar sensation down his back, that he tried to
      account for as a draught....
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a beam of cold air came like a touch against his face, and made
      him shudder convulsively. Then he hoped that she had not marked his
      shudder. He thought of laughing a low laugh to show he was not afraid.
      Someone else shuddered too, and he perceived an extraordinarily vivid
      odour of violets. Lagune&rsquo;s finger communicated a nervous quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was happening?
    </p>
    <p>
      The musical box somewhere on the table began playing a rather trivial,
      rather plaintive air that was strange to him. It seemed to deepen the
      silence about him, an accent on the expectant stillness, a thread of
      tinkling melody spanning an abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham took himself in hand at this stage. What <i>was</i> happening? He
      must attend. Was he really watching as he should do? He had been
      wool-gathering. There were no such things as spirits, mediums were
      humbugs, and he was here to prove that sole remaining Gospel. But he must
      keep up with things&mdash;he was missing points. What was that scent of
      violets? And who had set the musical box going? The Medium, of course; but
      how? He tried to recall whether he had heard a rustling or detected any
      movement before the music began. He could not recollect. Come! he must be
      more on the alert than this!
    </p>
    <p>
      He became acutely desirous of a successful exposure. He figured the
      dramatic moment he had prepared with Smithers&mdash;Ethel a spectator. He
      peered suspiciously into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody shuddered again, someone opposite him this time. He felt Lagune&rsquo;s
      finger quiver still more palpably, and then suddenly the raps began,
      abruptly, all about him. <i>Rap</i>!&mdash;making him start violently. A
      swift percussive sound, tap, rap, dap, under the table, under the chair,
      in the air, round the cornices. The Medium groaned again and shuddered,
      and his nervous agitation passed sympathetically round the circle. The
      music seemed to fade to the vanishing point and grew louder again.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was it done?
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Lagune&rsquo;s voice next him speaking with a peculiar quality of
      breathless reverence, &ldquo;The alphabet?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;shall
      we&mdash;shall we use the alphabet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A forcible rap under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; interpreted the voice of the Medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raps were continued everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was trickery, Lewisham endeavoured to think what the
      mechanism was. He tried to determine whether he really had the Medium&rsquo;s
      little finger touching his. He peered at the dark shape next him. There
      was a violent rapping far away behind them with an almost metallic
      resonance. Then the raps ceased, and over the healing silence the little
      jet of melody from the musical box played alone. And after a moment that
      ceased also....
    </p>
    <p>
      The stillness was profound, Mr. Lewisham was now highly strung. Doubts
      assailed him suddenly, and an overwhelming apprehension, a sense of vast
      occurrences gathering above him. The darkness was a physical
      oppression....
    </p>
    <p>
      He started. Something had stirred on the table. There was the sharp ping
      of metal being struck. A number of little crepitating sounds like paper
      being smoothed. The sound of wind without the movement of air. A sense of
      a presence hovering over the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement of Lagune communicated itself in convulsive tremblings; the
      Medium&rsquo;s hand quivered. In the darkness on the table something
      faintly luminous, a greenish-white patch, stirred and hopped slowly among
      the dim shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object, whatever it was, hopped higher, rose slowly in the air,
      expanded. Lewisham&rsquo;s attention followed this slavishly. It was
      ghostly&mdash;unaccountable&mdash;marvellous. For the moment he forgot
      even Ethel. Higher and higher this pallid luminosity rose overhead, and
      then he saw that it was a ghostly hand and arm, rising, rising. Slowly,
      deliberately it crossed the table, seemed to touch Lagune, who shivered.
      It moved slowly round and touched Lewisham. He gritted his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the touch, firm and yet soft, of finger-tips.
      Almost simultaneously, Miss Heydinger cried out that something was
      smoothing her hair, and suddenly the musical box set off again with a
      reel. The faint oval of the tambourine rose, jangled, and Lewisham heard
      it pat Smithers in the face. It seemed to pass overhead. Immediately a
      table somewhere beyond the Medium began moving audibly on its castors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed impossible that the Medium, sitting so still beside him, could
      be doing all these things&mdash;grotesquely unmeaning though they might
      be. After all....
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghostly hand was hovering almost directly in front of Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s
      eyes. It hung with a slight quivering. Ever and again its fingers flapped
      down and rose stiffly again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noise! A loud noise it seemed. Something moving? What was it he had to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham suddenly missed the Medium&rsquo;s little finger. He tried to
      recover it. He could not find it. He caught, held and lost an arm. There
      was an exclamation. A faint report. A curse close to him bitten in half by
      the quick effort to suppress it. Tzit! The little pinpoint of light flew
      up with a hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham, standing, saw a circle of blinking faces turned to the group of
      two this sizzling light revealed. Smithers was the chief figure of the
      group; he stood triumphant, one hand on the gas tap, the other gripping
      the Medium&rsquo;s wrist, and in the Medium&rsquo;s hand&mdash;the
      incriminatory tambourine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, Lewisham?&rdquo; cried Smithers, with the shadows
      on his face jumping as the gas flared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Caught</i>!&rdquo; said Lewisham loudly, rising in his place and
      avoiding Ethel&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried the Medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheating,&rdquo; panted Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; cried the Medium. &ldquo;When you turned up the
      light ... put my hand up ... caught tambourine ... to save head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Smithers,&rdquo; cried Lagune. &ldquo;Mr. Smithers, this is
      very wrong. This&mdash;shock&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tambourine fell noisily to the floor. The Medium&rsquo;s face changed,
      he groaned strangely and staggered back. Lagune cried out for a glass of
      water. Everyone looked at the man, expecting him to fall, save Lewisham.
      The thought of Ethel had flashed back into his mind. He turned to see how
      she took this exposure in which he was such a prominent actor. He saw her
      leaning over the table as if to pick up something that lay across it. She
      was not looking at him, she was looking at the Medium. Her face was set
      and white. Then, as if she felt his glance, her eyes met his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started back, stood erect, facing him with a strange hardness in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the moment Lewisham did not grasp the situation. He wanted to show that
      he was acting upon equal terms with Smithers in the exposure. For the
      moment her action simply directed his attention to the object towards
      which she had been leaning, a thing of shrivelled membrane, a pneumatic
      glove, lying on the table. This was evidently part of the mediumistic
      apparatus. He pounced and seized it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said, holding it towards Smithers. &ldquo;Here is
      more! What is this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived that the girl started. He saw Chaffery, the Medium, look
      instantly over Smithers&rsquo; shoulders, saw his swift glance of reproach
      at the girl. Abruptly the situation appeared to Lewisham; he perceived her
      complicity. And he stood, still in the attitude of triumph, with the
      evidence against her in his hand! But his triumph had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Smithers, leaning across the table to secure it.
      &ldquo;<i>Good</i> old Lewisham!... Now we <i>have</i> it. This is better
      than the tambourine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes shone with triumph. &ldquo;Do you see, Mr. Lagune?&rdquo; said
      Smithers. &ldquo;The Medium held this in his teeth and blew it out. There&rsquo;s
      no denying this. This wasn&rsquo;t falling on your head, Mr. Medium, was
      it? <i>This</i>&mdash;this was the luminous hand!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; LEWISHAM IS UNACCOUNTABLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night, as she went with him to Chelsea station, Miss Heydinger
      discovered an extraordinary moodiness in Lewisham. She had been vividly
      impressed by the scene in which they had just participated, she had for a
      time believed in the manifestations; the swift exposure had violently
      revolutionised her ideas. The details of the crisis were a little confused
      in her mind. She ranked Lewisham with Smithers in the scientific triumph
      of the evening. On the whole she felt elated. She had no objection to
      being confuted by Lewisham. But she was angry with the Medium, &ldquo;It
      is dreadful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Living a lie! How can the world grow
      better, when sane, educated people use their sanity and enlightenment to
      darken others? It is dreadful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a horrible man&mdash;such an oily, dishonest voice. And the
      girl&mdash;I was sorry for her. She must have been oh!&mdash;bitterly
      ashamed, or why should she have burst out crying? That <i>did</i> distress
      me. Fancy crying like that! It was&mdash;yes&mdash;<i>abandon</i>. But
      what can one do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Lewisham was walking along, looking straight before him, lost
      in some grim argument with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me think of Sludge the Medium,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him suddenly. &ldquo;Have you read Sludge the Medium?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eigh?&rdquo; he said, coming back out of infinity. &ldquo;What? I
      beg your pardon. Sludge, the Medium? I thought his name was&mdash;it <i>was</i>&mdash;Chaffery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, clearly very anxious upon this question of fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mean Browning&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sludge.&rsquo; You know the
      poem.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must lend it to you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s splendid.
      It goes to the very bottom of this business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never occurred to me before. But I see the point clearly now. If
      people, poor people, are offered money if phenomena happen, it&rsquo;s too
      much. They are <i>bound</i> to cheat. It&rsquo;s bribery&mdash;immorality!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked in panting little sentences, because Lewisham was walking in
      heedless big strides. &ldquo;I wonder how much&mdash;such people&mdash;could
      earn honestly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham slowly became aware of the question at his ear. He hurried back
      from infinity. &ldquo;How much they could earn honestly? I haven&rsquo;t
      the slightest idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. &ldquo;The whole of this business puzzles me,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I want to think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s frightfully complex, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said&mdash;a
      little staggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rest of the way to the station was silence. They parted with a
      hand-clasp they took a pride in&mdash;a little perfunctory so far as
      Lewisham was concerned on this occasion. She scrutinised his face as the
      train moved out of the station, and tried to account for his mood. He was
      staring before him at unknown things as if he had already forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to think! But two heads, she thought, were better than one in a
      matter of opinion. It troubled her to be so ignorant of his mental states.
      &ldquo;How we are wrapped and swathed about&mdash;soul from soul!&rdquo;
      she thought, staring out of the window at the dim things flying by
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a fit of depression came upon her. She felt alone&mdash;absolutely
      alone&mdash;in a void world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she returned to external things. She became aware of two people
      in the next compartment eyeing her critically. Her hand went patting at
      her hair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; LEWISHAM INSISTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ethel Henderson sat at her machine before the window of Mr. Lagume&rsquo;s
      study, and stared blankly at the greys and blues of the November twilight.
      Her face was white, her eyelids were red from recent weeping, and her
      hands lay motionless in her lap. The door had just slammed behind Lagune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigh-ho!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish I was dead. Oh! I wish I
      was out of it all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She became passive again. &ldquo;I wonder what I have <i>done</i>,&rdquo;
      she said, &ldquo;that I should be punished like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She certainly looked anything but a Fate-haunted soul, being indeed
      visibly and immediately a very pretty girl. Her head was shapely and
      covered with curly dark hair, and the eyebrows above her hazel eyes were
      clear and dark. Her lips were finely shaped, her mouth was not too small
      to be expressive, her chin small, and her neck white and full and pretty.
      There is no need to lay stress upon her nose&mdash;it sufficed. She was of
      a mediocre height, sturdy rather than slender, and her dress was of a
      pleasant, golden-brown material with the easy sleeves and graceful line of
      those aesthetic days. And she sat at her typewriter and wished she was
      dead and wondered what she had <i>done</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was lined with bookshelves, and conspicuous therein were a long
      row of foolish pretentious volumes, the &ldquo;works&rdquo; of Lagune&mdash;the
      witless, meandering imitation of philosophy that occupied his life. Along
      the cornices were busts of Plato, Socrates, and Newton. Behind Ethel was
      the great man&rsquo;s desk with its green-shaded electric light, and
      littered with proofs and copies of <i>Hesperus</i>, &ldquo;A Paper for
      Doubters,&rdquo; which, with her assistance, he edited, published,
      compiled, wrote, and (without her help) paid for and read. A pen, flung
      down forcibly, quivered erect with its one surviving nib in the blotting
      pad. Mr. Lagune had flung it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collapse of the previous night had distressed him dreadfully, and ever
      and again before his retreat he had been breaking into passionate
      monologue. The ruin of a life-work, it was, no less. Surely she had known
      that Chaffery was a cheat. Had she not known? Silence. &ldquo;After so
      many kindnesses&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him with a wailing, &ldquo;Oh, I know&mdash;I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lagune was remorseless and insisted she had betrayed him, worse&mdash;made
      him ridiculous! Look at the &ldquo;work&rdquo; he had undertaken at South
      Kensington&mdash;how could he go on with that now? How could he find the
      heart? When his own typewriter sacrificed him to her stepfather&rsquo;s
      trickery? &ldquo;Trickery!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gesticulating hands became active, the grey eyes dilated with
      indignation, the piping voice eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t cheated you, someone else would,&rdquo; was
      Ethel&rsquo;s inadequate muttered retort, unheard by the seeker after
      phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps not so bad as dismissal, but it certainly lasted longer.
      And at home was Chaffery, grimly malignant at her failure to secure that
      pneumatic glove. He had no right to blame her, he really had not; but a
      disturbed temper is apt to falsify the scales of justice. The tambourine,
      he insisted, he could have explained by saying he put up his hand to catch
      it and protect his head directly Smithers moved. But the pneumatic glove
      there was no explaining. He had made a chance for her to secure it when he
      had pretended to faint. It was rubbish to say anyone could have been
      looking on the table then&mdash;rubbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside that significant wreck of a pen stood a little carriage clock in a
      case, and this suddenly lifted a slender voice and announced <i>five</i>.
      She turned round on her stool and sat staring at the clock. She smiled
      with the corners of her mouth down. &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
      begin again. It&rsquo;s like battledore and shuttlecock....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>was</i> silly....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ve brought it on myself. I ought to have picked
      it up, I suppose. I had time....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheats ... just cheats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought I should see him again....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was ashamed, of course.... He had his own friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space she sat still, staring blankly before her. She sighed, rubbed
      a knuckle in a reddened eye, rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the hall, where her hat, transfixed by a couple of hat-pins,
      hung above her jacket, assumed these garments, and let herself out into
      the cold grey street.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly gone twenty yards from Lagune&rsquo;s door before she
      became aware of a man overtaking her and walking beside her. That kind of
      thing is a common enough experience to girls who go to and from work in
      London, and she had had perforce to learn many things since her
      adventurous Whortley days. She looked stiffly in front of her. The man
      deliberately got in her way so that she had to stop. She lifted eyes of
      indignant protest. It was Lewisham&mdash;and his face was white.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated awkwardly, and then in silence held out his hand. She took it
      mechanically. He found his voice. &ldquo;Miss Henderson,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said.... &ldquo;I want to talk to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Her heart was beating fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the thing unexpectedly difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I&mdash;? Are you expecting&mdash;? Have you far to go? I would
      like to talk to you. There is a lot ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walk to Clapham,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you care ... to come
      part of the way ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved awkwardly. Lewisham took his place at her side. They walked side
      by side for a moment, their manner constrained, having so much to say that
      they could not find a word to begin upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten Whortley?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her; her face was downcast. &ldquo;Why did you never write?&rdquo;
      he asked bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, I mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did&mdash;in July.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mrs. Munday ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had forgotten her name. I sent it to the Grammar School.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham suppressed an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on again in silence. &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; said Lewisham at
      length. &ldquo;I have no business to ask. But&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a long breath. &ldquo;Mr. Lewisham,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That
      man you saw&mdash;the Medium&mdash;was my stepfather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham paused. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another constrained silence. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said less
      dubiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a rap what your stepfather is. Were
      <i>you</i> cheating?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face turned white. Her mouth opened and closed. &ldquo;Mr. Lewisham,&rdquo;
      she said deliberately, &ldquo;you may not believe it, it may sound
      impossible, but on my honour ... I did not know&mdash;I did not know for
      certain, that is&mdash;that my stepfather ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lewisham, leaping at conviction. &ldquo;Then I was
      right....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she stared at him, and then, &ldquo;I <i>did</i> know,&rdquo;
      she said, suddenly beginning to cry. &ldquo;How can I tell you? It is a
      lie. I <i>did</i> know. I <i>did</i> know all the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her in white astonishment. He fell behind her one step, and
      then in a stride came level again. Then, a silence, a silence that seemed
      it would never end. She had stopped crying, she was one huge suspense, not
      daring even to look at his face. And at last he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind even that. I
      don&rsquo;t care&mdash;even if it was that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abruptly they turned into the King&rsquo;s Road, with its roar of wheeled
      traffic and hurrying foot-passengers, and forthwith a crowd of boys with a
      broken-spirited Guy involved and separated them. In a busy highway of a
      night one must needs talk disconnectedly in shouted snatches or else hold
      one&rsquo;s peace. He glanced at her face and saw that it was set again.
      Presently she turned southward out of the tumult into a street of darkness
      and warm blinds, and they could go on talking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand what you mean,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;I know I
      do. You knew, but you did not want to know. It was like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But her mind had been active. &ldquo;At the end of this road,&rdquo; she
      said, gulping a sob, &ldquo;you must go back. It was kind of you to come,
      Mr. Lewisham. But you were ashamed&mdash;you are sure to be ashamed. My
      employer is a spiritualist, and my stepfather is a professional Medium,
      and my mother is a spiritualist. You were quite right not to speak to me
      last night. Quite. It was kind of you to come, but you must go back. Life
      is hard enough as it is ... You must go back at the end of the road. Go
      back at the end of the road ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham made no reply for a hundred yards. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming on to
      Clapham,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to the end of the road in silence. Then at the kerb corner she
      turned and faced him. &ldquo;Go back,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said obstinately, and they stood face to face at the
      cardinal point of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;It is hard to say what I
      feel. I don&rsquo;t know myself.... But I&rsquo;m not going to lose you
      like this. I&rsquo;m not going to let you slip a second time. I was awake
      about it all last night. I don&rsquo;t care where you are, what your
      people are, nor very much whether you&rsquo;ve kept quite clear of this
      medium humbug. I don&rsquo;t. You will in future. Anyhow. I&rsquo;ve had a
      day and night to think it over. I had to come and try to find you. It&rsquo;s
      you. I&rsquo;ve never forgotten you. Never. I&rsquo;m not going to be sent
      back like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be no good for either of us,&rdquo; she said as resolute as
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t leave you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the good?...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; said Lewisham, dogmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked her a question point blank and she would not answer him, and for
      some way they walked in grim silence. Presently she spoke with a twitching
      mouth. &ldquo;I wish you would leave me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are
      quite different from what I am. You felt that last night. You helped find
      us out....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When first I came to London I used to wander about Clapham looking
      for you,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;week after week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had crossed the bridge and were in a narrow little street of shabby
      shops near Clapham Junction before they talked again. She kept her face
      averted and expressionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Lewisham, with a sort of stiff
      civility, &ldquo;if I seem to be forcing myself upon you. I don&rsquo;t
      want to pry into your affairs&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t wish me to. The
      sight of you has somehow brought back a lot of things.... I can&rsquo;t
      explain it. Perhaps&mdash;I had to come to find you&mdash;I kept on
      thinking of your face, of how you used to smile, how you jumped from the
      gate by the lock, and how we had tea ... a lot of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may come,&rdquo; he said, and went unanswered. They crossed
      the wide streets by the Junction and went on towards the Common.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live down this road,&rdquo; she said, stopping abruptly at a
      corner. &ldquo;I would rather ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have said nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with her face white, unable to speak for a space.
      &ldquo;It can do no good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am mixed up with
      this....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke deliberately. &ldquo;I shall come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to-morrow
      night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come.&rdquo; She could hide the gladness of her heart from
      herself no longer. She was frightened that he had come, but she was glad,
      and she knew he knew that she was glad. She made no further protest. She
      held out her hand dumbly. And on the morrow she found him awaiting her
      even as he had said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; MR. LAGUNE&rsquo;S POINT OF VIEW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For three days the Laboratory at South Kensington saw nothing of Lagune,
      and then he came back more invincibly voluble than ever. Everyone had
      expected him to return apostate, but he brought back an invigorated faith,
      a propaganda unashamed. From some source he had derived strength and
      conviction afresh. Even the rhetorical Smithers availed nothing. There was
      a joined battle over the insufficient tea-cups, and the elderly young
      assistant demonstrator hovered on the verge of the discussion, rejoicing,
      it is supposed, over the entanglements of Smithers. For at the outset
      Smithers displayed an overweening confidence and civility, and at the end
      his ears were red and his finer manners lost to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham, it was remarked by Miss Heydinger, made but a poor figure in
      this discussion. Once or twice he seemed about to address Lagune, and
      thought better of it with the words upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagune&rsquo;s treatment of the exposure was light and vigorous. &ldquo;The
      man Chaffery,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has made a clean breast of it. His
      point of view&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Facts are facts,&rdquo; said Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fact is a synthesis of impressions,&rdquo; said Lagune; &ldquo;but
      that you will learn when you are older. The thing is that we were at cross
      purposes. I told Chaffery you were beginners. He treated you as beginners&mdash;arranged
      a demonstration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>was</i> a demonstration,&rdquo; said Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. If it had not been for your interruptions ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He forged elementary effects ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t but admit that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t attempt to deny it. But, as he explained, the thing
      is necessary&mdash;justifiable. Psychic phenomena are subtle, a certain
      training of the observation is necessary. A medium is a more subtle
      instrument than a balance or a borax bead, and see how long it is before
      you can get assured results with a borax bead! In the elementary class, in
      the introductory phase, conditions are too crude....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For honesty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. <i>Is</i> it dishonest&mdash;rigging a
      demonstration?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your professors do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny that in toto,&rdquo; said Smithers, and repeated with
      satisfaction, &ldquo;in toto.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Lagune, &ldquo;because I have
      the facts. Your chemical lecturers&mdash;you may go downstairs now and
      ask, if you disbelieve me&mdash;always cheat over the indestructibility of
      matter experiment&mdash;always. And then another&mdash;a physiography
      thing. You know the experiment I mean? To demonstrate the existence of the
      earth&rsquo;s rotation. They use&mdash;they use&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foucault&rsquo;s pendulum,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;They use a
      rubber ball with a pin-hole hidden in the hand, and blow the pendulum
      round the way it ought to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; said Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said Lagune, and produced a piece of folded
      printed paper from his pocket. &ldquo;Here is a review from <i>Nature</i>
      of the work of no less a person than Professor Greenhill. And see&mdash;a
      convenient pin is introduced in the apparatus for the demonstration of
      virtual velocities! Read it&mdash;if you doubt me. I suppose you doubt me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Smithers abruptly abandoned his position of denial &ldquo;in toto.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t my point, Mr. Lagune; this isn&rsquo;t my point,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;These things that are done in the lecture theatre are not
      to prove facts, but to give ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was my demonstration,&rdquo; said Lagune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t understand it in that light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor does the ordinary person who goes to Science lectures
      understand it in that light. He is comforted by the thought that he is
      seeing things with his own eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Smithers; &ldquo;two wrongs
      don&rsquo;t make a right. To rig demonstrations is wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I agree with you. I have spoken plainly with this man
      Chaffery. He&rsquo;s not a full-blown professor, you know, a highly
      salaried ornament of the rock of truth like your demonstration-rigging
      professors here, and so I can speak plainly to him without offence. He
      takes quite the view they would take. But I am more rigorous. I insist
      that there shall be no more of this....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next time&mdash;&rdquo; said Smithers with irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no next time. I have done with elementary
      exhibitions. You must take the word of the trained observer&mdash;just as
      you do in the matter of chemical analysis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean you are going on with that chap when he&rsquo;s been
      caught cheating under your very nose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Smithers set out to explain why not, and happened on confusion. &ldquo;I
      still believe the man has powers,&rdquo; said Lagune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of deception,&rdquo; said Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those I must eliminate,&rdquo; said Lagune. &ldquo;You might as
      well refuse to study electricity because it escaped through your body. All
      new science is elusive. No investigator in his senses would refuse to
      investigate a compound because it did unexpected things. Either this
      dissolves in acid or I have nothing more to do with it&mdash;eh? That&rsquo;s
      fine research!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was the last vestiges of Smithers&rsquo; manners vanished. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t care <i>what</i> you say,&rdquo; said Smithers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all rot&mdash;it&rsquo;s all just rot. Argue if you like&mdash;but have
      you convinced anybody? Put it to the vote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s democracy with a vengeance,&rdquo; said Lagune.
      &ldquo;A general election of the truth half-yearly, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s simply wriggling out of it,&rdquo; said Smithers.
      &ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with it at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagune, flushed but cheerful, was on his way downstairs when Lewisham
      overtook him. He was pale and out of breath, but as the staircase
      invariably rendered Lagune breathless he did not remark the younger man&rsquo;s
      disturbance. &ldquo;Interesting talk,&rdquo; panted Lewisham. &ldquo;Very
      interesting talk, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you found it so&mdash;very,&rdquo; said Lagune.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and then Lewisham plunged desperately. &ldquo;There is
      a young lady&mdash;she is your typewriter....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped from sheer loss of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Lagune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she a medium or anything of that sort?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Lagune reflected, &ldquo;She is not a medium,
      certainly. But&mdash;why do you ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!... I wondered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You noticed her eyes perhaps. She is the stepdaughter of that man
      Chaffery&mdash;a queer character, but indisputably mediumistic. It&rsquo;s
      odd the thing should have struck you. Curiously enough I myself have
      fancied she might be something of a psychic&mdash;judging from her face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A psychic&mdash;undeveloped, of course. I have thought once or
      twice. Only a little while ago I was speaking to that man Chaffery about
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He of course would like to see any latent powers developed.
      But it&rsquo;s a little difficult to begin, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;she won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present. She is a good girl, but in this matter she is&mdash;timid.
      There is often a sort of disinclination&mdash;a queer sort of feeling&mdash;one
      might almost call it modesty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can override it usually. I don&rsquo;t despair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham shortly. They were at the foot of the
      staircase now. He hesitated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me a lot to think
      about,&rdquo; he said with an attempt at an off-hand manner. &ldquo;The
      way you talked upstairs;&rdquo; and turned towards the book he had to
      sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t take up quite such an intolerant
      attitude as Mr. Smithers,&rdquo; said Lagune; &ldquo;very glad. I must
      lend you a book or two. If your <i>cramming</i> here leaves you any time,
      that is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Lewisham shortly, and walked away from him. The
      studiously characteristic signature quivered and sprawled in an unfamiliar
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>damned</i> if he overrides it,&rdquo; said Lewisham,
      under his breath.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; LOVE IN THE STREETS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lewisham was not quite clear what course he meant to take in the high
      enterprise of foiling Lagune, and indeed he was anything but clear about
      the entire situation. His logical processes, his emotions and his
      imagination seemed playing some sort of snatching game with his will.
      Enormous things hung imminent, but it worked out to this, that he walked
      home with Ethel night after night for&mdash;to be exact&mdash;seven-and-sixty
      nights. Every week night through November and December, save once, when he
      had to go into the far East to buy himself an overcoat, he was waiting to
      walk with her home. A curious, inconclusive affair, that walk, to which he
      came nightly full of vague longings, and which ended invariably under an
      odd shadow of disappointment. It began outside Lagune&rsquo;s most
      punctually at five, and ended&mdash;mysteriously&mdash;at the corner of a
      side road in Clapham, a road of little yellow houses with sunk basements
      and tawdry decorations of stone. Up that road she vanished night after
      night, into a grey mist and the shadow beyond a feeble yellow gas-lamp,
      and he would watch her vanish, and then sigh and turn back towards his
      lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of this and that, their little superficial ideas about
      themselves, and of their circumstances and tastes, and always there was
      something, something that was with them unspoken, unacknowledged, which
      made all these things unreal and insincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet out of their talk he began to form vague ideas of the home from which
      she came. There was, of course, no servant, and the mother was something
      meandering, furtive, tearful in the face of troubles. Sometimes of an
      afternoon or evening she grew garrulous. &ldquo;Mother does talk so&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;
      She rarely went out of doors. Chaffery always rose late, and would
      sometimes go away for days together. He was mean; he allowed only a weekly
      twenty-five shillings for housekeeping, and sometimes things grew
      unsatisfactory at the week-end. There seemed to be little sympathy between
      mother and daughter; the widow had been flighty in a dingy fashion, and
      her marriage with her chief lodger Chaffery had led to unforgettable
      sayings. It was to facilitate this marriage that Ethel had been sent to
      Whortley, so that was counted a mitigated evil. But these were far-off
      things, remote and unreal down the long, ill-lit vista of the suburban
      street which swallowed up Ethel nightly. The walk, her warmth and light
      and motion close to him, her clear little voice, and the touch of her
      hand; that was reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow of Chaffery and his deceptions lay indeed across all these
      things, sometimes faint, sometimes dark and present. Then Lewisham became
      insistent, his sentimental memories ceased, and he asked questions that
      verged on gulfs of doubt. Had she ever &ldquo;helped&rdquo;? She had not,
      she declared. Then she added that twice at home she had &ldquo;sat down&rdquo;
      to complete the circle. She would never help again. That she promised&mdash;if
      it needed promising. There had already been dreadful trouble at home about
      the exposure at Lagune&rsquo;s. Her mother had sided with her stepfather
      and joined in blaming her. But was she to blame?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of <i>course</i> you were not to blame,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
      Lagune, he learnt, had been unhappy and restless for the three days after
      the <i>siance</i>&mdash;indulging in wearisome monologue&mdash;with Ethel
      as sole auditor (at twenty-one shillings a week). Then he had decided to
      give Chaffery a sound lecture on his disastrous dishonesty. But it was
      Chaffery gave the lecture. Smithers, had he only known it, had been
      overthrown by a better brain than Lagune&rsquo;s, albeit it spoke through
      Lagune&rsquo;s treble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel did not like talking of Chaffery and these other things. &ldquo;If
      you knew how sweet it was to forget it all,&rdquo; she would say; &ldquo;to
      be just us two together for a little while.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;What good
      <i>does</i> it do to keep on?&rdquo; when Lewisham was pressing. Lewisham
      wanted very much to keep on at times, but the good of it was a little hard
      to demonstrate. So his knowledge of the situation remained imperfect and
      the weeks drifted by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wonderfully varied were those seven-and-sixty nights, as he came to
      remember in after life. There were nights of damp and drizzle, and then
      thick fogs, beautiful, isolating, grey-white veils, turning every yard of
      pavement into a private room. Grand indeed were these fogs, things to
      rejoice at mightily, since then it was no longer a thing for public scorn
      when two young people hurried along arm in arm, and one could do a
      thousand impudent, significant things with varying pressure and the
      fondling of a little hand (a hand in a greatly mended glove of cheap kid).
      Then indeed one seemed to be nearer that elusive something that threaded
      it all together. And the dangers of the street corners, the horses looming
      up suddenly out of the dark, the carters with lanterns at their horses&rsquo;
      heads, the street lamps, blurred, smoky orange at one&rsquo;s nearest, and
      vanishing at twenty yards into dim haze, seemed to accentuate the infinite
      need of protection on the part of a delicate young lady who had already
      traversed three winters of fogs, thornily alone. Moreover, one could come
      right down the quiet street where she lived, halfway to the steps of her
      house, with a delightful sense of enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fogs passed all too soon into a hard frost, into nights of starlight
      and presently moonlight, when the lamps looked hard, flashing like rows of
      yellow gems, and their reflections and the glare of the shop windows were
      sharp and frosty, and even the stars hard and bright, snapping noiselessly
      (if one may say so) instead of twinkling. A jacket trimmed with imitation
      Astrachan replaced Ethel&rsquo;s lighter coat, and a round cap of
      Astrachan her hat, and her eyes shone hard and bright, and her forehead
      was broad and white beneath it. It was exhilarating, but one got home too
      soon, and so the way from Chelsea to Clapham was lengthened, first into a
      loop of side streets, and then when the first pulverulent snows told that
      Christmas was at hand, into a new loop down King&rsquo;s Road, and once
      even through the Brompton Road and Sloane Street, where the shops were
      full of decorations and entertaining things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, under circumstances of infinite gravity, Mr. Lewisham secretly spent
      three-and-twenty shillings out of the vestiges of that hundred pounds, and
      bought Ethel a little gold ring set with pearls. With that there must
      needs be a ceremonial, and on the verge of the snowy, foggy Common she
      took off her glove and the ring was placed on her finger. Whereupon he was
      moved to kiss her&mdash;on the frost-pink knuckle next to an inky nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly of us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What can we do?&mdash;ever?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait,&rdquo; he said, and his tone was full of vague promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he thought over those promises, and another evening went into
      the matter more fully, telling her of all the brilliant things that he
      held it was possible for a South Kensington student to do and be&mdash;of
      headmasterships, northern science schools, inspectorships,
      demonstratorships, yea, even professorships. And then, and then&mdash;To
      all of which she lent a willing and incredulous ear, finding in that
      dreaming a quality of fear as well as delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The putting on of the pearl-set ring was mere ceremonial, of course; she
      could not wear it either at Lagune&rsquo;s or at home, so instead she
      threaded it on a little white satin ribbon and wore it round her neck&mdash;&ldquo;next
      her heart.&rdquo; He thought of it there warm &ldquo;next her heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had bought the ring he had meant to save it for Christmas before
      he gave it to her. But the desire to see her pleasure had been too strong
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas Eve, I know not by what deceit on her part, these young people
      spent together all day. Lagune was down with a touch of bronchitis and had
      given his typewriter a holiday. Perhaps she forgot to mention it at home.
      The Royal College was in vacation and Lewisham was free. He declined the
      plumber&rsquo;s invitation; &ldquo;work&rdquo; kept him in London, he
      said, though it meant a pound or more of added expenditure. These absurd
      young people walked sixteen miles that Christmas Eve, and parted warm and
      glowing. There had been a hard frost and a little snow, the sky was a
      colourless grey, icicles hung from the arms of the street lamps, and the
      pavements were patterned out with frond-like forms that were trodden into
      slides as the day grew older. The Thames they knew was a wonderful sight,
      but that they kept until last. They went first along the Brompton Road....
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is well that you should have the picture of them right: Lewisham in
      the ready-made overcoat, blue cloth and velvet collar, dirty tan gloves,
      red tie, and bowler hat; and Ethel in a two-year-old jacket and hat of
      curly Astrachan; both pink-cheeked from the keen air, shyly arm in arm
      occasionally, and very alert to miss no possible spectacle. The shops were
      varied and interesting along the Brompton Road, but nothing to compare
      with Piccadilly. There were windows in Piccadilly so full of costly little
      things, it took fifteen minutes to get them done, card shops, drapers&rsquo;
      shops full of foolish, entertaining attractions. Lewisham, in spite of his
      old animosities, forgot to be severe on the Shopping Class, Ethel was so
      vastly entertained by all these pretty follies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then up Regent Street by the place where the sham diamonds are, and the
      place where the girls display their long hair, and the place where the
      little chickens run about in the window, and so into Oxford Street,
      Holborn, Ludgate Hill, St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, to Leadenhall, and the
      markets where turkeys, geese, ducklings, and chickens&mdash;turkeys
      predominant, however&mdash;hang in rows of a thousand at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i> buy you something,&rdquo; said Lewisham, resuming a
      topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Ethel, with her eye down a vista of innumerable
      birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I <i>must</i>,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;You had better
      choose it, or I shall get something wrong.&rdquo; His mind ran on brooches
      and clasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t waste your money, and besides, I have that ring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lewisham insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;if you must&mdash;I am starving. Buy me something to
      eat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense and memorable joke. Lewisham plunged recklessly&mdash;orientally&mdash;into
      an awe-inspiring place with mitred napkins. They lunched on cutlets&mdash;stripped
      the cutlets to the bone&mdash;and little crisp brown potatoes, and they
      drank between them a whole half bottle of&mdash;some white wine or other,
      Lewisham selected in an off-hand way from the list. Neither of them had
      ever taken wine at a meal before. One-and-ninepence it cost him, Sir, and
      the name of it was Capri! It was really very passable Capri&mdash;a
      manufactured product, no doubt, but warming and aromatic. Ethel was aghast
      at his magnificence and drank a glass and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, very warm and comfortable, they went down by the Tower, and the
      Tower Bridge with its crest of snow, huge pendant icicles, and the ice
      blocks choked in its side arches, was seasonable seeing. And as they had
      had enough of shops and crowds they set off resolutely along the desolate
      Embankment homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But indeed the Thames was a wonderful sight that year! ice-fringed along
      either shore, and with drift-ice in the middle reflecting a luminous
      scarlet from the broad red setting sun, and moving steadily, incessantly
      seaward. A swarm of mewing gulls went to and fro, and with them mingled
      pigeons and crows. The buildings on the Surrey side were dim and grey and
      very mysterious, the moored, ice-blocked barges silent and deserted, and
      here and there a lit window shone warm. The sun sank right out of sight
      into a bank of blue, and the Surrey side dissolved in mist save for a few
      insoluble, spots of yellow light, that presently became many. And after
      our lovers had come under Charing Cross Bridge the Houses of Parliament
      rose before them at the end of a great crescent of golden lamps, blue and
      faint, halfway between the earth and sky. And the clock on the Tower was
      like a November sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a day without a flaw, or at most but the slightest speck. And that
      only came at the very end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been very happy
      to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face came very close to hers. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said,
      pressing her hand and looking into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced round, she drew nearer to him. &ldquo;<i>Dearest</i> one,&rdquo;
      she whispered very softly, and then, &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he became unaccountably petulant, he dropped her hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      always like this. We are happy. <i>I</i> am happy. And then&mdash;then you
      are taken away....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence of mute interrogations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;we must wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;<i>Wait</i>!&rdquo; he said, and broke off.
      He hesitated. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said as though he was snapping a
      thread that held them together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; MISS HEYDINGER&rsquo;S PRIVATE THOUGHTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The way from Chelsea to Clapham and the way from South Kensington to
      Battersea, especially if the former is looped about a little to make it
      longer, come very near to each other. One night close upon Christmas two
      friends of Lewisham&rsquo;s passed him and Ethel. But Lewisham did not see
      them, because he was looking at Ethel&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see?&rdquo; said the other girl, a little maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lewisham&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger in a
      perfectly indifferent tone.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Miss Heydinger sat in the room her younger sisters called her &ldquo;Sanctum.&rdquo;
      Her Sanctum was only too evidently an intellectualised bedroom, and a
      cheap wallpaper of silvery roses peeped coquettishly from among her draped
      furniture. Her particular glories were the writing-desk in the middle and
      the microscope on the unsteady octagonal table under the window. There
      were bookshelves of workmanship patently feminine in their facile
      decoration and structural instability, and on them an array of glittering
      poets, Shelley, Rossetti, Keats, Browning, and odd volumes of Ruskin,
      South Place Sermons, Socialistic publications in torn paper covers, and
      above, science text-books and note-books in an oppressive abundance. The
      autotypes that hung about the room were eloquent of aesthetic ambitions
      and of a certain impermeability to implicit meanings. There were the
      Mirror of Venus by Burne Jones, Rossetti&rsquo;s Annunciation, Lippi&rsquo;s
      Annunciation, and the Love of Life and Love and Death of Watts. And among
      other photographs was one of last year&rsquo;s Debating Society Committee,
      Lewisham smiling a little weakly near the centre, and Miss Heydinger out
      of focus in the right wing. And Miss Heydinger sat with her back to all
      these things, in her black horse-hair arm-chair, staring into the fire,
      her eyes hot, and her chin on her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have guessed&mdash;before,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ever
      since that <i>siance</i>. It has been different ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled bitterly. &ldquo;Some shop girl ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She mused. &ldquo;They are all alike, I suppose. They come back&mdash;a
      little damaged, as the woman says in &lsquo;Lady Windermere&rsquo;s Fan.&rsquo;
      Perhaps he will. I wonder ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he be so deceitful? Why should he act to me ...?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty, pretty, pretty&mdash;that is our business. What man
      hesitates in the choice? He goes his own way, thinks his own thoughts,
      does his own work ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His dissection is getting behind&mdash;one can see he takes
      scarcely any notes....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time she was silent. Her face became more intent. She began to
      bite her thumb, at first slowly, then faster. She broke out at last into
      words again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The things he might do, the great things he might do. He is able,
      he is dogged, he is strong. And then comes a pretty face! Oh God! <i>Why</i>
      was I made with heart and brain?&rdquo; She sprang to her feet, with her
      hands clenched and her face contorted. But she shed no tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her attitude fell limp in a moment. One hand dropped by her side, the
      other rested on a fossil on the mantel-shelf, and she stared down into the
      red fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of all we might have done! It maddens me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To work, and think, and learn. To hope and wait. To despise the
      petty arts of womanliness, to trust to the sanity of man....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To awake like the foolish virgins,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and find
      the hour of life is past!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face, her pose, softened into self-pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Futility ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good....&rdquo; Her voice broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never be happy....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the grandiose vision of the future she had cherished suddenly
      rolled aside and vanishing, more and more splendid as it grew more and
      more remote&mdash;like a dream at the waking moment. The vision of her
      inevitable loneliness came to replace it, clear and acute. She saw herself
      alone and small in a huge desolation&mdash;infinitely pitiful, Lewisham
      callously receding with &ldquo;some shop girl.&rdquo; The tears came, came
      faster, until they were streaming down her face. She turned as if looking
      for something. She flung herself upon her knees before the little
      arm-chair, and began an incoherent sobbing prayer for the pity and comfort
      of God.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The next day one of the other girls in the biological course remarked to
      her friend that &ldquo;Heydinger-dingery&rdquo; had relapsed. Her friend
      glanced down the laboratory. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad relapse,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Really ... I couldn&rsquo;t ... wear my hair like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to regard Miss Heydinger with a critical eye. She was free
      to do this because Miss Heydinger was standing, lost in thought, staring
      at the December fog outside the laboratory windows. &ldquo;She looks
      white,&rdquo; said the girl who had originally spoken. &ldquo;I wonder if
      she works hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes precious little difference if she does,&rdquo; said her
      friend. &ldquo;I asked her yesterday what were the bones in the parietal
      segment, and she didn&rsquo;t know one. Not one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Miss Heydinger&rsquo;s place was vacant. She was ill&mdash;from
      overstudy&mdash;and her illness lasted to within three weeks of the
      terminal examination. Then she came back with a pallid face and a
      strenuous unavailing industry.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; IN THE RAPHAEL GALLERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was nearly three o&rsquo;clock, and in the Biological Laboratory the
      lamps were all alight. The class was busy with razors cutting sections of
      the root of a fern to examine it microscopically. A certain silent
      frog-like boy, a private student who plays no further part in this story,
      was working intently, looking more like a frog than usual&mdash;his
      expression modest with a touch of effort. Behind Miss Heydinger, jaded and
      untidy in her early manner again, was a vacant seat, an abandoned
      microscope and scattered pencils and note-books.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the door of the class-room was a list of those who had passed the
      Christmas examination. At the head of it was the name of the aforesaid
      frog-like boy; next to him came Smithers and one of the girls bracketed
      together. Lewisham ingloriously headed the second class, and Miss
      Heydinger&rsquo;s name did not appear&mdash;there was, the list asserted,
      &ldquo;one failure.&rdquo; So the student pays for the finer emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the spacious solitude of the museum gallery devoted to the Raphael
      cartoons sat Lewisham, plunged in gloomy meditation. A negligent hand
      pulled thoughtfully at the indisputable moustache, with particular
      attention to such portions as were long enough to gnaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was trying to see the situation clearly. As he was just smarting
      acutely under his defeat, this speaks little for the clearness of his
      mind. The shadow of that defeat lay across everything, blotted out the
      light of his pride, shaded his honour, threw everything into a new
      perspective. The rich prettiness of his love-making had fled to some
      remote quarter of his being. Against the frog-like youngster he felt a
      savage animosity. And Smithers had betrayed him. He was angry, bitterly
      angry, with &ldquo;swats&rdquo; and &ldquo;muggers&rdquo; who spent their
      whole time grinding for these foolish chancy examinations. Nor had the
      practical examination been altogether fair, and one of the questions in
      the written portion was quite outside the lectures. Biver, Professor
      Biver, was an indiscriminating ass, he felt assured, and so too was Weeks,
      the demonstrator. But these obstacles could not blind his intelligence to
      the manifest cause of his overthrow, the waste of more than half his
      available evening, the best time for study in the twenty-four hours, day
      after day. And that was going on steadily, a perpetual leakage of time.
      To-night he would go to meet her again, and begin to accumulate to himself
      ignominy in the second part of the course, the botanical section, also.
      And so, reluctantly rejecting one cloudy excuse after another, he clearly
      focussed the antagonism between his relations to Ethel and his immediate
      ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things had come so easily to him for the last two years that he had taken
      his steady upward progress in life as assured. It had never occurred to
      him, when he went to intercept Ethel after that <i>siance</i>, that he
      went into any peril of that sort. Now he had had a sharp reminder. He
      began to shape a picture of the frog-like boy at home&mdash;he was a
      private student of the upper middle class&mdash;sitting in a convenient
      study with a writing-table, book-shelves, and a shaded lamp&mdash;Lewisham
      worked at his chest of drawers, with his greatcoat on, and his feet in the
      lowest drawer wrapped in all his available linen&mdash;and in the midst of
      incredible conveniences the frog-like boy was working, working, working.
      Meanwhile Lewisham toiled through the foggy streets, Chelsea-ward, or,
      after he had left her, tramped homeward&mdash;full of foolish imaginings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to think with bloodless lucidity of his entire relationship to
      Ethel. His softer emotions were in abeyance, but he told himself no lies.
      He cared for her, he loved to be with her and to talk to her and please
      her, but that was not all his desire. He thought of the bitter words of an
      orator at Hammersmith, who had complained that in our present civilisation
      even the elemental need of marriage was denied. Virtue had become a vice.
      &ldquo;We marry in fear and trembling, sex for a home is the woman&rsquo;s
      traffic, and the man comes to his heart&rsquo;s desire when his heart&rsquo;s
      desire is dead.&rdquo; The thing which had seemed a mere flourish, came
      back now with a terrible air of truth. Lewisham saw that it was a case of
      divergent ways. On the one hand that shining staircase to fame and power,
      that had been his dream from the very dawn of his adolescence, and on the
      other hand&mdash;Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if he chose Ethel, even then, would he have his choice? What would
      come of it? A few walks more or less! She was hopelessly poor, he was
      hopelessly poor, and this cheat of a Medium was her stepfather! After all
      she was not well-educated, she did not understand his work and his
      aims....
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly perceived with absolute conviction that after the <i>siance</i>
      he should have gone home and forgotten her. Why had he felt that
      irresistible impulse to seek her out? Why had his imagination spun such a
      strange web of possibilities about her? He was involved now, foolishly
      involved.... All his future was a sacrifice to this transitory ghost of
      love-making in the streets. He pulled spitefully at his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      His picture began to shape itself into Ethel, and her mysterious mother,
      and the vague dexterous Chaffery holding him back, entangled in an
      impalpable net from that bright and glorious ascent to performance and
      distinction. Leaky boots and the splash of cabs for all his life as his
      portion! Already the Forbes Medal, the immediate step, was as good as
      lost....
    </p>
    <p>
      What on earth had he been thinking about? He fell foul of his upbringing.
      Men of the upper or middle classes were put up to these things by their
      parents; they were properly warned against involving themselves in this
      love nonsense before they were independent. It was much better....
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was going. Not only his work&mdash;his scientific career, but
      the Debating Society, the political movement, all his work for
      Humanity.... Why not be resolute&mdash;even now?... Why not put the thing
      clearly and plainly to her? Or write? If he wrote now he could get the
      advantage of the evening at the Library. He must ask her to forgo these
      walks home&mdash;at least until the next examination. <i>She</i> would
      understand. He had a qualm of doubt whether she would understand.... He
      grew angry at this possibility. But it was no good mincing matters. If
      once he began to consider her&mdash;Why should he consider her in that
      way? Simply because she was unreasonable!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham had a transitory gust of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet that abandonment of the walks insisted on looking mean to him. And she
      would think it mean. Which was very much worse, somehow. <i>Why</i> mean?
      Why should she think it mean? He grew angry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portly museum policeman who had been watching him furtively, wondering
      why a student should sit in front of the &ldquo;Sacrifice of Lystra&rdquo;
      and gnaw lips and nails and moustache, and scowl and glare at that
      masterpiece, saw him rise suddenly to his feet with an air of resolution,
      spin on his heel, and set off with a quick step out of the gallery. He
      looked neither to the right nor the left. He passed out of sight down the
      staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to get some more moustache to eat, I suppose,&rdquo; said the
      policeman reflectively....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One &lsquo;ud think something had bit him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After some pensive moments the policeman strolled along down the gallery
      and came to a stop opposite the cartoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Figgers is a bit big for the houses,&rdquo; said the policeman,
      anxious to do impartial justice. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s Art. I lay
      &lsquo;<i>e</i> couldn&rsquo;t do anything ... not arf so good.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; THE FRIENDS OF PROGRESS MEET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night next but one after this meditation saw a new order in the world.
      A young lady dressed in an astrachan-edged jacket and with a face of
      diminished cheerfulness marched from Chelsea to Clapham alone, and
      Lewisham sat in the flickering electric light of the Education Library
      staring blankly over a business-like pile of books at unseen things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangement had not been effected without friction, the explanation
      had proved difficult. Evidently she did not appreciate the full
      seriousness of Lewisham&rsquo;s mediocre position in the list. &ldquo;But
      you have <i>passed</i> all right,&rdquo; she said. Neither could she grasp
      the importance of evening study. &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
      she said judicially; &ldquo;but I thought you were learning all day.&rdquo;
      She calculated the time consumed by their walk as half an hour, &ldquo;just
      one half hour;&rdquo; she forgot that he had to get to Chelsea and then to
      return to his lodgings. Her customary tenderness was veiled by an only too
      apparent resentment. First at him, and then when he protested, at Fate.
      &ldquo;I suppose it <i>has</i> to be,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course,
      it doesn&rsquo;t matter, I suppose, if we <i>don&rsquo;t</i> see each
      other quite so often,&rdquo; with a quiver of pale lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had returned from the parting with an uneasy mind, and that evening had
      gone in the composition of a letter that was to make things clearer. But
      his scientific studies rendered his prose style &ldquo;hard,&rdquo; and
      things he could whisper he could not write. His justification indeed did
      him no sort of justice. But her reception of it made her seem a very
      unreasonable person. He had some violent fluctuations. At times he was
      bitterly angry with her for her failure to see things as he did. He would
      wander about the museum conducting imaginary discussions with her and
      making even scathing remarks. At other times he had to summon all his
      powers of acrid discipline and all his memories of her resentful retorts,
      to keep himself from a headlong rush to Chelsea and unmanly capitulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this new disposition of things endured for two weeks. It did not take
      Miss Heydinger all that time to discover that the disaster of the
      examination had wrought a change in Lewisham. She perceived those nightly
      walks were over. It was speedily evident to her that he was working with a
      kind of dogged fury; he came early, he went late. The wholesome freshness
      of his cheek paled. He was to be seen on each of the late nights amidst a
      pile of diagrams and text-books in one of the less draughty corners of the
      Educational Library, accumulating piles of memoranda. And nightly in the
      Students&rsquo; &ldquo;club&rdquo; he wrote a letter addressed to a
      stationer&rsquo;s shop in Clapham, but that she did not see. For the most
      part these letters were brief, for Lewisham, South Kensington fashion,
      prided himself upon not being &ldquo;literary,&rdquo; and some of the more
      despatch-like wounded a heart perhaps too hungry for tender words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not meet Miss Heydinger&rsquo;s renewed advances with invariable
      kindness. Yet something of the old relations were presently restored. He
      would talk well to her for a time, and then snap like a dry twig. But the
      loaning of books was resumed, the subtle process of his aesthetic
      education that Miss Heydinger had devised. &ldquo;Here is a book I
      promised you,&rdquo; she said one day, and he tried to remember the
      promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book was a collection of Browning&rsquo;s Poems, and it contained
      &ldquo;Sludge&rdquo;; it also happened that it contained &ldquo;The Statue
      and the Bust&rdquo;&mdash;that stimulating lecture on half-hearted
      constraints. &ldquo;Sludge&rdquo; did not interest Lewisham, it was not at
      all his idea of a medium, but he read and re-read &ldquo;The Statue and
      the Bust.&rdquo; It had the profoundest effect upon him. He went to sleep&mdash;he
      used to read his literature in bed because it was warmer there, and over
      literature nowadays it did not matter as it did with science if one dozed
      a little&mdash;with these lines stimulating his emotion:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;So weeks grew months, years; gleam by gleam
    The glory dropped from their youth and love,
    And both perceived they had dreamed a dream.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      By way of fruit it may be to such seed, he dreamed a dream that night. It
      concerned Ethel, and at last they were a-marrying. He drew her to his
      arms. He bent to kiss her. And suddenly he saw her lips were shrivelled
      and her eyes were dull, saw the wrinkles seaming her face! She was old!
      She was intolerably old! He woke in a kind of horror and lay awake and
      very dismal until dawn, thinking of their separation and of her solitary
      walk through the muddy streets, thinking of his position, the leeway he
      had lost and the chances there were against him in the battle of the
      world. He perceived the colourless truth; the Career was improbable, and
      that Ethel should be added to it was almost hopeless. Clearly the question
      was between these two. Or should he vacillate and lose both? And then his
      wretchedness gave place to that anger that comes of perpetually thwarted
      desires....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the day after this dream that he insulted Parkson so grossly. He
      insulted Parkson after a meeting of the &ldquo;Friends of Progress&rdquo;
      at Parkson&rsquo;s rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      No type of English student quite realises the noble ideal of plain living
      and high thinking nowadays. Our admirable examination system admits of
      extremely little thinking at any level, high or low. But the Kensington
      student&rsquo;s living is at any rate insufficient, and he makes
      occasional signs of recognition towards the cosmic process.
    </p>
    <p>
      One such sign was the periodic gathering of these &ldquo;Friends of
      Progress,&rdquo; an association begotten of Lewisham&rsquo;s paper on
      Socialism. It was understood that strenuous things were to be done to make
      the world better, but so far no decisive action had been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met in Parkson&rsquo;s sitting-room, because Parkson was the only one
      of the Friends opulent enough to have a sitting-room, he being a Whitworth
      Scholar and in receipt of one hundred pounds a year. The Friends were of
      various ages, mostly very young. Several smoked and others held pipes
      which they had discontinued smoking&mdash;but there was nothing to drink,
      except coffee, because that was the extent of their means. Dunkerley, an
      assistant master in a suburban school, and Lewisham&rsquo;s former
      colleague at Whortley, attended these assemblies through the introduction
      of Lewisham. All the Friends wore red ties except Bletherley, who wore an
      orange one to show that he was aware of Art, and Dunkerley, who wore a
      black one with blue specks, because assistant masters in small private
      schools have to keep up appearances. And their simple procedure was that
      each talked as much as the others would suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually the self-proposed &ldquo;Luther of Socialism&rdquo;&mdash;ridiculous
      Lewisham!&mdash;had a thesis or so to maintain, but this night he was
      depressed and inattentive. He sat with his legs over the arm of his chair
      by way of indicating the state of his mind. He had a packet of Algerian
      cigarettes (twenty for fivepence), and appeared chiefly concerned to smoke
      them all before the evening was out. Bletherley was going to discourse of
      &ldquo;Woman under Socialism,&rdquo; and he brought a big American edition
      of Shelley&rsquo;s works and a volume of Tennyson with the &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo;
      both bristling with paper tongues against his marked quotations. He was
      all for the abolition of &ldquo;monopolies,&rdquo; and the <i>criche</i>
      was to replace the family. He was unctuous when he was not pretty-pretty,
      and his views were evidently unpopular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parkson was a man from Lancashire, and a devout Quaker; his third and
      completing factor was Ruskin, with whose work and phraseology he was
      saturated. He listened to Bletherley with a marked disapproval, and opened
      a vigorous defence of that ancient tradition of loyalty that Bletherley
      had called the monopolist institution of marriage. &ldquo;The pure and
      simple old theory&mdash;love and faithfulness,&rdquo; said Parkson,
      &ldquo;suffices for me. If we are to smear our political movements with
      this sort of stuff ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it work?&rdquo; interjected Lewisham, speaking for the first
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pure and simple old theory. I know the theory. I believe in the
      theory. Bletherley&rsquo;s Shelley-witted. But it&rsquo;s theory. You meet
      the inevitable girl. The theory says you may meet her anywhen. You meet
      too young. You fall in love. You marry&mdash;in spite of obstacles. Love
      laughs at locksmiths. You have children. That&rsquo;s the theory. All very
      well for a man whose father can leave him five hundred a year. But how
      does it work for a shopman?... An assistant master like Dunkerley? Or ...
      Me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In these cases one must exercise restraint,&rdquo; said Parkson.
      &ldquo;Have faith. A man that is worth having is worth waiting for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth growing old for?&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chap ought to fight,&rdquo; said Dunkerley. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see
      your difficulty, Lewisham. Struggle for existence keen, no doubt,
      tremendous in fact&mdash;still. In it&mdash;may as well struggle. Two&mdash;join
      forces&mdash;pool the luck. If I saw, a girl I fancied so that I wanted
      to, I&rsquo;d marry her to-morrow. And my market value is seventy <i>non
      res</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham looked round at him eagerly, suddenly interested. &ldquo;<i>Would</i>
      you?&rdquo; he said. Dunkerley&rsquo;s face was slightly flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a shot. Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how are you to live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That comes after. If ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t agree with you, Mr. Dunkerley,&rdquo; said Parkson.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you have read Sesame and Lilies, but there
      you have, set forth far more fairly than any words of mine could do, an
      ideal of a woman&rsquo;s place ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All rot&mdash;Sesame and Lilies,&rdquo; interrupted Dunkerley.
      &ldquo;Read bits. Couldn&rsquo;t stand it. Never <i>can</i> stand Ruskin.
      Too many prepositions. Tremendous English, no doubt, but not my style.
      Sort of thing a wholesale grocer&rsquo;s daughter might read to get
      refined. <i>We</i> can&rsquo;t afford to get refined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would you really marry a girl ...?&rdquo; began Lewisham, with
      an unprecedented admiration for Dunkerley in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On&mdash;?&rdquo; Lewisham hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty pounds a year <i>res</i>. Whack! Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A silent youngster began to speak, cleared an accumulated huskiness from
      his throat and said, &ldquo;Consider the girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why <i>marry</i>?&rdquo; asked Bletherley, unregarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must admit you are asking a great thing when you want a girl
      ...&rdquo; began Parkson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so. When a girl&rsquo;s chosen a man, and he chooses her, her
      place is with him. What is the good of hankering? Mutual. Fight together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Lewisham, suddenly emotional. &ldquo;You talk
      like a man, Dunkerley. I&rsquo;m hanged if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place of Woman,&rdquo; insisted Parkson, &ldquo;is the Home.
      And if there is no home&mdash;! I hold that, if need be, a man should toil
      seven years&mdash;as Jacob did for Rachel&mdash;ruling his passions, to
      make the home fitting and sweet for her ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get the hutch for the pet animal,&rdquo; said Dunkerley. &ldquo;No.
      I mean to marry a <i>woman</i>. Female sex always <i>has</i> been in the
      struggle for existence&mdash;no great damage so far&mdash;always will be.
      Tremendous idea&mdash;that struggle for existence. Only sensible theory
      you&rsquo;ve got hold of, Lewisham. Woman who isn&rsquo;t fighting square
      side by side with a man&mdash;woman who&rsquo;s just kept and fed and
      petted is ...&rdquo; He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lad with a spotted face and a bulldog pipe between his teeth supplied a
      Biblical word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s shag,&rdquo; said Dunkerley, &ldquo;I was going to say
      &lsquo;a harem of one&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngster was puzzled for a moment. &ldquo;I smoke Perique,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make you just as sick,&rdquo; said Dunkerley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refinement&rsquo;s so beastly vulgar,&rdquo; was the belated answer
      of the smoker of Perique.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the interesting part of the evening to Lewisham. Parkson suddenly
      rose, got down &ldquo;Sesame and Lilies,&rdquo; and insisted upon reading
      a lengthy mellifluous extract that went like a garden roller over the
      debate, and afterwards Bletherley became the centre of a wrangle that left
      him grossly insulted and in a minority of one. The institution of
      marriage, so far as the South Kensington student is concerned, is in no
      immediate danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parkson turned out with the rest of them at half-past ten, for a walk. The
      night was warm for February and the waxing moon bright. Parkson fixed
      himself upon Lewisham and Dunkerley, to Lewisham&rsquo;s intense annoyance&mdash;for
      he had a few intimate things he could have said to the man of Ideas that
      night. Dunkerley lived north, so that the three went up Exhibition Road to
      High Street, Kensington. There they parted from Dunkerley, and Lewisham
      and Parkson turned southward again for Lewisham&rsquo;s new lodging in
      Chelsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parkson was one of those exponents of virtue for whom the discussion of
      sexual matters has an irresistible attraction. The meeting had left him
      eloquent. He had argued with Dunkerley to the verge of indelicacy, and now
      he poured out a vast and increasingly confidential flow of talk upon
      Lewisham. Lewisham was distraught. He walked as fast as he could. His sole
      object was to get rid of Parkson. Parkson&rsquo;s sole object was to tell
      him interesting secrets, about himself and a Certain Person with a mind of
      extraordinary Purity of whom Lewisham had heard before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ages passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham suddenly found himself being shown a photograph under a lamp. It
      represented an unsymmetrical face singularly void of expression, the upper
      part of an &ldquo;art&rdquo; dress, and a fringe of curls. He perceived he
      was being given to understand that this was a Paragon of Purity, and that
      she was the particular property of Parkson. Parkson was regarding him
      proudly, and apparently awaiting his verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham struggled with the truth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an interesting face,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a face essentially beautiful,&rdquo; said Parkson quietly but
      firmly. &ldquo;Do you notice the eyes, Lewisham?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;Yes. I see the eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are ... innocent. They are the eyes of a little child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They look that sort of eye. Very nice, old man. I congratulate
      you. Where does she live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw a face like that in London,&rdquo; said Parkson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Never</i>,&rdquo; said Lewisham decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not show that to every one,&rdquo; said Parkson. &ldquo;You
      can scarcely judge all that pure-hearted, wonderful girl is to me.&rdquo;
      He returned the photograph solemnly to its envelope, regarding Lewisham
      with an air of one who has performed the ceremony of blood-brotherhood.
      Then taking Lewisham&rsquo;s arm affectionately&mdash;a thing Lewisham
      detested&mdash;he went on to a copious outpouring on Love&mdash;with
      illustrative anecdotes of the Paragon. It was just sufficiently cognate to
      the matter of Lewisham&rsquo;s thoughts to demand attention. Every now and
      then he had to answer, and he felt an idiotic desire&mdash;albeit he
      clearly perceived its idiocy&mdash;to reciprocate confidences. The
      necessity of fleeing Parkson became urgent&mdash;Lewisham&rsquo;s temper
      under these multitudinous stresses was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man needs a Lode Star,&rdquo; said Parkson&mdash;and Lewisham
      swore under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parkson&rsquo;s lodgings were now near at hand to the left, and it
      occurred to him this boredom would be soonest ended if he took Parkson
      home, Parkson consented mechanically, still discoursing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often seen you talking to Miss Heydinger,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;If you will pardon my saying it ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are excellent friends,&rdquo; admitted Lewisham. &ldquo;But here
      we are at your diggings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Parkson stared at his &ldquo;diggings.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Heaps I
      want to talk about. I&rsquo;ll come part of the way at any rate to
      Battersea. Your Miss Heydinger, I was saying ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From that point onwards he made casual appeals to a supposed confidence
      between Lewisham and Miss Heydinger, each of which increased Lewisham&rsquo;s
      exasperation. &ldquo;It will not be long before you also, Lewisham, will
      begin to know the infinite purification of a Pure Love....&rdquo; Then
      suddenly, with a vague idea of suppressing Parkson&rsquo;s unendurable
      chatter, as one motive at least, Lewisham rushed into the confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You talk to me as though ... I&rsquo;ve
      marked out my destiny these three years.&rdquo; His confidential impulse
      died as he relieved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say Miss Heydinger&mdash;?&rdquo; asked
      Parkson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>damn</i> Miss Heydinger!&rdquo; said Lewisham, and suddenly,
      abruptly, uncivilly, he turned away from Parkson at the end of the street
      and began walking away southward, leaving Parkson in mid-sentence at the
      crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parkson stared in astonishment at his receding back and ran after him to
      ask for the grounds of this sudden offence. Lewisham walked on for a space
      with Parkson trotting by his side. Then suddenly he turned. His face was
      quite white and he spoke in a tired voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parkson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a fool!... You have the
      face of a sheep, the manners of a buffalo, and the conversation of a bore,
      Pewrity indeed!... The girl whose photograph you showed me has eyes that
      don&rsquo;t match. She looks as loathsome as one would naturally
      expect.... I&rsquo;m not joking now.... Go away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Lewisham went on his southward way alone. He did not go
      straight to his room in Chelsea, but spent some hours in a street in
      Battersea, pacing to and fro in front of a possible house. His passion
      changed from savageness to a tender longing. If only he could see her
      to-night! He knew his own mind now. To-morrow he was resolved <i>he</i>
      would fling work to the dogs and meet her. The things Dunkerley had said
      had filled his mind with wonderful novel thoughts. If only he could see
      her now!
    </p>
    <p>
      His wish was granted. At the corner of the street two figures passed him;
      one of these, a tall man in glasses and a quasi-clerical hat, with coat
      collar turned up under his grey side-whiskers, he recognised as Chaffery;
      the other he knew only too well. The pair passed him without seeing him,
      but for an instant the lamplight fell upon her face and showed it white
      and tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham stopped dead at the corner, staring in blank astonishment after
      these two figures as they receded into the haze under the lights. He was
      dumfounded. A clock struck slowly. It was midnight. Presently down the
      road came the slamming of their door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after the echo died away he stood there. &ldquo;She has been at a <i>siance</i>;
      she has broken her promise. She has been at a <i>siance</i>; she has
      broken her promise,&rdquo; sang in perpetual reiteration through his
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the interpretation. &ldquo;She has done it because I have
      left her. I might have told it from her letters. She has done it because
      she thinks I am not in earnest, that my love-making was just boyishness
      ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew she would never understand.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; LEWISHAM&rsquo;S SOLUTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Lewisham learnt from Lagune that his intuition was
      correct, that Ethel had at last succumbed to pressure and consented to
      attempt thought-reading. &ldquo;We made a good beginning,&rdquo; said
      Lagune, rubbing his hands. &ldquo;I am sure we shall do well with her.
      Certainly she has powers. I have always felt it in her face. She has
      powers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was much ... pressure necessary?&rdquo; asked Lewisham by an
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had&mdash;considerable difficulty. Considerable. But of course&mdash;as
      I pointed out to her&mdash;it was scarcely possible for her to continue as
      my typewriter unless she was disposed to take an interest in my
      investigations&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had to. Fortunately Chaffery&mdash;it was his idea. I must admit&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagune stopped astonished. Lewisham, after making an odd sort of movement
      with his hands, had turned round and was walking away down the laboratory.
      Lagune stared; confronted by a psychic phenomenon beyond his circle of
      ideas. &ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; he said at last, and began to unpack his bag.
      Ever and again he stopped and stared at Lewisham, who was now sitting in
      his own place and drumming on the table with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Miss Heydinger came out of the specimen room and addressed a
      remark to the young man. He appeared to answer with considerable brevity.
      He then stood up, hesitated for a moment between the three doors of the
      laboratory and walked out by that opening on the back staircase. Lagune
      did not see him again until the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Ethel had Lewisham&rsquo;s company again on her way home, and
      their voices were earnest. She did not go straight home, but instead they
      went up under the gas lamps to the vague spaces of Clapham Common to talk
      there at length. And the talk that night was a momentous one. &ldquo;Why
      have you broken your promise?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her excuses were vague and weak. &ldquo;I thought you did not care so much
      as you did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And when you stopped these walks&mdash;nothing
      seemed to matter. Besides&mdash;it is not like <i>siances</i> with spirits
      ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Lewisham was passionate and forcible. His anger at Lagune and
      Chaffery blinded him to her turpitude. He talked her defences down.
      &ldquo;It is cheating,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well&mdash;even if what <i>you</i>
      do is not cheating, it is delusion&mdash;unconscious cheating. Even if
      there is something in it, it is wrong. True or not, it is wrong. Why don&rsquo;t
      they thought-read each other? Why should they want you? Your mind is your
      own. It is sacred. To probe it!&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have it! I won&rsquo;t
      have it! At least you are mine to that extent. I can&rsquo;t think of you
      like that&mdash;bandaged. And that little fool pressing his hand on the
      back of your neck and asking questions. I won&rsquo;t have it! I would
      rather kill you than that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! that is what it will come to. The bandage is
      the beginning. People must not get their living in that way anyhow. I&rsquo;ve
      thought it out. Let them thought-read their daughters and hypnotise their
      aunts, and leave their typewriters alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. There are things one must not suffer anyhow,
      whatever happens! Or else&mdash;one might be made to do anything. Honour!
      Just because we are poor&mdash;Let him dismiss you! <i>Let</i> him dismiss
      you. You can get another place&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at a guinea a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take less.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have to pay sixteen shillings every week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught at a sob, &ldquo;But to leave London&mdash;I can&rsquo;t do it,
      I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&mdash;Leave London?&rdquo; Lewisham&rsquo;s face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! life is <i>hard</i>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.
      They&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t let me stop in London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained if Lagune dismissed her she was to go into the country to an
      aunt, a sister of Chaffery&rsquo;s who needed a companion. Chaffery
      insisted upon that. &ldquo;Companion they call it. I shall be just a
      servant&mdash;she has no servant. My mother cries when I talk to her. She
      tells me she doesn&rsquo;t want me to go away from her. But she&rsquo;s
      afraid of him. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do what he wants?&rsquo; she
      says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat staring in front of her at the gathering night. She spoke again in
      an even tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate telling you these things. It is you ... If you didn&rsquo;t
      mind ... But you make it all different. I could do it&mdash;if it wasn&rsquo;t
      for you. I was ... I <i>was</i> helping ... I had gone meaning to help if
      anything went wrong at Mr. Lagune&rsquo;s. Yes&mdash;that night. No ...
      don&rsquo;t! It was too hard before to tell you. But I really did not feel
      it ... until I saw you there. Then all at once I felt shabby and mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. I may have done thought-reading, but I have never
      really cheated since&mdash;<i>never</i>.... If you knew how hard it is ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had told me that before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t. Before you came it was different. He used to make
      fun of the people&mdash;used to imitate Lagune and make me laugh. It
      seemed a sort of joke.&rdquo; She stopped abruptly. &ldquo;Why did you
      ever come on with me? I told you not to&mdash;you <i>know</i> I did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was near wailing. For a minute she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to his sister&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
      may be a coward&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause. And then Lewisham saw his solution straight and clear. Suddenly his
      secret desire had become his manifest duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, not looking at her and pulling his
      moustache. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you doing any more of that damned
      cheating. You shan&rsquo;t soil yourself any more. And I won&rsquo;t have
      you leaving London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo; Her voice went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;there is one thing you can do. If you dare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer for some seconds. Then he turned round and sat looking
      at her. Their eyes met....
    </p>
    <p>
      The grey of his mind began to colour. Her face was white and she was
      looking at him, in fear and perplexity. A new tenderness for her sprang up
      in him&mdash;a new feeling. Hitherto he had loved and desired her
      sweetness and animation&mdash;but now she was white and weary-eyed. He
      felt as though he had forgotten her and suddenly remembered. A great
      longing came into his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the other thing I can do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strangely hard to say. There came a peculiar sensation in his
      throat and facial muscles, a nervous stress between laughing and crying.
      All the world vanished before that great desire. And he was afraid she
      would not dare, that she would not take him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that we can marry?&rdquo; he said, with the
      flood of his resolution suddenly strong and steady. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      see that is the only thing for us? The dead lane we are in! You must come
      out of your cheating, and I must come out of my ... cramming. And we&mdash;we
      must marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and then became eloquent. &ldquo;The world is against us,
      against&mdash;us. To you it offers money to cheat&mdash;to be ignoble. For
      it <i>is</i> ignoble! It offers you no honest way, only a miserable
      drudgery. And it keeps you from me. And me too it bribes with the promise
      of success&mdash;if I will desert you ... You don&rsquo;t know all ... We
      may have to wait for years&mdash;we may have to wait for ever, if we wait
      until life is safe. We may be separated.... We may lose one another
      altogether.... Let us fight against it. Why should we separate? Unless
      True Love is like the other things&mdash;an empty cant. This is the only
      way. We two&mdash;who belong to one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, her face perplexed with this new idea, her heart
      beating very fast. &ldquo;We are so young,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And how
      are we to live? You get a guinea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can get more&mdash;I can earn more, I have thought it out. I have
      been thinking of it these two days. I have been thinking what we could do.
      I have money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly a hundred pounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are so young&mdash;And my mother ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t ask her. We will ask no one. This is <i>our</i>
      affair. Ethel! this is <i>our</i> affair. It is not a question of ways and
      means&mdash;even before this&mdash;I have thought ... Dear one!&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;t</i>
      you love me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not grasp his emotional quality. She looked at him with puzzled
      eyes&mdash;still practical&mdash;making the suggestion arithmetical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could typewrite if I had a machine. I have heard&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of ways and means. Now. Ethel&mdash;I
      have longed&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. She looked at his face, at his eyes now eager and eloquent
      with the things that never shaped themselves into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dare</i> you come with me?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the world opened out in reality to her as sometimes it had opened
      out to her in wistful dreams. And she quailed before it. She dropped her
      eyes from his. She became a fellow-conspirator. &ldquo;But, how&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think how. Trust me! Surely we know each other now&mdash;Think!
      We two&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have never thought&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could get apartments for us both. It would be so easy. And think
      of it&mdash;think&mdash;of what life would be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, startled. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
      must know I would like&mdash;I would love&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear&mdash;! Dear, if you <i>make</i> me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Lewisham triumphantly. &ldquo;You will come.&rdquo;
      He glanced round and his voice dropped. &ldquo;Oh! my dearest! my
      dearest!...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice sank to an inaudible whisper. But his face was eloquent. Two
      garrulous, home-going clerks passed opportunely to remind him that his
      emotions were in a public place.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; THE CAREER IS SUSPENDED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the Wednesday afternoon following this&mdash;it was hard upon the
      botanical examination&mdash;Mr. Lewisham was observed by Smithers in the
      big Education Library reading in a volume of the British Encyclopaedia.
      Beside him were the current Whitaker&rsquo;s Almanac, an open note-book, a
      book from the Contemporary Science Series, and the Science and Art
      Department&rsquo;s Directory. Smithers, who had a profound sense of
      Lewisham&rsquo;s superiority in the art of obtaining facts of value in
      examinations, wondered for some minutes what valuable tip for a student in
      botany might be hidden in Whitaker, and on reaching his lodgings spent some
      time over the landlady&rsquo;s copy. But really Lewisham was not studying
      botany, but the art of marriage according to the best authorities. (The
      book from the Contemporary Science Series was Professor Letourneau&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Evolution of Marriage.&rdquo; It was interesting certainly, but of
      little immediate use.)
    </p>
    <p>
      From Whitaker Lewisham learnt that it would be possible at a cost of #2,
      6s. 1d. or #2, 7s. 1d. (one of the items was ambiguous) to get married
      within the week&mdash;that charge being exclusive of vails&mdash;at the
      district registry office. He did little addition sums in the note-book.
      The church fees he found were variable, but for more personal reasons he
      rejected a marriage at church. Marriage by certificate at a registrar&rsquo;s
      involved an inconvenient delay. It would have to be #2, 7s. 1d. Vails&mdash;ten
      shillings, say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, without needless ostentation, he produced a cheque-book and a
      deposit-book, and proceeded to further arithmetic. He found that he was
      master of #61, 4s. 7d. Not a hundred as he had said, but a fine big sum&mdash;men
      have started great businesses on less. It had been a hundred originally.
      Allowing five pounds for the marriage and moving, this would leave about
      #56. Plenty. No provision was made for flowers, carriages, or the
      honeymoon. But there would be a typewriter to buy. Ethel was to do her
      share....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a devilish close thing,&rdquo; said Lewisham with a
      quite unreasonable exultation. For, strangely enough, the affair was
      beginning to take on a flavour of adventure not at all unpleasant. He
      leant back in his chair with the note-book closed in his hand....
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was much to see to that afternoon. First of all he had to
      discover the district superintendent registrar, and then to find a lodging
      whither he should take Ethel&mdash;their lodging, where they were to live
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the thought of that new life together that was drawing so near, she
      came into his head, vivid and near and warm....
    </p>
    <p>
      He recovered himself from a day dream. He became aware of a library
      attendant down the room leaning forward over his desk, gnawing the tip of
      a paper knife after the fashion of South Kensington library attendants,
      and staring at him curiously. It occurred to Lewisham that thought reading
      was one of the most possible things in the world. He blushed, rose
      clumsily and took the volume of the Encyclopaedia back to its shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the selection of lodgings a difficult business. After his first
      essay he began to fancy himself a suspicious-looking character, and that
      perhaps hampered him. He had chosen the district southward of the Brompton
      Road. It had one disadvantage&mdash;he might blunder into a house with a
      fellow-student.... Not that it mattered vitally. But the fact is, it is
      rather unusual for married couples to live permanently in furnished
      lodgings in London. People who are too poor to take a house or a flat
      commonly find it best to take part of a house or unfurnished apartments.
      There are a hundred couples living in unfurnished rooms (with &ldquo;the
      use of the kitchen&rdquo;) to one in furnished in London. The absence of
      furniture predicates a dangerous want of capital to the discreet landlady.
      The first landlady Lewisham interviewed didn&rsquo;t like ladies, they
      required such a lot of attendance; the second was of the same mind; the
      third told Mr. Lewisham he was &ldquo;youngish to be married;&rdquo; the
      fourth said she only &ldquo;did&rdquo; for single &ldquo;gents.&rdquo; The
      fifth was a young person with an arch manner, who liked to know all about
      people she took in, and subjected Lewisham to a searching
      cross-examination. When she had spitted him in a downright lie or so, she
      expressed an opinion that her rooms &ldquo;would scarcely do,&rdquo; and
      bowed him amiably out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cooled his ears and cheeks by walking up and down the street for a
      space, and then tried again. This landlady was a terrible and pitiful
      person, so grey and dusty she was, and her face deep lined with dust and
      trouble and labour. She wore a dirty cap that was all askew. She took
      Lewisham up into a threadbare room on the first floor, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      the use of a piano,&rdquo; she said, and indicated an instrument with a
      front of torn green silk. Lewisham opened the keyboard and evoked a
      vibration of broken strings. He took one further survey of the dismal
      place, &ldquo;Eighteen shillings,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thank you ... I&rsquo;ll
      let you know.&rdquo; The woman smiled with the corners of her mouth down,
      and without a word moved wearily towards the door. Lewisham felt a
      transient wonder at her hopeless position, but he did not pursue the
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next landlady sufficed. She was a clean-looking German woman, rather
      smartly dressed; she had a fringe of flaxen curls and a voluble flow of
      words, for the most part recognisably English. With this she sketched out
      remarks. Fifteen shillings was her demand for a minute bedroom and a small
      sitting-room, separated by folding doors on the ground floor, and her
      personal services. Coals were to be &ldquo;sixpence a kettle,&rdquo; she
      said&mdash;a pretty substitute for scuttle. She had not understood
      Lewisham to say he was married. But she had no hesitation. &ldquo;Aayteen
      shillin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said imperturbably. &ldquo;Paid furs day ich
      wik ... See?&rdquo; Mr. Lewisham surveyed the rooms again. They looked
      clean, and the bonus tea vases, the rancid, gilt-framed oleographs, two
      toilet tidies used as ornaments, and the fact that the chest of drawers
      had been crowded out of the bedroom into the sitting-room, simply appealed
      to his sense of humour. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em from Saturday
      next,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sure he would like them, and proposed to give him his book
      forthwith. She mentioned casually that the previous lodger had been a
      captain and had stayed three years. (One never hears by any chance of
      lodgers stopping for a shorter period.) Something happened (German) and
      now he kept his carriage&mdash;apparently an outcome of his stay. She
      returned with a small penny account-book, a bottle of ink and an execrable
      pen, wrote Lewisham&rsquo;s name on the cover of this, and a receipt for
      eighteen shillings on the first page. She was evidently a person of
      considerable business aptitude. Lewisham paid, and the transaction
      terminated. &ldquo;Szhure to be gomfortable,&rdquo; followed him
      comfortingly to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on to Chelsea and interviewed a fatherly gentleman at the
      Vestry offices. The fatherly gentleman was chubby-faced and spectacled,
      and his manner was sympathetic but business-like. He &ldquo;called back&rdquo;
      each item of the interview, &ldquo;And what can I do for you? You wish to
      be married! By licence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By licence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By licence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so forth. He opened a book and made neat entries of the particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady&rsquo;s age?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very suitable age ... for a lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He advised Lewisham to get a ring, and said he would need two witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Well</i>&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always someone about,&rdquo; said the superintendent
      registrar. &ldquo;And they are quite used to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday and Friday Lewisham passed in exceedingly high spirits. No
      consciousness of the practical destruction of the Career seems to have
      troubled him at this time. Doubt had vanished from his universe for a
      space. He wanted to dance along the corridors. He felt curiously
      irresponsible and threw up an unpleasant sort of humour that pleased
      nobody. He wished Miss Heydinger many happy returns of the day, <i>apropos</i>
      of nothing, and he threw a bun across the refreshment room at Smithers and
      hit one of the Art School officials. Both were extremely silly things to
      do. In the first instance he was penitent immediately after the outrage,
      but in the second he added insult to injury by going across the room and
      asking in an offensively suspicious manner if anyone had seen his bun. He
      crawled under a table and found it at last, rather dusty but quite
      eatable, under the chair of a lady art student. He sat down by Smithers to
      eat it, while he argued with the Art official. The Art official said the
      manners of the Science students were getting unbearable, and threatened to
      bring the matter before the refreshment-room committee. Lewisham said it
      was a pity to make such a fuss about a trivial thing, and proposed that
      the Art official should throw his lunch&mdash;steak and kidney pudding&mdash;across
      the room at him, Lewisham, and so get immediate satisfaction. He then
      apologised to the official and pointed out in extenuation that it was a
      very long and difficult shot he had attempted. The official then drank a
      crumb, or breathed some beer, or something of that sort, and the
      discussion terminated. In the afternoon, however, Lewisham, to his undying
      honour, felt acutely ashamed of himself. Miss Heydinger would not speak to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday morning he absented himself from the schools, pleading by post
      a slight indisposition, and took all his earthly goods to the booking
      office at Vauxhall Station. Chaffery&rsquo;s sister lived at Tongham, near
      Farnham, and Ethel, dismissed a week since by Lagune, had started that
      morning, under her mother&rsquo;s maudlin supervision, to begin her new
      slavery. She was to alight either at Farnham or Woking, as opportunity
      arose, and to return to Vauxhall to meet him. So that Lewisham&rsquo;s
      vigil on the main platform was of indefinite duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he felt the exhilaration of a great adventure. Then, as he paced
      the long platform, came a philosophical mood, a sense of entire detachment
      from the world. He saw a bundle of uprooted plants beside the portmanteau
      of a fellow-passenger and it suggested a grotesque simile. His roots, his
      earthly possessions, were all downstairs in the booking-office. What a
      flimsy thing he was! A box of books and a trunk of clothes, some
      certificates and scraps of paper, an entry here and an entry there, a body
      not over strong&mdash;and the vast multitude of people about him&mdash;against
      him&mdash;the huge world in which he found himself! Did it matter anything
      to one human soul save her if he ceased to exist forthwith? And miles away
      perhaps she also was feeling little and lonely....
    </p>
    <p>
      Would she have trouble with her luggage? Suppose her aunt were to come to
      Farnham Junction to meet her? Suppose someone stole her purse? Suppose she
      came too late! The marriage was to take place at two.... Suppose she never
      came at all! After three trains in succession had disappointed him his
      vague feelings of dread gave place to a profound depression....
    </p>
    <p>
      But she came at last, and it was twenty-three minutes to two. He hurried
      her luggage downstairs, booked it with his own, and in another minute they
      were in a hansom&mdash;their first experience of that species of
      conveyance&mdash;on the way to the Vestry office. They had said scarcely
      anything to one another, save hasty directions from Lewisham, but their
      eyes were full of excitement, and under the apron of the cab their hands
      were gripped together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old gentleman was business-like but kindly. They made their
      vows to him, to a little black-bearded clerk and a lady who took off an
      apron in the nether part of the building to attend. The little old
      gentleman made no long speeches. &ldquo;You are young people,&rdquo; he
      said slowly, &ldquo;and life together is a difficult thing.... Be kind to
      each other.&rdquo; He smiled a little sadly, and held out a friendly hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s eyes glistened and she found she could not speak.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; HOME!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then a furtive payment of witnesses, and Lewisham was beside her. His face
      was radiant. A steady current of workers going home to their half-holiday
      rest poured along the street. On the steps before them lay a few grains of
      rice from some more public nuptials.
    </p>
    <p>
      A critical little girl eyed our couple curiously and made some remark to
      her ragamuffin friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not them,&rdquo; said the ragamuffin friend, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
      only been askin&rsquo; questions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ragamuffin friend was no judge of faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked back through the thronged streets to Vauxhall station, saying
      little to one another, and there Lewisham, assuming as indifferent a
      manner as he could command, recovered their possessions from the
      booking-office by means of two separate tickets and put them aboard a
      four-wheeler. His luggage went outside, but the little brown portmanteau
      containing Ethel&rsquo;s trousseau was small enough to go on the seat in
      front of them. You must figure a rather broken-down four-wheeler bearing
      the yellow-painted box and the experienced trunk and Mr. Lewisham and all
      his fortunes, a despondent fitful horse, and a threadbare venerable
      driver, blasphemous <i>sotto voce</i> and flagellant, in an ancient coat
      with capes. When our two young people found themselves in the cab again a
      certain stiffness of manner between them vanished and there was more
      squeezing of hands. &ldquo;Ethel <i>Lewisham</i>,&rdquo; said Lewisham
      several times, and Ethel reciprocated with &ldquo;Husbinder&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Hubby dear,&rdquo; and took off her glove to look again in an
      ostentatious manner at a ring. And she kissed the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were resolved that their newly-married state should not appear, and
      with considerable ceremony it was arranged that he should treat her with
      off-hand brusqueness when they arrived at their lodging. The Teutonic
      landlady appeared in the passage with an amiable smile and the hope that
      they had had a pleasant journey, and became voluble with promises of
      comfort. Lewisham having assisted the slatternly general servant to carry
      in his boxes, paid the cabman a florin in a resolute manner and followed
      the ladies into the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel answered Madam Gadow&rsquo;s inquiries with admirable
      self-possession, followed her through the folding-doors and displayed an
      intelligent interest in a new spring mattress. Presently the folding-doors
      were closed again. Lewisham hovered about the front room pulling his
      moustache and pretending to admire the oleographs, surprised to find
      himself trembling....
    </p>
    <p>
      The slatternly general servant reappeared with the chops and tinned salmon
      he had asked Madam Gadow to prepare for them. He went and stared out of
      the window, heard the door close behind the girl, and turned at a sound as
      Ethel appeared shyly through the folding-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was suddenly domestic. Hitherto he had seen her without a hat and
      jacket only on one indistinct dramatic occasion. Now she wore a little
      blouse of soft, dark red material, with a white froth about the wrists and
      that pretty neck of hers. And her hair was a new wonderland of curls and
      soft strands. How delicate she looked and sweet as she stood hesitating
      there. These gracious moments in life! He took two steps and held out his
      arms. She glanced at the closed door of the room and came flitting towards
      him....
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; EPITHALAMY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For three indelible days Lewisham&rsquo;s existence was a fabric of fine
      emotions, life was too wonderful and beautiful for any doubts or
      forethought. To be with Ethel was perpetual delight&mdash;she astonished
      this sisterless youngster with a thousand feminine niceties and
      refinements. She shamed him for his strength and clumsiness. And the light
      in her eyes and the warmth in her heart that lit them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to be away from her was a wonder and in its way delightful. He was no
      common Student, he was a man with a Secret Life. To part from her on
      Monday near South Kensington station and go up Exhibition Road among all
      the fellows who lived in sordid, lonely lodgings and were boys to his
      day-old experience! To neglect one&rsquo;s work and sit back and dream of
      meeting again! To slip off to the shady churchyard behind the Oratory
      when, or even a little before, the midday bell woke the great staircase to
      activity, and to meet a smiling face and hear a soft, voice saying sweet
      foolish things! And after four another meeting and the walk home&mdash;their
      own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      No little form now went from him and flitted past a gas lamp down a foggy
      vista, taking his desire with her. Never more was that to be. Lewisham&rsquo;s
      long hours in the laboratory were spent largely in a dreamy meditation, in&mdash;to
      tell the truth&mdash;the invention of foolish terms of endearment: &ldquo;Dear
      Wife,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear Little Wife Thing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweetest Dearest
      Little Wife,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dillywings.&rdquo; A pretty employment! And
      these are quite a fair specimen of his originality during those wonderful
      days. A moment of heart-searching in that particular matter led to the
      discovery of hitherto undreamt-of kindred with Swift. For Lewisham, like
      Swift and most other people, had hit upon, the Little Language. Indeed it
      was a very foolish time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such section cutting as he did that third day of his married life&mdash;and
      he did very little&mdash;was a thing to marvel at. Bindon, the botany
      professor, under the fresh shock of his performance, protested to a
      colleague in the grill room that never had a student been so foolishly
      overrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ethel too had a fine emotional time. She was mistress of a home&mdash;<i>their</i>
      home together. She shopped and was called &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; by
      respectful, good-looking shopmen; she designed meals and copied out papers
      of notes with a rich sense of helpfulness. And ever and again she would
      stop writing and sit dreaming. And for four bright week-days she went to
      and fro to accompany and meet Lewisham and listen greedily to the latest
      fruits of his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady was very polite and conversed entertainingly about the very
      extraordinary and dissolute servants that had fallen to her lot. And Ethel
      disguised her newly wedded state by a series of ingenious prevarications.
      She wrote a letter that Saturday evening to her mother&mdash;Lewisham had
      helped her to write it&mdash;making a sort of proclamation of her heroic
      departure and promising a speedy visit. They posted the letter so that it
      might not be delivered until Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite sure with Lewisham that only the possible dishonour of
      mediumship could have brought their marriage about&mdash;she sank the
      mutual attraction beyond even her own vision. There was more than a touch
      of magnificence, you perceive, about this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Lewisham had persuaded her to delay that reassuring visit until
      Monday night. &ldquo;One whole day of honeymoon,&rdquo; he insisted, was
      to be theirs. In his prenuptial meditations he had not clearly focussed
      the fact that even after marriage some sort of relations with Mr. and Mrs.
      Chaffery would still go on. Even now he was exceedingly disinclined to
      face that obvious necessity. He foresaw, in spite of a resolute attempt to
      ignore it, that there would be explanatory scenes of some little
      difficulty. But the prevailing magnificence carried him over this trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us at least have this little time for ourselves,&rdquo; he
      said, and that seemed to settle their position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Save for its brevity and these intimations of future trouble it was a very
      fine time indeed. Their midday dinner together, for example&mdash;it was a
      little cold when at last they came to it on Saturday&mdash;was immense
      fun. There was no marked subsidence of appetite; they ate extremely well
      in spite of the meeting of their souls, and in spite of certain shiftings
      of chairs and hand claspings and similar delays. He really made the
      acquaintance of her hands then for the first time, plump white hands with
      short white fingers, and the engagement ring had come out of its tender
      hiding-place and acted as keeper to the wedding ring. Their eyes were
      perpetually flitting about the room and coming back to mutual smiles. All
      their movements were faintly tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      She professed to be vastly interested and amused by the room and its
      furniture and her position, and he was delighted by her delight. She was
      particularly entertained by the chest of drawers in the living room, and
      by Lewisham&rsquo;s witticisms at the toilet tidies and the oleographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after the chops and the most of the tinned salmon and the very new
      loaf were gone they fell to with fine effect upon a tapioca pudding. Their
      talk was fragmentary. &ldquo;Did you hear her call me <i>Madame? Madame</i>&mdash;so!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;And presently I must go out and do some shopping. There are all the
      things for Sunday and Monday morning to get. I must make a list. It will
      never do to let her know how little I know about things.... I wish I knew
      more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time Lewisham regarded her confession of domestic ignorance as a
      fine basis for facetiousness. He developed a fresh line of thought, and
      condoled with her on the inglorious circumstances of their wedding.
      &ldquo;No bridesmaids,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;no little children
      scattering flowers, no carriages, no policemen to guard the wedding
      presents, nothing proper&mdash;nothing right. Not even a white favour.
      Only you and I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only you and I. <i>Oh</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is nonsense,&rdquo; said Lewisham, after an interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And think what we lose in the way of speeches,&rdquo; he resumed.
      &ldquo;Cannot you imagine the best man rising:&mdash;&lsquo;Ladies and
      gentlemen&mdash;the health of the bride.&rsquo; That is what the best man
      has to do, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of answer she extended her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know,&rdquo; he said, after that had received due
      recognition, &ldquo;we have never been introduced!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither have we!&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;Neither have we! We have
      never been introduced!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some inscrutable reason it delighted them both enormously to think
      that they had never been introduced....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the later afternoon Lewisham, having unpacked his books to a certain
      extent, and so forth, was visible to all men, visibly in the highest
      spirits, carrying home Ethel&rsquo;s shopping. There were parcels and
      cones in blue and parcels in rough grey paper and a bag of confectionery,
      and out of one of the side pockets of that East-end overcoat the tail of a
      haddock protruded from its paper. Under such magnificent sanctions and
      amid such ignoble circumstances did this honeymoon begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday evening they went for a long rambling walk through the quiet
      streets, coming out at last into Hyde Park. The early spring night was
      mild and clear and the kindly moonlight was about them. They went to the
      bridge and looked down the Serpentine, with the little lights of
      Paddington yellow and remote. They stood there, dim little figures and
      very close together. They whispered and became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently it seemed that something passed and Lewisham began talking in
      his magnificent vein. He likened the Serpentine to Life, and found Meaning
      in the dark banks of Kensington Gardens and the remote bright lights.
      &ldquo;The long struggle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the lights at the
      end,&rdquo;&mdash;though he really did not know what he meant by the
      lights at the end. Neither did Ethel, though the emotion was indisputable.
      &ldquo;We are Fighting the World,&rdquo; he said, finding great
      satisfaction in the thought. &ldquo;All the world is against us&mdash;and
      we are fighting it all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not be beaten,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could we be beaten&mdash;together?&rdquo; said Lewisham.
      &ldquo;For you I would fight a dozen worlds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a very sweet and noble thing to them under the sympathetic
      moonlight, almost indeed too easy for their courage, to be merely fighting
      the world.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;aven&rsquo;t bin married ver&rsquo; long,&rdquo; said
      Madam Gadow with an insinuating smile, when she readmitted Ethel on Monday
      morning after Lewisham had been swallowed up by the Schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t <i>very</i> long,&rdquo; admitted Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ver&rsquo; &lsquo;appy,&rdquo; said Madam Gadow, and
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> was ver&rsquo; &lsquo;appy,&rdquo; said Madam Gadow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; MR. CHAFFERY AT HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The golden mists of delight lifted a little on Monday, when Mr. and Mrs.
      G.E. Lewisham went to call on his mother-in-law and Mr. Chaffery. Mrs.
      Lewisham went in evident apprehension, but clouds of glory still hung
      about Lewisham&rsquo;s head, and his manner was heroic. He wore a cotton
      shirt and linen collar, and a very nice black satin tie that Mrs. Lewisham
      had bought on her own responsibility during the day. She naturally wanted
      him to look all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Chaffery appeared in the half light of the passage as the top of a
      grimy cap over Ethel&rsquo;s shoulder and two black sleeves about her
      neck. She emerged as a small, middle-aged woman, with a thin little nose
      between silver-rimmed spectacles, a weak mouth and perplexed eyes, a queer
      little dust-lined woman with the oddest resemblance to Ethel in her face.
      She was trembling visibly with nervous agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, peering, and then kissed Mr. Lewisham effusively. &ldquo;And
      this is Mr. Lewisham!&rdquo; she said as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the third thing feminine to kiss Lewisham since the promiscuous
      days of his babyhood. &ldquo;I was so afraid&mdash;There!&rdquo; She
      laughed hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse my saying that it&rsquo;s comforting to see you&mdash;honest
      like and young. Not but what Ethel ... <i>He</i> has been something
      dreadful,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chaffery. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ought to have
      written about that mesmerising. And of all letters that which Jane wrote&mdash;there!
      But he&rsquo;s waiting and listening&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we to go downstairs, Mums?&rdquo; asked Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting for you there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chaffery. She
      held a dismal little oil lamp, and they descended a tenebrous spiral
      structure into an underground breakfast-room lit by gas that shone through
      a partially frosted globe with cut-glass stars. That descent had a
      distinctly depressing effect upon Lewisham. He went first. He took a deep
      breath at the door. What on earth was Chaffery going to say? Not that he
      cared, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaffery was standing with his back to the fire, trimming his finger-nails
      with a pocket-knife. His gilt glasses were tilted forward so as to make an
      inflamed knob at the top of his long nose, and he regarded Mr. and Mrs.
      Lewisham over them with&mdash;Lewisham doubted his eyes for a moment&mdash;but
      it was positively a smile, an essentially waggish smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come back,&rdquo; he said quite cheerfully over
      Lewisham to Ethel. There was a hint of falsetto in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has called to see her mother,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;You,
      I believe, are Mr. Chaffery?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to know who the Deuce <i>you</i> are?&rdquo; said
      Chaffery, suddenly tilting his head back so as to look through his glasses
      instead of over them, and laughing genially. &ldquo;For thoroughgoing
      Cheek, I&rsquo;m inclined to think you take the Cake. Are you the Mr.
      Lewisham to whom this misguided girl refers in her letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; said Mr. Chaffery to Mrs. Chaffery, &ldquo;there is
      a class of being upon whom delicacy is lost&mdash;to whom delicacy is
      practically unknown. Has your daughter got her marriage lines?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chaffery!&rdquo; said Lewisham, and Mrs. Chaffery exclaimed,
      &ldquo;James! How <i>can</i> you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaffery shut his penknife with a click and slipped it into his
      vest-pocket. Then he looked up again, speaking in the same equal voice.
      &ldquo;I presume we are civilised persons prepared to manage our affairs
      in a civilised way. My stepdaughter vanishes for two nights and returns
      with an alleged husband. I at least am not disposed to be careless about
      her legal position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know her better&mdash;&rdquo; began Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why argue about it,&rdquo; said Chaffery gaily, pointing a lean
      finger at Ethel&rsquo;s gesture, &ldquo;when she has &rsquo;em in her
      pocket? She may just as well show me now. I thought so. Don&rsquo;t be
      alarmed at my handling them. Fresh copies can always be got at the nominal
      price of two-and-seven. Thank you ... Lewisham, George Edgar.
      One-and-twenty. And ... You&mdash;one-and-twenty! I never did know your
      age, my dear, exactly, and now your mother won&rsquo;t say. Student! Thank
      you. I am greatly obliged. Indeed I am greatly relieved. And now, what
      have you got to say for yourselves in this remarkable affair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a letter,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a letter of excuses&mdash;the personalities I overlook ...
      Yes, sir&mdash;they were excuses. You young people wanted to marry&mdash;and
      you seized an occasion. You did not even refer to the fact that you wanted
      to marry in your letter. Pure modesty! But now you have come here married.
      It disorganises this household, it inflicts endless bother on people, but
      never you mind that! I&rsquo;m not blaming <i>you</i>. Nature&rsquo;s to
      blame! Neither of you know what you are in for yet. You will. You&rsquo;re
      married, and that is the great essential thing.... (Ethel, my dear, just
      put your husband&rsquo;s hat and stick behind the door.) And you, sir, are
      so good as to disapprove of the way in which I earn my living?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m bound to say
      I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really <i>not</i> bound to say it. The modesty of
      inexperience would excuse you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it isn&rsquo;t right&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t straight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dogma,&rdquo; said Chaffery. &ldquo;Dogma!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by dogma?&rdquo; asked Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, dogma. But we must argue this out in comfort. It is our
      supper hour, and I&rsquo;m not the man to fight against accomplished
      facts. We have intermarried. There it is. You must stop to supper&mdash;and
      you and I must thresh these things out. We&rsquo;ve involved ourselves
      with each other and we&rsquo;ve got to make the best of it. Your wife and
      mine will spread the board, and we will go on talking. Why not sit in that
      chair instead of leaning on the back? This is a home&mdash;<i>domus</i>&mdash;not
      a debating society&mdash;humble in spite of my manifest frauds.... That&rsquo;s
      better. And in the first place I hope&mdash;I do so hope&rdquo;&mdash;Chaffery
      was suddenly very impressive&mdash;&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re not a
      Dissenter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; said Lewisham, and then, &ldquo;No! I am <i>not</i> a
      Dissenter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Mr. Chaffery. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      glad of that. I was just a little afraid&mdash;Something in your manner. I
      can&rsquo;t stand Dissenters. I&rsquo;ve a peculiar dislike to Dissenters.
      To my mind it&rsquo;s the great drawback of this Clapham. You see ... I
      have invariably found them deceitful&mdash;invariably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He grimaced and dropped his glasses with a click against his waistcoat
      buttons. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad of that,&rdquo; he said, replacing
      them. &ldquo;The Dissenter, the Nonconformist Conscience, the Puritan, you
      know, the Vegetarian and Total Abstainer, and all that sort of thing, I
      cannot away with them. I have cleared my mind of cant and formulae. I&rsquo;ve
      a nature essentially Hellenic. Have you ever read Matthew Arnold?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond my scientific reading&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you <i>should</i> read Matthew Arnold&mdash;a mind of singular
      clarity. In him you would find a certain quality that is sometimes a
      little wanting in your scientific men. They are apt to be a little too
      phenomenal, you know, a little too objective. Now I seek after noumena.
      Noumena, Mr. Lewisham! If you follow me&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and his eyes behind the glasses were mildly interrogative.
      Ethel re-entered without her hat and jacket, and with a noisy square black
      tray, a white cloth, some plates and knives and glasses, and began to lay
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> follow you,&rdquo; said Lewisham, reddening. He had not
      the courage to admit ignorance of this remarkable word. &ldquo;You state
      your case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seek after <i>noumena</i>,&rdquo; repeated Chaffery with great
      satisfaction, and gesticulated with his hand, waving away everything but
      that. &ldquo;I cannot do with surfaces and appearances. I am one of those
      nympholepts, you know, nympholepts ... Must pursue the truth of things!
      the elusive fundamental ... I make a rule, I never tell myself lies&mdash;never.
      There are few who can say that. To my mind&mdash;truth begins at home. And
      for the most part&mdash;stops there. Safest and seemliest! <i>you</i>
      know. With most men&mdash;with your typical Dissenter <i>par excellence</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      always gadding abroad, calling on the neighbours. You see my point of
      view?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Lewisham, who was conscious of an unwonted opacity of mind.
      He became wary, as wary as he could manage to be on the spur of the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little surprising, you know,&rdquo; he said very
      carefully, &ldquo;if I may say so&mdash;and considering what happened&mdash;to
      hear <i>you</i> ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of truth? Not when you understand my position. Not when
      you see where I stand. That is what I am getting at. That is what I am
      naturally anxious to make clear to you now that we have intermarried, now
      that you are my stepson-in-law. You&rsquo;re young, you know, you&rsquo;re
      young, and you&rsquo;re hard and fast. Only years can give a mind <i>tone</i>&mdash;mitigate
      the varnish of education. I gather from this letter&mdash;and your face&mdash;that
      you are one of the party that participated in that little affair at Lagune&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stuck out a finger at a point he had just seen. &ldquo;By-the-bye!&mdash;That
      accounts for Ethel,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel rapped down the mustard on the table. &ldquo;It does,&rdquo; she
      said, but not very loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had met before?&rdquo; said Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Whortley,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in&mdash;I was one of those who arranged the exposure,&rdquo;
      said Lewisham. &ldquo;And now you have raised the matter, I am bound to
      say&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; interrupted Chaffery. &ldquo;But what a shock that
      was for Lagune!&rdquo; He looked down at his toes for a moment with the
      corners of his mouth tucked in. &ldquo;The hand dodge wasn&rsquo;t bad,
      you know,&rdquo; he said, with a queer sidelong smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham was very busy for a moment trying to get this remark in focus.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it in the same light as you do,&rdquo; he
      explained at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get away from your moral bias, eh?&mdash;Well, well. We&rsquo;ll
      go into all that. But apart from its moral merits&mdash;simply as an
      artistic trick&mdash;it was not bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about tricks&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So few who undertake exposures do. You admit you never heard or
      thought of that before&mdash;the bladder, I mean. Yet it&rsquo;s as
      obvious as tintacks that a medium who&rsquo;s hampered at his hands will
      do all he can with his teeth, and what <i>could</i> be so self-evident as
      a bladder under one&rsquo;s lappel? What could be? Yet I know psychic
      literature pretty well, and it&rsquo;s never been suggested even! Never.
      It&rsquo;s a perpetual surprise to me how many things are <i>not</i>
      thought of by investigators. For one thing, they never count the odds
      against them, and that puts them wrong at the start. Look at it! I am by
      nature tricky. I spend all my leisure standing or sitting about and
      thinking up or practising new little tricks, because it amuses me
      immensely to do so. The whole thing amuses me. Well&mdash;what is the
      result of these meditations? Take one thing:&mdash;I know eight-and-forty
      ways of making raps&mdash;of which at least ten are original. Ten original
      ways of making raps.&rdquo; His manner was very impressive. &ldquo;And
      some of them simply tremendous raps. There!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A confirmatory rap exploded&mdash;as it seemed between Lewisham and
      Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eh?</i>&rdquo; said Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mantelpiece opened a dropping fire, and the table went off under
      Lewisham&rsquo;s nose like a cracker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; said Chaffery, putting his hands under the tail of
      his coat. The whole room seemed snapping its fingers at Lewisham for a
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, and now take the other side. Take the severest test I
      ever tried. Two respectable professors of physics&mdash;not Newtons, you
      understand, but good, worthy, self-important professors of physics&mdash;a
      lady anxious to prove there&rsquo;s a life beyond the grave, a journalist
      who wants stuff to write&mdash;a person, that is, who gets his living by
      these researches just as I do&mdash;undertook to test me. Test <i>me</i>!...
      Of course they had their other work to do, professing physics, professing
      religion, organising research, and so forth. At the outside they don&rsquo;t
      think an hour a day about it, and most of them had never cheated anybody
      in their existence, and couldn&rsquo;t, for example, travel without a
      ticket for a three-mile journey and not get caught, to save their
      lives.... Well&mdash;you see the odds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. Lewisham appeared involved in some interior struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; explained Chaffery, &ldquo;it was quite an
      accident you got me&mdash;quite. The thing slipped out of my mouth. Or
      your friend with, the flat voice wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance. Not a
      chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham spoke like a man who is lifting a weight. &ldquo;All <i>this</i>,
      you know, is off the question. I&rsquo;m not disputing your ability. But
      the thing is ... it isn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to that,&rdquo; said Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident we look at things in a different light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;ve got to discuss.
      Exactly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheating is cheating. You can&rsquo;t get away from that. That&rsquo;s
      simple enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I&rsquo;ve done with it,&rdquo; said Chaffery with a
      certain zest. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s imperative you should understand
      my position. It isn&rsquo;t as though I hadn&rsquo;t one. Ever since I
      read your letter I&rsquo;ve been thinking over that. Really!&mdash;a
      justification! In a way you might almost say I had a mission. A sort of
      prophet. You really don&rsquo;t see the beginning of it yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but hang it!&rdquo; protested Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re crude. My dear young man, you&rsquo;re
      only at the beginning of things. You really must concede a certain
      possibility of wider views to a man more than twice your age. But here&rsquo;s
      supper. For a little while at any rate we&rsquo;ll call a truce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel had come in again bearing an additional chair, and Mrs. Chaffery
      appeared behind her, crowning the preparations with a jug of small beer.
      The cloth, Lewisham observed, as he turned towards it, had several
      undarned holes and discoloured places, and in the centre stood a tarnished
      cruet which contained mustard, pepper, vinegar, and three ambiguous
      dried-up bottles. The bread was on an ample board with a pious rim, and an
      honest wedge of cheese loomed disproportionate on a little plate. Mr. and
      Mrs. Lewisham were seated facing one another, and Mrs. Chaffery sat in the
      broken chair because she understood its ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This cheese is as nutritious and unattractive and indigestible as
      Science,&rdquo; remarked Chaffery, cutting and passing wedges. &ldquo;But
      crush it&mdash;so&mdash;under your fork, add a little of this good Dorset
      butter, a dab of mustard, pepper&mdash;the pepper is very necessary&mdash;and
      some malt vinegar, and crush together. You get a compound called Crab and
      by no means disagreeable. So the wise deal with the facts of life, neither
      bolting nor rejecting, but adapting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As though pepper and mustard were not facts,&rdquo; said Lewisham,
      scoring his solitary point that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaffery admitted the collapse of his image in very complimentary terms,
      and Lewisham could not avoid a glance across the table at Ethel. He
      remembered that Chaffery was a slippery scoundrel whose blame was better
      than his praise, immediately afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the Crab engaged Chaffery, and the conversation languished.
      Mrs. Chaffery asked Ethel formal questions about their lodgings, and Ethel&rsquo;s
      answers were buoyant, &ldquo;You must come and have tea one day,&rdquo;
      said Ethel, not waiting for Lewisham&rsquo;s endorsement, &ldquo;and see
      it all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaffery astonished Lewisham by suddenly displaying a complete
      acquaintance with his status as a South Kensington teacher in training.
      &ldquo;I suppose you have some money beyond that guinea,&rdquo; said
      Chaffery offhandedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to go on with,&rdquo; said Lewisham, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you look to them at South Kensington, to do something for you&mdash;a
      hundred a year or so, when your scholarship is up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lewisham a little reluctantly. &ldquo;Yes. A
      hundred a year or so. That&rsquo;s the sort of idea. And there&rsquo;s
      lots of places beyond South Kensington, of course, even if they don&rsquo;t
      put me up there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Chaffery; &ldquo;but it will be a pretty close
      shave for all that&mdash;one hundred a year. Well, well&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      many a deserving man has to do with less,&rdquo; and after a meditative
      pause he asked Lewisham to pass the beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hev you a mother living, Mr. Lewisham?&rdquo; said Mrs. Chaffery
      suddenly, and pursued him through the tale of his connexions. When he came
      to the plumber, Mrs. Chaffery remarked with an unexpected air of
      consequence that most families have their poor relations. Then the air of
      consequence vanished again into the past from which it had arisen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper finished, Chaffery poured the residuum of the beer into his glass,
      produced a Broseley clay of the longest sort, and invited Lewisham to
      smoke. &ldquo;Honest smoking,&rdquo; said Chaffery, tapping the bowl of
      his clay, and added: &ldquo;In this country&mdash;cigars&mdash;sound
      cigars&mdash;and honesty rarely meet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham fumbled in his pocket for his Algerian cigarettes, and Chaffery
      having regarded them unfavourably through his glasses, took up the thread
      of his promised apologia. The ladies retired to wash up the supper things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Chaffery, opening abruptly so soon as the clay
      was drawing, &ldquo;about this cheating&mdash;I do not find life such a
      simple matter as you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t find life simple,&rdquo; said Lewisham,
      &ldquo;but I do think there&rsquo;s a Right and a Wrong in things. And I
      don&rsquo;t think you have said anything so far to show that
      spiritualistic cheating is Right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us thresh the matter out,&rdquo; said Chaffery, crossing his
      legs; &ldquo;let us thresh the matter out. Now&rdquo;&mdash;he drew at his
      pipe&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you fully appreciate the importance
      of Illusion in life, the Essential Nature of Lies and Deception of the
      body politic. You are inclined to discredit one particular form of
      Imposture, because it is not generally admitted&mdash;carries a certain
      discredit, and&mdash;witness the heel edges of my trouser legs, witness
      yonder viands&mdash;small rewards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am prepared to maintain,&rdquo; said Chaffery, proceeding
      with his proposition, &ldquo;that Honesty is essentially an anarchistic
      and disintegrating force in society, that communities are held together
      and the progress of civilisation made possible only by vigorous and
      sometimes even, violent Lying; that the Social Contract is nothing more or
      less than a vast conspiracy of human beings to lie to and humbug
      themselves and one another for the general Good. Lies are the mortar that
      bind the savage Individual man into the social masonry. There is the
      general thesis upon which I base my justification. My mediumship, I can
      assure you, is a particular instance of the general assertion. Were I not
      of a profoundly indolent, restless, adventurous nature, and horribly
      averse to writing, I would make a great book of this and live honoured by
      every profound duffer in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how are <i>you</i> going to prove it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove It! It simply needs pointing out. Even now there are men&mdash;Bernard
      Shaw, Ibsen, and such like&mdash;who have seen bits of it in a
      new-gospel-grubbing sort of fashion. What Is man? Lust and greed tempered
      by fear and an irrational vanity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with that,&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will as you grow older,&rdquo; said Chaffery. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      truths you have to grow into. But about this matter of Lies&mdash;let us
      look at the fabric of society, let us compare the savage. You will
      discover the only essential difference between savage and civilised is
      this: The former hasn&rsquo;t learnt to shirk the truth of things, and the
      latter has. Take the most obvious difference&mdash;the clothing of the
      civilised man, his invention of decency. What <i>is</i> clothing? The
      concealment of essential facts. What is decorum? Suppression! I don&rsquo;t
      argue against decency and decorum, mind you, but there they are&mdash;essentials
      to civilisation and essentially &lsquo;<i>suppressio veri</i>.&rsquo; And
      in the pockets of his clothes our citizen carries money. The pure savage
      has no money. To him a lump of metal is a lump of metal&mdash;possibly
      ornamental&mdash;no more. That&rsquo;s right. To any lucid-minded man it&rsquo;s
      the same or different only through the gross folly of his fellows. But to
      the common civilised man the universal exchangeability of this gold is a
      sacred and fundamental fact. Think of it! Why should it be? There isn&rsquo;t
      a why! I live in perpetual amazement at the gullibility of my
      fellow-creatures. Of a morning sometimes, I can assure you, I lie in bed
      fancying that people may have found out this swindle in the night, expect
      to hear a tumult downstairs and see your mother-in-law come rushing into
      the room with a rejected shilling from the milkman. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
      this?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;This Muck for milk?&rsquo; But it never
      happens. Never. If it did, if people suddenly cleared their minds of this
      cant of money, what would happen? The true nature of man would appear. I
      should whip out of bed, seize some weapon, and after the milkman
      forthwith. It&rsquo;s becoming to keep the peace, but it&rsquo;s necessary
      to have milk. The neighbours would come pouring out&mdash;also after milk.
      Milkman, suddenly enlightened, would start clattering up the street. After
      him! Clutch&mdash;tear! Got him! Over goes the cart! Fight if you like,
      but don&rsquo;t upset the can!... Don&rsquo;t you see it all?&mdash;perfectly
      reasonable every bit of it. I should return, bruised and bloody, with the
      milk-can under my arm. Yes, <i>I</i> should have the milk-can&mdash;I
      should keep my eye on that.... But why go on? You of all men should know
      that life is a struggle for existence, a fight for food. Money is just the
      lie that mitigates our fury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham; &ldquo;no! I&rsquo;m not prepared to
      admit that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham dodged. &ldquo;You state your case first,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see what all this has to do with cheating at a
      <i>siance</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I weave my defence from this loom, though. Take some aggressively
      respectable sort of man&mdash;a bishop, for example.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much hold with
      bishops.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Take a professor of science, walking the
      earth. Remark his clothing, making a decent citizen out of him, concealing
      the fact that physically he is a flabby, pot-bellied degenerate. That is
      the first Lie of his being. No fringes round <i>his</i> trousers, my boy.
      Notice his hair, groomed and clipped, the tacit lie that its average
      length is half an inch, whereas in nature he would wave a few score
      yard-long hairs of ginger grey to the winds of heaven. Notice the smug
      suppressions of his face. In his mouth are Lies in the shape of false
      teeth. Then on the earth somewhere poor devils are toiling to get him meat
      and corn and wine. He is clothed in the lives of bent and thwarted
      weavers, his Way is lit by phossy jaw, he eats from lead-glazed crockery&mdash;all
      his ways are paved with the lives of men.... Think of the chubby,
      comfortable creature! And, as Swift has it&mdash;to think that such a
      thing should deal in pride!... He pretends that his blessed little
      researches are in some way a fair return to these remote beings for their
      toil, their suffering; pretends that he and his parasitic career are
      payment for their thwarted desires. Imagine him bullying his gardener over
      some transplanted geraniums, the thick mist of lies they stand in, so that
      the man does not immediately with the edge of a spade smite down his
      impertinence to the dust from which it rose.... And his case is the case
      of all comfortable lives. What a lie and sham all civility is, all good
      breeding, all culture and refinement, while one poor ragged wretch drags
      hungry on the earth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is Socialism!&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;<i>I</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Ism,&rdquo; said Chaffery, raising his rich voice. &ldquo;Only
      the ghastly truth of things&mdash;the truth that the warp and the woof of
      the world of men is Lying. Socialism is no remedy, no <i>ism</i> is a
      remedy; things are so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree&mdash;&rdquo; began Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with the hopelessness, because you are young, but with the
      description you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;within limits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You agree that most respectable positions in the world are tainted
      with the fraud of our social conditions. If they were not tainted with
      fraud they would not be respectable. Even your own position&mdash;Who gave
      you the right to marry and prosecute interesting scientific studies while
      other young men rot in mines?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help admitting. And here is my position. Since all
      ways of life are tainted with fraud, since to live and speak the truth is
      beyond human strength and courage&mdash;as one finds it&mdash;is it not
      better for a man that he engage in some straightforward comparatively
      harmless cheating, than if he risk his mental integrity in some ambiguous
      position and fall at last into self-deception and self-righteousness? That
      is the essential danger. That is the thing I always guard against. Heed
      that! It is the master sin. Self-righteousness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham pulled at his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You begin to take me. And after all, these worthy people do not
      suffer so greatly. If I did not take their money some other impostor
      would. Their huge conceit of intelligence would breed perhaps some viler
      swindle than my facetious rappings. That&rsquo;s the line our doubting
      bishops take, and why shouldn&rsquo;t I? For example, these people might
      give it to Public Charities, minister to the fattened secretary, the
      prodigal younger son. After all, at worst, I am a sort of latter-day Robin
      Hood; I take from the rich according to their incomes. I don&rsquo;t give
      to the poor certainly, I don&rsquo;t get enough. But&mdash;there are other
      good works. Many a poor weakling have I comforted with Lies, great
      thumping, silly Lies, about the grave! Compare me with one of those
      rascals who disseminate phossy jaw and lead poisons, compare me with a
      millionaire who runs a music hall with an eye to feminine talent, or an
      underwriter, or the common stockbroker. Or any sort of lawyer....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are bishops,&rdquo; said Chaffery, &ldquo;who believe in
      Darwin and doubt Moses. Now, I hold myself better than they&mdash;analogous
      perhaps, but better&mdash;for I do at least invent something of the tricks
      I play&mdash;I do do that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; began Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might forgive them their dishonesty,&rdquo; said Chaffery,
      &ldquo;but the stupidity of it, the mental self-abnegation&mdash;Lord! If
      a solicitor doesn&rsquo;t swindle in the proper shabby-magnificent way,
      they chuck him for unprofessional conduct.&rdquo; He paused. He became
      meditative, and smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, some of <i>my</i> dodges,&rdquo; he said with a sudden change
      of voice, turning towards Lewisham, his eyes smiling over his glasses and
      an emphatic hand patting the table-cloth; &ldquo;some of <i>my</i> dodges
      are <i>damned</i> ingenious, you know&mdash;<i>damned</i> ingenious&mdash;and
      well worth double the money they bring me&mdash;double.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards the fire again, pulling at his smouldering pipe, and
      eyeing Lewisham over the corner of his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One or two of my little things would make Maskelyne sit up,&rdquo;
      he said presently. &ldquo;They would set that mechanical orchestra playing
      out of pure astonishment. I really must explain some of them to you&mdash;now
      we have intermarried.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It took Mr. Lewisham a minute or so to re-form the regiment of his mind,
      disordered by its headlong pursuit of Chaffery&rsquo;s flying arguments.
      &ldquo;But on your principles you might do almost anything!&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely!&rdquo; said Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather a curious method,&rdquo; protested Chaffery; &ldquo;to
      test one&rsquo;s principles of action by judging the resultant actions on
      some other principle, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham took a moment to think. &ldquo;I suppose that is so,&rdquo; he
      said, in the manner of a man convinced against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived his logic insufficient. He suddenly thrust the delicacies of
      argument aside. Certain sentences he had brought ready for use in his mind
      came up and he delivered them abruptly. &ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with this cheating. In spite of what you say, I
      hold to what I said in my letter. Ethel&rsquo;s connexion with all these
      things is at an end. I shan&rsquo;t go out of my way to expose you, of
      course, but if it comes in my way I shall speak my mind of all these
      spiritualistic phenomena. It&rsquo;s just as well that we should know
      clearly where we are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is clearly understood, my dear stepson-in-law,&rdquo; said
      Chaffery. &ldquo;Our present object is discussion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Ethel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel is yours,&rdquo; said Chaffery. &ldquo;Ethel is yours,&rdquo;
      he repeated after an interval and added pensively&mdash;&ldquo;to keep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But talking of Illusion,&rdquo; he resumed, dismissing the sordid
      with a sign of relief, &ldquo;I sometimes think with Bishop Berkeley, that
      all experience is probably something quite different from reality. That
      consciousness is <i>essentially</i> hallucination. I, here, and you, and
      our talk&mdash;it is all Illusion. Bring your Science to bear&mdash;what
      am I? A cloudy multitude of atoms, an infinite interplay of little cells.
      Is this hand that I hold out me? This head? Is the surface of my skin any
      more than a rude average boundary? You say it is my mind that is me? But
      consider the war of motives. Suppose I have an impulse that I resist&mdash;it
      is <i>I</i> resist it&mdash;the impulse is outside me, eh? But suppose
      that impulse carries me and I do the thing&mdash;that impulse is part of
      me, is it not? Ah! My brain reels at these mysteries! Lord! what flimsy
      fluctuating things we are&mdash;first this, then that, a thought, an
      impulse, a deed and a forgetting, and all the time madly cocksure we are
      ourselves. And as for you&mdash;you who have hardly learned to think for
      more than five or six short years, there you sit, assured, coherent, there
      you sit in all your inherited original sin&mdash;Hallucinatory
      Windlestraw!&mdash;judging and condemning. <i>You</i> know Right from
      Wrong! My boy, so did Adam and Eve ... <i>so soon as they&rsquo;d had
      dealings with the father of lies</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At the end of the evening whisky and hot water were produced, and
      Chaffery, now in a mood of great urbanity, said he had rarely enjoyed
      anyone&rsquo;s conversation so much as Lewisham&rsquo;s, and insisted upon
      everyone having whisky. Mrs. Chaffery and Ethel added sugar and lemon.
      Lewisham felt an instantaneous mild surprise at the sight of Ethel
      drinking grog.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door Mrs. Chaffery kissed Lewisham an effusive good-bye, and told
      Ethel she really believed it was all for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home Lewisham was thoughtful and preoccupied. The problem of
      Chaffery assumed enormous proportions. At times indeed even that good man&rsquo;s
      own philosophical sketch of himself as a practical exponent of mental
      sincerity touched with humour and the artistic spirit, seemed plausible.
      Lagune was an undeniable ass, and conceivably psychic research was an
      incentive to trickery. Then he remembered the matter in his relation to
      Ethel....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your stepfather is a little hard to follow,&rdquo; he said at last,
      sitting on the bed and taking off one boot. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dodgy&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      so confoundedly dodgy. One doesn&rsquo;t know where to take hold of him.
      He&rsquo;s got such a break he&rsquo;s clean bowled me again and again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought for a space, and then removed his boot and sat with it on his
      knee. &ldquo;Of course!... all that he said was wrong&mdash;quite wrong.
      Right is right and cheating is cheating, whatever you say about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I feel about him,&rdquo; said Ethel at the
      looking-glass. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly how it seems to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; THE CAMPAIGN OPENS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Saturday Lewisham was first through the folding doors. In a moment he
      reappeared with a document extended. Mrs. Lewisham stood arrested with her
      dress skirt in her hand, astonished at the astonishment on his face.
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> say!&rdquo; said Lewisham; &ldquo;just look here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the book that he held open before her, and perceived that
      its vertical ruling betokened a sordid import, that its list of items in
      an illegible mixture of English and German was lengthy. &ldquo;1 kettle of
      coals 6d.&rdquo; occurred regularly down that portentous array and
      buttoned it all together. It was Madam Gadow&rsquo;s first bill. Ethel
      took it out of his hand and examined it closer. It looked no smaller
      closer. The overcharges were scandalous. It was curious how the humour of
      calling a scuttle &ldquo;kettle&rdquo; had evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
      That document, I take it, was the end of Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s informal
      honeymoon. Its advent was the snap of that bright Prince Rupert&rsquo;s
      drop; and in a moment&mdash;Dust. For a glorious week he had lived in the
      persuasion that life was made of love and mystery, and now he was reminded
      with singular clearness that it was begotten of a struggle for existence
      and the Will to Live. &ldquo;Confounded imposition!&rdquo; fumed Mr.
      Lewisham, and the breakfast table was novel and ominous, mutterings
      towards anger on the one hand and a certain consternation on the other.
      &ldquo;I must give her a talking to this afternoon,&rdquo; said Lewisham
      at his watch, and after he had bundled his books into the shiny black bag,
      he gave the first of his kisses that was not a distinct and
      self-subsisting ceremony. It was usage and done in a hurry, and the door
      slammed as he went his way to the schools. Ethel was not coming that
      morning, because by special request and because she wanted to help him she
      was going to copy out some of his botanical notes which had fallen into
      arrears.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way to the schools Lewisham felt something suspiciously near a
      sinking of the heart. His preoccupation was essentially arithmetical. The
      thing that engaged his mind to the exclusion of all other matters is best
      expressed in the recognised business form.

    <p>
      From this it will be manifest to the most unbusiness like that,
      disregarding the extraordinary expenditure on the marriage, and the by no
      means final &ldquo;few little things&rdquo; Ethel had bought, outgoings
      exceeded income by two pounds and more, and a brief excursion into
      arithmetic will demonstrate that in five-and-twenty weeks the balance of
      the account would be nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that guinea a week was not to go on for five-and-twenty weeks, but
      simply for fifteen, and then the net outgoings will be well over three
      guineas, reducing the &ldquo;law&rdquo; accorded our young couple to
      two-and-twenty weeks. These details are tiresome and disagreeable, no
      doubt, to the refined reader, but just imagine how much more disagreeable
      they were to Mr. Lewisham, trudging meditative to the schools. You will
      understand his slipping out of the laboratory, and betaking himself to the
      Educational Reading-room, and how it was that the observant Smithers,
      grinding his lecture notes against the now imminent second examination for
      the &ldquo;Forbes,&rdquo; was presently perplexed to the centre of his
      being by the spectacle of Lewisham intent upon a pile of current
      periodicals, the <i>Educational Times</i>, the <i>Journal of Education</i>,
      the <i>Schoolmaster, Science and Art, The University Correspondent,
      Nature, The Athenaeum, The Academy</i>, and <i>The Author</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smithers remarked the appearance of a note-book, the jotting down of
      memoranda. He edged into the bay nearest Lewisham&rsquo;s table and
      approached him suddenly from the flank. &ldquo;What are <i>you</i> after?&rdquo;
      said Smithers in a noisy whisper and with a detective eye on the papers.
      He perceived Lewisham was scrutinising the advertisement column, and his
      perplexity increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; said Lewisham blandly, with his hand
      falling casually over his memoranda; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your particular
      little game?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; said Smithers, &ldquo;just mooching round. You
      weren&rsquo;t at the meeting last Friday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned a chair, knelt on it, and began whispering over the back about
      Debating Society politics. Lewisham was inattentive and brief. What had he
      to do with these puerilities? At last Smithers went away foiled, and met
      Parkson by the entrance. Parkson, by-the-bye, had not spoken to Lewisham
      since their painful misunderstanding. He made a wide detour to his seat at
      the end table, and so, and by a singular rectitude of bearing and a
      dignified expression, showed himself aware of Lewisham&rsquo;s offensive
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham&rsquo;s investigations were two-fold. He wanted to discover some
      way of adding materially to that weekly guinea by his own exertions, and
      he wanted to learn the conditions of the market for typewriting. For
      himself he had a vague idea, an idea subsequently abandoned, that it was
      possible to get teaching work in evening classes during the month of
      March. But, except by reason of sudden death, no evening class in London
      changes its staff after September until July comes round again. Private
      tuition, moreover, offered many attractions to him, but no definite
      proposals. His ideas of his own possibilities were youthful or he would
      not have spent time in noting the conditions of application for a vacant
      professorship in physics at the Melbourne University. He also made a note
      of the vacant editorship of a monthly magazine devoted to social
      questions. He would not have minded doing that sort of thing at all,
      though the proprietor might. There was also a vacant curatorship in the
      Museum of Eton College.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typewriting business was less varied and more definite. Those were the
      days before the violent competition of the half-educated had brought
      things down to an impossible tenpence the thousand words, and the
      prevailing price was as high as one-and-six. Calculating that Ethel could
      do a thousand words in an hour and that she could work five or six hours
      in the day, it was evident that her contributions to the household
      expenses would be by no means despicable; thirty shillings a week perhaps.
      Lewisham was naturally elated at this discovery. He could find no
      advertisements of authors or others seeking typewriting, but he saw that a
      great number of typewriters advertised themselves in the literary papers.
      It was evident Ethel also must advertise. &ldquo;&lsquo;Scientific
      phraseology a speciality&rsquo; might be put,&rdquo; meditated Lewisham.
      He returned to his lodgings in a hopeful mood with quite a bundle of
      memoranda of possible employments. He spent five shillings in stamps on
      the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch, Lewisham&mdash;a little short of breath-asked to see Madam
      Gadow. She came up in the most affable frame of mind; nothing could be
      further from the normal indignation of the British landlady. She was very
      voluble, gesticulatory and lucid, but unhappily bi-lingual, and at all the
      crucial points German. Mr. Lewisham&rsquo;s natural politeness restrained
      him from too close a pursuit across the boundary of the two imperial
      tongues. Quite half an hour&rsquo;s amicable discussion led at last to a
      reduction of sixpence, and all parties professed themselves satisfied with
      this result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam Gadow was quite cool even at the end. Mr. Lewisham was flushed in
      the face, red-eared, and his hair slightly disordered, but that sixpence
      was at any rate an admission of the justice of his claim. &ldquo;She was
      evidently trying it on,&rdquo; he said almost apologetically to Ethel.
      &ldquo;It was absolutely necessary to present a firm front to her. I doubt
      if we shall have any trouble again....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course what she says about kitchen coals is perfectly just.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young couple went for a walk in Kensington Gardens, and&mdash;the
      spring afternoon was so warm and pleasant&mdash;sat on two attractive
      green chairs near the band-stand, for which Lewisham had subsequently to
      pay twopence. They had what Ethel called a &ldquo;serious talk.&rdquo; She
      was really wonderfully sensible, and discussed the situation exhaustively.
      She was particularly insistent upon the importance of economy in her
      domestic disbursements and deplored her general ignorance very earnestly.
      It was decided that Lewisham should get a good elementary text-book of
      domestic economy for her private study. At home Mrs. Chaffery guided her
      house by the oracular items of &ldquo;Inquire Within upon Everything,&rdquo;
      but Lewisham considered that work unscientific.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel was also of opinion that much might be learnt from the sixpenny
      ladies&rsquo; papers&mdash;the penny ones had hardly begun in those days.
      She had bought such publications during seasons of affluence, but chiefly,
      as she now deplored, with an eye to the trimming of hats and such like
      vanities. The sooner the typewriter came the better. It occurred to
      Lewisham with unpleasant suddenness that he had not allowed for the
      purchase of a typewriter in his estimate of their resources. It brought
      their &ldquo;law&rdquo; down to twelve or thirteen weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent the evening in writing and copying a number of letters,
      addressing envelopes and enclosing stamps. There were optimistic moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melbourne&rsquo;s a fine city,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;and we
      should have a glorious voyage out.&rdquo; He read the application for the
      Melbourne professorship out loud to her, just to see how it read, and she
      was greatly impressed by the list of his accomplishments and successes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not, know you knew <i>half</i> those things,&rdquo; she said,
      and became depressed at her relative illiteracy. It was natural, after
      such encouragement, to write to the scholastic agents in a tone of assured
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advertisement for typewriting in the <i>Athenaeum</i> troubled his
      conscience a little. After he had copied out his draft with its &ldquo;Scientific
      phraseology a speciality,&rdquo; fine and large, he saw the notes she had
      written out for him. Her handwriting was still round and boyish, even as
      it had appeared in the Whortley avenue, but her punctuation was confined
      to the erratic comma and the dash, and there was a disposition to spell
      the imperfectly legible along the line of least resistance. However, he
      dismissed that matter with a resolve to read over and correct anything in
      that way that she might have sent her to do. It would not be a bad idea,
      he thought parenthetically, if he himself read up some sound authority on
      the punctuation of sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat at this business quite late, heedless of the examination in
      botany that came on the morrow. It was very bright and cosy in their
      little room with their fire burning, the gas lit and the curtains drawn,
      and the number of applications they had written made them hopeful. She was
      flushed and enthusiastic, now flitting about the room, now coming close to
      him and leaning over him to see what he had done. At Lewisham&rsquo;s
      request she got him the envelopes from the chest of drawers. &ldquo;You <i>are</i>
      a help to a chap,&rdquo; said Lewisham, leaning back from the table,
      &ldquo;I feel I could do anything for a girl like you&mdash;anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Really!</i>&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Really! Am I really a help?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham&rsquo;s face and gesture, were all assent. She gave a little cry
      of delight, stood for a moment, and then by way of practical demonstration
      of her unflinching helpfulness, hurried round the table towards him with
      arms extended, &ldquo;You dear!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham, partially embraced, pushed his chair back with his disengaged
      arm, so that she might sit on his knee....

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; THE FIRST BATTLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lewisham&rsquo;s inquiries for evening teaching and private tuition were
      essentially provisional measures. His proposals for a more permanent
      establishment displayed a certain defect in his sense of proportion. That
      Melbourne professorship, for example, was beyond his merits, and there
      were aspects of things that would have affected the welcome of himself and
      his wife at Eton College. At the outset he was inclined to regard the
      South Kensington scholar as the intellectual salt of the earth, to
      overrate the abundance of &ldquo;decent things&rdquo; yielding from one
      hundred and fifty to three hundred a year, and to disregard the
      competition of such inferior enterprises as the universities of Oxford,
      Cambridge, and the literate North. But the scholastic agents to whom he
      went on the following Saturday did much in a quiet way to disabuse his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blendershin&rsquo;s chief assistant in the grimy little office in
      Oxford Street cleared up the matter so vigorously that Lewisham was
      angered. &ldquo;Headmaster of an endowed school, perhaps!&rdquo; said Mr.
      Blendershin&rsquo;s chief assistant &ldquo;Lord!&mdash;why not a
      bishopric? I say,&rdquo;&mdash;as Mr. Blendershin entered smoking an
      assertive cigar&mdash;&ldquo;one-and-twenty, <i>no</i> degree, <i>no</i>
      games, two years&rsquo; experience as junior&mdash;wants a headmastership
      of an endowed school!&rdquo; He spoke so loudly that it was inevitable the
      selection of clients in the waiting-room should hear, and he pointed with
      his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said Lewisham hotly; &ldquo;if I knew the ways of
      the market I shouldn&rsquo;t come to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blendershin stared at Lewisham for a moment. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he
      done in the way of certificates?&rdquo; asked Mr. Blendershin of the
      assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant read a list of &lsquo;ologies and &lsquo;ographies. &ldquo;Fifty
      resident,&rdquo; said Mr. Blendershin concisely&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      <i>your</i> figure. Sixty, if you&rsquo;re lucky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i>?&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not enough for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not nearly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can get a Cambridge graduate for eighty resident&mdash;and
      grateful,&rdquo; said Mr. Blendershin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want a resident post,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precious few non-resident shops,&rdquo; said Mr. Blendershin.
      &ldquo;Precious few. They want you for dormitory supervision&mdash;and
      they&rsquo;re afraid of your taking pups outside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not married by any chance?&rdquo; said the assistant suddenly,
      after an attentive study of Lewisham&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;er.&rdquo; Lewisham met Mr. Blendershin&rsquo;s eye.
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant was briefly unprintable. &ldquo;Lord! you&rsquo;ll have to
      keep that dark,&rdquo; said Mr. Blendershin. &ldquo;But you have got a
      tough bit of hoeing before you. If I was you I&rsquo;d go on and get my
      degree now you&rsquo;re so near it. You&rsquo;ll stand a better chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Lewisham slowly and looking at his boot
      toes, &ldquo;I must be doing <i>something</i> while I am getting my
      degree.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant, whistled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might get you a visiting job, perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Blendershin
      speculatively. &ldquo;Just read me those items again, Binks.&rdquo; He
      listened attentively. &ldquo;Objects to religious teaching!&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;
      He stopped the reading by a gesture, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense. You can&rsquo;t
      have everything, you know. Scratch that out. You won&rsquo;t get a place
      in any middle-class school in England if you object to religious teaching.
      It&rsquo;s the mothers&mdash;bless &rsquo;em! Say nothing about it. Don&rsquo;t
      believe&mdash;who does? There&rsquo;s hundreds like you, you know&mdash;hundreds.
      Parsons&mdash;all sorts. Say nothing about it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I&rsquo;m asked?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Church of England. Every man in this country who has not dissented
      belongs to the Church of England. It&rsquo;ll be hard enough to get you
      anything without that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Mr. Lewisham. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legal fiction,&rdquo; said Mr. Blendershin. &ldquo;Everyone
      understands. If you don&rsquo;t do that, my dear chap, we can&rsquo;t do
      anything for you. It&rsquo;s Journalism, or London docks. Well,
      considering your experience,&mdash;say docks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham&rsquo;s face flushed irregularly. He did not answer. He scowled
      and tugged at the still by no means ample moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compromise, you know,&rdquo; said Mr. Blendershin, watching him
      kindly. &ldquo;Compromise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life Lewisham faced the necessity of telling a
      lie in cold blood. He glissaded from, the austere altitudes of his
      self-respect, and his next words were already disingenuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t promise to tell lies if I&rsquo;m asked,&rdquo; he
      said aloud. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scratch it out,&rdquo; said Blendershin to the clerk. &ldquo;You
      needn&rsquo;t mention it. Then you don&rsquo;t say you can teach drawing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just give out the copies,&rdquo; said Blendershin, &ldquo;and
      take care they don&rsquo;t see you draw, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not teaching drawing&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s understood by it in <i>this</i> country,&rdquo;
      said Blendershin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go corrupting your mind with
      pedagogueries. They&rsquo;re the ruin of assistants. Put down drawing.
      Then there&rsquo;s shorthand&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, I say!&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s shorthand, French, book-keeping, commercial
      geography, land measuring&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t teach any of those things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Blendershin, and paused. &ldquo;Has your
      wife or you a private income?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause of further moral descent, and a whack against an obstacle. &ldquo;But
      they will find me out,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blendershin smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much ability as willingness
      to teach, you know. And <i>they</i> won&rsquo;t find you out. The sort of
      schoolmaster we deal with can&rsquo;t find anything out. He can&rsquo;t
      teach any of these things himself&mdash;and consequently he doesn&rsquo;t
      believe they <i>can</i> be taught. Talk to him of pedagogics and he talks
      of practical experience. But he puts &rsquo;em on his prospectus, you
      know, and he wants &lsquo;em on his time-table. Some of these subjects&mdash;There&rsquo;s
      commercial geography, for instance. What <i>is</i> commercial geography?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barilla,&rdquo; said the assistant, biting the end of his pen, and
      added pensively, &ldquo;<i>and</i> blethers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fad,&rdquo; said Blendershin, &ldquo;Just fad. Newspapers talk rot
      about commercial education, Duke of Devonshire catches on and talks ditto&mdash;pretends
      he thought it himself&mdash;much <i>he</i> cares&mdash;parents get hold of
      it&mdash;schoolmasters obliged to put something down, consequently
      assistants must. And that&rsquo;s the end of the matter!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>All</i> right,&rdquo; said Lewisham, catching his breath in a
      faint sob of shame, &ldquo;Stick &rsquo;em down. But mind&mdash;a
      non-resident place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Blendershin, &ldquo;your science may pull you
      through. But I tell you it&rsquo;s hard. Some grant-earning grammar school
      may want that. And that&rsquo;s about all, I think. Make a note of the
      address....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant made a noise, something between a whistle and the word
      &ldquo;Fee.&rdquo; Blendershin glanced at Lewisham and nodded doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fee for booking,&rdquo; said the assistant; &ldquo;half a crown,
      postage&mdash;in advance&mdash;half a crown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lewisham remembered certain advice Dunkerley had given him in the old
      Whortley days. He hesitated. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      pay that. If you get me anything there&rsquo;s the commission&mdash;if you
      don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We lose,&rdquo; supplied the assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you ought to,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fair
      game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living in London?&rdquo; asked Blendershin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Blendershin. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
      say anything about the postage in that case. Of course it&rsquo;s the off
      season, and you mustn&rsquo;t expect anything at present very much.
      Sometimes there&rsquo;s a shift or so at Easter.... There&rsquo;s nothing
      more.... Afternoon. Anyone else, Binks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Maskelyne, Smith, and Thrums did a higher class of work than
      Blendershin, whose specialities were lower class private establishments
      and the cheaper sort of endowed schools. Indeed, so superior were
      Maskelyne, Smith, and Thrums that they enraged Lewisham by refusing at
      first to put him on their books. He was interviewed briefly by a young man
      dressed and speaking with offensive precision, whose eye adhered rigidly
      to the waterproof collar throughout the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly our line,&rdquo; he said, and pushed Lewisham a form to fill
      up. &ldquo;Mostly upper class and good preparatory schools here, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lewisham filled up the form with his multitudinous &ldquo;&lsquo;ologies&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;&lsquo;ographies,&rdquo; a youth of ducal appearance entered
      and greeted the precise young man in a friendly way. Lewisham, bending
      down to write, perceived that this professional rival wore a very long
      frock coat, patent leather boots, and the most beautiful grey trousers.
      His conceptions of competition enlarged. The precise young man by a motion
      of his eyes directed the newcomer&rsquo;s attention to Lewisham&rsquo;s
      waterproof collar, and was answered by raised eyebrows and a faint
      tightening of the mouth. &ldquo;That bounder at Castleford has answered
      me,&rdquo; said the new-comer in a fine rich voice. &ldquo;Is he any bally
      good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bounder at Castleford had been discussed Lewisham presented his
      paper, and the precise young man with his eye still fixed on the
      waterproof collar took the document in the manner of one who reaches
      across a gulf. &ldquo;I doubt if we shall be able to do anything for you,&rdquo;
      he said reassuringly. &ldquo;But an English mastership may chance to be
      vacant. Science doesn&rsquo;t count for much in <i>our</i> sort of
      schools, you know. Classics and good games&mdash;that&rsquo;s our sort of
      thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good games, good form, you know, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to be a public-school boy?&rdquo; asked the
      precise young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you educated?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham&rsquo;s face grew hot. &ldquo;Does that matter?&rdquo; he asked,
      with his eye on the exquisite grey trousering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In our sort of school&mdash;decidedly. It&rsquo;s a question of
      tone, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lewisham, beginning to realise new limitations.
      His immediate impulse was to escape the eye of the nicely dressed
      assistant master. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll write, I suppose, if you have
      anything,&rdquo; he said, and the precise young man responded with
      alacrity to his door-ward motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often get that kind of thing?&rdquo; asked the nicely dressed young
      man when Lewisham had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather. Not quite so bad as that, you know. That waterproof collar&mdash;did
      you notice it? Ugh! And&mdash;&lsquo;I see.&rsquo; And the scowl and the
      clumsiness of it. Of course <i>he</i> hasn&rsquo;t any decent clothes&mdash;he&rsquo;d
      go to a new shop with one tin box! But that sort of thing&mdash;and board
      school teachers&mdash;they&rsquo;re getting everywhere! Only the other day&mdash;Rowton
      was here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Rowton of Pinner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rowton of Pinner. And he asked right out for a board
      schoolmaster. He said, &lsquo;I want someone who can teach arithmetic.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. The nicely dressed young man meditated over the handle of his
      cane. &ldquo;A bounder of that kind can&rsquo;t have a particularly nice
      time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;anyhow. If he does get into a decent school,
      he must get tremendously cut by all the decent men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too thick-skinned to mind that sort of thing, I fancy,&rdquo; said
      the scholastic agent. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a new type. This South Kensington
      place and the polytechnics an turning him out by the hundred....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham forgot his resentment at having to profess a religion he did not
      believe, in this new discovery of the scholastic importance of clothing.
      He went along with an eye to all the shop windows that afforded a view of
      his person. Indisputably his trousers <i>were</i> ungainly, flapping
      abominably over his boots and bagging terribly at the knees, and his boots
      were not only worn and ugly but extremely ill blacked. His wrists
      projected offensively from his coat sleeves, he perceived a huge asymmetry
      in the collar of his jacket, his red tie was askew and ill tied, and that
      waterproof collar! It was shiny, slightly discoloured, suddenly clammy to
      the neck. What if he did happen to be well equipped for science teaching?
      That was nothing. He speculated on the cost of a complete outfit. It would
      be difficult to get such grey trousers as those he had seen for less than
      sixteen shillings, and he reckoned a frock coat at forty shillings at
      least&mdash;possibly even more. He knew good clothes were very expensive.
      He hesitated at Poole&rsquo;s door and turned away. The thing was out of
      the question. He crossed Leicester Square and went down Bedford Street,
      disliking every well-dressed person he met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Danks and Wimborne inhabited a bank-like establishment near
      Chancery Lane, and without any conversation presented him with forms to
      fill up. Religion? asked the form. Lewisham paused and wrote &ldquo;Church
      of England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence he went to the College of Pedagogues in Holborn. The College of
      Pedagogues presented itself as a long-bearded, corpulent, comfortable
      person with a thin gold watch chain and fat hands. He wore gilt glasses
      and had a kindly confidential manner that did much to heal Lewisham&rsquo;s
      wounded feelings. The &lsquo;ologies and &lsquo;ographies were taken down
      with polite surprise at their number. &ldquo;You ought to take one of our
      diplomas,&rdquo; said the stout man. &ldquo;You would find no difficulty.
      No competition. And there are prizes&mdash;several prizes&mdash;in money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham was not aware that the waterproof collar had found a sympathetic
      observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We give courses of lectures, and have an examination in the theory
      and practice of education. It is the only examination in the theory and
      practice of education for men engaged in middle and upper class teaching
      in this country. Except the Teacher&rsquo;s Diploma. And so few come&mdash;not
      two hundred a year. Mostly governesses. The men prefer to teach by rule of
      thumb, you know. English characteristic&mdash;rule of thumb. It doesn&rsquo;t
      do to say anything of course&mdash;but there&rsquo;s bound to be&mdash;something
      happen&mdash;something a little disagreeable&mdash;somewhen if things go
      on as they do. American schools keep on getting better&mdash;German too.
      What used to do won&rsquo;t do now. I tell this to you, you know, but it
      doesn&rsquo;t do to tell everyone. It doesn&rsquo;t do. It doesn&rsquo;t
      do to do anything. So much has to be considered. However ... But you&rsquo;d
      do well to get a diploma and make yourself efficient. Though that&rsquo;s
      looking ahead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of looking ahead with an apologetic laugh as though it was an
      amiable weakness of his. He turned from such abstruse matters and
      furnished Lewisham with the particulars of the college diplomas, and
      proceeded to other possibilities. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s private tuition,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;Would you mind a backward boy? Then we are occasionally
      asked for visiting masters. Mostly by girls&rsquo; schools. But that&rsquo;s
      for older men&mdash;married men, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am married,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eh</i>?&rdquo; said the College of Pedagogues, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> married,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the College of Pedagogues gravely, and
      regarding Mr. Lewisham over gold-rimmed glasses. &ldquo;Dear me! And I am
      more than twice your age, and I am not married at all. One-and-twenty!
      Have you&mdash;have you been married long?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few weeks,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very remarkable,&rdquo; said the College of
      Pedagogues. &ldquo;Very interesting.... <i>Really!</i> Your wife must be a
      very courageous young person.... Excuse me! You know&mdash;You will really
      have a hard fight for a position. However&mdash;it certainly makes you
      eligible for girls&rsquo; schools; it does do that. To a certain extent,
      that is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidently enhanced respect of the College of Pedagogues pleased
      Lewisham extremely. But his encounter with the Medical, Scholastic, and
      Clerical Agency that holds by Waterloo Bridge was depressing again, and
      after that he set out to walk home. Long before he reached home he was
      tired, and his simple pride in being married and in active grapple with an
      unsympathetic world had passed. His surrender on the religious question
      had left a rankling bitterness behind it; the problem of the clothes was
      acutely painful. He was still far from a firm grasp of the fact that his
      market price was under rather than over one hundred pounds a year, but
      that persuasion was gaining ground in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was a greyish one, with a dull cold wind, and a nail in one of his
      boots took upon itself to be objectionable. Certain wild shots and
      disastrous lapses in his recent botanical examination, that he had managed
      to keep out of his mind hitherto, forced their way on his attention. For
      the first time since his marriage he harboured premonitions of failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got in he wanted to sit down at once in the little creaky chair by
      the fire, but Ethel came flitting from the newly bought typewriter with
      arms extended and prevented him. &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;it <i>has</i> been dull,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He missed the compliment. &ldquo;<i>I</i> haven&rsquo;t had such a giddy
      time that you should grumble,&rdquo; he said, in a tone that was novel to
      her. He disengaged himself from her arms and sat down. He noticed the
      expression of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather tired,&rdquo; he said by way of apology. &ldquo;And
      there&rsquo;s a confounded nail I must hammer down in my boot. It&rsquo;s
      tiring work hunting up these agents, but of course it&rsquo;s better to go
      and see them. How have you been getting on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, regarding him. And then, &ldquo;You <i>are</i>
      tired. We&rsquo;ll have some tea. And&mdash;let me take off your boot for
      you, dear. Yes&mdash;I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell, bustled out of the room, called for tea at the
      staircase, came back, pulled out Madam Gadow&rsquo;s ungainly hassock and
      began unlacing his boot. Lewisham&rsquo;s mood changed. &ldquo;You <i>are</i>
      a trump, Ethel,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hanged if you&rsquo;re
      not.&rdquo; As the laces flicked he bent forward and kissed her ear. The
      unlacing was suspended and there were reciprocal endearments....
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he was sitting in his slippers, with a cup of tea in his hand,
      and Ethel, kneeling on the hearthrug with the firelight on her face, was
      telling him of an answer that had come that afternoon to her advertisement
      in the <i>Athenaeum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a novelist,&rdquo; she said with the light of pride in
      her eyes, and handed him the letter. &ldquo;Lucas Holderness, the author
      of &lsquo;The Furnace of Sin&rsquo; and other stories.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s first rate,&rdquo; said Lewisham with just a touch of
      envy, and bent forward to read by the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was from an address in Judd Street, Euston Road, written on
      good paper and in a fair round hand such as one might imagine a novelist
      using. &ldquo;Dear Madam,&rdquo; said the letter, &ldquo;I propose to send
      you, by registered letter, the MS. of a three-volume novel. It is about
      90,000 words&mdash;but you must count the exact number.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I shall count I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you a way,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      no difficulty in that. You count the words on three or four pages, strike
      an average, and multiply.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, of course, before doing so I must have a satisfactory
      guarantee that my confidence in putting my work in your hands will not be
      misplaced and that your execution is of the necessary high quality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lewisham; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a bother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accordingly I must ask you for references.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a downright nuisance,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;I
      suppose that ass, Lagune ... But what&rsquo;s this? &lsquo;Or, failing
      references, for a deposit ...&rsquo; That&rsquo;s reasonable, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a moderate deposit too&mdash;merely a guinea. Even had the
      doubt been stronger, the aspect of helpful hopeful little Ethel eager for
      work might well have thrust it aside. &ldquo;Sending him a cheque will
      show him we have a banking account behind us,&rdquo; said Lewisham,&mdash;his
      banking was still sufficiently recent for pride. &ldquo;We will send him a
      cheque. That&rsquo;ll settle <i>him</i> all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after the guinea cheque had been despatched, things were
      further brightened by the arrival of a letter of atrociously jellygraphed
      advices from Messrs. Danks and Wimborne. They all referred to resident
      vacancies for which Lewisham was manifestly unsuitable, nevertheless their
      arrival brought an encouraging assurance of things going on, of shifting
      and unstable places in the defences of the beleaguered world. Afterwards,
      with occasional endearments for Ethel, he set himself to a revision of his
      last year&rsquo;s note-books, for now the botany was finished, the
      advanced zoological course&mdash;the last lap, as it were, for the Forbes
      medal&mdash;was beginning. She got her best hat from the next room to make
      certain changes in the arrangement of its trimmings. She sat in the little
      chair, while Lewisham, with documents spread before him, sat at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she looked up from an experimental arrangement of her
      cornflowers, and discovered Lewisham, no longer reading, but staring
      blankly at the middle of the table-cloth, with an extraordinary misery in
      his eyes. She forgot the cornflowers and stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penny,&rdquo; she said after an interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham started and looked up. &ldquo;<i>Eh</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why were you looking so miserable?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Was</i> I looking miserable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And <i>cross</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking just then that I would like to boil a bishop or so
      in oil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know perfectly well the case against what they teach, they
      know it&rsquo;s neither madness nor wickedness nor any great harm, to
      others not to believe, they know perfectly well that a man may be as
      honest as the day, and right&mdash;right and decent in every way&mdash;and
      not believe in what they teach. And they know that it only wants the edge
      off a man&rsquo;s honour, for him to profess anything in the way of
      belief. Just anything. And they won&rsquo;t say so. I suppose they want
      the edge off every man&rsquo;s honour. If a man is well off they will
      truckle to him no end, though he laughs at all their teaching. They&rsquo;ll
      take gold plate from company promoters and rent from insanitary houses.
      But if a man is poor and doesn&rsquo;t profess to believe in what some of
      them scarcely believe themselves, they wouldn&rsquo;t lift a finger to
      help him against the ignorance of their followers. Your stepfather was
      right enough there. They know what&rsquo;s going on. They know that it
      means lying and humbug for any number of people, and they don&rsquo;t
      care. Why should they? <i>They&rsquo;ve</i> got it down all right. They&rsquo;re
      spoilt, and why shouldn&rsquo;t we be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham having selected the bishops as scapegoats for his turpitude, was
      inclined to ascribe even the nail in his boot to their agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lewisham looked puzzled. She realised his drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; she said, and dropped her voice, &ldquo;an
      <i>infidel</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham nodded gloomily. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t go to church, you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lewisham; and then with more
      assurance, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not an infidel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christian?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a Christian&mdash;What do you believe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! to tell the truth, and do right, and not hurt or injure people
      and all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a Christian. A Christian is one who believes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> mean by a Christian,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! at that rate anyone&rsquo;s a Christian,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
      &ldquo;We all think it&rsquo;s right to do right and wrong to do wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t all do it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lewisham, taking up
      the cornflowers again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham, a little taken aback by the feminine
      method of discussion. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t all do it&mdash;certainly.&rdquo;
      He stared at her for a moment&mdash;her head was a little on one side and
      her eyes on the cornflower&mdash;and his mind was full of a strange
      discovery. He seemed on the verge of speaking, and turned to his note-book
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon the centre of the table-cloth resumed its sway.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The following day Mr. Lucas Holderness received his cheque for a guinea.
      Unhappily it was crossed. He meditated for some time, and then took pen
      and ink and improved Lewisham&rsquo;s careless &ldquo;one&rdquo; to
      &ldquo;five&rdquo; and touched up his unticked figure one to correspond.
    </p>
    <p>
      You perceive him, a lank, cadaverous, good-looking man with long black
      hair and a semi-clerical costume of quite painful rustiness. He made the
      emendations with grave carefulness. He took the cheque round to his
      grocer. His grocer looked at it suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pay it in,&rdquo; said Mr. Lucas Holderness, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve
      any doubts about it. Pay it in. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know the man or what
      he is. He may be a swindler for all I can tell. <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t
      answer for him. Pay it in and see. Leave the change till then. I can wait.
      I&rsquo;ll call round in a few days&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mr. Lucas Holderness in a
      casual tone two days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, sir,&rdquo; said his grocer with enhanced respect, and
      handed him his four pounds thirteen and sixpence change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lucas Holderness, who had been eyeing the grocer&rsquo;s stock with a
      curious intensity, immediately became animated and bought a tin of salmon.
      He went out of the shop with the rest of the money in his hand, for the
      pockets of his clothes were old and untrustworthy. At the baker&rsquo;s he
      bought a new roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bit a huge piece of the roll directly he was out of the shop, and went
      on his way gnawing. It was so large a piece that his gnawing mouth was
      contorted into the ugliest shapes. He swallowed by an effort, stretching
      his neck each time. His eyes expressed an animal satisfaction. He turned
      the corner of Judd Street biting again at the roll, and the reader of this
      story, like the Lewishams, hears of him no more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; THE GLAMOUR FADES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After all, the rosy love-making and marrying and Epithalamy are no more
      than the dawn of things, and to follow comes all the spacious interval of
      white laborious light. Try as we may to stay those delightful moments,
      they fade and pass remorselessly; there is no returning, no recovering,
      only&mdash;for the foolish&mdash;the vilest peep-shows and imitations in
      dens and darkened rooms. We go on&mdash;we grow. At least we age. Our
      young couple, emerging presently from an atmosphere of dusk and morning
      stars, found the sky gathering greyly overhead and saw one another for the
      first time clearly in the light of every-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might perhaps witness better to Lewisham&rsquo;s refinement if one
      could tell only of a moderated and dignified cooling, of pathetic little
      concealments of disappointment and a decent maintenance of the sentimental
      atmosphere. And so at last daylight. But our young couple were too crude
      for that. The first intimations of their lack of identity have already
      been described, but it would be tedious and pitiful to tell of all the
      little intensifications, shade by shade, of the conflict of their
      individualities. They fell out, dear lady! they came to conflict of words.
      The stress of perpetual worry was upon them, of dwindling funds and the
      anxious search for work that would not come. And on Ethel lay long,
      vacant, lonely hours in dull surroundings. Differences arose from the most
      indifferent things; one night Lewisham lay awake in unfathomable amazement
      because she had convinced him she did not care a rap for the Welfare of
      Humanity, and deemed his Socialism a fancy and an indiscretion. And one
      Sunday afternoon they started for a walk under the pleasantest auspices,
      and returned flushed and angry, satire and retort flying free&mdash;on the
      score of the social conventions in Ethel&rsquo;s novelettes. For some
      inexplicable reason Lewisham saw fit to hate her novelettes very bitterly.
      These encounters indeed were mere skirmishes for the most part, and the
      silences and embarrassments that followed ended sooner or later in a
      &ldquo;making up,&rdquo; tacit or definite, though once or twice this
      making up only re-opened the healing wound. And always each skirmish left
      its scar, effaced from yet another line of their lives the lingering tints
      of romantic colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came no work, no added income for either of them, saving two
      trifles, for five long months. Once Lewisham won twelve shillings in the
      prize competition of a penny weekly, and three times came infinitesimal
      portions of typewriting from a poet who had apparently seen the <i>Athenaeum</i>
      advertisement. His name was Edwin Peak Baynes and his handwriting was
      sprawling and unformed. He sent her several short lyrics on scraps of
      paper with instructions that he desired &ldquo;three copies of each
      written beautifully in different styles&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>not</i>
      fastened with metal fasteners but with silk thread of an appropriate
      colour.&rdquo; Both of our young people were greatly exercised by these
      instructions. One fragment was called &ldquo;Bird Song,&rdquo; one &ldquo;Cloud
      Shadows,&rdquo; and one &ldquo;Eryngium,&rdquo; but Lewisham thought they
      might be spoken of collectively as Bosh. By way of payment, this poet
      sent, in contravention of the postal regulations, half a sovereign stuck
      into a card, asking her to keep the balance against future occasions. In a
      little while, greatly altered copies of these lyrics were returned by the
      poet in person, with this enigmatical instruction written across the cover
      of each: &ldquo;This style I like, only if possible more so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham was out, but Ethel opened the door, so this indorsement was
      unnecessary, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really only a boy,&rdquo; said Ethel,
      describing the interview to Lewisham, who was curious. They both felt that
      the youthfulness of Edwin Peak Baynes detracted something from the reality
      of this employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his marriage until the final examination in June, Lewisham&rsquo;s
      life had an odd amphibious quality. At home were Ethel and the perpetual
      aching pursuit of employment, the pelting irritations of Madam Gadow&rsquo;s
      persistent overcharges, and so forth, and amid such things he felt
      extraordinarily grown up; but intercalated with these experiences were
      those intervals at Kensington, scraps of his adolescence, as it were,
      lying amidst the new matter of his manhood, intervals during which he was
      simply an insubordinate and disappointing student with an increasing
      disposition to gossip. At South Kensington he dwelt with theories and
      ideals as a student should; at the little rooms in Chelsea&mdash;they grew
      very stuffy as the summer came on, and the accumulation of the penny
      novelettes Ethel favoured made a litter&mdash;there was his particular
      private concrete situation, and ideals gave place to the real.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strangely narrow world, he perceived dimly, in which his manhood
      opened. The only visitors were the Chafferys. Chaffery would come to share
      their supper, and won upon Lewisham in spite of his roguery by his
      incessantly entertaining monologue and by his expressed respect for and
      envy of Lewisham&rsquo;s scientific attainments. Moreover, as time went on
      Lewisham found himself more and more in sympathy with Chaffery&rsquo;s
      bitterness against those who order the world. It was good to hear him on
      bishops and that sort of people. He said what Lewisham wanted to say
      beautifully. Mrs. Chaffery was perpetually flitting&mdash;out of the house
      as Lewisham came home, a dim, black, nervous, untidy little figure. She
      came because Ethel, in spite of her expressed belief that love was &ldquo;all
      in all,&rdquo; found married life a little dull and lonely while Lewisham
      was away. And she went hastily when he came, because of a certain
      irritability that the struggle against the world was developing. He told
      no one at Kensington about his marriage, at first because it was such a
      delicious secret, and then for quite other reasons. So there was no
      overlapping. The two worlds began and ended sharply at the wrought-iron
      gates. But the day came when Lewisham passed those gates for the last time
      and his adolescence ended altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the final examination of the biological course, the examination that
      signalised the end of his income of a weekly guinea, he knew well enough
      that he had done badly. The evening of the last day&rsquo;s practical work
      found him belated, hot-headed, beaten, with ruffled hair and red ears. He
      sat to the last moment doggedly struggling to keep cool and to mount the
      ciliated funnel of an earthworm&rsquo;s nephridium. But ciliated funnels
      come not to those who have shirked the laboratory practice. He rose,
      surrendered his paper to the morose elderly young assistant demonstrator
      who had welcomed him so flatteringly eight months before, and walked down
      the laboratory to the door where the rest of his fellow-students
      clustered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smithers was talking loudly about the &ldquo;twistiness&rdquo; of the
      identification, and the youngster with the big ears was listening
      attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Lewisham! How did <i>you</i> get on, Lewisham?&rdquo;
      asked Smithers, not concealing his assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horribly,&rdquo; said Lewisham shortly, and pushed past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you spot D?&rdquo; clamoured Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham pretended not to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Heydinger stood with her hat in her hand and looked at Lewisham&rsquo;s
      hot eyes. He was for walking past her, but something in her face
      penetrated even his disturbance. He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get out the nephridium?&rdquo; he said as graciously as he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;Are you going downstairs?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said Lewisham, with a vague intimation in his manner
      of the offence Smithers gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the glass door from the passage to the staircase. They went down
      one tier of that square spiral in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming up again next year?&rdquo; asked Miss Heydinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;No, I shall not come here again.
      Ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause. &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I have to get a living somehow. It&rsquo;s been
      bothering me all the session.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped. &ldquo;Will you go down to
      your uncle&rsquo;s again?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I shall stop in London. It&rsquo;s no good going out of things
      into the country. And besides&mdash;I&rsquo;ve quarrelled rather with my
      uncle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of doing?&mdash;teaching?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it will be teaching, I&rsquo;m not sure. Anything that
      turns up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on down in silence for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will come up again?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may try the botanical again&mdash;if they can find room. And, I
      was thinking&mdash;sometimes one hears of things. What is your address? So
      that if I heard of anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham stopped on the staircase and thought. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he
      said. He made no effort to give her the address, and she demanded it again
      at the foot of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That confounded nephridium&mdash;!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It has
      put everything out of my head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged addresses on leaflets torn from Miss Heydinger&rsquo;s
      little note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited at the Book in the hall while he signed his name. At the iron
      gates of the Schools she said: &ldquo;I am going through Kensington
      Gardens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now feeling irritated about the addresses, and he would not see the
      implicit invitation. &ldquo;I am going towards Chelsea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a moment, looking at him&mdash;puzzled. &ldquo;Good-bye,
      then,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he answered, lifting his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the Exhibition Road slowly with his packed glazed bag, now
      seamed with cracks, in his hand. He went thoughtfully down to the corner
      of the Cromwell Road and turned along that to the right so that he could
      see the red pile of the Science Schools rising fair, and tall across the
      gardens of the Natural History Museum. He looked back towards it
      regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite sure that he had failed in this last examination. He knew
      that any career as a scientific man was now closed to him for ever. And he
      remembered now how he had come along this very road to that great building
      for the first time in his life, and all the hopes and resolves that had
      swelled within him as he had drawn near. That dream of incessant
      unswerving work! Where might he have reached if only he had had singleness
      of purpose to realise that purpose?...
    </p>
    <p>
      And in these gardens it was that he and Smithers and Parkson had sat on a
      seat hard by the fossil tree, and discoursed of Socialism together before
      the great paper was read....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, speaking aloud to himself; &ldquo;yes&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i>
      all over too. Everything&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the corner of the Natural History Museum came between him and
      his receding Alma Mater. He sighed and turned his face towards the stuffy
      little rooms at Chelsea, and the still unconquered world.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; CONCERNING A QUARREL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late in September that this particular quarrel occurred. Almost all
      the roseate tints seemed gone by this time, for the Lewishams had been
      married six months. Their financial affairs had changed from the
      catastrophic to the sordid; Lewisham had found work. An army crammer named
      Captain Vigours wanted someone energetic for his mathematical duffers and
      to teach geometrical drawing and what he was pleased to call &ldquo;Sandhurst
      Science.&rdquo; He paid no less than two shillings an hour for his
      uncertain demands on Lewisham&rsquo;s time. Moreover, there was a class in
      lower mathematics beginning at Walham Green where Lewisham was to show his
      quality. Fifty shillings a week or more seemed credible&mdash;more might
      be hoped for. It was now merely a case of tiding over the interval until
      Vigours paid. And meanwhile the freshness of Ethel&rsquo;s blouses
      departed, and Lewisham refrained from the repair of his boot which had
      cracked across the toe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginning of the quarrel was trivial enough. But by the end they got
      to generalities. Lewisham had begun the day in a bad temper and under the
      cloud of an overnight passage of arms&mdash;and a little incident that had
      nothing to do with their ostensible difference lent it a warmth of emotion
      quite beyond its merits. As he emerged through the folding doors he saw a
      letter lying among the sketchily laid breakfast things, and Ethel&rsquo;s
      attitude suggested the recoil of a quick movement; the letter suddenly
      dropped. Her eyes met his and she flushed. He sat down and took the letter&mdash;a
      trifle awkwardly perhaps. It was from Miss Heydinger. He hesitated with it
      halfway to his pocket, then decided to open it. It displayed an ample
      amount of reading, and he read. On the whole he thought it rather a dull
      sort of letter, but he did not allow this to appear. When it was read he
      put it carefully in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      That formally had nothing to do with the quarrel. The breakfast was
      already over when the quarrel began. Lewisham&rsquo;s morning was vacant,
      and be proposed to occupy it in the revision of certain notes bearing upon
      &ldquo;Sandhurst Science.&rdquo; Unhappily the search for his note-book
      brought him into collision with the accumulation of Ethel&rsquo;s
      novelettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These things are everywhere,&rdquo; he said after a gust of
      vehement handling, &ldquo;I <i>wish</i> you&rsquo;d tidy them up
      sometimes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were tidy enough till you began to throw them about,&rdquo;
      Ethel pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confounded muck! it&rsquo;s only fit to be burnt,&rdquo; Lewisham
      remarked to the universe, and pitched one viciously into the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you tried to write one, anyhow,&rdquo; said Ethel, recalling
      a certain &ldquo;Mammoth&rdquo; packet of note-paper that had come on an
      evil end before Lewisham found his industrial level. This reminiscence
      always irritated him exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tried to write one,&rdquo; repeated Ethel&mdash;a little
      unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean me to forget that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you reminded me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared hostility for a space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the things make a beastly litter anyhow; there isn&rsquo;t a
      tidy corner anywhere in the room. There never is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the sort of thing you always say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;<i>is</i> there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Where</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel professed not to hear. But a devil had possession of Lewisham for a
      time. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as though you had anything else to do,&rdquo;
      he remarked, wounding dishonourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel turned. &ldquo;If I <i>put</i> those things away,&rdquo; she said
      with tremendous emphasis on the &ldquo;<i>put</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
      only say I&rsquo;d hidden them. What <i>is</i> the good of trying to
      please you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of perversity suggested to Lewisham, &ldquo;None apparently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s cheeks glowed and her eyes were bright with unshed tears.
      Abruptly she abandoned the defensive and blurted out the thing that had
      been latent so long between them. Her voice took a note of passion.
      &ldquo;Nothing I can do ever does please you, since that Miss Heydinger
      began to write to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, a gap. Something like astonishment took them both.
      Hitherto it had been a convention that she knew nothing of the existence
      of Miss Heydinger. He saw a light. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; he
      began, and perceived that line was impossible. He took the way of the
      natural man; he ejaculated an &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; of vast disgust, he
      raised his voice. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> unreasonable!&rdquo; he cried in
      angry remonstrance. &ldquo;Fancy saying that! As though you ever tried to
      please me! Just as though it wasn&rsquo;t all the other way about!&rdquo;
      He stopped&mdash;struck by a momentary perception of injustice. He plunged
      at the point he had shirked, &ldquo;How did you know it <i>was</i> Miss
      Heydinger&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel&rsquo;s voice took upon itself the quality of tears. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
      <i>meant</i> to know, was I?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think it doesn&rsquo;t concern me? I suppose you
      think I&rsquo;m made of stone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;you think&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I <i>do</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a brief interval Lewisham stared at the issue she had laid bare. He
      sought some crashing proposition, some line of convincing reasoning, with
      which to overwhelm and hide this new aspect of things. It would not come.
      He found himself fenced in on every side. A surging, irrational rage
      seized upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealousy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Jealousy! Just as though&mdash;Can&rsquo;t
      I have letters about things you don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;that you <i>won&rsquo;t</i>
      understand? If I asked you to read them you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;It&rsquo;s
      just because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never give me a <i>chance</i> to understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&mdash;At first I was always trying. Socialism, religion&mdash;all
      those things. But you don&rsquo;t care&mdash;you won&rsquo;t care. You won&rsquo;t
      have that I&rsquo;ve thought over these things at all, that I care for
      these things! It wasn&rsquo;t any <i>good</i> to argue. You just care for
      me in a way&mdash;and all the rest of me&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t matter! And
      because I&rsquo;ve got a friend ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;<i>friend!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&mdash;you hide her letters!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I tell you you wouldn&rsquo;t understand what they are
      about. But, pah! I won&rsquo;t argue. I <i>won&rsquo;t!</i> You&rsquo;re
      jealous, and there&rsquo;s the end of the matter!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> be jealous?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her as if he found the question hard to see. The theme was
      difficult&mdash;invincibly difficult. He surveyed the room for a
      diversion. The note-book he had disinterred from her novelettes lay upon
      the table and reminded him of his grievance of rained hours. His rage
      exploded. He struck out abruptly towards fundamental things. He
      gesticulated forcibly. &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t go on!&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;this can&rsquo;t go on! How can I work? How can I do anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made three steps and stood in a clear space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t <i>stand</i>, it&mdash;I won&rsquo;t go on at this!
      Quarrels&mdash;bickerings&mdash;discomfort. Look there! I meant to work
      this morning. I meant to look up notes! Instead of which you start a
      quarrel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gross injustice raised Ethel&rsquo;s voice to an outcry. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      didn&rsquo;t start the quarrel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The only response to this was to shout, and Lewisham shouted. &ldquo;You
      start a quarrel!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You make a shindy! You spring
      a dispute&mdash;jealousy!&mdash;on me! How can I do anything? How can one
      stop in a house like this? I shall go out. Look here!&mdash;I shall go
      out. I shall go to Kensington and work there!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived himself wordless, and Ethel was about to speak. He glared
      about him, seeking a prompt climax. Instant action was necessary. He
      perceived Huxley&rsquo;s <i>Vertebrata</i> upon the side-table. He
      clutched it, swayed it through a momentous arc, hurled it violently into
      the empty fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second he seemed to be seeking some other missile. He perceived his
      hat on the chest of drawers, seized it, and strode tragically from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated with the door half closed, then opened it wide and slammed it
      vehemently. Thereby the world was warned of the justice of his rage, and
      so he passed with credit into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went striding heedless of his direction through the streets dotted with
      intent people hurrying to work, and presently habit turned his feet
      towards the Brompton Road. The eastward trend of the morning traffic
      caught him. For a time, save for a rebellious ingredient of wonder at the
      back of his mind, he kept his anger white and pure. Why had he married
      her? was the text to which he clung. Why in the name of destiny had he
      married her? But anyhow he had said the decisive thing. He would not stand
      it! It must end. Things were intolerable and they must end. He meditated
      devastating things that he might presently say to her in pursuance of this
      resolution. He contemplated acts of cruelty. In such ways he would
      demonstrate clearly that he would not stand it. He was very careful to
      avoid inquiring what it was he would not stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      How in the name of destiny had he come to marry her? The quality of his
      surroundings mingled in some way with the quality of his thoughts. The
      huge distended buildings of corrugated iron in which the Art Museum (of
      all places!) culminates, the truncated Oratory all askew to the street,
      seemed to have a similar quarrel with fate. How in the name of destiny?
      After such high prolusions!
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that his thoughts had carried him past the lodge of the museum.
      He turned back irritably and went through the turnstile. He entered the
      museum and passed beneath the gallery of Old Iron on his way to the
      Education Library. The vacant array of tables, the bays of attendant books
      had a quality of refuge....
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for Lewisham in the morning. Long before midday all the vigour of
      his wrath was gone, all his passionate conviction of Ethel&rsquo;s
      unworthiness. Over a pile of neglected geological works he presented a
      face of gloom. His memory presented a picture of himself as noisy,
      overbearing, and unfair. What on earth had it all been about?
    </p>
    <p>
      By two o&rsquo;clock he was on his way to Vigours&rsquo;, and his mood was
      acute remorse. Of the transition there can be no telling in words, for
      thoughts are more subtle than words and emotions infinitely vaguer. But
      one thing at least is definite, that a memory returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It drifted in to him, through the glass roof of the Library far above. He
      did not perceive it as a memory at first, but as an irritating obstacle to
      attention. He struck the open pages of the book before him with his flat
      hand. &ldquo;Damn that infernal hurdy-gurdy!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he made a fretful movement and put his hands over his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he thrust his books from him, got up, and wandered about the Library.
      The organ came to an abrupt end in the middle of a bar, and vanished in
      the circumambient silence of space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham standing in a bay closed a book with a snap and returned to his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he found himself humming a languid tune, and thinking again of
      the quarrel that he had imagined banished from his mind. What in the name
      of destiny had it all been about? He had a curious sense that something
      had got loose, was sliding about in his mind. And as if by way of answer
      emerged a vision of Whortley&mdash;a singularly vivid vision. It was
      moonlight and a hillside, the little town lay lit and warm below, and the
      scene was set to music, a lugubriously sentimental air. For some reason
      this music had the quality of a barrel organ&mdash;though he knew that
      properly it came from a band&mdash;and it associated with itself a
      mystical formula of words, drawing words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Sweet dreamland fa&mdash;ces, passing to and fro,
    Bring back to mem&rsquo;ry days of long ago&mdash;oh!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This air not only reproduced the picture with graphic vividness, but it
      trailed after it an enormous cloud of irrational emotion, emotion that had
      but a moment before seemed gone for ever from his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled it all! He had come down that hillside and Ethel had been with
      him....
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he really felt like that about her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; he said suddenly, and reverted to his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tune and the memory had won their footing, they were with him
      through his meagre lunch of milk and scones&mdash;he had resolved at the
      outset he would not go back to her for the midday meal&mdash;and on his
      way to Vigours&rsquo; they insisted on attention. It may be that lunching
      on scone and milk does in itself make for milder ways of thinking. A sense
      of extraordinary contradiction, of infinite perplexity, came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how the devil did we get to <i>this</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is indeed one of the fundamental questions of matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning tumults had given place to an almost scientific calm. Very
      soon he was grappling manfully with the question. There was no disputing
      it, they had quarrelled. Not once but several times lately they had
      quarrelled. It was real quarrelling;&mdash;they had stood up against one
      another, striking, watching to strike, seeking to wound. He tried to
      recall just how things had gone&mdash;what he had said and what she had
      replied. He could not do it. He had forgotten phrases and connexions. It
      stood in his memory not as a sequence of events but as a collection of
      disconnected static sayings; each saying blunt, permanent, inconsecutive
      like a graven inscription. And of the scene there came only one picture&mdash;Ethel
      with a burning face and her eyes shining with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traffic of a cross street engaged him for a space. He emerged on the
      further side full of the vivid contrast of their changed relations. He
      made a last effort to indict her, to show that for the transition she was
      entirely to blame. She had quarrelled with him, she had quarrelled
      deliberately because she was jealous. She was jealous of Miss Heydinger
      because she was stupid. But now these accusations faded like smoke as he
      put them forth. But the picture of two little figures back there in the
      moonlit past did not fade. It was in the narrows of Kensington High Street
      that he abandoned her arraignment. It was beyond the Town Hall that he
      made the new step. Was it, after all, just possible that in some degree he
      himself rather was the chief person to blame?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was instantly as if he had been aware of that all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he had made that step, he moved swiftly. Not a hundred paces before
      the struggle was over, and he had plunged headlong into the blue abyss of
      remorse. And all these things that had been so dramatic and forcible, all
      the vivid brutal things he had said, stood no longer graven inscriptions
      but in letters of accusing flame. He tried to imagine he had not said
      them, that his memory played him a trick; tried to suppose he had said
      something similar perhaps, but much less forcible. He attempted with
      almost equal futility to minimise his own wounds. His endeavour served
      only to measure the magnitude of his fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had recovered everything now, he saw it all. He recalled Ethel, sunlit
      in the avenue, Ethel, white in the moonlight before they parted outside
      the Frobisher house, Ethel as she would come out of Lagune&rsquo;s house
      greeting him for their nightly walk, Ethel new wedded, as she came to him
      through the folding doors radiant in the splendour his emotions threw
      about her. And at last, Ethel angry, dishevelled and tear-stained in that
      ill-lit, untidy little room. All to the cadence of a hurdy-gurdy tune!
      From that to this! How had it been possible to get from such an opalescent
      dawning to such a dismal day? What was it had gone? He and she were the
      same two persons who walked so brightly in his awakened memory; he and she
      who had lived so bitterly through the last few weeks of misery!
    </p>
    <p>
      His mood sank for a space to the quality of groaning. He implicated her
      now at most as his partner in their failure&mdash;&ldquo;What a mess we
      have made of things!&rdquo; was his new motif. &ldquo;What a mess!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew love now for what it was, knew it for something more ancient and
      more imperative than reason. He knew now that he loved her, and his recent
      rage, his hostility, his condemnation of her seemed to him the reign of
      some exterior influence in his mind. He thought incredulously of the long
      decline in tenderness that had followed the first days of their delight in
      each other, the diminution of endearment, the first yielding to
      irritability, the evenings he had spent doggedly working, resisting all
      his sense of her presence. &ldquo;One cannot always be love-making,&rdquo;
      he had said, and so they were slipping apart. Then in countless little
      things he had not been patient, he had not been fair. He had wounded her
      by harshness, by unsympathetic criticism, above all by his absurd secrecy
      about Miss Heydinger&rsquo;s letters. Why on earth had he kept those
      letters from her? as though there was something to hide! What was there to
      hide? What possible antagonism could there be? Yet it was by such little
      things that their love was now like some once valued possession that had
      been in brutal hands, it was scratched and chipped and tarnished, it was
      on its way to being altogether destroyed. Her manner had changed towards
      him, a gulf was opening that he might never be able to close again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it <i>shall</i> not be!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it shall not be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But how to get back to the old footing? how to efface the things he had
      said, the things that had been done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Could they get back?
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he faced a new possibility. Suppose they could not get back!
      Suppose the mischief was done! Suppose that when he slammed the door
      behind him it locked, and was locked against him for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we <i>must</i>!&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;we must!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived clearly that this was no business of reasoned apologies. He
      must begin again, he must get back to emotion, he must thrust back the
      overwhelming pressure of everyday stresses and necessities that was
      crushing all the warmth and colour from their lives. But how? How?
    </p>
    <p>
      He must make love to her again. But how to begin&mdash;how to mark the
      change? There had been making-up before, sullen concessions and treaties.
      But this was different. He tried to imagine something he might say, some
      appeal that he might make. Everything he thought of was cold and hard, or
      pitiful and undignified, or theatrical and foolish. Suppose the door <i>was</i>
      closed! If already it was too late! In every direction he was confronted
      by the bristling memories of harsh things. He had a glimpse of how he must
      have changed in her eyes, and things became intolerable for him. For now
      he was assured he loved her still with all his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly came a florist&rsquo;s window, and in the centre of it a
      glorious heap of roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      They caught his eye before they caught his mind. He saw white roses,
      virginal white, roses of cream and pink and crimson, the tints of flesh
      and pearl, rich, a mass of scented colour, visible odours, and in the
      midst of them a note of sullen red. It was as it were the very colour of
      his emotion. He stopped abruptly. He turned back to the window and stared
      frankly. It was gorgeous, he saw, but why so particularly did it appeal to
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he perceived as though it was altogether self-evident what he had to
      do. This was what he wanted. This was the note he had to strike. Among
      other things because it would repudiate the accursed worship of pinching
      self-restraint that was one of the incessant stresses between them. They
      would come to her with a pure unexpectedness, they would flame upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after the roses, he would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the grey trouble passed from his mind; he saw the world full of
      colour again. He saw the scene he desired bright and clear, saw Ethel no
      longer bitter and weeping, but glad as once she had always seemed glad.
      His heart-beats quickened. It was giving had been needed, and he would
      give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some weak voice of indiscreet discretion squeaked and vanished. He had, he
      knew, a sovereign in his pocket. He went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself in front of a formidable young lady in black, and
      unprepared with any formula. He had never bought flowers before. He looked
      about him for an inspiration. He pointed at the roses. &ldquo;I want those
      roses,&rdquo; he said....
    </p>
    <p>
      He emerged again with only a few small silver coins remaining out of the
      sovereign he had changed. The roses were to go to Ethel, properly packed;
      they were to be delivered according to his express direction at six o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Lewisham had reiterated very earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We quite understand,&rdquo; the young lady in black had said, and
      had pretended to be unable to conceal a smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re <i>quite</i>
      accustomed to sending out flowers.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; THE COMING OF THE ROSES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And the roses miscarried!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lewisham returned from Vigours&rsquo; it was already nearly seven. He
      entered the house with a beating heart. He had expected to find Ethel
      excited, the roses displayed. But her face was white and jaded. He was so
      surprised by this that the greeting upon his lips died away. He was
      balked! He went into, the sitting-room and there were no roses to be seen.
      Ethel came past him and stood with her back to him looking out of the
      window. The suspense was suddenly painful....
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to ask, though he was certain of the answer, &ldquo;Has
      nothing come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel looked at him. &ldquo;What did you think had come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked out of the window again. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said slowly,
      &ldquo;nothing has come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to think of something to say that might bridge the distance
      between them, but he could think of nothing. He must wait until the roses
      came. He took out his books and a gaunt hour passed to supper time. Supper
      was a chilly ceremonial set with necessary over-polite remarks.
      Disappointment and exasperation darkened Lewisham&rsquo;s soul. He began
      to feel angry with everything&mdash;even with her&mdash;he perceived she
      still judged him angry, and that made him angry with her. He was resuming
      his books and she was helping Madam Gadow&rsquo;s servant to clear away,
      when they heard a rapping at the street door. &ldquo;They have come at
      last,&rdquo; he said to himself brightening, and hesitated whether he
      should bolt or witness her reception of them. The servant was a nuisance.
      Then he heard Chaffery&rsquo;s voices and whispered a soft &ldquo;damn!&rdquo;
      to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing to do now if the roses came was to slip out into the
      passage, intercept them, and carry them into the bedroom by the door
      between that and the passage. It would be undesirable for Chaffery to
      witness that phase of sentiment. He might flash some dart of ridicule that
      would stick in their memory for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham tried to show that he did not want a visitor. But Chaffery was in
      high spirits, and could have warmed a dozen cold welcomes. He sat down
      without any express invitation in the chair that he preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mr. and Mrs. Chaffery the Lewishams veiled whatever trouble might
      be between them beneath an insincere cordiality, and Chaffery was soon
      talking freely, unsuspicious of their crisis. He produced two cigars.
      &ldquo;I had a wild moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&lsquo;For once,&rsquo;
      said I, &lsquo;the honest shall smoke the admirable&mdash;or the admirable
      shall smoke the honest,&rsquo; whichever you like best. Try one? No? Those
      austere principles of yours! There will be more pleasure then. But really,
      I would as soon you smoked it as I. For to-night I radiate benevolence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cut the cigar with care, he lit it with ceremony, waiting until nothing
      but honest wood was burning on the match, and for fully a minute he was
      silent, evolving huge puffs of smoke. And then he spoke again, punctuating
      his words by varied and beautiful spirals. &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I have only trifled with knavery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lewisham said nothing he resumed after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three sorts of men in the world, my boy, three and no
      more&mdash;and of women only one. There are happy men and there are knaves
      and fools. Hybrids I don&rsquo;t count. And to my mind knaves and fools
      are very much alike.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they are,&rdquo; said Lewisham flatly, and frowned at the
      fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaffery eyed him. &ldquo;I am talking wisdom. To-night I am talking a
      particular brand of wisdom. I am broaching some of my oldest and finest,
      because&mdash;as you will find one day&mdash;this is a special occasion.
      And you are distrait!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham looked up. &ldquo;Birthday?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see. But I was making golden observations about knaves and
      fools. I was early convinced of the absolute necessity of righteousness if
      a man is to be happy. I know it as surely as there is a sun in the
      heavens. Does that surprise you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it hardly squares&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I know. I will explain all that. But let me tell you the happy
      life. Let me give you that, as if I lay on my deathbed and this was a
      parting gift. In the first place, mental integrity. Prove all things, hold
      fast to that which is right. Let the world have no illusions for you, no
      surprises. Nature is full of cruel catastrophes, man is a physically
      degenerate ape, every appetite, every instinct, needs the curb; salvation
      is not in the nature of things, but whatever salvation there may be is in
      the nature of man; face all these painful things. I hope you follow that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Lewisham, with the debating-society taste for a
      thesis prevailing for a minute over that matter of the roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In youth, exercise and learning; in adolescence, ambition; and in
      early manhood, love&mdash;no footlight passion.&rdquo; Chaffery was very
      solemn and insistent, with a lean extended finger, upon this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then marriage, young and decent, and then children and stout honest
      work for them, work too for the State in which they live; a life of
      self-devotion, indeed, and for sunset a decent pride&mdash;that is the
      happy life. Rest assured that is the happy life; the life Natural
      Selection has been shaping for man since life began. So a man may go happy
      from the cradle to the grave&mdash;at least&mdash;passably happy. And to
      do this needs just three things&mdash;a sound body, a sound intelligence,
      and a sound will ... A sound will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaffery paused on the repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other happiness endures. And when all men are wise, all men will
      seek that life. Fame! Wealth! Art!&mdash;the Red Indians worship lunatics,
      and we are still by way of respecting the milder sorts. But I say that all
      men who do not lead that happy life are knaves and fools. The physical
      cripple, you know, poor devil, I count a sort of bodily fool.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; weighed Lewisham, &ldquo;I suppose he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now a fool fails of happiness because of his insufficient mind, he
      miscalculates, he stumbles and hobbles, some cant or claptrap whirls him
      away; he gets passion out of a book and a wife out of the stews, or he
      quarrels on a petty score; threats frighten him, vanity beguiles him, he
      fails by blindness. But the knave who is not a fool fails against the
      light. Many knaves are fools also&mdash;<i>most</i> are&mdash;but some are
      not. I know&mdash;I am a knave but no fool. The essence of your knave is
      that he lacks the will, the motive capacity to seek his own greater good.
      The knave abhors persistence. Strait is the way and narrow the gate; the
      knave cannot keep to it and the fool cannot find it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham lost something of what Chaffery was saying by reason of a rap
      outside. He rose, but Ethel was before him. He concealed his anxiety as
      well as he could; and was relieved when he heard the front door close
      again and her footsteps pass into the bedroom by the passage door. He
      reverted to Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you,&rdquo; asked Chaffery, apparently
      apropos of nothing, &ldquo;that intellectual conviction is no motive at
      all? Any more than a railway map will run a train a mile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;Map&mdash;run a train a mile&mdash;of
      course, yes. No, it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely my case,&rdquo; said Chaffery. &ldquo;That is the
      case of your pure knave everywhere. We are not fools&mdash;because we
      know. But yonder runs the highway, windy, hard, and austere, a sort of dry
      happiness that will endure; and here is the pleasant by-way&mdash;lush, my
      boy, lush, as the poets have it, and with its certain man-trap among the
      flowers ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel returned through the folding doors. She glanced at Lewisham,
      remained standing for awhile, sat down in the basket chair as if to resume
      some domestic needlework that lay upon the table, then rose and went back
      into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaffery proceeded to expatiate on the transitory nature of passion and
      all glorious and acute experiences. Whole passages of that discourse
      Lewisham did not hear, so intent was he upon those roses. Why had Ethel
      gone back into the bedroom? Was it possible&mdash;? Presently she
      returned, but she sat down so that he could not see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is one thing to set against the wholesome life it is
      adventure,&rdquo; Chaffery was saying. &ldquo;But let every adventurer
      pray for an early death, for with adventure come wounds, and with wounds
      come sickness, and&mdash;except in romances&mdash;sickness affects the
      nervous system. Your nerve goes. Where are you then, my boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ssh! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rap at the house door. Heedless of the flow of golden wisdom, he
      went out at once and admitted a gentleman friend of Madam Gadow, who
      passed along the passage and vanished down the staircase. When he returned
      Chaffery was standing to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have talked with you longer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you
      have something on your mind, I see. I will not worry you by guessing what.
      Some day you will remember ...&rdquo; He said no more, but laid his hand
      on Lewisham&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might almost fancy he was offended at something.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any other time Lewisham might have been propitiatory, but now he
      offered no apology. Chaffery turned to Ethel and looked at her curiously
      for a moment. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the doorstep Chaffery regarded Lewisham with the same curious look, and
      seemed to weigh some remark. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said at last with
      something in his manner that kept Lewisham at the door for a moment
      looking after his stepfather&rsquo;s receding figure. But immediately the
      roses were uppermost again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he re-entered the living room he found Ethel sitting idly at her
      typewriter, playing with the keys. She got up at his return and sat down
      in the armchair with a novelette that hid her face. He stared at her, full
      of questions. After all, then, they had not come. He was intensely
      disappointed now, he was intensely angry with the ineffable young
      shop-woman in black. He looked at his watch and then again, he took a book
      and pretended to read and found himself composing a scathing speech of
      remonstrance to be delivered on the morrow at the flower-shop. He put his
      book down, went to his black bag, opened and closed it aimlessly. He
      glanced covertly at Ethel, and found her looking covertly at him. He could
      not quite understand her expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fidgeted into the bedroom and stopped as dead as a pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt an extraordinary persuasion of the scent of roses. So strong did
      it seem that he glanced outside the room door, expecting to find a box
      there, mysteriously arrived. But there was no scent of roses in the
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw close by his foot an enigmatical pale object, and stooping,
      picked up the creamy petal of a rose. He stood with it in his hand,
      perplexed beyond measure. He perceived a slight disorder of the valence of
      the dressing-table and linked it with this petal by a swift intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made two steps, lifted the valence, and behold! there lay his roses
      crushed together!
    </p>
    <p>
      He gasped like a man who plunges suddenly into cold water. He remained
      stooping with the valence raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel appeared in the half doorway and her, expression was unfamiliar. He
      stared at her white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth did you put my roses here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared back at him. Her face reflected his astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you put my roses here?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your roses!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;What! Did <i>you</i> send
      those roses?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; THORNS AND ROSE PETALS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      He remained stooping and staring up at her, realising the implication of
      her words only very slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it grew clear to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she saw understanding dawning in his face, she uttered a cry of
      consternation. She came forward and sat down upon the little bedroom
      chair. She turned to him and began a sentence. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; she said,
      and stopped, with an impatient gesture of her hands. &ldquo;<i>Oh</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He straightened himself and stood regarding her. The basket of roses lay
      overturned between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought these came from someone else?&rdquo; he said, trying to
      grasp this inversion of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes, &ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;A
      trap.... Was it likely&mdash;they came from you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought they came from someone else,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Baynes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham looked about him&mdash;a man in the presence of the
      inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you have been carrying on with that youngster
      behind my back?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her lips to speak and had no words to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pallor increased until every tinge of colour had left his face. He
      laughed and then set his teeth. Husband and wife looked at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never dreamt,&rdquo; he said in even tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the bed, thrusting his feet among the scattered roses with
      a sort of grim satisfaction. &ldquo;I never dreamt,&rdquo; he repeated,
      and the flimsy basket kicked by his swinging foot hopped indignantly
      through the folding doors into the living room and left a trail of
      blood-red petals.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat for perhaps two minutes, and when he spoke again his voice was
      hoarse. He reverted to a former formula. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said,
      and cleared his throat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you think I&rsquo;m
      going to stand this, but I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. She sat staring in front of her, making no attempt to
      cope with disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I say I&rsquo;m not going to stand it,&rdquo; explained
      Lewisham, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean having a row or anything of that sort.
      One can quarrel and be disappointed over&mdash;other things&mdash;and
      still go on. But this is a different thing altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all dreams and illusions!... Think what I have lost in this
      accursed marriage. And <i>now</i> ... You don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;you
      won&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor you,&rdquo; said Ethel, weeping but neither looking at him nor
      moving her hands from her lap where they lay helplessly. &ldquo;<i>You</i>
      don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in silence gathering force. &ldquo;In one year,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;all my hopes, all my ambitions have gone. I know I have been cross
      and irritable&mdash;I know that. I&rsquo;ve been pulled two ways. But ...
      I bought you these roses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the roses, and then at his white face, made an imperceptible
      movement towards him, and became impassive again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think one thing. I have found out you are shallow, you don&rsquo;t
      think, you can&rsquo;t feel things that I think and feel. I have been
      getting over that. But I did think you were loyal&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> loyal,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think&mdash;Bah!&mdash;you poke my roses under the table!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another portentous silence. Ethel stirred and he turned his eyes to watch
      what she was about to do. She produced her handkerchief and began to wipe
      her dry eyes rapidly, first one and then the other. Then she began
      sobbing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ... as loyal as you ... anyhow,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Lewisham was aghast. Then he perceived he must ignore that
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have stood it&mdash;I would have stood anything if you had
      been loyal&mdash;if I could have been sure of you. I am a fool, I know,
      but I would have stood the interruption of my work, the loss of any hope
      of a Career, if I had been sure you were loyal. I ... I cared for you a
      great deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. He had suddenly perceived the pathetic. He took refuge in
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have deceived me! How long, how much, I don&rsquo;t care.
      You have deceived me. And I tell you&rdquo;&mdash;he began to gesticulate&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not so much your slave and fool as to stand that! No woman shall make me
      <i>that</i> sort of fool, whatever else&mdash;So far as I am concerned,
      this ends things. This ends things. We are married&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t
      care if we were married five hundred times. I won&rsquo;t stop with a
      woman who takes flowers from another man&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham gave way to a transport of anger. He caught up a handful of roses
      and extended them, trembling. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s <i>this</i>?&rdquo; he
      asked. His finger bled from a thorn, as once it had bled from a blackthorn
      spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> take them,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
      help it if they were sent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;But what is the good of argument
      and denial? You took them in, you had them. You may have been cunning, but
      you have given yourself away. And our life and all this&rdquo;&mdash;he
      waved an inclusive hand at Madam Gadow&rsquo;s furniture&mdash;&ldquo;is
      at an end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her and repeated with bitter satisfaction, &ldquo;At an end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at his face, and his expression was remorseless. &ldquo;I will
      not go on living with you,&rdquo; he said, lest there should be any
      mistake. &ldquo;Our life is at an end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes went from his face to the scattered roses. She remained staring
      at these. She was no longer weeping, and her face, save about the eyes,
      was white.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presented it in another form. &ldquo;I shall go away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never ought to have married,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;But ...
      I never expected <i>this</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she cried out, lifting up her voice.
      &ldquo;I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> know. How could <i>I</i> help! <i>Oh</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and stared at him with hands clenched, her eyes haggard with
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham remained impenetrably malignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to know,&rdquo; he said, answering her
      dumb appeal. &ldquo;That settles everything. <i>That</i>!&rdquo; He
      indicated the scattered flowers. &ldquo;What does it matter to me what has
      happened or hasn&rsquo;t happened? Anyhow&mdash;oh! I don&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;m
      glad. See? It settles things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner we part the better. I shan&rsquo;t stop with you another
      night. I shall take my box and my portmanteau into that room and pack. I
      shall stop in there to-night, sleep in a chair or <i>think</i>. And
      to-morrow I shall settle up with Madam Gadow and go. You can go back ...
      to your cheating.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped for some seconds. She was deadly still. &ldquo;You wanted to,
      and now you may. You wanted to, before I got work. You remember? You know
      your place is still open at Lagune&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t care. I tell you
      I don&rsquo;t care <i>that</i>. Not that! You may go your own way&mdash;and
      I shall go mine. See? And all this rot&mdash;this sham of living together
      when neither cares for the other&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care for you <i>now</i>,
      you know, so you needn&rsquo;t think it&mdash;will be over and done with.
      As for marriage&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care <i>that</i> for marriage&mdash;it
      can&rsquo;t make a sham and a blunder anything but a sham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sham, and shams have to end, and that&rsquo;s the end
      of the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up resolutely. He kicked the scattered roses out of his way and
      dived beneath the bed for his portmanteau. Ethel neither spoke nor moved,
      but remained watching his movements. For a time the portmanteau refused to
      emerge, and he marred his stern resolution by a half audible &ldquo;Come
      here&mdash;damn you!&rdquo; He swung it into the living room and returned
      for his box. He proposed to pack in that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had taken all his personal possessions out of the bedroom, he
      closed the folding-doors with an air of finality. He knew from the sounds
      that followed that she flung herself upon the bed, and that filled him
      with grim satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood listening for a space, then set about packing methodically. The
      first rage of discovery had abated; he knew quite clearly that he was
      inflicting grievous punishment, and that gratified him. There was also
      indeed a curious pleasure in the determination of a long and painful
      period of vague misunderstanding by this unexpected crisis. He was acutely
      conscious of the silence on the other side of the folding-doors, he kept
      up a succession of deliberate little noises, beat books together and
      brushed clothes, to intimate the resolute prosecution of his preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was about nine o&rsquo;clock. At eleven he was still busy....
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness came suddenly upon him. It was Madam Gadow&rsquo;s economical
      habit to turn off all her gas at that hour unless she chanced to be
      entertaining friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his pocket for matches and he had none. He whispered curses.
      Against such emergencies he had bought a brass lamp and in the bedroom
      there were candles. Ethel had a candle alight, he could see the bright
      yellow line that appeared between the folding doors. He felt his way
      presently towards the mantel, receiving a blow in the ribs from a chair on
      the way, and went carefully amidst Madam Gadow&rsquo;s once amusing
      ornaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no matches on the mantel. Going to the chest of drawers he
      almost fell over his open portmanteau. He had a silent ecstasy of rage.
      Then he kicked against the basket in which the roses had come. He could
      find no matches on the chest of drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel must have the matches in the bedroom, but that was absolutely
      impossible. He might even have to ask her for them, for at times she
      pocketed matches.... There was nothing for it but to stop packing. Not a
      sound came from the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided he would sit down in the armchair and go to sleep. He crept
      very carefully to the chair and sat down. Another interval of listening
      and he closed his eyes and composed himself for slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to think over his plans for the morrow. He imagined the scene
      with Madam Gadow, and then his departure to find bachelor lodgings once
      more. He debated in what direction he should go to get, suitable lodgings.
      Possible difficulties with his luggage, possible annoyances of the search
      loomed gigantic. He felt greatly irritated at these minor difficulties. He
      wondered if Ethel also was packing. What particularly would she do? He
      listened, but he could hear nothing. She was very still. She was really
      very still! What could she be doing? He forgot the bothers of the morrow
      in this new interest. Presently he rose very softly and listened. Then he
      sat down again impatiently. He tried to dismiss his curiosity about the
      silence by recapitulating the story of his wrongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some difficulty in fixing his mind upon this theme, but presently
      his memories were flowing freely. Only it was not wrongs now that he could
      recall. He was pestered by an absurd idea that he had again behaved
      unjustly to Ethel, that he had been headlong and malignant. He made
      strenuous efforts to recover his first heat of jealousy&mdash;in vain. Her
      remark that she had been as loyal as he, became an obstinate headline in
      his mind. Something arose within him that insisted upon Ethel&rsquo;s
      possible fate if he should leave her. What particularly would she do? He
      knew how much her character leant upon his, Good Heavens! What might she
      not do?
    </p>
    <p>
      By an effort he succeeded in fixing his mind on Baynes. That helped him
      back to the harsher footing. However hard things might be for her she
      deserved them. She deserved them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet presently he slipped again, slipped back to the remorse and regrets of
      the morning time. He clutched at Baynes as a drowning man clutches at a
      rope, and recovered himself. For a time he meditated on Baynes. He had
      never seen the poet, so his imagination had scope. It appeared to him as
      an exasperating obstacle to a tragic avenging of his honour that Baynes
      was a mere boy&mdash;possibly even younger than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question, &ldquo;What will become of Ethel?&rdquo; rose to the surface
      again. He struggled against its possibilities. No! That was not it! That
      was her affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt inexorably kept to the path he had chosen, for all the waning of
      his rage. He had put his hand to the plough. &ldquo;If you condone this,&rdquo;
      he told himself, &ldquo;you might condone anything. There are things one
      <i>must</i> not stand.&rdquo; He tried to keep to that point of view&mdash;assuming
      for the most part out of his imagination what it was he was not standing.
      A dim sense came to him of how much he was assuming. At any rate she must
      have flirted!... He resisted this reviving perception of justice as though
      it was some unspeakably disgraceful craving. He tried to imagine her with
      Baynes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined he would go to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his was a waking weariness. He tried counting. He tried to distract
      his thoughts from her by going over the atomic weights of the elements....
    </p>
    <p>
      He shivered, and realised that he was cold and sitting cramped on an
      uncomfortable horsehair chair. He had dozed. He glanced for the yellow
      line between the folding doors. It was still there, but it seemed to
      quiver. He judged the candle must be flaring. He wondered why everything
      was so still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now why should he suddenly feel afraid?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat for a long time trying to hear some movement, his head craning
      forward in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grotesque idea came into his head that all that had happened a very long
      time ago. He dismissed that. He contested an unreasonable persuasion that
      some irrevocable thing had passed. But why was everything so still?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was invaded by a prevision of unendurable calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he rose and crept very slowly, and with infinite precautions
      against noise, towards the folding doors. He stood listening with his ear
      near the yellow chink.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear nothing, not even the measured breathing of a sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived that the doors were not shut, but slightly ajar. He pushed
      against the inner one very gently and opened it silently. Still there was
      no sound of Ethel. He opened the door still wider and peered into the
      room. The candle had burnt down and was flaring in its socket. Ethel was
      lying half undressed upon the bed, and in her hand and close to her face
      was a rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood watching her, fearing to move. He listened hard and his face was
      very white. Even now he could not hear her breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, it was probably all right. She was just asleep. He would slip
      back before she woke. If she found him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her again. There was something in her face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came nearer, no longer heeding the sounds he made. He bent over her.
      Even now she did not seem to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that her eyelashes were still wet, the pillow by her cheek was wet.
      Her white, tear-stained face hurt him....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was intolerably pitiful to him. He forgot everything but that and how
      he had wounded her that day. And then she stirred and murmured
      indistinctly a foolish name she had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He forgot that they were going to part for ever. He felt nothing but a
      great joy that she could stir and speak. His jealousy flashed out of
      being. He dropped upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;Is it all right? I ... I could
      not hear you breathing. I could not hear you breathing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She started and was awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in the other room,&rdquo; said Lewisham in a voice full of
      emotion. &ldquo;Everything was so quiet, I was afraid&mdash;I did not know
      what had happened. Dear&mdash;Ethel dear. Is it all right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up quickly and scrutinised his face. &ldquo;Oh! let me tell you,&rdquo;
      she wailed. &ldquo;Do let me tell you. It&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s
      nothing. You wouldn&rsquo;t hear me. You wouldn&rsquo;t hear me. It wasn&rsquo;t
      fair&mdash;before you had heard me....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His arms tightened about her. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I knew
      it was nothing. I knew. I knew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in sobbing sentences. &ldquo;It was so simple. Mr. Baynes ...
      something in his manner ... I knew he might be silly ... Only I did so
      want to help you.&rdquo; She paused. Just for one instant she saw one
      untenable indiscretion as it were in a lightning flash. A chance meeting
      it was, a &ldquo;silly&rdquo; thing or so said, a panic, retreat. She
      would have told it&mdash;had she known how. But she could not do it. She
      hesitated. She abolished it&mdash;untold. She went on: &ldquo;And then, I
      thought he had sent the roses and I was frightened ... I was frightened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear one,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;Dear one! I have been cruel
      to you. I have been unjust. I understand. I do understand. Forgive me.
      Dearest&mdash;forgive me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did so want to do something for you. It was all I could do&mdash;that
      little money. And then you were angry. I thought you didn&rsquo;t love me
      any more because I did not understand your work.... And that Miss
      Heydinger&mdash;Oh! it was hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear one,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;I do not care your little
      finger for Miss Heydinger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how I hamper you. But if you will help me. Oh! I would work,
      I would study. I would do all I could to understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; whispered Lewisham. &ldquo;<i>Dear</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to have <i>her</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he vowed, &ldquo;I have been a brute. I will end all
      that. I will end all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her suddenly into his arms and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>know</i> I&rsquo;m stupid,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not. It&rsquo;s I have been stupid. I have been
      unkind, unreasonable. All to-day&mdash;... I&rsquo;ve been thinking about
      it. Dear! I don&rsquo;t care for anything&mdash;It&rsquo;s <i>you</i>. If
      I have you nothing else matters ... Only I get hurried and cross. It&rsquo;s
      the work and being poor. Dear one, we <i>must</i> hold to each other. All
      to-day&mdash;It&rsquo;s been dreadful....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. They sat clinging to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do love you,&rdquo; she said presently with her arms about him.
      &ldquo;Oh! I do&mdash;<i>do</i>&mdash;love you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her neck. She pressed him to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their lips met.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expiring candle streamed up into a tall flame, flickered, and was
      suddenly extinguished. The air was heavy with the scent of roses.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; A WITHDRAWAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Tuesday Lewisham returned from Vigours&rsquo; at five&mdash;at
      half-past six he would go on to his science class at Walham Green&mdash;and
      discovered Mrs. Chaffery and Ethel in tears. He was fagged and rather
      anxious for some tea, but the news they had for him drove tea out of his
      head altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gone? What! Not Chaffery?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Chaffery, with a keen eye to Lewisham&rsquo;s behaviour, nodded
      tearfully over an experienced handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham grasped the essentials of the situation forthwith, and trembled
      on the brink of an expletive. Ethel handed him a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Lewisham held this in his hand asking; questions. Mrs.
      Chaffery had come upon it in the case of her eight-day clock when the time
      to wind it came round. Chaffery, it seemed, had not been home since
      Saturday night. The letter was an open one addressed to Lewisham, a long
      rambling would-be clever letter, oddly inferior in style to Chaffery&rsquo;s
      conversation. It had been written some hours before Chaffery&rsquo;s last
      visit his talk then had been perhaps a sort of codicil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inordinate stupidity of that man Lagune is driving me out of
      the country,&rdquo; Lewisham saw. &ldquo;It has been at last a definite
      stumbling block&mdash;even a legal stumbling block. I fear. I am off. I
      skedaddle. I break ties. I shall miss our long refreshing chats&mdash;you
      had found me out and I could open my mind. I am sorry to part from Ethel
      also, but thank Heaven she has you to look to! And indeed they both have
      you to look to, though the &lsquo;both&rsquo; may be a new light to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham growled, went from page 1 to page 3&mdash;conscious of their both
      looking to him now&mdash;even intensely&mdash;and discovered Chaffery in a
      practical vein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but little light, and portable property in that house in
      Clapham that has escaped my lamentable improvidence, but there are one or
      two things&mdash;the iron-bound chest, the bureau with a broken hinge, and
      the large air pump&mdash;distinctly pawnable if only you can contrive to
      get them to a pawnshop. You have more Will power than I&mdash;I never
      could get the confounded things downstairs. That iron-bound box was
      originally mine, before I married your mother-in-law, so that I am not
      altogether regardless of your welfare and the necessity of giving some
      equivalent. Don&rsquo;t judge me too harshly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham turned over sharply without finishing that page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life at Clapham,&rdquo; continued the letter, &ldquo;has irked
      me for some time, and to tell you the truth, the spectacle of your
      vigorous young happiness&mdash;you are having a very good time, you know,
      fighting the world&mdash;reminded me of the passing years. To be frank in
      self-criticism, there is more than a touch of the New Woman about me, and
      I feel I have still to live my own life. What a beautiful phrase that is&mdash;to
      live one&rsquo;s own life!&mdash;redolent of honest scorn for moral
      plagiarism. No <i>Imitatio Christi</i> in that ... I long to see more of
      men and cities.... I begin late, I know, to live my own life, bald as I am
      and grey-whiskered; but better late than never. Why should the educated
      girl have the monopoly of the game? And after all, the whiskers will
      dye....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are things&mdash;I touch upon them lightly&mdash;that will
      presently astonish Lagune.&rdquo; Lewisham became more attentive. &ldquo;I
      marvel at that man, grubbing hungry for marvels amidst the almost
      incredibly marvellous. What can be the nature of a man who gapes after
      Poltergeists with the miracle of his own silly existence (inconsequent,
      reasonless, unfathomably weird) nearer to him than breathing and closer
      than hands and feet. What is <i>he</i> for, that he should wonder at
      Poltergeists? I am astonished these by no means flimsy psychic phenomena
      do not turn upon their investigators, and that a Research Society of
      eminent illusions and hallucinations does not pursue Lagune with
      sceptical! inquiries. Take his house&mdash;expose the alleged man of
      Chelsea! <i>A priori</i> they might argue that a thing so vain, so
      unmeaning, so strongly beset by cackle, could only be the diseased
      imagining of some hysterical phantom. Do <i>you</i> believe that such a
      thing as Lagune exists? I must own to the gravest doubts. But happily his
      banker is of a more credulous type than I.... Of all that Lagune will tell
      you soon enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham read no more. &ldquo;I suppose he thought himself clever when he
      wrote that rot,&rdquo; said Lewisham bitterly, throwing the sheets
      forcibly athwart the table. &ldquo;The simple fact is, he&rsquo;s stolen,
      or forged, or something&mdash;and bolted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. &ldquo;What will become of Mother?&rdquo; said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham looked at Mother and thought for a moment. Then he glanced at
      Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in the same boat,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to give any trouble to a single human being,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might get a man his tea, Ethel,&rdquo; said Lewisham,
      sitting down suddenly; &ldquo;anyhow.&rdquo; He drummed on the table with
      his fingers. &ldquo;I have to get to Walham Green by a quarter to seven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in the same boat,&rdquo; he repeated after an
      interval, and continued drumming. He was chiefly occupied by the curious
      fact that they were all in the same boat. What an extraordinary faculty he
      had for acquiring responsibility! He looked up suddenly and caught Mrs.
      Chaffery&rsquo;s tearful eye directed to Ethel and full of distressful
      interrogation, and his perplexity was suddenly changed to pity. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all right, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be
      unreasonable. I&rsquo;ll stand by you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mrs. Chaffery. &ldquo;As if I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;
      and Ethel came and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed in imminent danger of universal embraces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d let me have my tea,&rdquo; he said. And while he
      had his tea he asked Mrs. Chaffery questions and tried to get the new
      situation into focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even at ten o&rsquo;clock, when he was returning hot and jaded from
      Walham Green, he was still trying to get the situation into focus. There
      were vague ends and blank walls of interrogation in the matter, that
      perplexed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that his supper would be only the prelude to an interminable
      &ldquo;talking over,&rdquo; and indeed he did not get to bed until nearly
      two. By that time a course of action was already agreed upon. Mrs.
      Chaffery was tied to the house in Clapham by a long lease, and thither
      they must go. The ground floor and first floor were let unfurnished, and
      the rent of these practically paid the rent of the house. The Chafferys
      occupied basement and second floor. There was a bedroom on the second
      floor, formerly let to the first floor tenants, that he and Ethel could
      occupy, and in this an old toilet table could be put for such studies as
      were to be prosecuted at home. Ethel could have her typewriter in the
      subterranean breakfast-room. Mrs. Chaffery and Ethel must do the catering
      and the bulk of the housework, and as soon as possible, since letting
      lodgings would not square with Lewisham&rsquo;s professional pride, they
      must get rid of the lease that bound them and take some smaller and more
      suburban residence. If they did that without leaving any address it might
      save their feelings from any return of the prodigal Chaffery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Chaffery&rsquo;s frequent and pathetic acknowledgments of Lewisham&rsquo;s
      goodness only partly relieved his disposition to a philosophical
      bitterness. And the practical issues were complicated by excursions upon
      the subject of Chaffery, what he might have done, and where he might have
      gone, and whether by any chance he might not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last Mrs. Chaffery, after a violent and tearful kissing and
      blessing of them both&mdash;they were &ldquo;good dear children,&rdquo;
      she said&mdash;had departed, Mr. and Mrs. Lewisham returned into their
      sitting-room. Mrs. Lewisham&rsquo;s little face was enthusiastic. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      a Trump,&rdquo; she said, extending the willing arms that were his reward.
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know, and all to-night I have
      been loving you. Dear! Dear! Dear....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Lewisham was too full of engagements to communicate with
      Lagune, but the following morning he called and found the psychic
      investigator busy with the proofs of <i>Hesperus</i>. He welcomed the
      young man cordially nevertheless, conceiving him charged with the
      questions that had been promised long ago&mdash;it was evident he knew
      nothing of Lewisham&rsquo;s marriage. Lewisham stated his case with some
      bluntness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was last here on Saturday,&rdquo; said Lagune. &ldquo;You have
      always been inclined to suspicion about him. Have you any grounds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better read this,&rdquo; said Lewisham, repressing a
      grim smile, and he handed Lagune Chaffery&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the little man ever and again to see if he had come to the
      personal portion, and for the rest of the time occupied himself with an
      envious inventory of the writing appointments about him. No doubt the boy
      with the big ears had had the same sort of thing ...
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lagune came to the question of his real identity he blew out his
      cheeks in the most astonishing way, but made no other sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;My bankers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Lewisham with the exaggerated mildness of his spectacled eye.
      &ldquo;What do you think it means?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Has he gone
      mad? We have been conducting some experiments involving&mdash;considerable
      mental strain. He and I and a lady. Hypnotic&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should look at my cheque-book if I were you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagune produced some keys and got out his cheque book. He turned over the
      counterfoils. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong here,&rdquo; he said, and
      handed the book to Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;I suppose this&mdash;I say, is <i>this</i>
      right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed back the book to Lagune, open at the blank counterfoil of a
      cheque that had been removed. Lagune stared and passed his hand over his
      forehead in a confused way. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see this,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham had never heard of post hypnotic suggestion and he stood
      incredulous. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see that?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
      nonsense!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; repeated Lagune.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some seconds Lewisham could not get away from stupid repetitions of
      his inquiry. Then he hit upon a collateral proof. &ldquo;But look here!
      Can you see <i>this</i> counterfoil?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plainly,&rdquo; said Lagune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you read the number?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand two hundred and seventy-nine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand two hundred and eighty-one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;where&rsquo;s five thousand two hundred and eighty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagune began to look uncomfortable. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he
      has not&mdash;Will you read it out&mdash;the cheque, the counterfoil I
      mean, that I am unable to see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s blank,&rdquo; said Lewisham with an irresistible grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Lagune, and the discomfort of his expression
      deepened. &ldquo;Do you mind if I call in a servant to confirm&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham did not mind, and the same girl who had admitted him to the <i>siance</i>
      appeared. When she had given her evidence she went again. As she left the
      room by the door behind Lagune her eyes met Lewisham&rsquo;s, and she
      lifted her eyebrows, depressed her mouth, and glanced at Lagune with a
      meaning expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Lagune, &ldquo;that I have been
      shabbily treated. Mr. Chaffery is a man of indisputable powers&mdash;indisputable
      powers; but I am afraid&mdash;I am very much afraid he has abused the
      conditions of the experiment. All this&mdash;and his insults&mdash;touch
      me rather nearly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. Lewisham rose. &ldquo;Do you mind if you come again?&rdquo;
      asked Lagune with gentle politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham was surprised to find himself sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a man of extraordinary gifts,&rdquo; said Lagune. &ldquo;I
      had come to rely upon him.... My cash balance has been rather heavy
      lately. How he came to know of that I am unable to say. Without supposing,
      that is, that he had very remarkable gifts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lewisham saw Lagune again he learnt the particulars of Chaffery&rsquo;s
      misdeed and the additional fact that the &ldquo;lady&rdquo; had also
      disappeared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good job,&rdquo; he remarked selfishly.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no chance of <i>his</i> coming back.&rdquo; He spent
      a moment trying to imagine the &ldquo;lady&rdquo;; he realised more
      vividly than he had ever done before the narrow range of his experience,
      the bounds of his imagination. These people also&mdash;with grey hair and
      truncated honour&mdash;had their emotions I Even it may be glowing! He
      came back to facts. Chaffery had induced Lagune when hypnotised to sign a
      blank cheque as an &ldquo;autograph.&rdquo; &ldquo;The strange thing is,&rdquo;
      explained Lagune, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s doubtful if he&rsquo;s legally
      accountable. The law is so peculiar about hypnotism and I certainly signed
      the cheque, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man, in spite of his losses, was now almost cheerful again on
      account of a curious side issue. &ldquo;You may say it is coincidence,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;you may call it a fluke, but I prefer to look for some
      other interpretation! Consider this. The amount of my balance is a secret
      between me and my bankers. He never had it from <i>me</i>, for I did not
      know it&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t looked at my passbook for months. But he drew
      it all in one cheque, within seventeen and sixpence of the total. And the
      total was over five hundred pounds!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed quite bright again as he culminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within seventeen and sixpence,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now how do
      you account for that, eh? Give me a materialistic explanation that will
      explain away all that. You can&rsquo;t. Neither can I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham nodded towards a little drawer of the bureau. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you think&mdash;perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;a little ripple of laughter passed
      across his mind&mdash;&ldquo;he had a skeleton key?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagune&rsquo;s face lingered amusingly in Lewisham&rsquo;s mind as he
      returned to Clapham. But after a time that amusement passed away. He
      declined upon the extraordinary fact that Chaffery was his father-in-law,
      Mrs. Chaffery his mother-in-law, that these two and Ethel constituted his
      family, his clan, and that grimy graceless house up the Clapham hillside
      was to be his home. Home! His connexion with these things as a point of
      worldly departure was as inexorable now as though he had been born to it.
      And a year ago, except for a fading reminiscence of Ethel, none of these
      people had existed for him. The ways of Destiny! The happenings of the
      last few months, foreshortened in perspective, seemed to have almost a
      pantomimic rapidity. The thing took him suddenly as being laughable; and
      he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His laugh marked an epoch. Never before had Lewisham laughed at any fix in
      which he had found himself! The enormous seriousness of adolescence was
      coming to an end; the days of his growing were numbered. It was a laugh of
      infinite admissions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; IN BATTERSEA PARK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now although Lewisham had promised to bring things to a conclusion with
      Miss Heydinger, he did nothing in the matter for five weeks, he merely
      left that crucial letter of hers unanswered. In that time their removal
      from Madam Gadow&rsquo;s into the gaunt house at Clapham was accomplished&mdash;not
      without polyglot controversy&mdash;and the young couple settled themselves
      into the little room on the second floor even as they had arranged. And
      there it was that suddenly the world was changed&mdash;was astonishingly
      transfigured&mdash;by a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a whisper between sobs and tears, with Ethel&rsquo;s arms about him
      and Ethel&rsquo;s hair streaming down so that it hid her face from him.
      And he too had whispered, dismayed perhaps a little, and yet feeling a
      strange pride, a strange novel emotion, feeling altogether different from
      the things he had fancied he might feel when this thing that he had
      dreaded should come. Suddenly he perceived finality, the advent of the
      solution, the reconciliation of the conflict that had been waged so long.
      Hesitations were at an end;&mdash;he took his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he wrote a note, and two mornings later he started for his
      mathematical duffers an hour before it was absolutely necessary, and
      instead of going directly to Vigours&rsquo;, went over the bridge to
      Battersea Park. There waiting for him by a seat where once they had met
      before, he found Miss Heydinger pacing. They walked up and down side by
      side, speaking for a little while about indifferent topics, and then they
      came upon a pause ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have something to tell me?&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham changed colour a little. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the
      fact is&mdash;&rdquo; He affected ease. &ldquo;Did I ever tell you I was
      married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Married</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; a little testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment neither spoke. Lewisham stood without dignity staring at the
      dahlias of the London County Council, and Miss Heydinger stood regarding
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is what you have to tell me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham tamed and met her eyes. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That
      is what I have to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause. &ldquo;Do you mind if I sit down?&rdquo; asked Miss Heydinger in an
      indifferent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a seat yonder,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;under the
      tree.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked to the seat in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger, quietly. &ldquo;Tell me whom you
      have married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham answered sketchily. She asked him another question and another.
      He felt stupid and answered with a halting truthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I might have known.
      Only I would not know. Tell me some more. Tell me about her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham did. The whole thing was abominably disagreeable to him, but it
      had to be done, he had promised Ethel it should be done. Presently Miss
      Heydinger knew the main outline of his story, knew all his story except,
      the emotion that made it credible. &ldquo;And you were married&mdash;before
      the second examination?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you not tell me of this before?&rdquo; asked Miss
      Heydinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, know,&rdquo; said Lewisham. &ldquo;I wanted to&mdash;that
      day, in Kensington Gardens. But I didn&rsquo;t. I suppose I ought to have
      done so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you ought to have done so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose I ought ... But I didn&rsquo;t. Somehow&mdash;it has
      been hard. I didn&rsquo;t know what you would say. The thing seemed so
      rash, you know, and all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you had to do it,&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger presently,
      with her eyes on his profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewisham began the second and more difficult part of his explanation.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a difficulty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all the way
      along&mdash;I mean&mdash;about you, that is. It&rsquo;s a little difficult&mdash;The
      fact is, my life, you know&mdash;She looks at things differently from what
      we do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s odd, of course. But she has seen your letters&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t show her&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But, I mean, she knows you write to me, and she knows you write
      about Socialism and Literature and&mdash;things we have in common&mdash;things
      she hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say she doesn&rsquo;t understand these things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not thought about them. I suppose there&rsquo;s a sort
      of difference in education&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she objects&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham, lying promptly. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t
      <i>object</i> ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Miss Heydinger, and her face was white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She feels that&mdash;She feels&mdash;she does not say, of course,
      but I know she feels that it is something she ought to share. I know&mdash;how
      she cares for me. And it shames her&mdash;it reminds her&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
      you see how it hurts her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I see. So that even that little&mdash;&rdquo; Miss Heydinger&rsquo;s
      breath seemed to catch and she was abruptly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke at last with an effort. &ldquo;That it hurts <i>me</i>,&rdquo;
      she said, and grimaced and stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lewisham, &ldquo;that is not it.&rdquo; He
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>knew</i> this would hurt you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love her. You can sacrifice&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is not that. But there is a difference. Hurting <i>her</i>&mdash;she
      would not understand. But you&mdash;somehow it seems a natural thing for
      me to come to you. I seem to look to you&mdash;For her I am always making
      allowances&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it <i>is</i> that makes the difference. Things are so
      complex. Love means anything&mdash;or nothing. I know you better than I do
      her, you know me better than she will ever do. I could tell you things I
      could not tell her. I could put all myself before you&mdash;almost&mdash;and
      know you would understand&mdash;Only&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lewisham lamely and pulling at his moustache.
      &ldquo;I suppose ... that must be it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space neither spoke. Then Miss Heydinger said &ldquo;<i>Oh</i>!&rdquo;
      with extraordinary emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of this end to it all! That all your promise ... What is
      it she gives that I could not have given?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even now! Why should I give up that much of you that is mine? If
      she could take it&mdash;But she cannot take it. If I let you go&mdash;you
      will do nothing. All this ambition, all these interests will dwindle and
      die, and she will not mind. She will not understand. She will think that
      she still has you. Why should she covet what she cannot possess? Why
      should she be given the thing that is mine&mdash;to throw aside?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at Lewisham, but before her, her face a white misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way&mdash;I had come to think of you as something, belonging
      to me ... I shall&mdash;still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; said Lewisham after a pause, &ldquo;it
      is a thing that has come to me once or twice lately. Don&rsquo;t you think
      that perhaps you over-estimate the things I might have done? I know we&rsquo;ve
      talked of great things to do. But I&rsquo;ve been struggling for half a
      year and more to get the sort of living almost anyone seems able to get.
      It has taken me all my time. One can&rsquo;t help thinking after that,
      perhaps the world is a stiffer sort of affair ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said decisively. &ldquo;You could have done great
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you may do great things&mdash;If
      only I might see you sometimes, write to you sometimes&mdash;You are so
      capable and&mdash;weak. You must have somebody&mdash;That is your
      weakness. You fail in your belief. You must have support and belief&mdash;unstinted
      support and belief. Why could I not be that to you? It is all I want to
      be. At least&mdash;all I want to be now. Why need she know? It robs her of
      nothing. I want nothing&mdash;she has. But I know of my own strength too I
      can do nothing. I know that with you ... It is only knowing hurts her. Why
      should she know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lewisham looked at her doubtfully. That phantom greatness of his, it
      was that lit her eyes. In that instant, at least he had no doubts of the
      possibility of his Career. But he knew that in some way the secret of his
      greatness and this admiration went together. Conceivably they were one and
      indivisible. Why indeed need Ethel know? His imagination ran over the
      things that might be done, the things that might happen, and touched
      swiftly upon complication, confusion, discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is, I must simplify my life. I shall do nothing unless I
      simplify my life. Only people who are well off can be&mdash;complex. It is
      one thing or the other&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated and suddenly had a vision of Ethel weeping as once he had
      seen her weep with the light on the tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said almost brutally. &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s like this&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t do anything underhand. I mean&mdash;I&rsquo;m not so amazingly
      honest&mdash;now. But I&rsquo;ve not that sort of mind. She would find me
      out. It would do no good and she would find me out. My life&rsquo;s too
      complex. I can&rsquo;t manage it and go straight. I&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      overrated me. And besides&mdash;Things have happened. Something&mdash;&rdquo;
      He hesitated and then snatched at his resolve, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
      simplify&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the plain fact of the case. I&rsquo;m
      sorry, but it is so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Heydinger made no answer. Her silence astonished him. For nearly
      twenty seconds perhaps they sat without speaking. With a quick motion she
      stood up, and at once he stood up before her. Her face was flushed, her
      eyes downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said suddenly in a low tone and held out her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Lewisham and stopped. Miss Heydinger&rsquo;s
      colour left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said, looking him suddenly in the eyes and
      smiling awry. &ldquo;There is no more to say, is there? Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand. &ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said impatiently, and suddenly disengaged her
      hand and turned away from him. He made a step after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Heydinger,&rdquo; he said, but she did not stop. &ldquo;Miss
      Heydinger.&rdquo; He realised that she did not want to answer him
      again....
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained motionless, watching her retreating figure. An extraordinary
      sense of loss came into his mind, a vague impulse to pursue her and pour
      out vague passionate protestations....
    </p>
    <p>
      Not once did she look back. She was already remote when he began hurrying
      after her. Once he was in motion he quickened his pace and gained upon
      her. He was within thirty yards of her as she drew near the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pace slackened. Suddenly he was afraid she might look back. She passed
      out of the gates, out of his sight. He stopped, looking where she had
      disappeared. He sighed and took the pathway to his left that led back to
      the bridge and Vigours&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halfway across this bridge came another crisis of indecision. He stopped,
      hesitating. An impertinent thought obtruded. He looked at his watch and
      saw that he must hurry if he would catch the train for Earl&rsquo;s Court
      and Vigours&rsquo;. He said Vigours&rsquo; might go to the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the end he caught his train.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; THE CROWNING VICTORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night about seven Ethel came into their room with a waste-paper
      basket she had bought for him, and found him sitting at the little toilet
      table at which he was to &ldquo;write.&rdquo; The outlook was, for a
      London outlook, spacious, down a long slope of roofs towards the Junction,
      a huge sky of blue passing upward to the darkling zenith and downward into
      a hazy bristling mystery of roofs and chimneys, from which emerged signal
      lights and steam puffs, gliding chains of lit window carriages and the
      vague vistas of streets. She showed him the basket and put it beside him,
      and then her eye caught the yellow document in his hand. &ldquo;What is
      that you have there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He held it out to her. &ldquo;I found it&mdash;lining my yellow box. I had
      it at Whortley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it and perceived a chronological scheme. It was headed &ldquo;SCHEMA,&rdquo;
      there were memoranda in the margin, and all the dates had been altered by
      a hasty hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it got yellow?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to him the wrong thing for her to say. He stared at the
      document with a sudden accession of sympathy. There was an interval. He
      became aware of her hand upon his shoulder, that she was bending over him.
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she whispered, with a strange change in the quality of
      her voice. He knew she was seeking to say something that was difficult to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not grieving?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>This</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not&mdash;you are not even sorry?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not even sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand that. It&rsquo;s so much&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he proclaimed. &ldquo;<i>Glad.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;the trouble&mdash;the expense&mdash;everything&mdash;and
      your work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him doubtfully. He glanced up at her, and she questioned his
      eyes. He put his arm about her, and presently and almost absent-mindedly
      she obeyed his pressure and bent down and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It settles things,&rdquo; he said, holding her. &ldquo;It joins us.
      Don&rsquo;t you see? Before ... But now it&rsquo;s different. It&rsquo;s
      something we have between us. It&rsquo;s something that ... It&rsquo;s the
      link we needed. It will hold us together, cement us together. It will be
      our life. This will be my work now. The other ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced a truth. &ldquo;It was just ... vanity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still a shade of doubt in her face, a wistfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She knitted her brows. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      say it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interval she came into a sitting position on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her hand, but her face remained grave, and she looked out upon
      the twilight. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m stupid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The
      things I say ... aren&rsquo;t the things I feel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for her to say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the onus of expression lay on him. He too found it a little
      difficult to put into words. &ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; he said,
      and wrestled with the impalpable. The pause seemed long and yet not
      altogether vacant. She lapsed abruptly into the prosaic. She started from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t go down, Mother will get supper ...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door she stopped and turned a twilight face to him. For a moment
      they scrutinised one another. To her he was no more than a dim outline.
      Impulsively he held out his arms....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at the sound of a movement downstairs she freed herself and hurried
      out. He heard her call &ldquo;Mother! You&rsquo;re not to lay supper. You&rsquo;re
      to rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to her footsteps until the kitchen had swallowed them up. Then
      he turned his eyes to the Schema again and for a moment it seemed but a
      little thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked it up in both hands and looked at it as if it was the writing of
      another man, and indeed it was the writing of another man. &ldquo;Pamphlets
      in the Liberal Interest,&rdquo; he read, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a train of thought carried him off. His attitude relaxed a
      little, the Schema became for a time a mere symbol, a point of departure,
      and he stared out of the window at the darkling night. For a long time he
      sat pursuing thoughts that were half emotions, emotions that took upon
      themselves the shape and substance of ideas. The deepening current stirred
      at last among the roots of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was vanity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A boy&rsquo;s vanity.
      For me&mdash;anyhow. I&rsquo;m too two-sided.... Two-sided?...
      Commonplace!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreams like mine&mdash;abilities like mine. Yes&mdash;any man! And
      yet ...&mdash;The things I meant to do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts went to his Socialism, to his red-hot ambition of world
      mending. He marvelled at the vistas he had discovered since those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for us&mdash;Not for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must perish in the wilderness.&mdash;Some day. Somewhen. But not
      for us....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think, it is all the Child. The future is the Child. The
      Future. What are we&mdash;any of us&mdash;but servants or traitors to
      that?...
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natural Selection&mdash;it follows ... this way is happiness ...
      must be. There can be no other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. &ldquo;To last a lifetime, that is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet&mdash;it is almost as if Life had played me a trick&mdash;promised
      so much&mdash;given so little!...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! One must not look at it in that way! That will not do! That
      will <i>not</i> do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Career! In itself it is a career&mdash;the most important career in
      the world. Father! Why should I want more?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ... Ethel! No wonder she seemed shallow ... She has been
      shallow. No wonder she was restless. Unfulfilled ... What had she to do?
      She was drudge, she was toy ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. This is life. This alone is life! For this we were made and
      born. All these other things&mdash;all other things&mdash;they are only a
      sort of play....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes came back to the Schema. His hands shifted to the opposite corner
      and he hesitated. The vision of that arranged Career, that ordered
      sequence of work and successes, distinctions and yet further distinctions,
      rose brightly from the symbol. Then he compressed his lips and tore the
      yellow sheet in half, tearing very deliberately. He doubled the halves and
      tore again, doubled again very carefully and neatly until the Schema was
      torn into numberless little pieces. With it he seemed to be tearing his
      past self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play,&rdquo; he whispered after a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the end of adolescence,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the end of
      empty dreams....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He became very still, his hands resting on the table, his eyes staring out
      of the blue oblong of the window. The dwindling light gathered itself
      together and became a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found he was still holding the torn fragments. He stretched out his
      hand and dropped them into that new waste-paper basket Ethel had bought
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two pieces fell outside the basket. He stooped, picked them up, and put
      them carefully with their fellows.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
