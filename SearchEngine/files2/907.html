    <h1>PUNCH,<br />
     OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

    <h2>Vol. 153.</h2>

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"

    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>No sooner had the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> pointed out that
    "Dr. MICHAELIS was a good Chancellor as Chancellors go" than he
    went.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Daily Mail</i> is very cross with a neutral country
    for holding up their correspondent's copy. If persisted in,
    this sort of thing might get us mixed up in a war.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Highgate man has been fined forty shillings for feeding a
    horse kept solely for pleasure upon oats. His plea, that the
    animal did not generate sufficient power on coal-gas, left the
    Bench quite cold.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A ratcatcher has been granted three pounds of sugar a week
    until Christmas by a rural Food Control Committee, whom he
    informed that rats would not look at poison without sugar. The
    rats' lack of patriotism in refusing to forego their poison in
    these times of necessity is the subject of unfavourable
    comment.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is no foundation for the report that a prominent
    manufacturer identified with the Liberal Party has been offered
    a baronetcy if he will contribute five pounds of sugar to the
    party funds.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>No confirmation is to hand of the report that Commander
    BELLAIRS, M.P., has been <i>spurlos versnubt</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Why can't the Navy have a Bairnsfather?" asks <i>The Weekly
    Dispatch</i>. This habit of carping at the Senior Service is
    being carried to abominable lengths.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Charged with failing to report himself, a man who lived on
    Hackney Marshes stated that he did not know there was a war on,
    and that nobody had told him anything about it. A prospectus of
    <i>The Times'</i> History of the War has been despatched to him
    by express messenger.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Efforts of the Industrial Workers of the World to establish
    themselves in this country have received no encouragement, says
    Sir GEORGE CAVE. They were not even arrested and then
    released.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We trust there is no truth in the rumour that the Air
    Ministry Bill has gone to a better pigeon 'ole.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>No information has reached the Government, it was stated in
    the House of Commons recently, that toasted bread is being used
    as a substitute for tea. The misapprehension appears to have
    been caused by an unguarded admission of certain tea merchants
    that they have the public on toast.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We felt sure that the statement declaring that Mr. CHURCHILL
    had in a recent speech referred to "my Government" would be
    contradicted. The slight to <i>The Morning Post</i> would have
    been too marked.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In a case at Bow Police Court it was stated that it took
    fifteen policemen and an ambulance to remove a prisoner to the
    police-station. It is supposed that the fellow did not want to
    go.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Too much importance must not be attached to the report
    emanating from German sources that Count REVENTLOW has been
    appointed Honorary Colonel to the Imperial Fraternisers
    Battalion.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to <i>The Evening News</i> a gang of thieves are
    "working" the West End billiard saloons. So far no billiard
    tables have been actually stolen, but a sharp look-out is being
    kept on men leaving the saloons with bulgy pockets.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Addressing a Berlin meeting Herr STEGERWALD said, "We went
    to war at the side of the Kaiser, and the All Highest will
    return from war with us." If we may be permitted to say
    anything, we expect he will be leading by at least a couple of
    lengths.</p>

    <h3>Commercial Candour.</h3>

    <p>From a Native Tender for Works:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"In last we hope to be favoured with your orders, in the
        execution of which we will neglect nothing that can cause
        you any inconvenience."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"In the past quarter there were 19 births (6 males and
        13 females), comprising 10 between 1 and 65 years, and 9 65
        and upwards."&mdash;<i>Huntingdonshire Post</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The method of dodging the Military Service Acts adopted by
    these elderly infants strikes us as distinctly unpatriotic.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Looking Ahead.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Comfortable Home for young lady as paying guest; every
        convenience; near Cemetery."&mdash;<i>Local Paper</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Nothing which happens in Russia ... can alter the bare
        fact that Germany is <i>in extremis</i>. I am not sure that
        <i>articula mortis</i> wouldn't be the correct
        term."&mdash;<i>John Bull</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We, on the other hand, are quite sure it wouldn't.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"'Is it fresh, salt, Danish, or what?' one of the shop
        assistants was asked.</p>

        <p>'Don't know,' he replied, as he wiped the perspiration
        from his brow, and into the heap of butter with his
        pats."&mdash;<i>Evening Paper</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The vogue of margarine is now explained.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Servant (general), lady, two gentlemen; no
        starch."&mdash;<i>Scotsman</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We are glad to see that mistresses are taking a firm line
    against the prevailing stiffness of manners below stairs.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Of 9,048 houses in Newport only 5,130 are occupied by
        one family."&mdash;<i>The Western Mail</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If full advantage were taken of the housing accommodation it
    appears that Newport would contain almost two nowadays.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>GERMAN OFFICIAL.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Only a slight gain near Poelcapelle, 300 inches deep by
        1,200 inches wide, remains to the
        enemy."&mdash;<i>Nottingham Evening Post</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But by this time the Germans have discovered that, when they
    give him an inch, Sir DOUGLAS HAIG takes an ell.</p>

    <h2>MORE TALK WITH GERMAN PEACEMONGERS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Including an incidental reference to Mr. H.G.
    WELLS.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[The writer has received a pontifical brochure by Mr.
        WELLS, reprinted from <i>The Daily News</i>, sold by the
        International Free Trade League and entitled "A Reasonable
        Man's Peace", in which the following passage
        occurs:&mdash;"The conditions of peace can now be stated in
        general terms that are as acceptable to a reasonable man in
        Berlin as they are to a reasonable man in Paris or London
        or Petrograd.... Why, then, does the waste and killing go
        on? Why is not the Peace Conference sitting now? Manifestly
        because a small minority of people in positions of peculiar
        advantage, in positions of trust and authority, prevent or
        delay its assembling."]</p>

    <h2>THE GREAT MAN.</h2>

    <p>What am I doing, Dickie? Well, I'll tell you. I'm one of
    those subalterns you hear of sometimes. You know the kind of
    things they do? They look after their men and ask themselves
    every day in the line (as per printed instructions), "Am I
    offensive enough?" In trenches they are ever to the fore,
    bombing, patrolling, raiding, wiring and inspecting gas
    helmets. Working-parties under heavy fire are as meat and
    drink, rum and biscuits to them. Once every nine months, and
    when all Staff officers have had three goes, they get leave in
    order to give excuse for the appointment of A.P.M.'s. There are
    thousands of us, and we are supposed to run the War. These are
    the things which I am sure (if you get newspapers in Ceylon)
    jump into your mind the moment I mention the word subaltern,
    and I may as well tell you that in associating me with any one
    of these deeds at the present time you are entirely wrong.</p>

    <p>I sit in a room, an office papered with maps in all degrees
    of nakedness, from the newest and purest to those woad-stained
    veterans called objective maps. In this room, where regimental
    officers tread lightly, speak softly and creep away, awed and
    impotent&mdash;HE sits. "HE" is a G.S.O.3, or General Staff
    Officer, third grade. He it is who looks after the welfare of
    some hundred thousand troops (when everybody else is out). I am
    attached to him&mdash;not personally, be it understood, but
    officially. I am there to learn how he does it (whatever it
    is). High hopes, never realised, are held out to me that if I
    am good and look after the office during mealtimes I shall have
    a job of my very own one day&mdash;possibly two days.</p>

    <p>And he is very good to me. He rarely addresses me directly,
    except when short of matches, but he often gives me an insight
    into things by talking to himself aloud. He does this partly to
    teach me the reasoning processes by which he arrives at the
    momentous decisions expected of a G.S.O.3, and partly because
    he values my intelligent consideration.</p>

    <p>This morning, for instance, furnished a typically brilliant
    example of our co-operation. "I wonder," he said (and as he
    spoke I broke off from my daily duties of writing to
    Her)&mdash;"I wonder what about these Flares? Division say they
    want two thousand red and white changing to green&mdash;oh no,
    it's the other lot; no, that <i>is</i> right&mdash;I don't
    think they <i>can</i> want two thousand <i>possibly</i>. We
    might give them half for practice purposes, or say five
    hundred. Still, if they say they want two thousand I suppose
    they do; but then there's the question of what we've got in
    hand. All right, <i>let them have them</i>."</p>

    <p>That was one of the questions I helped to settle.</p>

    <p>"Heavens!" he went on, "five hundred men for digging cable
    trenches! No, no, I don't think. They had five hundred only the
    other night&mdash;no, they didn't; it was the other
    fellows&mdash;no, that was the night before-no, I was right as
    usual. One has so many things to think of. Well, they can't
    have them, that's certain; it can't be important&mdash;yes, it
    is, though, if things were to&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;<i>we'll let
    them have them</i>."</p>

    <p>You will note that he said "we." Co-operation again. I
    assure you I glowed with pleasure to think I had been of so
    much assistance.</p>

    <p>I had hardly got back to my letter when we started off
    again.</p>

    <p>"Well, that's my morning's work done&mdash;no, it
    isn't&mdash;yes, no, by Jove, there's a code word for No. 237
    Filtration Unit to be thought out. No, I shan't, they really
    <i>can't</i> want one, they're too far back&mdash;still they
    <i>might</i> come up to filter something near enough to want
    one&mdash;no I <i>won't</i>, it's sheer waste&mdash;still, I
    suppose one ought to be prepared&mdash;oh, yes, give them
    one&mdash;give them the word 'strafe'; nobody's got that. Bong!
    That's all for to-day."</p>

    <p>And now you know what part I play in the Great War,
    Dickie.</p>

    <p>Yours, JACK.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;Just off for my morning's
    exercise&mdash;sharpening the Corps Commander's pencils.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>A "PUNCH" COT.</h3>

    <p>Some time ago Mr. Punch made an appeal on behalf of the East
    London Hospital for Children at Shadwell. He has now received a
    letter from the Chairman, which says: "By a unanimous
    resolution the Board of Management have desired me to send you
    an expression of their most grateful thanks for your help,
    which, it is no exaggeration to say, has saved the Hospital
    from disaster." He adds that the Board "would like to give a
    more practical proof of their gratitude," and proposes, as "an
    abiding memorial," to set aside a Cot in the Hospital, to be
    called "The Punch Cot."</p>

    <p>It gives Mr. Punch a very sincere pleasure to convey to
    those who so generously responded to his appeal this expression
    of the Board's gratitude, and he begs them also to accept his
    own.</p>

    <p>The sum so far contributed by Mr. Punch and his friends
    amounts to &pound;3,505.</p>

    <h2>THE RECORDER.</h2>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[At the concluding session of the Museums Association
        Conference in Sheffield, Councillor Nuttall, of Southport
        said it was desirable that every town should make a voice
        record of every soldier who returned home from the wars,
        describing his experience in fighting. It would be a
        valuable record for future generations of the family to
        know what their ancestor did in the Great War.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In an Expeditionary Force whose vocabulary included several
    lurid words there was a certain Battalion renowned for the
    vigour of its language. And in that Battalion Private Thompson
    held a reputation which was the envy of all. Not only had he a
    more varied stock of expletives than anyone else, but he seemed
    to possess a unique gift for welding them into new and
    wonderful combinations to meet each fresh situation. Moreover
    he had an insistent manner of delivering them which alone was
    sufficient to place him in a class by himself. It was not long
    before many of his friends gave up trying altogether and let
    Private Thompson do it all for them. It is even rumoured that
    on occasions men in distant parts of the line would send for
    him so that he might come and give adequate expression to
    feelings which they felt to be beyond their range.</p>

    <p>To show you the extent of his fame, it is only necessary to
    mention that Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash; composed an ode all
    about Private Thompson and got it published in
    <i>Camouflage</i>, the trench gazette of the Nth Division. Two
    of the verses went, as far as I can remember, something like
    this:&mdash;</p>

            <p>As Private Thompson used to say,</p>

            <p class="i2">He couldn't stand the War;</p>

            <p>He cursed about it every day</p>

            <p class="i2">And every night he swore;</p>

            <p>And, while a sense of discipline</p>

            <p>Carried him on through thick and thin,</p>

            <p>The mud, the shells, the cold, the din</p>

            <p class="i2">Annoyed him more and more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The words with which we others cursed</p>

            <p class="i2">Seemed mild and harmless quips</p>

            <p>Compared to those remarks that burst</p>

            <p class="i2">From Private Thompson's lips;</p>

            <p>Haven't you ever heard about</p>

            <p>The Prussian Guard at X Redoubt,</p>

            <p>How Thompson's language laid them out</p>

            <p class="i2">Before we came to grips?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Anyhow, after bespattering the air of France and Flanders
    with a barrage of anathemas for the best part of a year,
    Private Thompson did something creditable in one of the pushes,
    and retired to a hospital in England, whence he emerged a few
    months later with a slight limp, a discharge certificate and a
    piece of coloured ribbon on his waistcoat. Having expressed his
    opinion on hospital life, he returned to his native town.</p>

    <p>His first shock was when he was met at the station by the
    local band and conducted up the Station Road and down the
    beflagged High Street to the accompaniment of martial and
    patriotic strains. His second was when he was confronted at the
    steps of the Town Hall by the Mayor and an official gathering
    of the leading citizens, with an unofficial background of the
    led ones, and found himself the subject of speeches of
    adulation and welcome.</p>

    <p>He was too dumbfounded to grasp all that was said, but he
    recovered his senses in time to hear the Mayor assuring his
    audience that it gave him great pleasure, indeed he might go so
    far as to say the very greatest pleasure, to welcome on behalf
    of their town one who had upheld with such distinction and
    bravery the reputation and honour of the community. And that,
    although he did not wish to keep them any longer, yet he must
    just add that he was going to ask Mr. Thompson then and there,
    while the remembrance of his terrible hardships was still fresh
    in his mind, to impart them to a phonograph, so that the
    archives of the town might not lack direct evidence of the
    experiences, if he might so express it, of her bravest citizen,
    and future generations might know something of the noble
    thoughts that surged in so gallant a breast in times of danger,
    and the fine and honourable words with which those thoughts had
    been uttered.</p>

    <p>The Mayor's peroration annoyed Thompson; the cheers that
    followed it annoyed him still more, and the subsequent shower
    of congratulations and vigorous slaps on the back threatened to
    move him to reply in a speech which might have been
    unintelligible to the ladies present.</p>

    <p>Fortunately the danger was averted. Before he could come
    into action a select committee of two, specially appointed for
    the purpose, had seized him by the arms and was conducting him
    up the steps of the Town Hall. The rapidity and the unexpected
    nature of the movement threw him out of gear, and he was forced
    to adopt an attitude of sullen silence during the progress of
    the little party across the Council Chamber and through a
    doorway leading into a small room.</p>

    <p>This room was furnished only with a table and a chair. On
    the former stood a phonograph; into the latter the Committee
    deposited ex-Private Thompson and explained to him that he was
    desired to sit there and in his own words to recount into the
    trumpet of the machine his experiences at the Front. That
    becoming modesty, they added, which hitherto had sealed his
    lips should now be laid aside. Posterity must not be denied the
    edification of listening to a hero's story of his share in the
    Great War. The phonograph was then turned on and the disc began
    to revolve with a slight grating sound that set Thompson's
    teeth on edge. He was about to address a few remarks to the
    Committee when they tactfully withdrew, leaving him alone with
    the instrument.</p>

    <p>For a few seconds he was silent. The machine rasped
    unchallenged through a dozen revolutions. Then he took a deep
    breath and, leaning forward, thrust his head into the yawning
    mouth of the trumpet.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>His Worship has sampled the record. The session was a secret
    one, but the Town has been given to understand that the disc
    has been sealed up and put away for the use of posterity
    only.</p>

    <h2>A DEAL WITH CHINA.</h2>

    <p>Fritz having killed the mule, it devolved upon the village
    Sanitary Inspector to see the carcass decently interred, and on
    application to the C.O. of the nearest Chinese labour camp. I
    presently secured the services of two beautiful old ivory
    carvings and a bronze statue, clad in blue quilted uniforms and
    wearing respectively, by way of head-dress, a towel turban, a
    straw hat and a coiffure like an early Victorian penwiper. It
    was the bronze gentleman&mdash;the owner of the noticeable
    coiffure&mdash;who at once really took charge of the working
    party.</p>

    <p>He introduced himself to me as "Lurtee Lee" (his official
    number was thirty-three), informed me he could "speakel
    Engliss," and, having by this single utterance at once
    apparently proved his statement and exhausted his vocabulary,
    settled down into a rapt and silent adoration of my tunic
    buttons.</p>

    <p>Before we had proceeded thirty yards he had offered me five
    francs (which he produced from the small of his back) for a
    single button. At the end of one hundred yards the price had
    risen to seven twenty-five, and arrived upon the scene of
    action the Celestial grave-digger made a further bid of eight
    francs, two Chinese coins (value unknown) and a tract in his
    native tongue. This being likewise met with a reluctant but
    unmistakable refusal, the work of excavation was commenced.</p>

    <p>Now when three men are employed upon a pit some six feet
    square they obviously cannot all work at the same time in so
    confined a space. One man must in turn stand out and rest. His
    rest time may be spent in divers ways.</p>

    <p>The elder of the two ivory carvings spent his breathing
    spells in philosophic reverie; the younger employed his leisure
    in rummaging on the neighbouring "dump" for empty tobacco tins,
    which he concealed about his person by a succession of feats of
    legerdemain (by the end of the morning I estimated him to be in
    possession of about thirty specimens). Lurtee Lee filled every
    moment of his off time in the manufacture of a quite beautiful
    pencilholder&mdash;his material an empty cartridge case, his
    tools a half-brick and a shoeing nail.</p>

    <p>Slowly the morning wore on&mdash;so slowly, indeed, that at
    an early period I cast aside my tunic and with spade and pick
    endeavoured by assistance and example to incite my labourers to
    "put a jerk in it." Noon saw the deceased mule beneath a ton or
    so of clay, and Lurtee Lee, whether from gratitude or sheer
    camaraderie, gravely presented me with the now completed
    pencil-holder. No, not a sou would he accept; I was to take it
    as a gift.</p>

    <p>At this moment a European N.C.O. from the Labour Camp came
    upon the scene and kindly offered to save me a journey by
    escorting Lurtee Lee and Company to quarters. They shuffled
    down the road, and I turned to put on my tunic. One button was
    missing.</p>

    <h2>THE NEW MRS. MARKHAM.</h2>

    <h3>IV.</h3>

    <h3>CONVERSATION ON CHAPTER LXXI.</h3>

    <p><i>Mary</i>. You spoke, Mamma, of CHAUCER being the Father
    of English poetry. Was there <i>any</i> English poetry before
    the discoveries of Lord EDWARD MARSH?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M</i>. Certainly, my dear. CHAUCER was our first
    eminent poet, but, as a distinguished American critic has
    observed, he could not spell. This greatly interfered with his
    popularity. Then there was SHAKSPEARE, who wrote quaint
    old-fashioned plays quite unsuitable for filming, but
    nevertheless enjoyed a certain fame until it was proved that he
    never existed and that SHAKESPEARE was the name of a syndicate;
    or that if he did exist he was somebody else; when all interest
    in his work naturally evaporated. The abolition of rhyme, about
    the year 1920, gave a fresh impetus to English poetry, and now,
    as you know, almost anyone can write it fluently, whereas
    formerly the easiest poems were written with the greatest
    difficulty. Indeed one reads of some old poets who were not
    able to produce a mere hundred lines in a day. Under the
    "free-verse" system, some of the Palustrine (or Marshy) School
    have been known to produce as many as three thousand lines in a
    day and to earn in a week as much as MILTON, an old poet of the
    seventeenth century, received for the whole of his greatest
    work, on which he was engaged for years.</p>

    <p><i>Richard</i>. You have often talked about people going
    into sanctuary. What does it mean?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M</i>. Originally every church, abbey, or
    consecrated place was a sanctuary, and all persons who had
    committed crimes or were otherwise in fear of their lives might
    secure themselves from danger by getting into them. But in the
    reign which we have been discussing it came to be used
    specially of the House of Commons from the number of tiresome
    and objectionable people who sought refuge there, because of
    the freedom from legal penalties which they enjoyed. Once safe
    in the House of Commons they said and even did things which, if
    they had been said or done in public, or even in private, would
    have exposed them either to prosecution or personal
    chastisement. Ultimately the nuisance became so great that the
    privilege of sanctuary was abolished, and the tone of the House
    of Commons greatly improved.</p>

    <p><i>Mary</i>. I could not quite understand that story about
    the King and the public jester.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M</i>. In earlier reigns it was customary for kings
    and nobles to have in their retinue some one whose business it
    was to play the fool, and who was privileged to say or do
    anything that was ridiculous for the sake of diverting his
    master. Although this practice had died out the privilege was
    usurped by a certain number of writers and speakers, who sought
    to attain notoriety by making themselves as unpleasant or
    ridiculous as possible on every occasion. It requires some
    cleverness to be a great fool, and though some of these public
    buffoons were clever men the majority had more malice than wit,
    and in time exhausted the patience of the people. Finally, in
    order to protect them from the violence of the infuriated
    populace, the Government were obliged to deport the chief
    offenders to the Solomon Islands, where cannibalism then
    prevailed.</p>

    <p><i>George</i>. Did they play on anything else besides
    mouth-organs in those days?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M</i>. They had many curious musical instruments
    which are now entirely obsolete. Of these the most popular was
    the pianoforte, a large <span class="pagenum"><a name="page318"
       id="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span> wooden box with a long
       horizontal keyboard, which the player struck with his
       fingers. Considerable and sometimes even distressing
       dexterity was attained by the performers, who indulged in
       all sorts of strange antics and gestures. The exercise was
       found to be remarkably beneficial to the growth of the hair,
       but it had compensating disadvantages, leading to cramps,
       dislocations and other troubles. Ultimately pianoforte
       playing was suppressed, largely owing to the exertions of
       the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Elephants, the
       tusks of that animal being in great request for the
       manufacture of the keys.</p>

    <p><i>Richard</i>. I shall never go to the Zoological Gardens
    without rejoicing over the suppression of the pianoforte.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M</i>. Another favourite instrument was the violin,
    a small and curiously shaped apparatus fitted with four
    strings, which, when rubbed or scraped with horsehair tightly
    stretched on a narrow wooden frame, were made to produce sounds
    imitating the cries of various animals, especially the mewing
    of a cat, to perfection. But as the timbre of the instrument
    did not lend itself to successful mechanical reproduction by
    the gramophone it fell into disuse.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, October 29th</i>.&mdash;For once Parliament
    repelled the gibe of its critics that it has ceased to
    represent the people. Lords and Commons united in praise of our
    sailors and soldiers and all the other gallant folk who are
    helping us to win the War, and passed the formal Votes of
    Thanks without a dissentient voice.</p>

    <p>As no eloquence could be adequate to such a theme&mdash;not
    even that of PERICLES or LINCOLN, as Mr. ASQUITH tactfully
    remarked&mdash;fewer and briefer speeches might have sufficed.
    The PRIME MINISTER painted the lily a little thickly, though no
    one would have had him omit his picturesque narrative of the
    first battle of Ypres&mdash;I hope some of its few survivors
    were among the soldiers in the Gallery&mdash;or his tributes to
    the Navy and the Merchant Service. Nor did one grudge Mr.
    REDMOND'S paean in praise of the Irish troops. It's not his
    fault, at any rate, that there aren't more of them.</p>

    <p>Seen at its best in the afternoon, the House descended to
    the depths on the adjournment, when Mr. PONSONBY, Mr. RAMSAY
    MACDONALD and Mr. KING badgered the HOME SECRETARY for the best
    part of an hour because in the exercise of his duty he had had
    some of their friends' correspondence opened and read. In
    ordinary times Members are very jealous, and rightly so, of
    this official espionage. The case of Sir JAMES GRAHAM and
    MAZZINI'S letters was raked up and quoted for all it was
    worth&mdash;and a little more; for, as Sir GEORGE CAVE reminded
    us, even on that occasion a Select Committee supported the
    action of the Government. The fact is that, when you are
    fighting for freedom <i>en gros</i>, individual liberties must
    of necessity be curtailed. Knowing that our letters in war-time
    are liable to inspection, the wise among us stick to postcards.
    As Mr. PONSONBY assures us that he and his friends have nothing
    to conceal, let them do likewise.</p>

    <p>One missed Mr. SNOWDEN, usually to the fore on these
    occasions. An incident earlier in the afternoon perhaps
    accounted for his absence. By way of bolstering up a charge of
    harshness against the HOME SECRETARY he mentioned that a
    deported German had "a son serving in the British Army." The
    Minister frankly admitted it. "The son," he said, "a British
    subject, who endeavoured to avoid military service, was
    arrested, and is serving in a noncombatant unit." <i>Exit</i>
    Mr. SNOWDEN.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday. October 30th</i>. I strongly suspect Major
    NEWMAN and Mr. REDDY of collaborating, like the "Two Macs" of
    music-hall fame. No other theory will explain the gallant
    Major's well-feigned annoyance at what he called "the
    assumption of military rank by clergymen and members of the
    theatrical profession" connected with cadet-corps. Mr.
    MACPHERSON supplied the official answer, namely, that gentlemen
    holding cadet-commissions are entitled to wear service dress;
    but the real object of the question was revealed when Brother
    REDDY from the backbenches piped out, "Does that apply to sham
    officers wearing uniform in this House?" There was a roar of
    laughter, and Major NEWMAN blushed his appreciation.</p>

    <p>I can imagine no more hopeless task than to plead the cause
    of Bulgaria in present circumstances; yet Mr. NOEL BUXTON
    cheerfully essays it whenever he gets an opportunity. This time
    he attempted to read into a recent utterance of the FOREIGN
    SECRETARY agreement with his own views.</p>

    <p>Mr. BALFOUR'S reply, in effect, was "What make you here, you
    little Bulgar boy?" He maintained that, while not as "dull and
    cautious" as he had meant it to be, the speech referred to in
    no way bore out Mr. BUXTON'S assertions. Then he proceeded in
    characteristic fashion to knock together the heads of the
    pro-Bulgarians and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page321"
       id="page321"></a>[pg 321]</span> the other Balkan theorists,
       and declared in conclusion that, while sharing the desire
       that Bulgaria should come out of the War without a
       grievance, he was not going to purchase that satisfaction by
       the betrayal of those who had sacrificed everything they
       possessed in the cause of the Allies&mdash;a declaration
       which, in view of recent rumours, the House as a whole heard
       with relief.</p>

    shall be able to write that&mdash;</p>

            <p class="i4">And did it very well,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>for, thanks to the pertinacity of Lord LOREBURN and Lord
    SELBORNE, their lordships have done something very particular.
    They have proposed that the PRIME MINISTER shall announce, with
    any honour conferred, the reasons why he has recommended it,
    having previously satisfied himself that a contribution to
    party funds was not one of them. If Lord LOREBURN had had his
    way the resolution would have been a good deal stronger, but
    Lord CURZON, upon whose majestic calm this subject has a
    curiously ruffling effect, refused to allow the retention of
    words implying that any Minister had ever been a party to a
    corrupt bargain.</p>

    <p>The debate was anything but dull, and some piquant
    revelations&mdash;of course all at second-hand&mdash;were made
    by the highly respectable peers who took part in it. It would
    have been livelier still if some of the more recent creations
    could have been induced to tell the full story of "How I got my
    Peerage." But they are modest fellows, and unanimously
    refrained.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, November 1st</i>.&mdash;A full House heard Sir
    ERIC GEDDES make his maiden speech, or rather read his maiden
    essay, for he rarely deviated from his type-script. A very good
    essay it was, full of well arranged information, and delivered
    in a strong clear voice that never faltered during an hour's
    recital. If we were to believe some of the critics the British
    Navy is directed by a set of doddering old gentlemen who are
    afraid to let it go at the Germans and cannot even safeguard
    our commerce from attack. The truth, as expounded by the FIRST
    LORD, is quite different. Despite the jeremiads of
    superannuated sailors and political longshoremen, the Admiralty
    is not going to Davy Jones's locker, but under its present
    chiefs, who have, with very few exceptions, seen service in
    this War, maintains and supplements its glorious record. Save
    for an occasional game of "tip and run"&mdash;as in the case of
    the North Sea convoy&mdash;enemy vessels have disappeared from
    the surface of the oceans; and "the long arm of the British
    Navy" is now stretching down into the depths and up into the
    skies in successful pursuit of them. If the nation hardly
    realises yet what it owes to the men of the Fleet and their
    comrades of the auxiliary Services it is because their work is
    done with "such thoroughness and so little fuss," and, as Mr.
    ASQUITH put it, "in the twilight and not in the limelight."</p>

    <h2>HOW TO BRIGHTEN UP THE THEATRE.</h2>

    <p>"You want, I take it," said the stranger to the manager, "to
    make your theatre the most interesting in London?"</p>

    <p>"Naturally," the manager replied. "I do all I can to make it
    so, as it is."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps," said the stranger; "we shall see. But I have it
    in my power to make it vastly more interesting than any theatre
    has ever been."</p>

    <p>"You have a play?" the manager inquired; amending this,
    after another glance, to "You know of a play?"</p>

    <p>"Play? No. I'm not troubling about plays," said the caller.
    "Plays&mdash;what are plays? No, I'm bringing you a live
    idea."</p>

    <p>"But I don't wish to make any change in the style of my
    performances," said the manager. "If you're thinking of a new
    kind of entertainment for me&mdash;super-cinema, or that 'real
    revue' which authors are always threatening me with&mdash;I
    don't want it. I intend to keep my stage for the legitimate
    drama."</p>

    <p>The stranger had been growing more and more restless. "My
    dear Sir," he now protested, "do let us understand each other.
    Have I ever mentioned the word 'stage'? Have I? No. Your stage
    is nothing to me; it doesn't come into the matter at all. Do
    what you like on the stage, but let me tackle the front of the
    house. That's the real battle-ground. My scheme, which I bring
    to you first of all, because I think of you as the least
    unenlightened of all London managers, is concerned solely with
    the audience. Will you promise not to mention it for a week if
    I unfold it to you?"</p>

    <p>The manager promised.</p>

    <p>"Very well," said the other, settling down to business, "Let
    us begin by looking at audiences. What are they made of? Human
    beings. What kind of human beings? The nobs and the mob. What
    is the favourite occupation of the nobs? Recognising other
    nobs. What comes next? Seeing who the other nobs have got with
    them. What is the favourite occupation of the mob? Identifying
    nobs and saying how disappointed they are with their
    appearance. Isn't that so?"</p>

    <p>"More or less," said the manager.</p>

    <p>"Very well," the other continued. "Now, then, what do you do
    for the audiences in your theatre between the Acts?"</p>

    <p>"There is an excellent orchestra," said the manager.</p>

    <p>"I have heard it," replied his visitor drily. "Most of the
    music played is composed by the conductor, who conducts with
    the bow of his violin. No, Sir, that is not enough to do for an
    audience in the intervals. I warn you that the whole question
    of intervals will come up soon, and the cleverest manager will
    be the one who does most to make them amusing. But that's
    another matter. My scheme for you is to provide more than mere
    amusement, it is to enable your theatre to partake of some of
    the quality and some of the success of the great picture
    newspapers."</p>

    <p>"How do you mean?" the manager asked, leaning forward. The
    word "success" galvanised him.</p>

    <p>"Like this," said the enthusiast. "You grant that the proper
    study of mankind is man&mdash;as the POPE recently said? You
    grant an intense curiosity as to everybody else being implanted
    in the human breast? Very well. This, then, is my scheme. You
    must have each stall legibly numbered so that the whole house
    behind it and above it can see the number. The boxes must be
    numbered too. You then instal a printer with a little press
    somewhere behind the scenes, and to him is brought soon after
    the curtain rises a list of the names of all the box and stall
    holders, which he will print off in time for the assistants to
    sell them all over the house after Act I. This distribution
    will dispose of the first interval, and incidentally bring in a
    nice little sum for cigars and champagne for your business
    visitors, a new hat for your leading lady, and so forth."</p>

    <p>"By the way," said the manager, "won't you smoke? These are
    mild."</p>

    <p>"Thank you," said the other. "Very well," he continued, "the
    next interval will be wholly spent in the exciting and
    delightful task of identifying the nobs, in which the nobs
    themselves will take a part. And if there is still a third
    interval it will be equally amusingly filled by conversation as
    to the pasts or costumes of the more famous of the female nobs
    who are present&mdash;an interchange of opinion as to the
    lowness of their necks, conjectures as to the genuineness of
    their hair, and so forth. Do you see?"</p>

    <p>The manager went to the sideboard and brought back some
    glasses and a bottle. "Yes," he said, "I see. There's something
    in what you say. But you don't explain how the names are to be
    obtained?"</p>

    <p>"How?" exclaimed the other. "Why, ask for them, to be sure.
    You'll have to begin with a few blanks, of course, but directly
    it gets known that you're publishing them during the evening
    they'll all come in. Bless your soul, I know them! and if the
    nobs don't tumble to it the snobs will, and they're numerically
    strong enough to keep any play running. You won't have to worry
    about the play. As for the back rows of the stalls, where you
    put the people from the other theatres, why, they'll absolutely
    push their visiting-cards at you. What do you say?"</p>

    <p>"I think it's ingenious," said the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"
       id="page323"></a>[pg 323]</span> manager, "and not to be
       dismissed lightly. But I don't see anything to prevent all
       the other managers copying it."</p>

    <p>"There isn't," said the inventor. "Nothing ever has been
    done or will be done that can prevent theatrical managers from
    copying each other. It's chronic. But you'll be the first,
    remember that; and the pioneer often has some credit. You'll
    get the start, and that means a lot. For some months, at any
    rate, it will be your theatre to which the snobs will
    crowd."</p>

    <p>Such was the interview.</p>

    <p>What the manager will decide cannot yet be stated, for the
    week has not expired.</p>

    <p>"This," I said, "is perfectly monstrous. It is an outrage.
    It&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What have they done to you now?" said Francesca. "Have they
    forbidden you to have your boots made of leather, or to go on
    wearing your shiny old blue serge suit, or have they failed in
    some way to recognise your merits as a Volunteer? Quick, tell
    me so that I may comfort you."</p>

    <p>"Listen to this," I said.</p>

    <p>"I should be better able to listen and you would certainly
    be better able to read the letter if you didn't brandish it in
    my face."</p>

    <p>"When you've heard it," I said, "you'll understand why I
    brandish it. Listen:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'Sir,&mdash;I understand that on the 15th instant you
    travelled from Star Bond to our London terminus without your
    season-ticket, and declined to pay the ordinary fare. One of
    the conditions which you signed stipulates that in the event of
    your inability to produce your season-ticket the ordinary fare
    shall be paid, and as the Railway Executive now controlling the
    railways on behalf of the Government is strict in enforcing the
    observance of this condition, I have no alternative but to
    request you to kindly remit me the sum of 6<i>s.</i>
    1-1/2<i>d.</i> in respect of the journey in question.</p>

    <p>I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,</p>

    <p>H.W. HUTCHINSON.'</p>

    <p>"This," I said, as I finished reading the letter, "comes
    from the Great North-Southern Railway, and is addressed to
    <i>me</i>. What do you think of it?"</p>

    <p>"The miserable man," said Francesca, "has split an
    infinitive, but he probably did it under the orders of the
    Railway Executive."</p>

    <p>"I don't mind," I said, "about his treatment of infinitives.
    He may split them all to smithereens if he likes. It's the
    monstrous nature of his demand that vexes me."</p>

    <p>"What can you expect of a Railway Company?" said Francesca.
    "Surely you didn't suppose a company would display any of the
    finer feelings?"</p>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "this is a serious matter. If you are
    not going to sympathise with me, say so at once, and I shall
    know what to do."</p>

    <p>"Well, what will you do?"</p>

    <p>"I shall plough my lonely furrow&mdash;I mean, I shall write
    my lonely letter all by myself, and you shan't help me to make
    up any of the stingers that I'm going to put into it."</p>

    <p>"Oh, my dear," she said, "what is the use of writing
    stingers to a railway? You might as well smack the engine
    because the guard trod on your foot."</p>

    <p>"Well, but, Francesca, I'm boiling over with
    indignation."</p>

    <p>"So am I," she said, "but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"But me no buts," I said. "Let's boil over together and
    trounce Mr. Hutchinson. Let us write a model letter for the use
    of season-ticket holders who have mislaid their tickets. We'll
    pack it full of sarcasm and irony. We will make an appeal to
    the nobler sentiments of the Board of Directors. We will remind
    them that they too are subject to human frailty,
    and&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"&mdash;we will not send the letter, but will put it away
    until we've finished our boiling-over and have simmered
    down."</p>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "am I not going to be allowed to
    communicate to this so-called railway company my opinion of its
    conduct? Are all the pearls of sarcasm with which my mind is
    teeming to be thrown away?"</p>

    <p>"Well," she said, "it would be useless to cast them before
    the Railway Executive."</p>

    <p>"Mayn't I hint a hope that the penny-halfpenny will come in
    useful in a time of financial stress?"</p>

    <p>"No," she said decisively, "you are to do none of these
    things. Of course they've behaved in a mean and shabby way, but
    they've got you fixed, and the best thing you can do is to get
    a postal order and send it off to Mr. Hutchinson."</p>

    <p>"Mayn't I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No, certainly not. Write a short and formal note and
    enclose the P.O.; and next time don't forget your ticket."</p>

    <p>"If you'll tell me how to make sure of that," I said, "I'll
    vote for having a statue of you put up."</p>

    <p>"Does everybody," she said, "forget his season-ticket?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "everybody, at least once a year."</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>

    <p>It would seem that "BARTIMEUS" occupies the same relative
    position towards the silent Navy of 1917 that JOHN STRANGE
    WINTER did towards the Army of the pre-KIPLING era. All his men
    are magnificent fellows, his women sympathetic and courageous.
    The Hun, depicted as an unsportsman-like brute (which he is),
    invariably gets it in the neck (which, I regret to say, he
    doesn't). And so all is for the best in the best of all
    possible services. In the Navy they are nothing if not
    consistent and, while the military storyteller who did not have
    his knife into the higher command would be looked upon as a
    freak, "BARTIMEUS" loyally includes amongst his galaxy of
    perfect people Lords of the Admiralty no less than the lower
    ratings. No one knows the Navy and its business better than
    "BARTIMEUS," and he owes his popularity to that fact. Yet he
    tells us very little about it, preferring to dwell on the
    personal attributes of his individual heroes, throwing in just
    enough incidental detail to give his stories the proper sea
    tang. Of late a good many people have been busy informing us
    that the Navy, like GILBERT'S chorus-girl, is no better than it
    should be. But the fault, if there be one, does not lie with
    the men that "BARTIMEUS" has selected to write about in his
    latest novel, <i>The Long Trick</i> (CASSELL), which will
    therefore lose none of the appreciation it deserves on that
    account. And with such a leal and brilliant champion to take
    the part of the Navy afloat, the Navy ashore, whether in
    Parliament or out of it, may very well be left to take care of
    itself.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Although Sir ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE calls his collection of
    detective stories <i>His Last Bow</i> (MURRAY), and also warns
    us that <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> is "somewhat crippled by
    occasional attacks of rheumatism," there is not in my lay
    opinion any cause for alarm. If I may jest about such an
    austere personage as <i>Sherlock</i>, I should say that there
    are several strings still left to his bow, and that the ever
    amenable and admiring <i>Watson</i> means to use them for all
    they are worth. At any rate I sincerely hope so, for if it is
    conceivable that some of us grow weary of <i>Sherlock's</i>
    methods when we are given a long draught of them no one will
    deny that they are palatable when taken a small dose at a time.
    <i>Sherlock</i>, in short, is a national institution, and if he
    is to be closed now and for ever I feel sure that the Bosches
    will claim to have finished him off. And that would be a pity.
    Of these eight stories the best are "The Dying Detective" and
    the "Bruce-Partington Plans," but all of them are good to read,
    except perhaps "The Devil's Foot," which left a "most sinister
    impression" on dear old <i>Watson's</i> mind, and incidentally
    on my own.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Every now and then, out of a mass of War-books grown so vast
    that no single reader can hope even to keep count of them,
    there emerges one of particular appeal. This is a claim that
    may certainly be made for <i>An Airman's Outings</i>
    (BLACKWOOD), especially just now when everything associated
    with aviation is&mdash;I was about to say <i>sur le tapis</i>,
    but the phrase is hardly well chosen&mdash;so conspicuously in
    the limelight. The writer of these modest but thrilling records
    veils his identity under the technical <i>nom de guerre</i> of
    "CONTACT." With regard to his method I can hardly do better
    than repeat what is said in a brief preface by Major-General
    W.S. BRANCKER, Deputy Director-General of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page326"
       id="page326"></a>[pg 326]</span> Military Aeronautics: "The
       author depicts the daily life of the flying officer in
       France, simply and with perfect truth; indeed he describes
       heroic deeds with such moderation and absence of
       exaggeration that the reader will scarcely realise," etc.
       But he will be a reader poor indeed in imagination who is
       not helped by these pages to realise some part of the debt
       that we owe to these marvellous winged boys of ours; As for
       the heroic deeds, they are of a kind to take your
       breath&mdash;tales of battles above the clouds, of trenches
       captured by aeroplane, of men fatally wounded, thousands of
       feet above the enemy country, recovering consciousness and
       working their guns till they sank dead, while their battered
       machines planed for the security of friendly lines. Surely
       the whole history of War has no picture to beat this in
       devotion.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>EVELYN BRANSCOMBE PETTER has much that is interesting to say
    about men and women, and packs her thought (I risk the "her")
    into a quasi-Meredithian form of phrasing which does not always
    escape obscurity. But how much better this than a limpid flow
    of words without notable content! <i>Souls in the Making</i>
    (CHAPMAN AND HALL) is mainly an analysis of two love episodes
    in the life of a young man, the liberally educated son of an
    ambitious self-made soapmaker. The first&mdash;with <i>Sue</i>,
    the pretty waitress&mdash;is thwarted by a very persistent and
    unpleasant clerk; the second&mdash;with <i>Virginia</i>, a girl
    of birth and breeding&mdash;is threatened by the intrusion of
    the girl's cousin, a queerly morbid ne'er-do-well. There is no
    action to speak of, so one can't speak of it. I can only say
    that the interest of the shrewd analysis held me, and that if
    my guess as to the sex of the writer be sound it is noteworthy
    that more pains and skill are bestowed upon the characters of
    the men than of the two girls, who are some thing
    shadowy&mdash;charming unfinished sketches. There is a vigour
    and an effect of personality in the writing that put this novel
    above the large class of the merely competent.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Odd what a vogue has lately developed for what I might call
    the ultra-domestic school of fiction. Here is another example,
    <i>Married Life</i> (CASSELL), in which Miss MAY EDGINTON,
    following the mode, unites her hero and heroine at the
    beginning and leaves them to flounder for our edification amid
    the trials of double blessedness. I am sorry to say it, but her
    great solution for the eternal problem of How to be Happy
    though Married appears to be the possession of a sufficient
    bank-balance to prevent the chain from galling. In other words,
    not to be too much married. All this love-in-a-cottage talk has
    clearly no allurement for Miss EDGINTON. With her, the
    protagonists, <i>Osborne</i> and his young wife, are no sooner
    wed than their troubles begin&mdash;troubles of the domestic
    budget, of cooking and stove lighting and the rest. (By the
    way, for all its carefully British topography, I strongly
    suspect the whole story of an exotic origin, chiefly from
    certain odd-sounding words that seem to have slipped in here
    and there. Does our island womanhood really talk of a
    <i>matin&eacute;e</i>, in the sense of an article of attire? If
    so, this is the first I hear of it). To return to the
    <i>Kerr</i> household. In the midst of their bothers
    <i>Osborne</i> is given a post as traveller in motor-cars at a
    big salary. So off he goes, while <i>Marie</i>, like the other
    little pig of the poem, stays at home, and enjoys herself
    hugely. When he returns she hardly cares about him at all; and
    might indeed have continued this attitude of
    indifference&mdash;who knows how long?&mdash;had not some
    Higher Power (perhaps the Paper Controller) decreed a happy
    ending on page 340. A lesson, I am sure, to us all; but of what
    character remains ambiguous.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In such a title as <i>The North East Corner</i> (GRANT
    RICHARDS) there is something bleak and uninviting, something
    suggestive of the bitter mercies of an average English April,
    that is by no means confirmed in the story itself. Windy it
    certainly is&mdash;it runs to 496 pages&mdash;for I do not
    remember any other recent volume where the characters really do
    talk so much "like a book," and though, of course, this may be
    a true way of presenting the customs of a hundred years ago,
    one feels that it can be over-done. <i>Frank Hamilton</i>, the
    magnanimous friend, facile politician and all-but hero, was the
    worst offender, not only making love to the <i>Marquis's</i>
    unhandsome daughter in stately periods, and invariably
    addressing pretty <i>Sarah Owen</i>, who was much too good for
    his and the author's treatment of her, in the language of a
    Cabinet meeting (as popularly imagined), but being hardly able
    even to lose his temper decently in honest ejaculation.
    <i>Rolfe</i>, his friend, was a Jacobin of the blackest, who
    preached sedition and the right of tenants to vote as they
    chose; and the <i>Hamiltons</i> were renegades who gained
    titles and honours by supporting a failing Ministry, from the
    most opportunely patriotic of motives. The general drift of the
    plot is neither very readily to be summarised nor indeed very
    satisfactory, and one might disagree with Mr. JOHN HERON LEPPER
    at several points. At the same time, as his many friends would
    expect, there is much to be grateful for in this quiet study of
    Irish times and politics very different from our own. There is
    a ring of sincerity for one thing, matched by a literary grace
    that saves his chapters from ever becoming irritating even when
    they move most slowly.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>If the vintage to which "Miss KATHARINE TYNAN'S" novels
    belong is so old that some of its flavour has departed, there
    is no doubt that many of us are still glad enough to sample it.
    In these nervous times it is in fact very restful to read a
    book as calm and detached as <i>Miss Mary</i> (MURRAY). Not
    that <i>Mary</i> refrained from allowing her heart to flutter
    in the wrong direction, but even the simplest of us couldn't
    really be alarmed by this excursion. Mrs. HINKSON seems to take
    all her nice characters under her protective wing, and to
    include you and me (if we are nice) in a pleasant family party.
    So at little outlay you have the chance to go to Ireland and
    stay quietly and decorously with the <i>de Burghs</i>. There
    you will meet a very saint in <i>Lady de Burgh</i>, and you
    will breathe the right local atmosphere, and have, on the
    whole, a good and tranquillizing time.</p>

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL
