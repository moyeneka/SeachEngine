    <h2>
      Chapter 1.I
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were times when we had to go without puddings to pay John&rsquo;s uniform
      bills, and always I did the facings myself with a cloth-ball to save
      getting new ones. I would have polished his sword, too, if I had been
      allowed; I adored his sword. And once, I remember, we painted and
      varnished our own dog-cart, and very smart it looked, to save fifty
      rupees. We had nothing but our pay&mdash;John had his company when we were
      married, but what is that?&mdash;and life was made up of small knowing
      economies, much more amusing in recollection than in practise. We were
      sodden poor, and that is a fact, poor and conscientious, which was worse.
      A big fat spider of a money-lender came one day into the veranda and
      tempted us&mdash;we lived in a hut, but it had a veranda&mdash;and John
      threatened to report him to the police. Poor when everybody else had
      enough to live in the open-handed Indian fashion, that was what made it so
      hard; we were alone in our sordid little ways. When the expectation of
      Cecily came to us we made out to be delighted, knowing that the whole
      station pitied us, and when Cecily came herself, with a swamping burst of
      expense, we kept up the pretense splendidly. She was peevish, poor little
      thing, and she threatened convulsions from the beginning, but we both knew
      that it was abnormal not to love her a great deal, more than life,
      immediately and increasingly; and we applied ourselves honestly to do it,
      with the thermometer at a hundred and two, and the nurse leaving at the
      end of a fortnight because she discovered that I had only six of
      everything for the table. To find out a husband&rsquo;s virtues, you must marry
      a poor man. The regiment was under-officered as usual, and John had to
      take parade at daylight quite three times a week; but he walked up and
      down the veranda with Cecily constantly till two in the morning, when a
      little coolness came. I usually lay awake the rest of the night in fear
      that a scorpion would drop from the ceiling on her. Nevertheless, we were
      of excellent mind towards Cecily; we were in such terror, not so much of
      failing in our duty towards her as towards the ideal standard of mankind.
      We were very anxious indeed not to come short. To be found too small for
      one&rsquo;s place in nature would have been odious. We would talk about her for
      an hour at a time, even when John&rsquo;s charger was threatening glanders and I
      could see his mind perpetually wandering to the stable. I would say to
      John that she had brought a new element into our lives&mdash;she had
      indeed!&mdash;and John would reply, &lsquo;I know what you mean,&rsquo; and go on to
      prophesy that she would &lsquo;bind us together.&rsquo; We didn&rsquo;t need binding
      together; we were more to each other, there in the desolation of that arid
      frontier outpost, than most husbands and wives; but it seemed a proper and
      hopeful thing to believe, so we believed it. Of course, the real
      experience would have come, we weren&rsquo;t monsters; but fate curtailed the
      opportunity. She was just five weeks old when the doctor told us that we
      must either pack her home immediately or lose her, and the very next day
      John went down with enteric. So Cecily was sent to England with a
      sergeant&rsquo;s wife who had lost her twins, and I settled down under the
      direction of a native doctor, to fight for my husband&rsquo;s life, without ice
      or proper food, or sickroom comforts of any sort. Ah! Fort Samila, with
      the sun glaring up from the sand!&mdash;however, it is a long time ago
      now. I trusted the baby willingly to Mrs. Berry and to Providence, and did
      not fret; my capacity for worry, I suppose, was completely absorbed. Mrs.
      Berry&rsquo;s letter, describing the child&rsquo;s improvement on the voyage and safe
      arrival came, I remember, the day on which John was allowed his first
      solid mouthful; it had been a long siege. &lsquo;Poor little wretch!&rsquo; he said
      when I read it aloud; and after that Cecily became an episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone to my husband&rsquo;s people; it was the best arrangement. We were
      lucky that it was possible; so many children had to be sent to strangers
      and hirelings. Since an unfortunate infant must be brought into the world
      and set adrift, the haven of its grandmother and its Aunt Emma and its
      Aunt Alice certainly seemed providential. I had absolutely no cause for
      anxiety, as I often told people, wondering that I did not feel a little
      all the same. Nothing, I knew, could exceed the conscientious devotion of
      all three Farnham ladies to the child. She would appear upon their
      somewhat barren horizon as a new and interesting duty, and the small
      additional income she also represented would be almost nominal
      compensation for the care she would receive. They were excellent persons
      of the kind that talk about matins and vespers, and attend both. They
      helped little charities and gave little teas, and wrote little notes, and
      made deprecating allowance for the eccentricities of their titled or
      moneyed acquaintances. They were the subdued, smiling, unimaginatively
      dressed women on a small definite income that you meet at every rectory
      garden-party in the country, a little snobbish, a little priggish, wholly
      conventional, but apart from these weaknesses, sound and simple and
      dignified, managing their two small servants with a display of the most
      exact traditions, and keeping a somewhat vague and belated but constant
      eye upon the doings of their country as chronicled in a bi-weekly paper.
      They were all immensely interested in royalty, and would read paragraphs
      aloud to each other about how the Princess Beatrice or the Princess Maud
      had opened a fancy bazaar, looking remarkably well in plain grey poplin
      trimmed with Irish lace&mdash;an industry which, as is well known, the
      Royal Family has set its heart on rehabilitating. Upon which Mrs.
      Farnham&rsquo;s comment invariably would be, &lsquo;How thoughtful of them, dear!&rsquo; and
      Alice would usually say, &lsquo;Well, if I were a princess, I should like
      something nicer than plain grey poplin.&rsquo; Alice, being the youngest, was
      not always expected to think before she spoke. Alice painted in
      water-colours, but Emma was supposed to have the most common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took turns in writing to us with the greatest regularity about
      Cecily; only once, I think, did they miss the weekly mail, and that was
      when she threatened diphtheria and they thought we had better be kept in
      ignorance. The kind and affectionate terms of these letters never altered
      except with the facts they described&mdash;teething, creeping, measles,
      cheeks growing round and rosy, all were conveyed in the same smooth, pat,
      and proper phrases, so absolutely empty of any glimpse of the child&rsquo;s
      personality that after the first few months it was like reading about a
      somewhat uninteresting infant in a book. I was sure Cecily was not
      uninteresting, but her chroniclers were. We used to wade through the long,
      thin sheets and saw how much more satisfactory it would be when Cecily
      could write to us herself. Meanwhile we noted her weekly progress with
      much the feeling one would have about a far-away little bit of property
      that was giving no trouble and coming on exceedingly well. We would take
      possession of Cecily at our convenience; till then, it was gratifying to
      hear of our unearned increment in dear little dimples and sweet little
      curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was nearly four when I saw her again. We were home on three months&rsquo; 
      leave; John had just got his first brevet for doing something which he
      does not allow me to talk about in the Black Mountain country; and we were
      fearfully pleased with ourselves. I remember that excitement lasted well
      up to Port Said. As far as the Canal, Cecily was only one of the pleasures
      and interests we were going home to: John&rsquo;s majority was the thing that
      really gave savour to life. But the first faint line of Europe brought my
      child to my horizon; and all the rest of the way she kept her place,
      holding out her little arms to me, beckoning me on. Her four motherless
      years brought compunction to my heart and tears to my eyes; she should
      have all the compensation that could be. I suddenly realized how ready I
      was&mdash;how ready!&mdash;to have her back. I rebelled fiercely against
      John&rsquo;s decision that we must not take her with us on our return to the
      frontier; privately, I resolved to dispute it, and, if necessary, I saw
      myself abducting the child&mdash;my own child. My days and nights as the
      ship crept on were full of a long ache to possess her; the defrauded
      tenderness of the last four years rose up in me and sometimes caught at my
      throat. I could think and talk and dream of nothing else. John indulged me
      as much as was reasonable, and only once betrayed by a yawn that the
      subject was not for him endlessly absorbing. Then I cried and he
      apologized. &lsquo;You know,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t exactly the same thing. I&rsquo;m not
      her mother.&rsquo; At which I dried my tears and expanded, proud and pacified. I
      was her mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the rainy little station and Alice, all-embracing in a damp
      waterproof, and the drive in the fly, and John&rsquo;s mother at the gate and a
      necessary pause while I kissed John&rsquo;s mother. Dear thing, she wanted to
      hold our hands and look into our faces and tell us how little we had
      changed for all our hardships; and on the way to the house she actually
      stopped to point out some alterations in the flower-borders. At last the
      drawing-room door and the smiling housemaid turning the handle and the
      unforgettable picture of a little girl, a little girl unlike anything we
      had imagined, starting bravely to trot across the room with the little
      speech that had been taught her. Half-way she came; I suppose our regards
      were too fixed, too absorbed, for there she stopped with a wail of terror
      at the strange faces, and ran straight back to the outstretched arms of
      her Aunt Emma. The most natural thing in the world, no doubt. I walked
      over to a chair opposite with my hand-bag and umbrella and sat down&mdash;a
      spectator, aloof and silent. Aunt Emma fondled and quieted the child,
      apologizing for her to me, coaxing her to look up, but the little figure
      still shook with sobs, hiding its face in the bosom that it knew. I smiled
      politely, like any other stranger, at Emma&rsquo;s deprecations, and sat
      impassive, looking at my alleged baby breaking her heart at the sight of
      her mother. It is not amusing even now to remember the anger that I felt.
      I did not touch her or speak to her; I simply sat observing my alien
      possession, in the frock I had not made and the sash I had not chosen,
      being coaxed and kissed and protected and petted by its Aunt Emma.
      Presently I asked to be taken to my room, and there I locked myself in for
      two atrocious hours. Just once my heart beat high, when a tiny knock came
      and a timid, docile little voice said that tea was ready. But I heard the
      rustle of a skirt, and guessed the directing angel in Aunt Emma, and
      responded, &lsquo;Thank you, dear, run away and say that I am coming,&rsquo; with a
      pleasant visitor&rsquo;s inflection which I was able to sustain for the rest of
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She goes to bed at seven,&rsquo; said Emma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, does she?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;A very good hour, I should think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She sleeps in my room,&rsquo; said Mrs. Farnham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We give her mutton broth very often, but seldom stock soup,&rsquo; said Aunt
      Emma. &lsquo;Mamma thinks it is too stimulating.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; said I, to all of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took me up to see her in her crib, and pointed out, as she lay
      asleep, that though she had &lsquo;a general look&rsquo; of me, her features were
      distinctively Farnham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you kiss her?&rsquo; asked Alice. &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t kissed her yet, and she is
      used to so much affection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could take such an advantage of her,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other, and Mrs. Farnham said that I was plainly worn
      out. I mustn&rsquo;t sit up to prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had been given anything like reasonable time I might have made a
      fight for it, but four weeks&mdash;it took a month each way in those days&mdash;was
      too absurdly little; I could do nothing. But I would not stay at mamma&rsquo;s.
      It was more than I would ask of myself, that daily disappointment under
      the mask of gratified discovery, for long.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent an approving, unnatural week, in my farcical character, bridling
      my resentment and hiding my mortification with pretty phrases; and then I
      went up to town and drowned my sorrows in the summer sales. I took John
      with me. I may have been Cecily&rsquo;s mother in theory, but I was John&rsquo;s wife
      in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went back to the frontier, and the regiment saw a lot of service. That
      meant medals and fun for my husband, but economy and anxiety for me,
      though I managed to be allowed as close to the firing line as any woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the Colonel&rsquo;s wife and I, sitting in Fort Samila, actually heard the
      rifles of a punitive expedition cracking on the other side of the river&mdash;that
      was a bad moment. My man came in after fifteen hours&rsquo; fighting, and went
      sound asleep, sitting before his food with his knife and fork in his
      hands. But service makes heavy demands besides those on your wife&rsquo;s
      nerves. We had saved two thousand rupees, I remember, against another run
      home, and it all went like powder, in the Mirzai expedition; and the run
      home diminished to a month in a boarding-house in the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, however, we had begun to correspond with our daughter, in large
      round words of one syllable, behind which, of course, was plain the
      patient guiding hand of Aunt Emma. One could hear Aunt Emma suggesting
      what would be nice to say, trying to instil a little pale affection for
      the far-off papa and mamma. There was so little Cecily and so much Emma&mdash;of
      course, it could not be otherwise&mdash;that I used to take, I fear, but a
      perfunctory joy in these letters. When we went home again I stipulated
      absolutely that she was to write to us without any sort of supervision&mdash;the
      child was ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the spelling!&rsquo; cried Aunt Emma, with lifted eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her letters aren&rsquo;t exercises,&rsquo; I was obliged to retort; &lsquo;she will do the
      best she can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We found her a docile little girl, with nice manners, a thoroughly
      unobjectionable child. I saw quite clearly that I could not have brought
      her up so well; indeed, there were moments when I fancied that Cecily,
      contrasting me with her aunts, wondered a little what my bringing up could
      have been like. With this reserve of criticism on Cecily&rsquo;s part, however,
      we got on very tolerably, largely because I found it impossible to assume
      any responsibility towards her, and in moments of doubt or discipline
      referred her to her aunts. We spent a pleasant summer with a little girl
      in the house whose interest in us was amusing, and whose outings it was
      gratifying to arrange; but when we went back, I had no desire to take her
      with us. I thought her very much better where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the period which is filled, in a subordinate degree, with
      Cecily&rsquo;s letters. I do not wish to claim more than I ought; they were not
      my only or even my principal interest in life. It was a long period; it
      lasted till she was twenty-one. John had had promotion in the meantime,
      and there was rather more money, but he had earned his second brevet with
      a bullet through one lung, and the doctors ordered our leave to be spent
      in South Africa. We had photographs, we knew she had grown tall and
      athletic and comely, and the letters were always very creditable. I had
      the unusual and qualified privilege of watching my daughter&rsquo;s development
      from ten to twenty-one, at a distance of four thousand miles, by means of
      the written word. I wrote myself as provocatively as possible; I sought
      for every string, but the vibration that came back across the seas to me
      was always other than the one I looked for, and sometimes there was none.
      Nevertheless, Mrs. Farnham wrote me that Cecily very much valued my
      communications. Once when I had described an unusual excursion in a native
      state, I learned that she had read my letter aloud to the sewing circle.
      After that I abandoned description, and confined myself to such intimate
      personal details as no sewing circle could find amusing. The child&rsquo;s own
      letters were simply a mirror of the ideas of the Farnham ladies; that must
      have been so, it was not altogether my jaundiced eye. Alice and Emma and
      grandmamma paraded the pages in turn. I very early gave up hope of
      discoveries in my daughter, though as much of the original as I could
      detect was satisfactorily simple and sturdy. I found little things to
      criticize, of course, tendencies to correct; and by return post I
      criticized and corrected, but the distance and the deliberation seemed to
      touch my maxims with a kind of arid frivolity, and sometimes I tore them
      up. One quick, warm-blooded scolding would have been worth a sheaf of
      them. My studied little phrases could only inoculate her with a dislike
      for me without protecting her from anything under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I found she didn&rsquo;t dislike me, when John and I went home at last
      to bring her out. She received me with just a hint of kindness, perhaps,
      but on the whole very well.

      Chapter 1.II
    </h2>
    <p>
      John was recalled, of course, before the end of our furlough, which
      knocked various things on the head; but that is the sort of thing one
      learned to take with philosophy in any lengthened term of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
      service. Besides, there is usually sugar for the pill; and in this case it
      was a Staff command bigger than anything we expected for at least five
      years to come. The excitement of it when it was explained to her gave
      Cecily a charming colour. She took a good deal of interest in the General,
      her papa; I think she had an idea that his distinction would alleviate the
      situation in India, however it might present itself. She accepted that
      prospective situation calmly; it had been placed before her all her life.
      There would always be a time when she should go and live with papa and
      mamma in India, and so long as she was of an age to receive the idea with
      rebel tears she was assured that papa and mamma would give her a pony. The
      pony was no longer added to the prospect; it was absorbed no doubt in the
      general list of attractions calculated to reconcile a young lady to a
      parental roof with which she had no practical acquaintance. At all events,
      when I feared the embarrassment and dismay of a pathetic parting with
      darling grandmamma and the aunties, and the sweet cat and the dear vicar
      and all the other objects of affection, I found an agreeable unexpected
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may add that while I anticipated such broken-hearted farewells I was
      quite prepared to take them easily. Time, I imagined, had brought
      philosophy to me also, equally agreeable and equally unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Bombay ship, full of returning Anglo-Indians. I looked up and
      down the long saloon tables with a sense of relief and of solace; I was
      again among my own people. They belonged to Bengal and to Burma, to Madras
      and to the Punjab, but they were all my people. I could pick out a score
      that I knew in fact, and there were none that in imagination I didn&rsquo;t
      know. The look of wider seas and skies, the casual experienced glance, the
      touch of irony and of tolerance, how well I knew it and how well I liked
      it! Dear old England, sitting in our wake, seemed to hold by comparison a
      great many soft, unsophisticated people, immensely occupied about very
      particular trifles. How difficult it had been, all the summer, to be
      interested! These of my long acquaintance belonged to my country&rsquo;s
      Executive, acute, alert, with the marks of travail on them. Gladly I went
      in and out of the women&rsquo;s cabins and listened to the argot of the men; my
      own ruling, administering, soldiering little lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecily looked at them askance. To her the atmosphere was alien, and I
      perceived that gently and privately she registered objections. She cast a
      disapproving eye upon the wife of a Conservator of Forests, who scanned
      with interest a distant funnel and laid a small wager that it belonged to
      the Messageries Maritimes. She looked with a straightened lip at the
      crisply stepping women who walked the deck in short and rather shabby
      skirts with their hands in their jacket-pockets talking transfers and
      promotions; and having got up at six to make a water-colour sketch of the
      sunrise, she came to me in profound indignation to say that she had met a
      man in his pyjamas; no doubt; poor wretch, on his way to be shaved. I was
      unable to convince her he was not expected to visit the barber in all his
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the third day she told me that she wished these people
      wouldn&rsquo;t talk to her; she didn&rsquo;t like them. I had turned in the hour we
      left the Channel and had not left my berth since, so possibly I was not in
      the most amiable mood to receive a douche of cold water. &lsquo;I must try to
      remember, dear,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that you have been brought up altogether in the
      society of pussies and vicars and elderly ladies, and of course you miss
      them. But you must have a little patience. I shall be up tomorrow, if this
      beastly sea continues to go down; and then we will try to find somebody
      suitable to introduce to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, mamma,&rsquo; said my daughter, without a ray of suspicion. Then she
      added consideringly, &lsquo;Aunt Emma and Aunt Alice do seem quite elderly
      ladies beside you, and yet you are older than either of them aren&rsquo;t you? I
      wonder how that is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so innocent, so admirable, that I laughed at my own expense; while
      Cecily, doing her hair, considered me gravely. &lsquo;I wish you would tell me
      why you laugh, mamma,&rsquo; quoth she; &lsquo;you laugh so often.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not to wait after all for my good offices of the next morning.
      Cecily came down at ten o&rsquo;clock that night quite happy and excited; she
      had been talking to a bishop, such a dear bishop. The bishop had been
      showing her his collection of photographs, and she had promised to play
      the harmonium for him at the eleven-o&rsquo;clock service in the morning. &lsquo;Bless
      me!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is it Sunday?&rsquo; It seemed she had got on very well indeed
      with the bishop, who knew the married sister, at Tunbridge, of her very
      greatest friend. Cecily herself did not know the married sister, but that
      didn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;it was a link. The bishop was charming. &lsquo;Well, my
      love,&rsquo; said I&mdash;I was teaching myself to use these forms of address
      for fear she would feel an unkind lack of them, but it was difficult&mdash;&lsquo;I
      am glad that somebody from my part of the world has impressed you
      favourably at last. I wish we had more bishops.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but my bishop doesn&rsquo;t belong to your part of the world,&rsquo; responded my
      daughter sleepily. &lsquo;He is travelling for his health.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the most unexpected and delightful thing to be packed into one&rsquo;s
      chair next morning by Dacres Tottenham. As I emerged from the music saloon
      after breakfast&mdash;Cecily had stayed below to look over her hymns and
      consider with her bishop the possibility of an anthem&mdash;Dacres&rsquo;s face
      was the first I saw; it simply illuminated, for me, that portion of the
      deck. I noticed with pleasure the quick toss of the cigar overboard as he
      recognized and bore down upon me. We were immense friends; John liked him
      too. He was one of those people who make a tremendous difference; in all
      our three hundred passengers there could be no one like him, certainly no
      one whom I could be more glad to see. We plunged at once into immediate
      personal affairs, we would get at the heart of them later. He gave his
      vivid word to everything he had seen and done; we laughed and exclaimed
      and were silent in a concert of admirable understanding. We were still
      unravelling, still demanding and explaining when the ship&rsquo;s bell began to
      ring for church, and almost simultaneously Cecily advanced towards us. She
      had a proper Sunday hat on, with flowers under the brim, and a
      church-going frock; she wore gloves and clasped a prayer-book. Most of the
      women who filed past to the summons of the bell were going down as they
      were, in cotton blouses and serge skirts, in tweed caps or anything, as to
      a kind of family prayers. I knew exactly how they would lean against the
      pillars of the saloon during the psalms. This young lady would be little
      less than a rebuke to them. I surveyed her approach; she positively walked
      as if it were Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;how endimanchee you look! The bishop will be very
      pleased with you. This gentleman is Mr. Tottenham, who administers Her
      Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure in parts of India about Allahabad. My daughter,
      Dacres.&rsquo; She was certainly looking very fresh, and her calm grey eyes had
      the repose in them that has never known itself to be disturbed about
      anything. I wondered whether she bowed so distantly also because it was
      Sunday, and then I remembered that Dacres was a young man, and that the
      Farnham ladies had probably taught her that it was right to be very
      distant with young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is almost eleven, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, dear. I see you are going to church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you not coming, mamma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was well wrapped up in an extremely comfortable corner. I had &lsquo;La
      Duchesse Bleue&rsquo; uncut in my lap, and an agreeable person to talk to. I
      fear that in any case I should not been inclined to attend the service,
      but there was something in my daughter&rsquo;s intonation that made me
      distinctly hostile to the idea. I am putting things down as they were,
      extenuating nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve turned up two such nice seats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, Miss Farnham, and keep us in countenance,&rsquo; said Dacres, with his
      charming smile. The smile displaced a look of discreet and amused
      observation. Dacres had an eye always for a situation, and this one was
      even newer to him than to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. She must run away and not bully her mamma,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;When she
      comes back we will see how much she remembers of the sermon;&rsquo; and as the
      flat tinkle from the companion began to show signs of diminishing, Cecily,
      with one grieved glance, hastened down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You amazing lady!&rsquo; said Dacres. &lsquo;A daughter&mdash;and such a tall
      daughter! I somehow never&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You knew we had one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was theory of that kind, I remember, about ten years ago. Since
      then&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve mentioned her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You talk as if she were a skeleton in the closet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You DIDN&rsquo;T talk&mdash;as if she were.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think she was, in a way, poor child. But the resurrection day hasn&rsquo;t
      confounded me as I deserved. She&rsquo;s a very good girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you had asked me to pick out your daughter&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She would have been the last you would indicate! Quite so,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;She
      is like her father&rsquo;s people. I can&rsquo;t help that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you would if you could,&rsquo; Dacres remarked absently; but
      the sea air, perhaps, enabled me to digest his thoughtlessness with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I am just as well pleased. I think a resemblance to me
      would confuse me, often.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a trace of scrutiny in Dacres&rsquo;s glance. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you find yourself
      in sympathy with her?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear boy, I have seen her just twice in twenty-one years! You see,
      I&rsquo;ve always stuck to John.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But between mother and daughter&mdash;I may be old-fashioned, but I had
      an idea that there was an instinct that might be depended on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am depending on it,&rsquo; I said, and let my eyes follow the little blue
      waves that chased past the hand-rail. &lsquo;We are making very good speed,
      aren&rsquo;t we? Thirty-five knots since last night at ten. Are you in the
      sweep?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never bet on the way out&mdash;can&rsquo;t afford it. Am I old-fashioned?&rsquo; he
      insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probably. Men are very slow in changing their philosophy about women. I
      fancy their idea of the maternal relation is firmest fixed of all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We see it a beatitude!&rsquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; I said wearily, &lsquo;and you never modify the view.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dacres contemplated the portion of the deck that lay between us. His eyes
      were discreetly lowered, but I saw embarrassment and speculation and a
      hint of criticism in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me more about it,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t be sympathetic!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;Lend me a
      little philosophy instead. There is nothing to tell. There she is and
      there I am, in the most intimate relation in the world, constituted when
      she is twenty-one and I am forty.&rsquo; Dacres started slightly at the ominous
      word; so little do men realize that the women they like can ever pass out
      of the constated years of attraction. &lsquo;I find the young lady very
      tolerable, very creditable, very nice. I find the relation atrocious.
      There you have it. I would like to break the relation into pieces,&rsquo; I went
      on recklessly, &lsquo;and throw it into the sea. Such things should be tempered
      to one. I should feel it much less if she occupied another cabin, and
      would consent to call me Elizabeth or Jane. It is not as if I had been her
      mother always. One grows fastidious at forty&mdash;new intimacies are only
      possible then on a basis of temperament&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused; it seemed to me that I was making excuses, and I had not the
      least desire in the world to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How awfully rough on the girl!&rsquo; said Dacres Tottenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That consideration has also occurred to me,&rsquo; I said candidly, &lsquo;though I
      have perhaps been even more struck by its converse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had no earthly business to be her mother,&rsquo; said my friend, with
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders&mdash;what would you have done?&mdash;and opened
      &lsquo;La Duchesse Bleue&rsquo;.

    <h2>
      Chapter 1.III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morgan, wife of a judge of the High Court of Bombay, and I sat
      amidships on the cool side in the Suez Canal. She was outlining &lsquo;Soiled
      Linen&rsquo; in chain-stitch on a green canvas bag; I was admiring the Egyptian
      sands. &lsquo;How charming,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is this solitary desert in the endless
      oasis we are compelled to cross!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oasis in the desert, you mean,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morgan; &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t noticed any,
      but I happened to look up this morning as I was putting on my stockings,
      and I saw through my port-hole the most lovely mirage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been at school with Mrs. Morgan more than twenty years agone, but
      she had come to the special enjoyment of the dignities of life while I
      still liked doing things. Mrs. Morgan was the kind of person to make one
      realize how distressing a medium is middle age. Contemplating her
      precipitous lap, to which conventional attitudes were certainly more
      becoming, I crossed my own knees with energy, and once more resolved to be
      young until I was old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How perfectly delightful for you to be taking Cecily out!&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Morgan placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; I responded, watching the gliding sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she was born in sixty-nine&mdash;that makes her twenty-one. Quite
      time, I should say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, we couldn&rsquo;t put it off any longer. I mean&mdash;her father has such a
      horror of early debuts. He simply would not hear of her coming before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t want her to marry in India, I dare say&mdash;the only one,&rsquo; 
      purred Mrs. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. It isn&rsquo;t such a bad place. I was brought out there to
      marry, and I married. I&rsquo;ve found it very satisfactory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You always did say exactly what you thought, Helena,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morgan
      excusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t much patience with people who bring their daughters out to give
      them the chance they never would have in England, and then go about
      devoutly hoping they won&rsquo;t marry in India,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I shall be very
      pleased if Cecily does as well as your girls have done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mary in the Indian Civil and Jessie in the Imperial Service Troops,&rsquo; 
      sighed Mrs. Morgan complacently. &lsquo;And both, my dear, within a year. It WAS
      a blow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it must have been!&rsquo; I said civilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no use in bandying words with Emily Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing in the world like the satisfaction and pleasure one
      takes in one&rsquo;s daughters,&rsquo; Mrs. Morgan went on limpidly. &lsquo;And one can be
      in such CLOSE sympathy with one&rsquo;s girls. I have never regretted having no
      sons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, yes. To watch oneself growing up again&mdash;call back the
      lovely April of one&rsquo;s prime, etcetera&mdash;to read every thought and
      anticipate every wish&mdash;there is no more golden privilege in life,
      dear Emily. Such a direct and natural avenue for affection, such a wide
      field for interest!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused, lost in the volume of my admirable sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How beautifully you talk, Helena! I wish I had the gift.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean very much,&rsquo; I said truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I think it&rsquo;s everything! And how companionable a girl is! I quite
      envy you, this season, having Cecily constantly with you and taking her
      about everywhere. Something quite new for you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Absolutely,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I am looking forward to it immensely. But it is
      likely she will make her own friends, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo; I added anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hardly the first season. My girls didn&rsquo;t. I was practically their only
      intimate for months. Don&rsquo;t be afraid; you won&rsquo;t be obliged to go shares in
      Cecily with anybody for a good long while,&rsquo; added Mrs. Morgan kindly. &lsquo;I
      know just how you feel about THAT.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The muddy water of the Ditch chafed up from under us against its banks
      with a smell that enabled me to hide the emotions Mrs. Morgan evoked
      behind my handkerchief. The pale desert was pictorial with the drifting,
      deepening purple shadows of clouds, and in the midst a blue glimmer of the
      Bitter Lakes, with a white sail on them. A little frantic Arab boy ran
      alongside keeping pace with the ship. Except for the smell, it was like a
      dream, we moved so quietly; on, gently on and on between the ridgy clay
      banks and the rows of piles. Peace was on the ship; you could hear what
      the Fourth in his white ducks said to the quartermaster in his blue
      denims; you could count the strokes of the electric bell in the
      wheel-house; peace was on the ship as she pushed on, an ever-venturing,
      double-funneled impertinence, through the sands of the ages. My eyes
      wandered along a plank-line in the deck till they were arrested by a
      petticoat I knew, when they returned of their own accord. I seemed to be
      always seeing that petticoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; resumed Mrs. Morgan, whose glance had wandered in the same
      direction, &lsquo;that Cecily is a very fine type of our English girls. With
      those dark grey eyes, a LITTLE prominent possibly, and that good colour&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      rather high now perhaps, but she will lose quite enough of it in India&mdash;and
      those regular features, she would make a splendid Britannia. Do you know,
      I fancy she must have a great deal of character. Has she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any amount. And all of it good,&rsquo; I responded, with private dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No faults at all?&rsquo; chaffed Mrs. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; I said sadly, &lsquo;that I can put my finger on.
      But I hope to discover a few later. The sun may bring them out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like freckles. Well, you are a lucky woman. Mine had plenty, I assure
      you. Untidiness was no name for Jessie, and Mary&mdash;I&rsquo;m SORRY to say
      that Mary sometimes fibbed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How lovable of her! Cecily&rsquo;s neatness is a painful example to me, and I
      don&rsquo;t believe she would tell a fib to save my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morgan, as the lunch-bell rang and she gathered her
      occupation into her work-basket, &lsquo;who is that talking to her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, an old friend,&rsquo; I replied easily; &lsquo;Dacres Tottenham, a dear fellow,
      and most benevolent. He is trying on my behalf to reconcile her to the
      life she&rsquo;ll have to lead in India.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t need much reconciling, if she&rsquo;s like most girls,&rsquo; observed Mrs.
      Morgan, &lsquo;but he seems to be trying very hard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That was quite the way I took it&mdash;on my behalf&mdash;for several
      days. When people have understood you very adequately for ten years you do
      not expect them to boggle at any problem you may present at the end of the
      decade. I thought Dacres was moved by a fine sense of compassion. I
      thought that with his admirable perception he had put a finger on the
      little comedy of fruitfulness in my life that laughed so bitterly at the
      tragedy of the barren woman, and was attempting, by delicate manipulation,
      to make it easier. I really thought so. Then I observed that myself had
      preposterously deceived me, that it wasn&rsquo;t like that at all. When Mr.
      Tottenham joined us, Cecily and me, I saw that he listened more than he
      talked, with an ear specially cocked to register any small irony which
      might appear in my remarks to my daughter. Naturally he registered more
      than there were, to make up perhaps for dear Cecily&rsquo;s obviously not
      registering any. I could see, too, that he was suspicious of any flavour
      of kindness; finally, to avoid the strictures of his upper lip, which
      really, dear fellow, began to bore me, I talked exclusively about the
      distant sails and the Red Sea littoral. When he no longer joined us as we
      sat or walked together, I perceived that his hostility was fixed and his
      parti pris. He was brimful of compassion, but it was all for Cecily, none
      for the situation or for me. (She would have marvelled, placidly, why he
      pitied her. I am glad I can say that.) The primitive man in him rose up as
      Pope of nature and excommunicated me as a creature recusant to her
      functions. Then deliberately Dacres undertook an office of consolation;
      and I fell to wondering, while Mrs. Morgan spoke her convictions plainly
      out, how far an impulse of reparation for a misfortune with which he had
      nothing to do might carry a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to watch the affair with an interest which even to me seemed
      queer. It was not detached, but it was semi-detached, and, of course, on
      the side for which I seem, in this history, to be perpetually apologizing.
      With certain limitations it didn&rsquo;t matter an atom whom Cecily married. So
      that he was sound and decent, with reasonable prospects, her simple
      requirements and ours for her would be quite met. There was the ghost of a
      consolation in that; one needn&rsquo;t be anxious or exacting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could predict with a certain amount of confidence that in her first
      season she would probably receive three or four proposals, any one of
      which she might accept with as much propriety and satisfaction as any
      other one. For Cecily it was so simple; prearranged by nature like her
      digestion, one could not see any logical basis for difficulties. A nice
      upstanding sapper, a dashing Bengal Lancer&mdash;oh, I could think of half
      a dozen types that would answer excellently. She was the kind of young
      person, and that was the summing up of it, to marry a type and be
      typically happy. I hoped and expected that she would. But Dacres!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dacres should exercise the greatest possible discretion. He was not a
      person who could throw the dice indifferently with fate. He could respond
      to so much, and he would inevitably, sooner or later, demand so much
      response! He was governed by a preposterously exacting temperament, and he
      wore his nerves outside. And what vision he had! How he explored the world
      he lived in and drew out of it all there was, all there was! I could see
      him in the years to come ranging alone the fields that were sweet and the
      horizons that lifted for him, and ever returning to pace the common dusty
      mortal road by the side of a purblind wife. On general principles, as a
      case to point at, it would be a conspicuous pity. Nor would it lack the
      aspect of a particular, a personal misfortune. Dacres was occupied in
      quite the natural normal degree with his charming self; he would pass his
      misery on, and who would deserve to escape it less than his mother-in-law?
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened to Emily Morgan, who gleaned in the ship more information about
      Dacres Tottenham&rsquo;s people, pay, and prospects than I had ever acquired,
      and I kept an eye upon the pair which was, I flattered myself, quite
      maternal. I watched them without acute anxiety, deploring the threatening
      destiny, but hardly nearer to it than one is in the stalls to the stage.
      My moments of real concern for Dacres were mingled more with anger than
      with sorrow&mdash;it seemed inexcusable that he, with his infallible
      divining-rod for temperament, should be on the point of making such an ass
      of himself. Though I talk of the stage there was nothing at all dramatic
      to reward my attention, mine and Emily Morgan&rsquo;s. To my imagination,
      excited by its idea of what Dacres Tottenham&rsquo;s courtship ought to be, the
      attentions he paid to Cecily were most humdrum. He threw rings into
      buckets with her&mdash;she was good at that&mdash;and quoits upon the
      &lsquo;bull&rsquo; board; he found her chair after the decks were swabbed in the
      morning and established her in it; he paced the deck with her at
      convenient times and seasons. They were humdrum, but they were constant
      and cumulative. Cecily took them with an even breath that perfectly
      matched. There was hardly anything, on her part, to note&mdash;a little
      discreet observation of his comings and goings, eyes scarcely lifted from
      her book, and later just a hint of proprietorship, as the evening she came
      up to me on deck, our first night in the Indian Ocean. I was lying in my
      long chair looking at the thick, low stars and thinking it was a long time
      since I had seen John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dearest mamma, out here and nothing over your shoulders! You ARE
      imprudent. Where is your wrap? Mr. Tottenham, will you please fetch
      mamma&rsquo;s wrap for her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If mamma so instructs me,&rsquo; he said audaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do as Cecily tells you,&rsquo; I laughed, and he went and did it, while I by
      the light of a quartermaster&rsquo;s lantern distinctly saw my daughter blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time, when Cecily came down to undress, she bent over me as I lay
      in the lower berth with unusual solicitude. I had been dozing, and I
      jumped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, child?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Is the ship on fire?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, mamma, the ship is not on fire. There is nothing wrong. I&rsquo;m so sorry
      I startled you. But Mr. Tottenham has been telling me all about what you
      did for the soldiers the time plague broke out in the lines at Mian-Mir. I
      think it was splendid, mamma, and so does he.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Lord!&rsquo; I groaned. &lsquo;Good night.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 1.IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It remained in my mind, that little thing that Dacres had taken the
      trouble to tell my daughter; I thought about it a good deal. It seemed to
      me the most serious and convincing circumstances that had yet offered
      itself to my consideration. Dacres was no longer content to bring solace
      and support to the more appealing figure of the situation; he must set to
      work, bless him! to improve the situation itself. He must try to induce
      Miss Farnham, by telling her everything he could remember to my credit, to
      think as well of her mother as possible, in spite of the strange and
      secret blows which that mother might be supposed to sit up at night to
      deliver to her. Cecily thought very well of me already; indeed, with
      private reservations as to my manners and&mdash;no, NOT my morals, I
      believe I exceeded her expectations of what a perfectly new and untrained
      mother would be likely to prove. It was my theory that she found me all
      she could understand me to be. The maternal virtues of the outside were
      certainly mine; I put them on with care every morning and wore them with
      patience all day. Dacres, I assured myself, must have allowed his
      preconception to lead him absurdly by the nose not to see that the girl
      was satisfied, that my impatience, my impotence, did not at all make her
      miserable. Evidently, however, he had created our relations differently;
      evidently he had set himself to their amelioration. There was portent in
      it; things seemed to be closing in. I bit off a quarter of an inch of
      wooden pen-handle in considering whether or not I should mention it in my
      letter to John, and decided that it would be better just perhaps to drop a
      hint. Though I could not expect John to receive it with any sort of
      perturbation. Men are different; he would probably think Tottenham well
      enough able to look after himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had embarked on my letter, there at the end of a corner-table of the
      saloon, when I saw Dacres saunter through. He wore a very conscious and
      elaborately purposeless air; and it jumped with my mood that he had
      nothing less than the crisis of his life in his pocket, and was looking
      for me. As he advanced towards me between the long tables doubt left me
      and alarm assailed me. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to find you in a quiet corner,&rsquo; said he,
      seating himself, and confirmed my worst anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m writing to John,&rsquo; I said, and again applied myself to my pen-handle.
      It is a trick Cecily has since done her best in vain to cure me of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to interrupt you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I have not had an opportunity of
      talking to you for some time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like that!&rsquo; I exclaimed derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I want to tell you that I am very much charmed with Cecily.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I am not going to gratify you by saying anything against
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve her, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t dispute that. But, if you don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;ll
      stand being abused, dear boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I quite see it isn&rsquo;t any use. Though one spoke with the tongues of men
      and of angels&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And had not charity,&rsquo; I continued for him. &lsquo;Precisely. I won&rsquo;t go on, but
      your quotation is very apt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I so bow down before her simplicity. It makes a wide and beautiful margin
      for the rest of her character. She is a girl Ruskin would have loved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;He did seem fond of the simple type, didn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her mind is so clear, so transparent. The motive spring of everything she
      says and does is so direct. Don&rsquo;t you find you can most completely depend
      upon her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;certainly. I nearly always know what she is going to
      say before she says it, and under given circumstances I can tell precisely
      what she will do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy her sense of duty is very beautifully developed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;There is hardly a day when I do not come in contact with
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that is surely a good thing. And I find that calm poise of hers
      very restful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not have believed that so many virtues could reside in one young
      lady,&rsquo; I said, taking refuge in flippancy, &lsquo;and to think that she should
      be my daughter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I believe you know, that seems to me rather a cruel stroke of destiny,
      Mrs. Farnham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, I know! You have a constructive imagination, Dacres. You don&rsquo;t
      seem to see that the girl is protected by her limitations, like a
      tortoise. She lives within them quite secure and happy and content. How
      determined you are to be sorry for her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tottenham looked at the end of this lively exchange as though he
      sought for a polite way of conveying to me that I rather was the limited
      person. He looked as if he wished he could say things. The first of them
      would be, I saw, that he had quite a different conception of Cecily, that
      it was illuminated by many trifles, nuances of feeling and expression,
      which he had noticed in his talks with her whenever they had skirted the
      subject of her adoption by her mother. He knew her, he was longing to say,
      better than I did; when it would have been natural to reply that one could
      not hope to compete in such a direction with an intelligent young man, and
      we should at once have been upon delicate and difficult ground. So it was
      as well perhaps that he kept silence until he said, as he had come
      prepared to say, &lsquo;Well, I want to put that beyond a doubt&mdash;her
      happiness&mdash;if I&rsquo;m good enough. I want her, please, and I only hope
      that she will be half as willing to come as you are likely to be to let
      her go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a shock when it came, plump, like that; and I was horrified to feel
      how completely every other consideration was lost for the instant in the
      immense relief that it prefigured. To be my whole complete self again,
      without the feeling that a fraction of me was masquerading about in
      Cecily! To be freed at once, or almost, from an exacting condition and an
      impossible ideal! &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; I exclaimed, and my eyes positively filled. &lsquo;You
      ARE good, Dacres, but I couldn&rsquo;t let you do that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His undisguised stare brought me back to a sense of the proportion of
      things. I saw that in the combination of influences that had brought Mr.
      Tottenham to the point of proposing to marry my daughter consideration for
      me, if it had a place, would be fantastic. Inwardly I laughed at the
      egotism of raw nerves that had conjured it up, even for an instant, as a
      reason for gratitude. The situation was not so peculiar, not so
      interesting, as that. But I answered his stare with a smile; what I had
      said might very well stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you imagine,&rsquo; he said, seeing that I did not mean to amplify it, &lsquo;that
      I want to marry her out of any sort of GOODness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Benevolence is your weakness, Dacres.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see. You think one&rsquo;s motive is to withdraw her from a relation which
      ought to be the most natural in the world, but which is, in her particular
      and painful case, the most equivocal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, come,&rsquo; I remonstrated. &lsquo;You have dropped one or two things, you
      know, in the heat of your indignation, not badly calculated to give one
      that idea. The eloquent statement you have just made, for instance&mdash;it
      carries all the patness of old conviction. How often have you rehearsed
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a fairly long-suffering person, but I began to feel a little annoyed
      with my would-be son-in-law. If the relation were achieved it would give
      him no prescriptive right to bully me; and we were still in very early
      anticipation of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he said disarmingly. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us quarrel. I&rsquo;m sorry you think
      that; because it isn&rsquo;t likely to bring your favour to my project, and I
      want you friendly and helpful. Oh, confound it!&rsquo; he exclaimed, with sudden
      temper. &lsquo;You ought to be. I don&rsquo;t understand this aloofness. I half
      suspect it&rsquo;s pose. You undervalue Cecily&mdash;well, you have no business
      to undervalue me. You know me better than anybody in the world. Now are
      you going to help me to marry your daughter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rsquo; I said slowly, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, which he sat
      through like a mutinous schoolboy. &lsquo;I might tell you that I don&rsquo;t care a
      button whom you marry, but that would not be true. I do care more or less.
      As you say, I know you pretty well. I&rsquo;d a little rather you didn&rsquo;t make a
      mess of it; and if you must I should distinctly prefer not to have the
      spectacle under my nose for the rest of my life. I can&rsquo;t hinder you, but I
      won&rsquo;t help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what possesses you to imagine that in marrying Cecily I should make a
      mess of it? Shouldn&rsquo;t your first consideration be whether SHE would?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it should, but, you see, it isn&rsquo;t. Cecily would be happy with
      anybody who made her comfortable. You would ask a good deal more than
      that, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dacres, at this, took me up promptly. Life, he said, the heart of life,
      had particularly little to say to temperament. By the heart of life I
      suppose he meant married love. He explained that its roots asked other
      sustenance, and that it throve best of all on simple elemental goodness.
      So long as a man sought in women mere casual companionship, perhaps the
      most exquisite thing to be experienced was the stimulus of some spiritual
      feminine counterpart; but when he desired of one woman that she should be
      always and intimately with him, the background of his life, the mother of
      his children, he was better advised to avoid nerves and sensibilities, and
      try for the repose of the common&mdash;the uncommon&mdash;domestic
      virtues. Ah, he said, they were sweet, like lavender. (Already, I told
      him, he smelled the housekeeper&rsquo;s linen-chest.) But I did not interrupt
      him much; I couldn&rsquo;t, he was too absorbed. To temperamental pairing, he
      declared, the century owed its breed of decadents. I asked him if he had
      ever really recognized one; and he retorted that if he hadn&rsquo;t he didn&rsquo;t
      wish to make a beginning in his own family. In a quarter of an hour he
      repudiated the theories of a lifetime, a gratifying triumph for simple
      elemental goodness. Having denied the value of the subtler pretensions to
      charm in woman as you marry her, he went artlessly on to endow Cecily with
      as many of them as could possibly be desirable. He actually persuaded
      himself to say that it was lovely to see the reflections of life in her
      tranquil spirit; and when I looked at him incredulously he grew angry, and
      hinted that Cecily&rsquo;s sensitiveness to reflections and other things might
      be a trifle beyond her mother&rsquo;s ken. &lsquo;She responds instantly, intimately,
      to the beautiful everywhere,&rsquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t the opportunities of life on board ship rather limited to
      demonstrate that?&rsquo; I inquired. &lsquo;I know&mdash;you mean sunsets. Cecily is
      very fond of sunsets. She is always asking me to come and look at them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was thinking of last night&rsquo;s sunset,&rsquo; he confessed. &lsquo;We looked at it
      together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did she say?&rsquo; I asked idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing very much. That&rsquo;s just the point. Another girl would have raved
      and gushed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well, Cecily never does that,&rsquo; I responded. &lsquo;Nevertheless she is a
      very ordinary human instrument. I hope I shall have no temptation ten
      years hence to remind you that I warned you of her quality.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish, not in the least for my own profit, for I am well convinced
      already, but simply to win your cordiality and your approval&mdash;never
      did an unexceptional wooer receive such niggard encouragement!&mdash;I
      wish there were some sort of test for her quality. I would be proud to
      stand by it, and you would be convinced. I can&rsquo;t find words to describe my
      objection to your state of mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing seemed to me to be a foregone conclusion. I saw it accomplished,
      with all its possibilities of disastrous commonplace. I saw all that I
      have here taken the trouble to foreshadow. So far as I was concerned,
      Dacres&rsquo;s burden would add itself to my philosophies, voila tout. I should
      always be a little uncomfortable about it, because it had been taken from
      my back; but it would not be a matter for the wringing of hands. And yet&mdash;the
      hatefulness of the mistake! Dacres&rsquo;s bold talk of a test made no
      suggestion. Should my invention be more fertile? I thought of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have said nothing to her yet?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing. I don&rsquo;t think she suspects for a moment. She treats me as if no
      such fell design were possible. I&rsquo;m none too confident, you know,&rsquo; he
      added, with longer face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We go straight to Agra. Could you come to Agra?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ideal!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;The memory of Mumtaz! The garden of the Taj! I&rsquo;ve
      always wanted to love under the same moon as Shah Jehan. How thoughtful of
      you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must spend a few days with us in Agra,&rsquo; I continued. &lsquo;And as you say,
      it is the very place to shrine your happiness, if it comes to pass there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I am glad to have extracted a word of kindness from you at last,&rsquo; 
      said Dacres, as the stewards came to lay the table. &lsquo;But I wish,&rsquo; he added
      regretfully, &lsquo;you could have thought of a test.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 1.V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Four days later we were in Agra. A time there was when the name would have
      been the key of dreams to me; now it stood for John&rsquo;s headquarters. I was
      rejoiced to think I would look again upon the Taj; and the prospect of
      living with it was a real enchantment; but I pondered most the kind of
      house that would be provided for the General Commanding the District, how
      many the dining-room would seat, and whether it would have a roof of
      thatch or of corrugated iron&mdash;I prayed against corrugated iron. I
      confess these my preoccupations. I was forty, and at forty the practical
      considerations of life hold their own even against domes of marble,
      world-renowned, and set about with gardens where the bulbul sings to the
      rose. I smiled across the years at the raptures of my first vision of the
      place at twenty-one, just Cecily&rsquo;s age. Would I now sit under Arjamand&rsquo;s
      cypresses till two o&rsquo;clock in the morning to see the wonder of her tomb at
      a particular angle of the moon? Would I climb one of her tall white
      ministering minarets to see anything whatever? I very greatly feared that
      I would not. Alas for the aging of sentiment, of interest! Keep your touch
      with life and your seat in the saddle as long as you will, the world is no
      new toy at forty. But Cecily was twenty-one, Cecily who sat stolidly
      finishing her lunch while Dacres Tottenham talked about Akbar and his
      philosophy. &lsquo;The sort of man,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that Carlyle might have smoked a
      pipe with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely,&rsquo; said Cecily reflectively, &lsquo;tobacco was not discovered in
      England then. Akbar came to the throne in 1526.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor Carlyle either for that matter,&rsquo; I hastened to observe.
      &lsquo;Nevertheless, I think Mr. Tottenham&rsquo;s proposition must stand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks, Mrs. Farnham,&rsquo; said Dacres. &lsquo;But imagine Miss Farnham&rsquo;s
      remembering Akbar&rsquo;s date! I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us hope she doesn&rsquo;t know too much about him,&rsquo; I cried gaily, &lsquo;or
      there will be nothing to tell!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, really and truly very little!&rsquo; said Cecily, &lsquo;but as soon as we heard
      papa would be stationed here Aunt Emma made me read up about those old
      Moguls and people. I think I remember the dynasty. Baber, wasn&rsquo;t he the
      first? And then Humayon, and after him Akbar, and then Jehangir, and then
      Shah Jehan. But I&rsquo;ve forgotten every date but Akbar&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled her smile of brilliant health and even spirits as she made the
      damaging admission, and she was so good to look at, sitting there simple
      and wholesome and fresh, peeling her banana with her well-shaped fingers,
      that we swallowed the dynasty as it were whole, and smiled back upon her.
      John, I may say, was extremely pleased with Cecily; he said she was a very
      satisfactory human accomplishment. One would have thought, positively, the
      way he plumed himself over his handsome daughter, that he alone was
      responsible for her. But John, having received his family, straightway set
      off with his Staff on a tour of inspection, and thereby takes himself out
      of this history. I sometimes think that if he had stayed&mdash;but there
      has never been the lightest recrimination between us about it, and I am
      not going to hint one now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you read,&rsquo; asked Dacres, &lsquo;what he and the Court poet wrote over the
      entrance gate to the big mosque at Fattehpur-Sikri? It&rsquo;s rather nice. &ldquo;The
      world is a looking-glass, wherein the image has come and is gone&mdash;take
      as thine own nothing more than what thou lookest upon.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My daughter&rsquo;s thoughtful gaze was, of course, fixed upon the speaker, and
      in his own glance I saw a sudden ray of consciousness; but Cecily
      transferred her eyes to the opposite wall, deeply considering, and while
      Dacres and I smiled across the table, I saw that she had perceived no
      reason for blushing. It was a singularly narrow escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t; what a curious proverb for an emperor to make!
      He couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been able to see all his possessions at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have finished,&rsquo; Dacres addressed her, &lsquo;do let me show you what
      your plain and immediate duty is to the garden. The garden waits for you&mdash;all
      the roses expectant&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there isn&rsquo;t one!&rsquo; cried Cecily, pinning on her hat. It was pleasing,
      and just a trifle pathetic, the way he hurried her out of the scope of any
      little dart; he would not have her even within range of amused
      observation. Would he continue, I wondered vaguely, as, with my elbows on
      the table, I tore into strips the lemon-leaf that floated in my
      finger-bowl&mdash;would he continue, through life, to shelter her from his
      other clever friends as now he attempted to shelter her from her mother?
      In that case he would have to domicile her, poor dear, behind the curtain,
      like the native ladies&mdash;a good price to pay for a protection of
      which, bless her heart! she would be all unaware. I had quite stopped
      bemoaning the affair; perhaps the comments of my husband, who treated it
      with broad approval and satisfaction, did something to soothe my
      sensibilities. At all events, I had gradually come to occupy a high
      fatalistic ground towards the pair. If it was written upon their foreheads
      that they should marry, the inscription was none of mine; and, of course,
      it was true, as John had indignantly stated, that Dacres might do very
      much worse. One&rsquo;s interest in Dacres Tottenham&rsquo;s problematical future had
      in no way diminished; but the young man was so positive, so full of
      intention, so disinclined to discussion&mdash;he had not reopened the
      subject since that morning in the saloon of the Caledonia&mdash;that one&rsquo;s
      feeling about it rather took the attenuated form of a shrug. I am afraid,
      too, that the pleasurable excitement of such an impending event had a
      little supervened; even at forty there is no disallowing the natural
      interests of one&rsquo;s sex. As I sat there pulling my lemon-leaf to pieces, I
      should not have been surprised or in the least put about if the two had
      returned radiant from the lawn to demand my blessing. As to the test of
      quality that I had obligingly invented for Dacres on the spur of the
      moment without his knowledge or connivance, it had some time ago faded
      into what he apprehended it to be&mdash;a mere idyllic opportunity, a
      charming background, a frame for his project, of prettier sentiment than
      the funnels and the hand-rails of a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tottenham had ten days to spend with us. He knew the place well; it
      belonged to the province to whose service he was dedicated, and he claimed
      with impressive authority the privilege of showing it to Cecily by degrees&mdash;the
      Hall of Audience today, the Jessamine Tower tomorrow, the tomb of Akbar
      another, and the Deserted City yet another day. We arranged the
      expeditions in conference, Dacres insisting only upon the order of them,
      which I saw was to be cumulative, with the Taj at the very end, on the
      night precisely of the full of the moon, with a better chance of roses. I
      had no special views, but Cecily contributed some; that we should do the
      Hall of Audience in the morning, so as not to interfere with the club
      tennis in the afternoon, that we should bicycle to Akbar&rsquo;s tomb and take a
      cold luncheon&mdash;if we were sure there would be no snakes&mdash;to the
      Deserted City, to all of which Dacres gave loyal assent. I endorsed
      everything; I was the encouraging chorus, only stipulating that my number
      should be swelled from day to day by the addition of such persons as I
      should approve. Cecily, for instance, wanted to invite the Bakewells
      because we had come out in the same ship with them; but I could not endure
      the Bakewells, and it seemed to me that our having made the voyage with
      them was the best possible reason for declining to lay eyes on them for
      the rest of our natural lives. &lsquo;Mamma has such strong prejudices,&rsquo; Cecily
      remarked, as she reluctantly gave up the idea; and I waited to see whether
      the graceless Tottenham would unmurmuringly take down the Bakewells. How
      strong must be the sentiment that turns a man into a boa-constrictor
      without a pang of transmigration! But no, this time he was faithful to the
      principles of his pre-Cecilian existence. &lsquo;They are rather Boojums,&rsquo; he
      declared. &lsquo;You would think so, too, if you knew them better. It is that
      kind of excellent person that makes the real burden of India.&rsquo; I could
      have patted him on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the rest of the chorus, which proved abundantly available, I was
      no immediate witness to Cecily&rsquo;s introduction to the glorious fragments
      which sustain in Agra the memory of the moguls. I may as well say that I
      arranged with care that if anybody must be standing by when Dacres
      disclosed them, it should not be I. If Cecily had squinted, I should have
      been sorry, but I would have found in it no personal humiliation. There
      were other imperfections of vision, however, for which I felt responsible
      and ashamed; and with Dacres, though the situation, Heaven knows, was none
      of my seeking, I had a little the feeling of a dealer who offers a
      defective bibelot to a connoisseur. My charming daughter&mdash;I was fifty
      times congratulated upon her appearance and her manners&mdash;had many
      excellent qualities and capacities which she never inherited from me; but
      she could see no more than the bulk, no further than the perspective; she
      could register exactly as much as a camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a curious thing, perhaps, to displease my maternal vanity, but it
      did; I had really rather she squinted; and when there was anything to look
      at I kept out of the way. I can not tell precisely, therefore, what the
      incidents were that contributed to make Mr. Tottenham, on our return from
      these expeditions, so thoughtful, with a thoughtfulness which increased,
      towards the end of them, to a positive gravity. This would disappear
      during dinner under the influence of food and drink. He would talk nightly
      with new enthusiasm and fresh hope&mdash;or did I imagine it?&mdash;of the
      loveliness he had arranged to reveal on the following day. If again my
      imagination did not lead me astray, I fancied this occurred later and
      later in the course of the meal as the week went on; as if his state
      required more stimulus as time progressed. One evening, when I expected it
      to flag altogether, I had a whim to order champagne and observe the
      effect; but I am glad to say that I reproved myself, and refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecily, meanwhile, was conducting herself in a manner which left nothing
      to be desired. If, as I sometimes thought, she took Dacres very much for
      granted, she took him calmly for granted; she seemed a prey to none of
      those fluttering uncertainties, those suspended judgments and elaborate
      indifferences which translate themselves so plainly in a young lady
      receiving addresses. She turned herself out very freshly and very well;
      she was always ready for everything, and I am sure that no glance of
      Dacres Tottenham&rsquo;s found aught but direct and decorous response. His
      society on these occasions gave her solid pleasure; so did the drive and
      the lunch; the satisfactions were apparently upon the same plane. She was
      aware of the plum, if I may be permitted a brusque but irresistible
      simile; and with her mouth open, her eyes modestly closed, and her head in
      a convenient position, she waited, placidly, until it should fall in. The
      Farnham ladies would have been delighted with the result of their labours
      in the sweet reason and eminent propriety of this attitude. Thinking of my
      idiotic sufferings when John began to fix himself upon my horizon, I
      pondered profoundly the power of nature in differentiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, the last, I think, but one, I had occasion to go to my
      daughter&rsquo;s room, and found her writing in her commonplace-book. She had a
      commonplace-book, as well as a Where Is It? an engagement-book, an
      account-book, a diary, a Daily Sunshine, and others with purposes too
      various to remember. &lsquo;Dearest mamma,&rsquo; she said, as I was departing, &lsquo;there
      is only one &ldquo;p&rdquo; in &ldquo;opulence&rdquo;, isn&rsquo;t there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied, with my hand on the door-handle, and added curiously,
      for it was an odd word in Cecily&rsquo;s mouth, &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hardly hesitated. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am just writing down one or two
      things Mr. Tottenham said about Agra before I forget them. They seemed so
      true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has a descriptive touch,&rsquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he describes beautifully. Would you like to hear what he said
      today?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would,&rsquo; I replied, sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Agra,&rdquo;&rsquo; read this astonishing young lady, &lsquo;&ldquo;is India&rsquo;s one pure idyll.
      Elsewhere she offers other things, foolish opulence, tawdry pageant,
      treachery of eunuchs and jealousies of harems, thefts of kings&rsquo; jewels and
      barbaric retributions; but they are all actual, visualized, or part of a
      past that shows to the backward glance hardly more relief and vitality
      than a Persian painting&rdquo;&mdash;I should like to see a Persian painting&mdash;&ldquo;but
      here the immortal tombs and pleasure-houses rise out of colour delicate
      and subtle; the vision holds across three hundred years; the print of the
      court is still in the dust of the city.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you really let him go on like that?&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;It has the license
      of a lecture!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I encouraged him to. Of course he didn&rsquo;t say it straight off. He said it
      naturally; he stopped now and then to cough. I didn&rsquo;t understand it all;
      but I think I have remembered every word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a remarkable memory. I&rsquo;m glad he stopped to cough. Is there any
      more?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One little bit. &ldquo;Here the moguls wrought their passions into marble, and
      held them up with great refrains from their religion, and set them about
      with gardens; and here they stand in the twilight of the glory of those
      kings and the noonday splendour of their own.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How clever of you!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;How wonderfully clever of you to
      remember!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had to ask him to repeat one or two sentences. He didn&rsquo;t like that. But
      this is nothing. I used to learn pages letter-perfect for Aunt Emma. She
      was very particular. I think it is worth preserving, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Cecily,&rsquo; I responded, &lsquo;you have a frugal mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing else to respond. I could not tell her just how practical
      I thought her, or how pathetic her little book.

    <h2>
      Chapter 1.VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We drove together, after dinner, to the Taj. The moonlight lay in an empty
      splendour over the broad sandy road, with the acacias pricking up on each
      side of it and the gardens of the station bungalows stretching back into
      clusters of crisp shadows. It was an exquisite February night, very still.
      Nothing seemed abroad but two or three pariah dogs, upon vague and errant
      business, and the Executive Engineer going swiftly home from the club on
      his bicycle. Even the little shops of the bazaar were dark and empty; only
      here and there a light showed barred behind the carved balconies of the
      upper rooms, and there was hardly any tom-tomming. The last long slope of
      the road showed us the river curving to the left, through a silent white
      waste that stretched indefinitely into the moonlight on one side, and was
      crowned by Akbar&rsquo;s fort on the other. His long high line of turrets and
      battlements still guarded a hint of their evening rose, and dim and
      exquisite above them hovered the three dome-bubbles of the Pearl Mosque.
      It was a night of perfect illusion, and the illusion was mysterious,
      delicate, and faint. I sat silent as we rolled along, twenty years nearer
      to the original joy of things when John and I drove through the same old
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dacres, too, seemed preoccupied; only Cecily was, as they say, herself.
      Cecily was really more than herself, she exhibited an unusual flow of
      spirits. She talked continually, she pointed out this and that, she asked
      who lived here and who lived there. At regular intervals of about four
      minutes she demanded if it wasn&rsquo;t simply too lovely. She sat straight up
      with her vigorous profile and her smart hat; and the silhouette of her
      personality sharply refused to mingle with the dust of any dynasty. She
      was a contrast, a protest; positively she was an indignity. &lsquo;Do lean back,
      dear child,&rsquo; I exclaimed at last. &lsquo;You interfere with the landscape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back, but she went on interfering with it in terms of sincerest
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we stopped at the great archway of entrance I begged to be left in
      the carriage. What else could one do, when the golden moment had come, but
      sit in the carriage and measure it? They climbed the broad stone steps
      together and passed under the lofty gravures into the garden, and I
      waited. I waited and remembered. I am not, as perhaps by this time is
      evident, a person of overwhelming sentiment, but I think the smile upon my
      lips was gentle. So plainly I could see, beyond the massive archway and
      across a score of years, all that they saw at that moment&mdash;Arjamand&rsquo;s
      garden, and the long straight tank of marble cleaving it full of sleeping
      water and the shadows of the marshaling cypresses; her wide dark garden of
      roses and of pomegranates, and at the end the Vision, marvellous, aerial,
      the soul of something&mdash;is it beauty? is it sorrow?&mdash;that great
      white pride of love in mourning such as only here in all the round of our
      little world lifts itself to the stars, the unpaintable, indescribable Taj
      Mahal. A gentle breath stole out with a scent of jessamine and such a
      memory! I closed my eyes and felt the warm luxury of a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking of the two in the garden, my mood was very kind, very conniving.
      How foolish after all were my cherry-stone theories of taste and
      temperament before that uncalculating thing which sways a world and builds
      a Taj Mahal! Was it probable that Arjamand and her Emperor had loved
      fastidiously, and yet how they had loved! I wandered away into
      consideration of the blind forces which move the world, in which comely
      young persons like my daughter Cecily had such a place; I speculated
      vaguely upon the value of the subtler gifts of sympathy and insight which
      seemed indeed, at that enveloping moment, to be mere flowers strewn upon
      the tide of deeper emotions. The garden sent me a fragrance of roses; the
      moon sailed higher and picked out the little kiosks set along the wall. It
      was a charming, charming thing to wait, there at the portal of the
      silvered, scented garden, for an idyll to come forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reappeared, Dacres and my daughter, they came with casual steps
      and cheerful voices. They might have been a couple of tourists. The
      moonlight fell full upon them on the platform under the arch. It showed
      Dacres measuring with his stick the length of the Sanskrit letters which
      declared the stately texts, and Cecily&rsquo;s expression of polite, perfunctory
      interest. They looked up at the height above them; they looked back at the
      vision behind. Then they sauntered towards the carriage, he offering a
      formal hand to help her down the uncertain steps, she gracefully accepting
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&mdash;you have not been long,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t hurry on my
      account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Farnham found the marble a little cold under foot,&rsquo; replied Dacres,
      putting Miss Farnham in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; explained Cecily, &lsquo;I stupidly forgot to change into thicker
      soles. I have only my slippers. But, mamma, how lovely it is! Do let us
      come again in the daytime. I am dying to make a sketch of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tottenham was to leave us on the following day. In the morning, after
      &lsquo;little breakfast,&rsquo; as we say in India, he sought me in the room I had set
      aside to be particularly my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I was writing to John, but this time I waited for precisely his
      interruption. I had got no further than &lsquo;My dearest husband,&rsquo; and my
      pen-handle was a fringe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another fine day,&rsquo; I said, as if the old, old Indian joke could give him
      ease, poor man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;we are having lovely weather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten that it was a joke. Then he lapsed into silence while I
      renewed my attentions to my pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; he said at last, with so strained a look about his mouth that it
      was almost a contortion, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t done it, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I responded, cheerfully, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;re not going to. Is that it?
      Well!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Frankly&mdash;&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, yes! Anything else between you and me would be grotesque,&rsquo; I
      interrupted, &lsquo;after all these years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be a success,&rsquo; he said, looking at me resolutely
      with his clear blue eyes, in which still lay, alas! the possibility of
      many delusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I never did, you know. But the prospect had begun to impose
      upon me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To say how right you were would seem, under the circumstances, the most
      hateful form of flattery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I think I can dispense with your verbal endorsement.&rsquo; I
      felt a little bitter. It was, of course, better that the connoisseur
      should have discovered the flaw before concluding the transaction; but
      although I had pointed it out myself I was not entirely pleased to have
      the article returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am infinitely ashamed that it should have taken me all these days&mdash;day
      after day and each contributory&mdash;to discover what you saw so easily
      and so completely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You forget that I am her mother,&rsquo; I could not resist the temptation of
      saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t jeer! Please be absolutely direct, and tell me
      if you have reason to believe that to the extent of a thought, of a breath&mdash;to
      any extent at all&mdash;she cares.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, I could see, very deeply moved; he had not arrived at this point
      without trouble and disorder not lightly to be put on or off. Yet I did
      not hurry to his relief, I was still possessed by a vague feeling of
      offense. I reflected that any mother would be, and I quite plumed myself
      upon my annoyance. It was so satisfactory, when one had a daughter, to
      know the sensations of even any mother. Nor was it soothing to remember
      that the young man&rsquo;s whole attitude towards Cecily had been based upon
      criticism of me, even though he sat before me whipped with his own lash.
      His temerity had been stupid and obstinate; I could not regret his
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept him waiting long enough to think all this, and then I replied, &lsquo;I
      have not the least means of knowing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I can not say what he expected, but he squared his shoulders as if he had
      received a blow and might receive another. Then he looked at me with a
      flash of the old indignation. &lsquo;You are not near enough to her for that!&rsquo; 
      he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not near enough to her for that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell between us. A crow perched upon an opened venetian and cawed
      lustily. For years afterward I never heard a crow caw without a sense of
      vain, distressing experiment. Dacres got up and began to walk about the
      room. I very soon put a stop to that. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t talk to a pendulum,&rsquo; I
      said, but I could not persuade him to sit down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Candidly,&rsquo; he said at length, &lsquo;do you think she would have me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I regret to say that I think she would. But you would not dream of asking
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? She is a dear girl,&rsquo; he responded inconsequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You could not possibly stand it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Tottenham delivered himself of this remarkable phrase: &lsquo;I could
      stand it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;as well as you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was far from being any joy in the irony with which I regarded him
      and under which I saw him gather up his resolution to go; nevertheless I
      did nothing to make it easy for him. I refrained from imparting my private
      conviction that Cecily would accept the first presentable substitute that
      appeared, although it was strong. I made no reference to my daughter&rsquo;s
      large fund of philosophy and small balance of sentiment. I did not even&mdash;though
      this was reprehensible&mdash;confess the test, the test of quality in
      these ten days with the marble archives of the Moguls, which I had almost
      wantonly suggested, which he had so unconsciously accepted, so
      disastrously applied. I gave him quite fifteen minutes of his bad quarter
      of an hour, and when it was over I wrote truthfully but furiously to
      John....
    </p>
    <p>
      That was ten years ago. We have since attained the shades of retirement,
      and our daughter is still with us when she is not with Aunt Emma and Aunt
      Alice&mdash;grandmamma has passed away. Mr. Tottenham&rsquo;s dumb departure
      that day in February&mdash;it was the year John got his C.B.&mdash;was
      followed, I am thankful to say, by none of the symptoms of unrequited
      affection on Cecily&rsquo;s part. Not for ten minutes, so far as I was aware,
      was she the maid forlorn. I think her self-respect was of too robust a
      character, thanks to the Misses Farnham. Still less, of course, had she
      any reproaches to serve upon her mother, although for a long time I
      thought I detected&mdash;or was it my guilty conscience?&mdash;a spark of
      shrewdness in the glance she bent upon me when the talk was of Mr.
      Tottenham and the probabilities of his return to Agra. So well did she
      sustain her experience, or so little did she feel it, that I believe the
      impression went abroad that Dacres had been sent disconsolate away. One
      astonishing conversation I had with her some six months later, which
      turned upon the point of a particularly desirable offer. She told me
      something then, without any sort of embarrassment, but quite lucidly and
      directly, that edified me much to hear. She said that while she was quite
      sure that Mr. Tottenham thought of her only as a friend&mdash;she had
      never had the least reason for any other impression&mdash;he had done her
      a service for which she could not thank him enough&mdash;in showing her
      what a husband might be. He had given her a standard; it might be high,
      but it was unalterable. She didn&rsquo;t know whether she could describe it, but
      Mr. Tottenham was different from the kind of man you seemed to meet in
      India. He had his own ways of looking at things, and he talked so well. He
      had given her an ideal, and she intended to profit by it. To know that men
      like Mr. Tottenham existed, and to marry any other kind would be an act of
      folly which she did not intend to commit. No, Major the Hon. Hugh Taverel
      did not come near it&mdash;very far short, indeed! He had talked to her
      during the whole of dinner the night before about jackal-hunting with a
      bobbery pack&mdash;not at all an elevated mind. Yes, he might be a very
      good fellow, but as a companion for life she was sure he would not be at
      all suitable. She would wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she has waited. I never thought she would, but she has. From time to
      time men have wished to take her from us, but the standard has been
      inexorable, and none of them have reached it. When Dacres married the
      charming American whom he caught like a butterfly upon her Eastern tour,
      Cecily sent them as a wedding present an alabaster model of the Taj, and I
      let her do it&mdash;the gift was so exquisitely appropriate. I suppose he
      never looks at it without being reminded that he didn&rsquo;t marry Miss
      Farnham, and I hope that he remembers that he owes it to Miss Farnham&rsquo;s
      mother. So much I think I might claim; it is really very little
      considering what it stands for. Cecily is permanently with us&mdash;I
      believe she considers herself an intimate. I am very reasonable about
      lending her to her aunts, but she takes no sort of advantage of my
      liberality; she says she knows her duty is at home. She is growing into a
      firm and solid English maiden lady, with a good colour and great decision
      of character. That she always had.
    </p>
    <p>
      I point out to John, when she takes our crumpets away from us, that she
      gets it from him. I could never take away anybody&rsquo;s crumpets, merely
      because they were indigestible, least of all my own parents&rsquo;. She has
      acquired a distinct affection for us, by some means best known to herself;
      but I should have no objection to that if she would not rearrange my
      bonnet-strings. That is a fond liberty to which I take exception; but it
      is one thing to take exception and another to express it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our daughter is with us, permanently with us. She declares that she
      intends to be the prop of our declining years; she makes the statement
      often, and always as if it were humorous. Nevertheless I sometimes notice
      a spirit of inquiry, a note of investigation in her encounters with the
      opposite sex that suggests an expectation not yet extinct that another and
      perhaps a more appreciative Dacres Tottenham may flash across her field of
      vision&mdash;alas, how improbable! Myself I can not imagine why she should
      wish it; I have grown in my old age into a perfect horror of cultivated
      young men; but if such a person should by a miracle at any time appear, I
      think it is extremely improbable that I will interfere on his behalf.

      Chapter 2.I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To understand how we prized him, Dora Harris and I, it is necessary to
      know Simla. I suppose people think of that place, if they ever do think of
      it, as an agreeable retreat in the wilds of the Himalayas where deodars
      and scandals grow, and where the Viceroy if he likes may take off his
      decorations and go about in flannels. I know how useless it would be to
      try to give a more faithful impression, and I will hold back from the
      attempt as far as I can. Besides, my little story is itself an explanation
      of Simla. Ingersoll Armour might have appeared almost anywhere else
      without making social history. He came and bloomed among us in the
      wilderness, and such and such things happened. It sounds too rude a
      generalization to say that Simla is a wilderness; I hasten to add that it
      is a waste as highly cultivated as you like, producing many things more
      admirable than Ingersoll Armour. Still he bloomed there conspicuously
      alone. Perhaps there would have been nothing to tell if we had not tried
      to gather him. That was wrong; Nature in Simla expects you to be content
      with cocked hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are artists almost everywhere and people who paint even in the
      Himalayas, though Miss Harris and I in our superior way went yearly to the
      Simla Fine Arts Exhibition chiefly to amuse ourselves by scoffing. It was
      easy to say clever things about the poor little exhibits; and one was
      grateful to the show on this account, for nothing is more depressing east
      of Suez than the absence of provocation to say clever things. There one
      afternoon in May as we marched about enjoying ourselves, we came upon
      Ingersoll Armour, not in the flesh, but in half a dozen studies hanging in
      the least conspicuous corner and quite the worst light in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh, what?&rsquo; said I, and Dora exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I SAY!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sent out from home,&rsquo; I said, ever the oracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; replied Dora. &lsquo;Look, they are Indian subjects. SIMLA
      subjects,&rsquo; she went on, with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned up the catalogue. &lsquo;Ninety-seven, &ldquo;Kasumti Bazaar&rdquo;; ninety-eight,
      &ldquo;Clouds on the Chor&rdquo;; ninety-nine, &ldquo;The House of a Friend&rdquo;&mdash;Lord,
      what apricot blossoms! Yes, they&rsquo;re all Simla.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake,&rsquo; said Dora, &lsquo;who painted them? You&rsquo;ve got the
      catalogue!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I. Armour,&rdquo;&rsquo; I read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I. Armour,&rdquo;&rsquo; she repeated, and we looked at each other, saying in plain
      silence that to the small world of Simla I. Armour was unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on Government House list, I venture to believe,&rsquo; said Dora. That in
      itself may show to what depths we sink. Yet it was a trenchant and a
      reasonable speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be a newcomer,&rsquo; I suggested, but she shook her head. &lsquo;All
      newcomers call upon us,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;There in the middle of the Mall we
      escape none of them. He isn&rsquo;t a calling person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you say &ldquo;he&rdquo;? You are very confident with your pronouns. There&rsquo;s a
      delicacy of feeling&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which exactly does not suggest a women. We are undermined by delicacy of
      feeling; we&rsquo;re not strong enough to express it with brushes. A man can
      make it a quality, a decorative characteristic, and so we see it. With a
      woman it&rsquo;s everything&mdash;all over the place&mdash;and of no effect. Oh,
      I assure you, I. Armour is a man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who shall stand against you! Let him be a man. He has taste.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Taste!&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Harris, violently, and from the corners of her
      mouth I gathered that I had said one of those things which she would store
      up and produce to prove that I was not, for all my pretensions, a person
      of the truest feeling. &lsquo;He sees things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s an intensity,&rsquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s better. Yes, an intensity. A perfect passion of colour. Look at
      that.&rsquo; She indicated a patch of hillsides perhaps six inches by four, in
      which the light seemed to come and go as it does in a sapphire.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood and gazed. It was a tremendous thing; only half a dozen studies
      with feeling and knowledge in them, but there in that remote fastness
      thrice barred against the arts a tremendous thing, a banquet for our
      famished eyes. What they would have said to us in London is a different
      matter, and how good they really were I do not find the courage to
      pronounce, but they had merit enough to prick our sense of beauty
      delightfully where we found them&mdash;oh, they were good!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven send it isn&rsquo;t a Tommy,&rsquo; said Dora, with a falling countenance.
      &lsquo;There is something absolutely inaccessible about a Tommy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could it be?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, there are some inspired ones. But it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;that&rsquo;s French
      technique. It&rsquo;s an Englishman or an American who has worked in Paris. What
      in the name of fortune is he doing here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;we have had them, you know. Val Prinsep came out at the
      time of the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remember that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of history,&rsquo; I said, evasively, &lsquo;and Edwin Weeks travelled
      through India not so many years ago. I saw his studio in Paris afterward.
      Between his own canvases and Ahmedabad balconies and Delhi embroideries
      and Burmese Buddhas and other things he seemed to have carried off the
      whole place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But they don&rsquo;t come up here ever. They come in the cold weather, and as
      they can get plenty of snow and ice at home, they stay down in the plains
      with the palm-trees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precisely; they do,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And besides,&rsquo; Dora went on, with increasing excitement, &lsquo;this isn&rsquo;t a
      master. You see, he doesn&rsquo;t send a single picture&mdash;only these tiny
      things. And there&rsquo;s a certain tentativeness&rsquo;&mdash;Miss Harris, her
      parasol handle pressed against her lips, looked at me with an eagerness
      that was a pleasure to look at in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A certain weakness, almost a lack of confidence, in the drawing,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does that signify?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, immaturity, of course&mdash;not enough discipline.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a student. Not that it amounts to a defect, you know&rsquo;&mdash;she was
      as jealous already as if she possessed the things&mdash;&lsquo;only a sign to
      read by. I should be grateful for more signs. Why should a student come to
      Simla?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To teach, perhaps,&rsquo; I suggested. Naturally one sought only among reasons
      of utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the Kensington person who teaches. When they have worked in the
      ateliers and learned as much as this they never do. They paint fans and
      menu cards, and starve, but they don&rsquo;t teach.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William Lamb, Member of Council for the Department of Finance, was
      borne by the stream to our sides. The simile will hardly stand
      conscientious examination, for the stream was a thin one and did no more
      than trickle past, while Sir William weighed fifteen stone, and was so
      eminent that it could never inconvenience him at its deepest. Dora
      detached her gaze from the pictures and turned her back upon them; I saw
      the measure of precaution. It was unavailing, however. &lsquo;What have we
      here?&rsquo; said Sir William. Dora removed her person from his line of vision,
      and he saw what we had there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The work of a friend of yours?&rsquo; Sir William was spoken of as a &lsquo;cautious&rsquo; 
      man. He had risen to his present distinction on stepping-stones of
      mistakes he conspicuously had not made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Dora, &lsquo;we were wondering who the artist could be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William looked at the studies, and had a happy thought. &lsquo;If you ask
      me, I should say a child of ten,&rsquo; he said. He was also known as a man of
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Harris had just remarked a certain immaturity,&rsquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; said Sir William, &lsquo;this isn&rsquo;t the Royal Academy, is it? I
      always say it&rsquo;s very good of people to send their things here at all. And
      some of them are not half bad&mdash;I should call this year&rsquo;s average very
      high indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you pleased with the picture that has taken your prize, Sir William?&rsquo; 
      asked Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have bought it.&rsquo; Sir William&rsquo;s chest underwent before our eyes an
      expansion of conscious virtue. Living is so expensive in Simla; the
      purchase of a merely decorative object takes almost the proportion of an
      act of religion, even by a Member of Council drawing four hundred pounds a
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First-rate it is, first-rate. Have you seen it? &ldquo;Our Camp in Tirah.&rdquo;
       Natives cooking in the foreground, fellows standing about smoking, and a
      whole pile of tinned stores dumped down in one corner, exactly as they
      would be, don&rsquo;t you know! Oh, I think the Committee made a very good
      choice indeed, a very good choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William moved on, and Dora was free to send me an expressive glance.
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just LIKE this place?&rsquo; she demanded. &lsquo;Let me see, the
      Viceroy&rsquo;s medal, the Society&rsquo;s silver medal, five prizes from Members of
      Council. Highly Commended&rsquo;s as thick as blackberries, and these perfectly
      fresh, original, admirable things completely ignored. What an absurd,
      impossible corner of the earth it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look very cross, you two,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sinclair, trailing past. &lsquo;Come
      and see the crazy china exhibit, all made of little bits, you know. They
      say the photograph frames are simply lovely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sinclair&rsquo;s invitation was not sincere. Miss Harris was able to answer
      it with a laugh and a wave. We remained beside the serious fact of
      exhibits 97-103.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are the judges this year?&rsquo; I asked, not that I did not know precisely
      who they were likely to be. There is a custom in these matters, and I had
      been part of Simla for eleven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora took the catalogue from my hand and turned its pages over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Cathcart, of course; the Private Secretary to the Viceroy would be on
      the Committee almost ex officio, wouldn&rsquo;t he? Impossible to conceive a
      Private Secretary to the Viceroy whose opinion would not be valuable upon
      any head. The member for Public Works&mdash;I suppose he can build
      bridges, or could once, therefore he can draw, or could once; besides,
      look at his precedence and his pay! General Haycock&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he head of
      the Ordnance Department? I can&rsquo;t think of any other reason for putting him
      on. Oh yes&mdash;he&rsquo;s a K.C.B., and he is inventing a way of taking
      coloured photographs. Mr. Tilley, the old gentleman that teaches
      elementary drawing to the little girls in the diocesan school, that&rsquo;s all
      right. And Mr. Jay, of course, because Mr. Jay&rsquo;s water-colours are the
      mainstay of the exhibition, and he must be given a chance of expressing
      his opinion of them.&rsquo; She handed me back the catalogue. &lsquo;I have never been
      really angry with them before,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you really angry now?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Furious,&rsquo; Dora replied, and indeed her face expressed indignation. Its
      lines were quite tense, and a spark shone oddly in the middle of the eyes.
      One could not credit her with beauty, but as her lady friends were fond of
      saying, there was something &lsquo;more&rsquo; in her face. I saw a good deal more at
      this moment, and it gave me pleasure, as all her feelings did when they
      came out like that. I hasten to add that she was not unpleasing; her
      features had a symmetry and a mobility, and her eyes could take any
      transient charm they chose to endow themselves with; though there were
      moments when she compared very badly with the other young ladies of Simla
      with their high spirits and their pretty complexions, very badly indeed.
      Those were occasions when the gay monotony of the place pressed, I
      imagine, a little heavily upon her, and the dullness she felt translated
      itself in her expression. But she was by no means unpleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go and see Lady Pilkey&rsquo;s picture,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the use?&rsquo; said Dora. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a landscape in oils&mdash;a view of
      the Himalayas, near Narkanda. There are the snows in the background, very
      thin and visionary through a gap in the trees, and two hills, one hill on
      each side. Dark green trees, pine-trees, with a dead one in the left
      foreground covered with a brilliant red creeper. Right foreground occupied
      by a mountain path and a solitary native figure with its back turned.
      Society&rsquo;s silver medal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When did you see it?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen it&mdash;this year. But I saw the one she sent last, and
      the one the year before that. You can trust my memory, really.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m dining there tonight. I must have an original
      impression.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Congratulate her on the warm blaze of colour in the foreground. It&rsquo;s
      perfectly safe,&rsquo; urged Miss Harris, but I felt compelled to go myself to
      see lady Pilkey&rsquo;s landscape. When I returned I found her still sitting in
      grave absorption before the studies that had taken us so by surprise. Her
      face was full of a soft new light; I had never before seen the spring
      touched in her that could flood it like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were very nearly right,&rsquo; I announced; &lsquo;but the blaze of colour was in
      the middle distance, and there was a torrent in the foreground that quite
      put it out. And the picture does take the Society&rsquo;s silver medal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can not decide,&rsquo; she replied without looking at me, &lsquo;between the
      Kattiawar fair thing and those hills in the rain. I can only have one&mdash;father
      won&rsquo;t hear of more than one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can have two,&rsquo; I said bluntly, so deeply interested I was in the
      effect the things had on her. &lsquo;And I will have a third for myself. I can&rsquo;t
      withstand those apricot-trees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought there was moisture in the eyes she turned upon me, an unusual
      thing&mdash;a most unusual thing&mdash;in Dora Harris; but she winked it
      back, if it was there, too quickly for any certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a dear,&rsquo; she said. Once or twice before she had called me a dear.
      It reminded me, as nothing else ever did, that I was a contemporary of her
      father&rsquo;s. It is a feeble confession, but I have known myself refrain from
      doing occasional agreeable things apprehending that she might call me a
      dear.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dora had been out three seasons when these things happened. I remember
      sharing Edward Harris&rsquo;s anxiety in no slight degree as to how the
      situation would resolve itself when she came, the situation consisting so
      considerably in his eyes of the second Mrs. Harris, who had complicated it
      further with three little red-cheeked boys, all of the age to be led about
      the station on very small ponies, and not under any circumstances to be
      allowed in the drawing-room when one went to tea with their mother. No
      one, except perhaps poor Ted himself, was more interested than I to
      observe how the situation did resolve itself, in the decision of Mrs.
      Harris that the boys, the two eldest at least, must positively begin the
      race for the competitive examinations of the future without further delay,
      and that she must as positively be domiciled in England &lsquo;to be near&rsquo; them,
      at all events until they had well made the start. I should have been glad
      to see them ride their ponies up and down the Mall a bit longer, poor
      little chaps; they were still very cherubic to be invited to take a view
      of competitive examinations, however distant; but Mrs. Harris&rsquo;s conviction
      was not to be overcome. So they went home to begin, and she went with
      them, leaving Dora in possession of her father, her father&rsquo;s house, his
      pay, his precedence, and all that was his. Not that I would suggest any
      friction; I am convinced that there was nothing like that&mdash;at least,
      nothing that met the eye, or the ear. Dora adored the three little boys
      and was extremely kind to their mother. She regarded this lady, I have
      reason to believe, with the greatest indulgence, and behaved towards her
      with the greatest consideration; I mean she had unerring intuitions as to
      just when, on afternoons when Mrs. Harris was at home from dusk till
      dinner, she should be dying for a walk. One could imagine her looking with
      her grey eyes at dear mamma&rsquo;s horizon and deciding that papa was certainly
      not enough to fill it by himself, deciding at the same time that he was
      never likely to be ousted there, only accompanied, in a less important and
      entirely innocent degree. It may be surprising that any one should fly
      from so broad-minded a step-daughter; but the happy family party lasted a
      bare three months. I think Mrs. Harris had a perception&mdash;she was the
      kind of woman who arrived obscurely at very correct conclusions&mdash;that
      she was contributing to her step-daughter&rsquo;s amusement in a manner which
      her most benevolent intentions had not contemplated, and she was not by
      any means the little person to go on doing that indefinitely, perhaps
      increasingly. Besides, it was in the natural order of things that Dora
      should marry, and Mrs. Harris doubtless foresaw a comfortable return for
      herself in the course of a year or two, when the usual promising junior in
      &lsquo;the Department&rsquo; should gild his own prospects and promote the general
      well-being by acquiring its head for a father-in-law. Things always worked
      out if you gave them time. How much time you ought to give them was
      doubtless by now a pretty constant query with the little lady in her foggy
      exile; for two years had already passed and Dora had found no connection
      with any young man of the Department more permanent than those prescribed
      at dinners and at dances. It is doubtful, indeed, if she had had the
      opportunity. There was no absolute means of knowing; but if offers were
      made they never transpired, and Mrs. Harris, far away in England,
      nourished a certainty that they never were made. Speaking with her
      intimate knowledge of the sex she declared that Dora frightened the men,
      that her cleverness was of a kind to paralyze any sentiment of the sort
      that might be expected. It depended upon Mrs. Harris&rsquo;s humour whether this
      was Dora&rsquo;s misfortune or her crime. She, Dora, never frightened me, and by
      the time her cleverness dawned upon me, my sentiment about her had become
      too robust to be paralyzed. On the contrary, the agreeable stimulus it
      gave me was one of the things I counted most valuable in my life out
      there. It hardly mattered, however, that I should confess this; I was not
      a young man in Harris&rsquo;s department. I had a department of my own; and
      Dora, though she frisked with me gloriously and bullied continually, must
      ever have been aware of the formidable fact that I joined the Service two
      years before Edward Harris did. The daughter of three generations of
      bureaucrats was not likely to forget that at one time her father had been
      junior to me in the same office, though in the course of time and the
      march of opportunity he had his own show now, and we nodded to each other
      on the Mall with an equal sense of the divine right of secretaries. It may
      seem irrelevant, but I feel compelled to explain here that I had remained
      a bachelor while Harris had married twice, and that I had kept up my
      cricket, while Harris had let his figure take all the soft curves of
      middle age. Nevertheless the fact remained. Sometimes I fancied it gave a
      certain piquancy to my relations with his daughter, but I could never
      believe that the laugh was on my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we met at dinner-parties, it would be sometimes Edward Harris and
      sometimes myself who would take the dullest and stoutest woman down. If
      she fell to him, the next in precedence was bestowed upon me, and there
      might not be a pin to choose between them for phlegm and inflation. It is
      a preposterous mistake to suppose that the married ladies of Simla are in
      the majority brilliant and fascinating creatures, who say things in French
      for greater convenience, and lead a man on. After fifteen years I am ready
      to swear that I have been led on to nothing more compromising than a
      subscription to the Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association, though no one
      could have been more docile or more intelligent. During one viceroyalty of
      happy memory half a dozen clever and amusing men and women came together
      in Simla&mdash;it was a mere fortuitous occurrence, aided by a joyous
      ruler who hated being bored as none before or ever since have hated it&mdash;and
      the place has lived socially upon the reputation of that meteoric term
      ever since. Whereas the domestic virtues are no more deeply rooted
      anywhere than under the deodars; nor could any one, I hasten to add,
      chronicle the fact with more profound satisfaction than myself. A
      dinner-party, however, is not a favourable setting for the domestic
      virtues; it does them so little justice that one could sometimes almost
      wish them left at home, and I was talking of Simla dinner-parties, where I
      have encountered so many. How often have I been consulted as to the best
      school for boys in England, or instructed as to how much I should let my
      man charge me for shoe-blacking, or advised as to the most effectual way
      of preventing the butler from stealing my cheroots, while Dora Harris,
      remote as a star, talked to a cavalry subaltern about wind-galls and
      splints! At these moments I felt my seniority bitterly; to give Dora to a
      cavalry subaltern was such plain waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an infinite pleasure to know any one as well as I seemed to know
      Dora Harris. She, I believe, held no one else upon the same terms of
      intimacy, though she found women, of course, with whom she fluttered and
      embraced; and while there were, naturally, men with whom I exchanged the
      time o&rsquo;day in terms more or less cordial, I am certain that I kept all my
      closest thoughts for her. It is necessary again to know Simla to
      understand how our friendship was gilded by the consideration that it was
      on both sides perfectly spontaneous. Social life in the poor little place
      is almost a pure farce with the number of its dictated, prompted
      intimacies, not controlled by general laws of expediency as at home, but
      each on its own basis of hope and expectancy, broadly and ludicrously
      obvious as a case by itself. There is a conspiracy of stupidity about it,
      for we are all in the same hat, every one of us; there is none so exalted
      that he does not urgently want a post that somebody else can give him. So
      we continue to exchange our depreciated smiles, and only privately admit
      that the person who most desires to be agreeable to us is the person whom
      we regard with the greatest suspicion. As between Dora Harris and myself
      there could be, naturally, no ax to grind. We amused ourselves by looking
      on penetratingly but tolerantly at the grinding of other people&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a very principal bond between us, that uncompromising clearness
      with which we looked at the place we lived in, and on the testimony of
      which we were so certain that we didn&rsquo;t like it. The women were nearly all
      so much in heaven in Simla, the men so well satisfied to be there too, at
      the top of the tree, that our dissatisfaction gave us to one another the
      merit of originality, almost proved in one another a superior mind. It was
      not that either of us would have preferred to grill out our days in the
      plains; we always had a saving clause for the climate, the altitude, the
      scenery; it was Simla intrinsic, Simla as its other conditions made it,
      with which we found such liberal fault. Again I should have to explain
      Simla, at the length of an essay at least, to justify our condemnation.
      This difficulty confronts me everywhere. I must ask you instead to imagine
      a small colony of superior&mdash;very superior&mdash;officials, of British
      origin and traditions, set on the top of a hill, years and miles away from
      literature, music, pictures, politics, existing like a harem on the gossip
      of the Viceroy&rsquo;s intentions, and depending for amusement on tennis and
      bumble-puppy, and then consider, you yourself, whether you are the sort of
      person to be unquestionably happy there. If you see no reason to the
      contrary, pray do not go on. There were times when Dora declared that she
      couldn&rsquo;t breathe for want of an atmosphere, and times when I looked round
      and groaned at the cheerful congratulatory aridity in every man&rsquo;s eye&mdash;men
      who had done things at Oxford in my own year, and come out like me to be
      mummified into a last state like this. Thank Heaven, there was never any
      cheerful congratulation in my eye; one could always put there, when the
      thought inspired it, a saving spark of rank ingratitude instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if we had the most desirable things&mdash;roses, cool airs, far
      snowy ranges&mdash;to build what we like with, and we built Simla&mdash;altitude,
      7,000, population 2,500, headquarters of the Government of India during
      the summer months. An ark it was, of course; an ark of refuge from the
      horrible heat that surged below, and I wondered as I climbed the steeps of
      Summer Hill in search of I. Armour&rsquo;s inaccessible address, whether he was
      to be the dove bearing beautiful testimony of a world coming nearer. I
      rejected the simile, however, as over-sanguine; we had been too long
      abandoned on our Ararat.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A dog of no sort of caste stood in the veranda and barked at me
      offensively. I picked up a stone, and he vanished like the dog of a dream
      into the house. It was such a small house that it wasn&rsquo;t on the municipal
      map at all: it looked as if someone had built it for amusement with
      anything that was lying about. Nevertheless, it had a name, it was called
      Amy Villa, freshly painted in white letters on a shiny black board, and
      nailed against the nearest tree in the orthodox Simla fashion. It looked
      as if the owner of the place had named it as a duty towards his tenant,
      the board was so new, and in that case the reflection presented itself
      that the tenant might have cooperated to call it something else. It was
      disconcerting somehow to find that our dove had perched, even temporarily,
      in Amy Villa. Nor was it soothing to discover that the small white object
      stuck in the corner of the board was Mr. Ingersoll Armour&rsquo;s card.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Simla we do not stick our cards about in that way at the mercy of the
      wind and the weather; we paint our names neatly under the names of our
      houses with &lsquo;I.C.S.&rsquo; for Indian Civil Service, or &lsquo;P.W.D.&rsquo; for Public
      Works Department, or whatever designation we are entitled to immediately
      after, so that there can be no mistake. This strikes newcomers sometimes
      as a little professional, especially when a hand accompanies, pointing;
      but it is the only possible way where there are no streets and no numbers,
      but where houses are dropped about a hilltop as if they had fallen from a
      pepper-pot. In sticking his card out like that Mr. Armour seemed to
      imagine himself au quatrieme or au cinquieme somewhere on the south side
      of the Seine; it betrayed rather a ridiculous lack of conformity. He was
      high enough up, however, to give any illusion; I had to stop to find the
      wind to announce myself. There was nobody else to do it if I except the
      dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked into the veranda and shouted. Then I saw that one end of it was
      partly glazed off, and inside sat a young man in his shirt-sleeves with
      his back to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply he called out, &lsquo;That you, Rosario?&rsquo; and I stood silent, taken
      somewhat aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one Rosario in Simla, and he was a subordinate in my own
      office. Again the hateful need to explain. Between subordinate clerks and
      officials in Simla there is a greater gulf fixed than was ever imagined in
      parable. Besides, Rosario had a plain strain of what we call &lsquo;the country&rsquo; 
      in him, a plain strain, that is, of the colour of the country. It was
      certainly the first time in my official career that I had been mistaken
      for Rosario.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armour turned round and saw me&mdash;that I was a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up at once. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I thought it was Rosario.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;my name is Philips. May I ask whether you were
      expecting Mr. Rosario? I can come again, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Sit down. He may drop in or he may not&mdash;I
      rather thought he would today. It&rsquo;s a pull up, isn&rsquo;t it, from the Mall?
      Have a whisky and soda.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood on the threshold spellbound. It was just the smell that bound me,
      the good old smell of oil paints and turpentine and mediums and varnish
      and new canvas that you never by any chance put your nose into in any part
      of Asia. It carried me back twenty years to old haunts, old friends, old
      joys, ideals, theories. Ah, to be young and have a temperament! For I had
      one then&mdash;that instant in Armour&rsquo;s veranda proved it to me forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No thanks,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;ll just have the smell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow knew at once that I liked the smell. &lsquo;Well, have a chair,
      anyhow,&rsquo; he said, and took one himself and sat down opposite me, letting
      his lean brown hands fall between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mind,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if for a minute I sit still and look round?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t brought much,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I left pretty near everything in
      Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have brought a world.&rsquo; Then after a moment, &lsquo;Did you do that?&rsquo; I
      asked, nodding towards a canvas tacked against the wall. It was the head
      of a half-veiled Arab woman turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture was in the turning away, and the shadow the head-covering made
      over the cheek and lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord, no! That&rsquo;s Dagnan Bouveret. I used to take my things to him, and
      one day he gave me that. You have an eye,&rsquo; he added, but without
      patronage. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the best thing I&rsquo;ve got.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt the warmth of an old thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once upon a time,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I was allowed to have an eye.&rsquo; The wine,
      untasted all those years, went to my head. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a vigorous bit above,&rsquo; 
      I continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well! It isn&rsquo;t really up to much, you know. It&rsquo;s Rosario&rsquo;s. He
      photographs mostly, but he has a notion of colour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really?&rsquo; said I, thinking with regard to my eye that the sun of that
      atrocious country had put it out. &lsquo;I expect I&rsquo;ve lost it,&rsquo; I said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your eye? Oh, you&rsquo;ll easily get a fresh one. Do you go home for the
      exhibitions?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did once,&rsquo; I confessed. &lsquo;My first leave. A kind of paralysis overtakes
      one here. Last time I went for the grouse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at me with his light clear eyes as if for the first time he
      encountered a difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a magnificent country for painting,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not for pictures,&rsquo; I rejoined. He paid no attention, staring at the
      ground and twisting one end of his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sun on those old marble tombs&mdash;broad sun and sand&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean somewhere about Delhi.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get anywhere near it.&rsquo; He was not at that moment anywhere near
      me. &lsquo;But I have thought out a trick or two&mdash;I mean to have another go
      when it cools off again down there.&rsquo; He returned with a smile, and I saw
      how delicate his face was. The smile turned down with a little gentle
      mockery in its lines. I had seen that particular smile only on the faces
      of one or two beautiful women. It had a borrowed air upon a man, like a
      tiara or an earring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s plenty to paint,&rsquo; he said, looking at me with an air of friendly
      speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, yes. And it has never been done. We are sure it has never been
      done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;We&rdquo;&mdash;you mean people generally?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. I mean Miss Harris, Miss Harris and myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your daughter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Philips,&rsquo; I reminded him pleasantly, remembering that the
      intelligence of clever people is often limited to a single art. &lsquo;Miss
      Harris is the daughter of Mr. Edward Harris, Secretary of the Government
      of India in the Legislative Department. She is fond of pictures. We have a
      good many tastes in common. We have always suspected that India had never
      been painted, and when we saw your things at the Town Hall we knew it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His queer eyes dilated, and he blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s only one interpretation. It all depends on what a
      fellow sees. No fellow can see everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Till you came,&rsquo; I insisted, &lsquo;nobody had seen anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, but I could read in his face that this was not news to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is mainly what I came up to tell you,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;to beg that you
      will go on and on. To hope that you will stay a long time and do a great
      deal. It is such an extraordinary chance that any one should turn up who
      can say what the country really means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stuck his hands in his pockets with a restive movement. &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t make
      me feel responsible,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I hate that;&rsquo; and then suddenly he
      remembered his manners. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s certainly nice of you to think so,&rsquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something a little unusual in his inflection which led me to ask
      at this point whether he was an American, and to discover that he came
      from somewhere in Wisconsin, not directly, but by way of a few years in
      London and Paris. This accounted in a way for the effect of freedom in any
      fortune about him for which I already liked him, and perhaps partly for
      the look of unembarrassed inquiry and experiment which sat so lightly in
      his unlined face. He came, one realized, out of the fermentation of new
      conditions; he never could have been the product of our limits and systems
      and classes in England. His surroundings, his &lsquo;things,&rsquo; as he called them,
      were as old as the sense of beauty, but he seemed simply to have put them
      where he could see them, there was no pose in their arrangement. They were
      all good, and his delight in them was plain; but he was evidently in no
      sense a connoisseur beyond that of natural instinct. Some of those he had
      picked up in India I could tell him about, but I had no impression that he
      would remember what I said. There was one Bokhara tapestry I examined with
      a good deal of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;they told me I shouldn&rsquo;t get anything as good as that out
      here, so I brought it,&rsquo; but I had to explain to him why it was anomalous
      that this should be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It came a good many miles over desert from somewhere,&rsquo; he remarked, as I
      made a note of inquiry as to the present direction of trade in woven goods
      from Persia, &lsquo;I had to pound it for a week to get the dust out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent an hour looking over work he had done down in the plains, and
      then I took my leave. It did not occur to me at the moment to ask Armour
      to come to the club or to offer to do anything for him; all the
      hospitality, all that was worth offering seemed so much more at his
      disposition than at mine. I only asked if I might come again, mentioning
      somewhat shyly that I must have the opportunity of adding, at my leisure,
      to those of his pictures that were already mine by transaction with the
      secretary of the Art Exhibition. I left him so astonished that this had
      happened, so plainly pleased, that I was certain he had never sold
      anything before in his life. This impression gave me the uplifted joy of a
      discoverer to add to the satisfactions I had already drawn from the
      afternoon; and I almost bounded down the hill to the Mall. I left the pi
      dog barking in the veranda, and I met Mr. Rosario coming up, but in my
      unusual elation I hardly paused to consider either of them further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mare and her groom were waiting on the Mall, and it was only when I
      got on her back that the consciousness visited me of something forgotten.
      It was my mission&mdash;to propose to take Armour, if he were &lsquo;possible,&rsquo; 
      to call upon the Harrises. Oh, well, he was possible enough; I supposed he
      possessed a coat, though he hadn&rsquo;t been wearing it; and I could arrange it
      by letter. Meanwhile, as was only fair, I turned the mare in the direction
      of the drawing-room where I had reason to believe that Miss Dora Harris
      was quenching her impatience in tea.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The very next morning I met Armour on my way to the office. He was ambling
      along on the leanest and most ill-groomed of bazaar ponies, and he wore a
      bowler. In Simla sun hats are admissible, straw hats are presentable, and
      soft felt hats are superior, but you must not wear a bowler. I might
      almost say that if one&rsquo;s glance falls upon a bowler, one hardly looks
      further; the expectation of finding an acquaintance under it is so vain.
      In this instance, I did look further, fortunately, though in doing so I
      was compelled to notice that the bowler was not lifted in answer to my
      salutation. Of no importance in itself, of course, but betraying in Armour
      a certain lack of observation. I felt the Departmental Head crumble in me,
      however, as I recognized him, and I pulled the mare up in a manner which
      she plainly resented. It was my opportunity to do cautiously and
      delicately what I had omitted the afternoon before; but my recollection is
      that I was very clumsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said something about the dust, and he said something about the glare,
      and then I could think of nothing better than to ask him if he wouldn&rsquo;t
      like to meet a few Simla people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I know lots of people, thanks,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s kind of you to think
      of it, all the same, but I&rsquo;ve got any amount of friends here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of Mr. Rosario, and stood, or sat confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mare fidgeted; I knocked a beast of a fly off her, and so gained time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is my second season up here, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your second season!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;Where on earth have you been hiding?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t exhibit last year, you see. I&rsquo;d heard it was a kind of a
      toy show, so I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t. I think now that was foolish. But I got
      to know quite a number of families.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am sure there are numbers that you haven&rsquo;t met,&rsquo; I urged,&rsquo; or I
      should have heard of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at me with a slight flush. &lsquo;If you mean society people,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care about that kind of thing, Mr. Philips. I&rsquo;m not adapted
      to it, and I don&rsquo;t want to be. If any one offered to introduce me to the
      Viceroy, I would ask to be excused.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the Viceroy,&rsquo; I responded, disrespectfully, &lsquo;is neither here nor
      there. But there are some people, friends of my own, who would like very
      much to meet you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the name of Harris?&rsquo; he asked. I was too amazed to do anything but
      nod. By the name of Harris! The Secretary of the Government of India in
      the Legislative Department! The expression, not used as an invocation, was
      inexcusable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember you mentioned them yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a father and daughter. Miss Harris is very
      artistic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded, as well it might, at the word. &lsquo;Does she paint?&rsquo; he
      asked, so apprehensively that I could not forbear a smile at Dora&rsquo;s
      expense. I could assure him that she did not paint, that she had not
      painted, at all events, for years, and presently I found myself in the
      ridiculous position of using argument to bring a young man to the
      Harrises. In the end I prevailed, I know, out of sheer good nature on
      Armour&rsquo;s part; he was as innocent as a baby of any sense of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arranged it for the following Friday, but as luck would have it, His
      Excellency sent for me at the very hour; we met the messenger. I felt
      myself unlucky, but there was nothing for it but that Armour should go
      alone, which he did, with neither diffidence nor alacrity, but as if it
      were all in the day&rsquo;s work, and he had no reason to be disobliging.
    </p>
    <p>
      The files were very heavy during the succeeding fortnight, and the Viceroy
      quite importunate in his demand for my valuable suggestions. I was worked
      off my legs, and two or three times was obliged to deny myself in replying
      to notes from Dora suggesting Sunday breakfast or afternoon tea. Finally,
      I shook myself free; it was the day she wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must come&mdash;I can&rsquo;t keep it to myself any longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I half thought Armour would be there, but he wasn&rsquo;t; that is, he was
      absent corporeally, but the spirit and expression of him littered every
      convenient part. Some few things lay about that I had seen in the studio,
      to call it so, but most of the little wooden panels looked fresh, almost
      wet, and the air held strongly the fragrance of Armour&rsquo;s north veranda. In
      one corner there used to be a Madonna on a carved easel; the Madonna stood
      on the floor, and the easel with working pegs in it held an unfinished
      canvas. Dora sat in the midst with a distinct flush&mdash;she was inclined
      to be sallow&mdash;and made me welcome in terms touched with extravagance.
      She did not rush, however, upon the matter that was dyeing her cheeks, and
      I showed myself as little impetuous. She poured out the tea, and we sat
      there inhaling, as it were, the aroma of the thing, while keeping it
      consciously in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      I imagine there was no moment in the time I describe when we enjoyed
      Ingersoll Armour so much as at this one, when he lay in his nimbus half
      known and wholly suppressed, between us. There were later instances,
      perhaps, of deeper satisfaction, but they were more or less perplexed, and
      not unobscured by anxiety. That afternoon it was all to know and to be
      experienced, with just a delicious foretaste.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said something presently about Lady Pilkey&rsquo;s picnic on the morrow, to
      which we had both been bidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I call for you?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;You will ride, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks, but I&rsquo;ve cried off&mdash;I&rsquo;m going sketching.&rsquo; Her eyes plainly
      added, &lsquo;with Ingersoll Armour,&rsquo; but she as obviously shrank from the
      roughness of pitching him in that unconsidered way before us. For some
      reason I refrained from taking the cue. I would not lug him in either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a new accomplishment,&rsquo; was as much as I felt I could say with
      dignity, and she responded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt some slight indignation on Lady Pilkey&rsquo;s account. &lsquo;Do you really
      think you ought to do things like that at the eleventh hour?&rsquo; I asked, but
      Dora smiled at a glance, the hypocrisy out of my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does anything matter?&rsquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew perfectly well the standard by which nothing mattered, and there
      was no use, of course, in going on pretending that I did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I assured him that you didn&rsquo;t paint,&rsquo; I said, accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I had to&mdash;otherwise what was there to go upon? He would have
      been found only to be lost again. You did not contemplate that?&rsquo; Miss
      Harris inquired sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have thought it was the surest way of losing him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you should be so rude. He observes progress already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a view to claiming and holding him, would it be of any use,&rsquo; I
      asked, &lsquo;for me to start in oils?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Harris eyed me calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t seem the same thing somehow. I
      think you had better leave it to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;there is too much in it,&rsquo; and we smiled across
      the gulf of our friendly understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crossed to the mantelpiece and picked up one of the little wet panels.
      There was that in it which explained my friend&rsquo;s exultation much more
      plainly than words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is what I am to show him tomorrow,&rsquo; she exclaimed; &lsquo;I think I have
      done as he told me. I think it&rsquo;s pretty right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was pretty right or pretty wrong, she had taken in an
      extraordinary way an essence out of him. It wasn&rsquo;t of course good, but his
      feeling was reflected in it, at once so brilliantly and so profoundly that
      it was startling to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll be pleased?&rsquo; she asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he&rsquo;ll be astounded,&rsquo; I said, reserving the rest, and she cried in
      her pleasure, &lsquo;Oh, you dear man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you have taken possession of him,&rsquo; I went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, body and soul,&rsquo; Dora rejoined, and it must have been something like
      that. I could imagine how she did it; with what wiles of simplicity and
      candid good-fellowship she had drawn him to forgetfulness and response,
      and how presently his enthusiasm leaped up to answer hers and they had
      been caught altogether out of the plane of common relations, and he had
      gone away on that disgraceful bazaar pony with a ratified arrangement to
      return next day which had been almost taken for granted from the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess, though I had helped to bring it about, the situation didn&rsquo;t
      altogether please me. I did not dream of foolish dangers, but it seemed to
      take a little too much for granted; I found myself inwardly demanding
      whether, after all, a vivid capacity to make colour conscious was a
      sufficient basis on which to bring to Edward Harris&rsquo;s house a young man
      about whom we knew nothing whatever else. An instant&rsquo;s regard showed the
      scruple fraudulent, it fled before the rush of pleasure with which I gazed
      at the tokens he had left behind him. I fell back on my wonder, which was
      great, that Dora should have possessed the technique necessary to take him
      at a point where he could give her so much that was valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; she said when I uttered it, &lsquo;you know I made the experiment! I
      found out in South Kensington&mdash;you can learn that much there&mdash;that
      I never would be able to paint well enough to make it worth while. So I
      dropped it and took a more general line towards life. But I find it very
      easy to imagine myself dedicated to that particular one again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You never told me,&rsquo; I said. Why had I been shut out of that experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you now,&rsquo; Dora replied, absently, &lsquo;when I am able to offer you the
      fact with illustrations.&rsquo; She laughed and dropped a still illuminated face
      in the palm of her hand. &lsquo;He has wonderfully revived me,&rsquo; she declared. &lsquo;I
      could throw, honestly, the whole of Simla overboard for this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I urged, feeling, suddenly, an integral part of Simla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no&mdash;what end would be served? But I don&rsquo;t care who knows,&rsquo; she
      went on with a rush, &lsquo;that in all life this is what I like best, and
      people like Mr. Armour are the people I value most. Heavens, how few of
      them there are! And wherever they go how the air clears up round them! It
      makes me quite ill to think of the life we lead here&mdash;the poverty of
      it, the preposterous dullness of it....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake,&rsquo; I said, obscurely irritated, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t quote the
      bishop. The life holds whatever we put into it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For other people it does, and for us it holds what other people put into
      it,&rsquo; she retorted. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you think it&rsquo;s adequately filled
      with gold lace and truffles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I defend it?&rsquo; I asked, not knowing indeed why. &lsquo;But it has
      perhaps a dignity, you know. Ah, you are too fresh from your baptism,&rsquo; I
      continued, as she shook her head and went to the piano. The quality,
      whatever it was, that the last fortnight had generated in her, leaped from
      her fingers; she played with triumph, elation, intention. The notes seemed
      an outlet for the sense of beauty and for power to make it. I had never
      heard her play like that before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me to ask when she had done, how far, after a fortnight,
      she could throw light on Armour&rsquo;s aims and history, where he had come
      from, and the great query with which we first received him, what he could
      be doing in Simla. I gathered that she had learned practically nothing,
      and had hardly concerned herself to learn anything. What difference did it
      make? she asked me. Why should we inquire? Why tack a theory of origin to
      a phenomenon of joy? Let us say the wind brought him, and build him a
      temple. She was very whimsical up to the furthest stretch of what could
      possibly be considered tea-time. When I went away I saw her go again and
      sit down at the piano. In the veranda I remembered something, stopped, and
      went back. I had to go back. &lsquo;You did not tell me,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;when he was
      coming again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, tomorrow&mdash;tomorrow, of course,&rsquo; Dora paused to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      I resented, as I made my way to the Club, the weight of official duties
      that made it so impossible for me to keep at all closely in touch with
      this young man.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The art of the photographer usually arouses in me all that is splenetic,
      and I had not submitted myself to him for years before Dora made such a
      preposterous point of it&mdash;years in which, as I sadly explained to
      her, I might have submitted to the ordeal with much more &lsquo;pleasing&rsquo; 
      results. She had often insisted before, but I could never see that she
      made out a particularly good case for the operation until one afternoon
      when she showed me the bold counterfeit presentment of an Assistant
      Adjutant-General or some such person, much flattered as to features but
      singularly faithful in its reproduction of the straps and buttons
      attached. To my post also there belongs a uniform and a cocked hat
      sufficiently dramatic, but persons who serve the State primarily with the
      intelligence are supposed to have a mind above buttons; and when I decided
      that my photograph should compete with the Assistant Adjutant-General&rsquo;s, I
      gave him every sartorial advantage. I gathered that the offer, cabinet
      size, of this gentleman had been a spontaneous one; that certainly could
      not be said of mine. Most unwillingly I turned one morning into Kauffer&rsquo;s;
      and I can not now imagine why I did it, for emulation of the Assistant
      Adjutant-General was really not motive enough, unless it was with an
      instinct prepared to stumble upon matter germane in an absurd degree to
      this little history.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the honour to be subjected to the searching analysis of Mr. Kauffer
      himself. It was he who placed the chair and arranged the screw, he who
      fixed the angle of my chin and gently disposed my fingers on my knee. He
      gave me, I remember, a recent portrait of the Viceroy to fix my eye upon,
      doubtless with the purpose of inspiring my countenance with the devotion
      which would sit suitably upon one of His Excellency&rsquo;s slaves, and when it
      was all over he conducted me into another apartment in order that I might
      see the very latest viceregal group&mdash;a domestic one, including the
      Staff. The walls of the room contained what is usually there, the enlarged
      photograph, the coloured photograph, the amateur theatrical group, the
      group of His Excellency&rsquo;s Executive Council, the native dignitary with a
      diamond-tipped aigrette in the front of his turban. The copy in oils of
      some old Italian landscape, very black and yellow, also held its
      invariable place, and above it, very near the ceiling, a line of canvases
      which, had I not been led past them to inspect our ruler and his family,
      who sat transfixed on an easel in a resplendent frame, would probably have
      escaped my attention. I did proper homage to the easel, and then turned to
      those pictures. It was plain enough who had painted them. Armour&rsquo;s broad
      brush stood out all over them. They were mostly Indian sporting subjects,
      the incident a trifle elliptical, the drawing unequal, but the verve and
      feeling unmistakeable, and colour to send a quiver of glorious
      acquiescence through you like a pang. What astonished me was the number of
      them; there must have been at least a dozen, all the same size and shape,
      all hanging in a line of dazzling repetition. Here then was the
      explanation of Armour&rsquo;s seeming curious lack of output, and plain denial
      of the supposition that he spent the whole of his time in doing the little
      wooden &lsquo;pochade&rsquo; things whose sweetness and delicacy had so feasted our
      eyes elsewhere. It was part, no doubt, of his absolutely uncommercial
      nature&mdash;we had experienced together passages of the keenest
      embarrassment over my purchase of some of his studies&mdash;that he had
      not mentioned these more serious things exposed at Kauffer&rsquo;s; one had the
      feeling of coming unexpectedly on treasure left upon the wayside and
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; I said, at a standstill, &lsquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got some of Mr. Armour&rsquo;s
      work there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kauffer, with his hands behind him, made the sound which has its
      counterpart in a shrug. &lsquo;Yass,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I haf some of Mr. Armour&rsquo;s work
      there. This one, that one, all those remaining pictures&mdash;they are all
      the work of Mr. Armour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that any of his things were to be seen outside his studio,&rsquo; 
      I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So? They are to be seen here. There is no objection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should there be any objection?&rsquo; I demanded, slightly nettled. &lsquo;People
      must see them before they buy them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Buy them!&rsquo; Kauffer&rsquo;s tone was distinctly exasperated. &lsquo;Who will buy these
      pictures? Nobody. They are all, every one of them to REfuse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you know Mr. Armour well enough,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you should advise him to
      exhibit some of his local studies and sketches here. They might sell
      better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My words seemed unfortunately chosen. Mr. Kauffer turned an honest angry
      red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I not know Mr. Armour well enough&mdash;und better!&rsquo; he exclaimed.
      &lsquo;What this man wass doing when I in Paris find him oudt? Shtarving, mein
      Gott! I see his work. I see he paint a very goot horse, very goot animal
      subject. I bring him oudt on contract, five hundred rupees the monnth to
      paint for me, for my firm. Sir, it is now nine monnth. I am yoost four
      tousand five hundred rupees out of my pocket by this gentleman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable me to cope with this astonishing tale I asked Mr. Kauffer for a
      chair, which he obligingly gave me, and begged that he also would be
      seated. The files at my office were my business, and this was not, but no
      matter of Imperial concern seemed at the moment half so urgently to
      require probing. &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that is an unusual piece of enterprise
      for a photographic firm to employ an artist to paint on a salary. I don&rsquo;t
      know even a regular dealer who does it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kauffer at once and frankly explained. It was unusual and entirely out
      of the regular line of business. It was, in fact, one of the exceptional
      forms of enterprise inspired in this country by the native prince. We who
      had to treat with the native prince solely on lofty political lines were
      hardly likely to remember how largely he bulked in the humbler relations
      of trade; but there was more than one Calcutta establishment, Mr. Kauffer
      declared, that would be obliged to put up its shutters without this
      inconstant and difficult, but liberal customer. I waited with impatience.
      I could not for the life of me see Armour&rsquo;s connection with the native
      prince, who is seldom a patron of the arts for their own sakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you could not depend on the Indian nobility to buy
      landscapes. They never do. I know of only one distinguished exception, and
      he lives a thousand miles from here, in Bengal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not landscape,&rsquo; returned Mr. Kauffer; &lsquo;but that Indian nobleman will
      buy his portrait. We send our own man&mdash;photographic artist&mdash;to
      his State, and he photograph the Chief and his arab, the Chief and his
      Prime Minister, the Chief in his durbar, palace, gardens, stables&mdash;everything.
      Presently the Chief goes on a big shoot. He says he will not have a plain
      photograph&mdash;besides, it is difficult. He will have a painting, and he
      will pay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I begin to see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see? Then I send this Armour. Look!&rsquo; Mr. Kauffer continued with
      rising excitement, baited apparently by the unfortunate canvas to which he
      pointed, &lsquo;when Armour go to make that I say you go paint ze Maharajah of
      Gridigurh spearing ze wild pig. You see what he make?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it is a wonderfully spirited, dashing thing, and the
      treatment of all that cane-brake and jungle grass is superb.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ze treatment&mdash;pardon me, sir, I overboil&mdash;do you know which is
      ze Maharajah?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neider does he. Ze Maharajah refuse zat picture; he is a good fellow,
      too. He says it is a portrait of ze pig.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is so good,&rsquo; I protested, &lsquo;of the pig.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But that does not interest the Maharajah, you onderstand, no. You see
      this one? Nawab of Kandore on his State elephant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt about it,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I know the Nawab well, the young scoundrel.
      How dignified he looks!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of real sorrow in Kauffer&rsquo;s voice. &lsquo;Dignified? Oh, yes;
      dignified, but, you observe, also black. The Nawab will not be painted
      black. At once it is on my hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he is black,&rsquo; I remonstrated. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the darkest native I&rsquo;ve ever seen
      among the nobility.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No matter for that. He will not be black. When I photograph that Nawab&mdash;any
      nawab&mdash;I do not him black make. But ziss ass of Armour&mdash;ach!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fascinating subject, and I could have pursued it all along the
      line of poor Armour&rsquo;s rejected canvases, but the need to get away from
      Kauffer with his equal claim upon my sympathy was too great. To have
      cracked my solemn mask by a single smile would have been to break down
      irrepressibly, and never since I set foot in India had I felt a parallel
      desire to laugh and to weep. There was a pang in it which I recognize as
      impossible to convey, arising from the point of contact, almost
      unimaginable yet so clear before me, of the uncompromising ideals of the
      atelier and the naive demands of the Oriental, with an unhappy
      photographer caught between and wriggling. The situation was really
      monstrous, the fatuous rejection of all that fine scheming and exquisite
      manipulation, and it did not grow less so as Mr. Kauffer continued to
      unfold it. Armour had not, apparently, proceeded to the scene of his
      labours without instructions. In the pig-sticking delineation he had been
      specially told that the Maharajah and the pig were to be in the middle,
      with the rest nowhere and nothing between. Other injunctions were as
      clear, and as clearly disregarded. Armour, like the Maharajahs, had simply
      &lsquo;REfuse&rsquo; to abandon his premeditated conceptions of how the thing should
      be done. And here was the result, for the laughter of the gods and anybody
      else that might see. I asked Kauffer unguardedly if no sort of pressure
      could be brought to bear upon these chaps to make them pay up. His face
      beaming with hope and intelligence, he suggested that I should approach
      the Foreign Office in his behalf; but this I could not quite see my way
      to. The coercion of native rulers, I explained, was a difficult and a
      dangerous art, and to insist, for example, that one of them should
      recognize his own complexion might be to run up a disproportionate little
      bill of our own. I did, however, compound something with Kauffer; I hope
      it wasn&rsquo;t a felony. &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; I said to Kauffer, &lsquo;this isn&rsquo;t official,
      you know, in any way, but how would it do to write that scamp Kandore a
      formal letter regretting that the portrait does not suit him, and asking
      his permission to dispose of it to me? Of course it is yours to do as you
      like with already, but that is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t ask. I should
      like it, but the Porcha tiger beat will do as well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kauffer nearly fell upon my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That Kandore will buy it to put in one bonfire first,&rsquo; he assured me, and
      I sincerely hoped for his sake that it would be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it&rsquo;s understood,&rsquo; I bethought me to say, &lsquo;that I get it, if I
      do get it, at Mr. Armour&rsquo;s price. I&rsquo;m not a Maharajah, you know, and it
      isn&rsquo;t a portrait of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; said Kauffer, &lsquo;but I sink I sell you that Porcha; it is ze
      best of ze two.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I ventured for a few days to keep the light which chance had shed for me
      upon Armour&rsquo;s affairs to myself. The whole thing considered in connection
      with his rare and delicate talent, seemed too derogatory and disastrous to
      impart without the sense of doing him some kind of injury in the mere
      statement. But there came a point when I could no longer listen to Dora
      Harris&rsquo;s theories to account for him, wild idealizations as most of them
      were of any man&rsquo;s circumstances and intentions. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask him
      point-blank?&rsquo; I said, and she replied, frowning slightly, &lsquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t
      do that. It would destroy something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what, but something
      valuable&mdash;between us.&rsquo; This struck me as an exaggeration, considering
      how far, by that time, they must have progressed towards intimacy, and my
      mouth was opened. She heard me without the exclamations I expected, her
      head bent over the pencil she was sharpening, and her silence continued
      after I had finished. The touch of comedy I gave the whole thing&mdash;surely
      I was justified in that!&mdash;fell flat, and I extracted from her
      muteness a sense of rebuke; one would think I had been taking advantage of
      the poor devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, having broken the lead of her pencil three times, she turned a
      calm, considering eye upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have known this for a fortnight?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem
      somehow quite fair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To whom?&rsquo; I asked, and her answer startled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To either of us,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she advised herself to that effect is more than I can imagine, but the
      print of her words is indelible, that is what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, confound it!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help finding out, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you could help keeping it to yourself in that&mdash;in that base
      way,&rsquo; she replied, and almost&mdash;the evening light was beginning to
      glimmer uncertainly through the deodars&mdash;I could swear I saw the
      flash of a tear on her eyelid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; she went on a moment later, &lsquo;but I do hate having to
      pity him. It&rsquo;s intolerable&mdash;that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up a dainty edition of Aucassin and Nicolette with the intention
      of getting upon ground less emotional, and observed on the flyleaf &lsquo;D.H.
      from I.A. In memory of the Hill of Stars.&rsquo; I looked appreciatively at the
      binding, and as soon as possible put it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was not bound to tell me,&rsquo; Dora asserted presently, in reply to my
      statement that the mare had somehow picked up a nail in the stable, and
      was laid up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been very good to him,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I think he was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His reticence was due,&rsquo; she continued, as if defying contradiction, &lsquo;to a
      simple dislike to bore one with his personal affairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it?&rsquo; I assented. My tone acknowledged with all humility that she was
      likely to know, and I did not deserve her doubtful glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He could not certainly,&rsquo; she went on, with firmer decision, &lsquo;have been in
      the least ashamed of his connection with Kauffer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He comes from a country where social distinctions are less sharp than
      they are in this idiotic place,&rsquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if you think it is from any lack of recognition! His sensitiveness is
      beyond reason. He has met two or three men in the Military Department here&mdash;he
      was aware of the nicest shade of their patronage. But he does not care. To
      him life is more than a clerkship. He sees all round people like that.
      They are only figures in the landscape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;he is not at all concerned that nobody in this Capua of
      ours knows him, or cares anything about him, or has bought a scrap of his
      work, except our two selves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a different matter. I have tried to rouse in him the feeling that
      it would be as well to be appreciated, even in Simla, and I think I&rsquo;ve
      succeeded. He said, after those two men had gone away on Sunday, that he
      thought a certain reputation in the place where he lived would help
      anybody in his work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On Sunday? Do you mean between twelve and two?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he came and made a formal call. There was no reason why he
      shouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now that I think of it,&rsquo; I rejoined, &lsquo;he shot a card on me too, at the
      Club. I was a little surprised. We didn&rsquo;t seem somehow to be on those
      terms. One doesn&rsquo;t readily associate him with any conventionality.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Dora again, and with this vague
      comment we spoke of something else, both of us, I think, a little
      disquieted and dissatisfied that he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; Dora said as I went away, &lsquo;that you had better go up to the
      studio and tell him what you have told me. Perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t matter much,
      but I can&rsquo;t bear the thought of his not knowing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to Kauffer&rsquo;s in the morning and see the pictures,&rsquo; I urged; but she
      turned away, &lsquo;Oh, not with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I found my way almost at once to Amy Villa, not only because I had been
      told to go there. I wanted, myself, certain satisfactions. Armour was
      alone and smoking, but I had come prepared against the contingency of one
      of his cigars. They were the cigars of the man who doesn&rsquo;t know what he
      eats. With sociable promptness I lighted one of my own. The little
      enclosed veranda testified to a wave of fresh activity. The north light
      streamed in upon two or three fresh canvases, the place seemed full of
      enthusiasm, and you could see its source, at present quiescent under the
      influence of tobacco, in Armour&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have taken a new line,&rsquo; I said, pointing to a file of camels, still
      half obscured by the dust of the day, coming along a mountain road under a
      dim moon. They might have been walking through time and through history.
      It was a queer, simple thing, with a world of early Aryanism in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does that say anything? I&rsquo;m glad. It was to me articulate, but I didn&rsquo;t
      know. Oh, things have been going well with me lately. Those two studies
      over there simply did themselves. That camp scene on the left is almost a
      picture. I think I&rsquo;ll put a little more work on it and give it a chance in
      Paris. I got in once, you know. Champ de Mars. With some horses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you, indeed?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Capital.&rsquo; I asked him if he didn&rsquo;t atrociously
      miss the life of the Quarter, and he surprised me by saying that he never
      had lived it. He had been en pension instead with a dear old professor of
      chemistry and his family at Puteaux, and used to go in and out. A smile
      came into his eyes at the remembrance, and he told me one after the other
      idyllic little stories of the old professor and madame. Madame and the
      omelet&mdash;madame and the melon&mdash;M. Vibois and the maire; I sat
      charmed. So long as we remained in France his humour was like this,
      delicate and expansive, but an accidental allusion led us across the
      Channel when he changed. He had no little stories of the time he spent in
      England. Instead he let himself go in generalizations, aimed, for they had
      a distinct animus, at English institutions and character, particularly as
      these appear in English society. I could not believe, from the little I
      had seen of him, that his experience of English society of any degree had
      been intimate; what he said had the flavour of Radical Sunday papers. The
      only original element was the feeling behind, which was plainly part of
      him; speculation instantly clamoured as to how far this was purely
      temperamental and how far the result of painful contact. He himself, he
      said, though later of the Western States, had been born under the British
      flag of British parents&mdash;though his mother was an Irishwoman she came
      from loyal Ulster&mdash;and he repeated the statement as if it in some way
      justified his attitude towards his fellow countrymen and excused his
      truculence in the ear of a servant of the empire which he had the humour
      to abuse. I heard him, I confess, with impatience, it was all so shabby
      and shallow, but I heard him out, and I was rewarded; he came for an
      illustration in the end to Simla. &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;at what they call
      their &ldquo;Government House list&rdquo;; and look at Strobo, Signor Strobo. Isn&rsquo;t
      Strobo a man of intelligence, isn&rsquo;t he a man of benevolence? He gave ten
      thousand rupees last week to the famine fund. Is Strobo on Government
      House list? Is he ever invited to dine with the Viceroy? No, because
      Strobo keeps a hotel! Look at Rosario&mdash;where does Rosario come in?
      Nowhere, because Rosario is a clerk, and a subordinate. Yet Rosario is a
      man of wide reading and a very accomplished fellow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It became more or less necessary to argue then, and the commonplaces with
      which I opposed him called forth a wealth of detail bearing most
      picturesquely upon his stay among us. I began to think he had never hated
      English rigidity and English snobbery until he came to Simla, and that he
      and Strobo and Rosario had mingled their experiences in one bitter cup. I
      gathered this by inference only, he was curiously watchful and reticent as
      to anything that had happened to him personally; indeed, he was careful to
      aver preferences for the society of &lsquo;sincere&rsquo; people like Strobo and
      Rosario, that seemed to declare him more than indifferent to circles in
      which he would not meet them. In the end our argument left me ridiculously
      irritated&mdash;it was simply distressing to see the platform from which
      he obtained so wide and exquisite a view of the world upheld by such
      flimsy pillars&mdash;and my nerves were not soothed by his proposal to
      walk with me to the Club. I could hardly refuse it, however, and he came
      along in excellent spirits, having effected the demolition of British
      social ideals, root and branch. His mongrel dog accompanied, keeping
      offensively near our heels. It was not even an honest pi, but a dog of
      tawdry pretensions with a banner-like tail dishonestly got from a spaniel.
      On one occasion I very nearly kicked the dog.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; I said to Dora as we rode down to the gymkhana, &lsquo;his
      personality takes possession of one. I constantly go to that little hut of
      his with intentions, benevolent or otherwise, which I never carry out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;that you completely forgot to reveal to him
      your hateful knowledge about Kauffer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, I didn&rsquo;t forget it for a moment. But the conversation
      took a turn that made it quite impossible to mention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can understand,&rsquo; Miss Harris replied softly, &lsquo;how that might be. And it
      doesn&rsquo;t in the least matter,&rsquo; she went on triumphantly, &lsquo;because I&rsquo;ve told
      him myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My nerves must have been a trifle strung up at the time, for this struck
      me as a matter for offense. &lsquo;You thought I would trample upon him,&rsquo; I
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no really. I disliked his not knowing it was known&mdash;rien de
      plus,&rsquo; she said lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, not much. What should he say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He might have expressed a decent regret on poor Kauffer&rsquo;s account,&rsquo; I
      growled. Dora did not reply, and a glance showed her frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe he apologized!&rsquo; I cried, pushing, as it were, my advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He explained.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course he hasn&rsquo;t relished the position, and of course he didn&rsquo;t
      realize it before he came. Shall we trot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was compelled to negative the idea of trotting, since we were descending
      quite the steepest pitch of the road down to Annandale. We went on at a
      walk, and it occurred to me, as my contemplative gaze fell on my own
      pig-skins, that we were, even for Simla, an uncommonly well-turned-out
      pair. I had helped to pick Dora&rsquo;s hack, and I allowed myself to reflect
      that he did my judgment credit. She sat him perfectly in her wrath&mdash;she
      was plainly angry&mdash;not a hair out of place. Why is it that a lady out
      of temper with her escort always walks away from him? Is her horse
      sympathetic? Ronald, at all events, was leading by a couple of yards, when
      suddenly he shied, bounding well across the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mare, whose manners I can always answer for, simply stopped and looked
      haughtily about for explanations. A path dropped into the road from the
      hillside; something came scrambling and stumbling down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Dora, as it emerged and was Armour on his much enduring white
      pony, &lsquo;how you frightened us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stick to the road, man?&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t usual to
      put ponies up and down these coolie tracks!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no notice of this rather broad hint that I was annoyed, but fixed
      his eager, light, luminous eyes upon Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; he said, and added, &lsquo;I did not expect to see you today!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not till tomorrow,&rsquo; she returned. &lsquo;You remember that we are sketching
      tomorrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her and smiled slightly; and then I remember noticing that
      his full, arched upper lip seldom quite met its counterpart over his
      teeth. This gave an unpremeditated casual effect to everything he found to
      say, and made him look a dreamer at his busiest. His smile was at the
      folly of her reminder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just been looking for something that you would like,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but
      it isn&rsquo;t much good hunting about alone. I see five times as much when we
      go together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He and his pony barred the way; he had an air of leisure and of felicity;
      one would think we had met at an afternoon party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are on our way,&rsquo; I explained, &lsquo;to the gymkhana. Miss Harris is in one
      of the events. You did enter for the needle-threading race, didn&rsquo;t you,
      with Lord Arthur? I think we must get on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow, dull red mounted to Armour&rsquo;s face and seemed to put out that
      curious light in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it far?&rsquo; he asked, glancing down over the tree-tops. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never been
      there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; cried Dora, suddenly, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve been down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you have,&rsquo; I confirmed her. &lsquo;Your beast is damaged too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it was only a stumble,&rsquo; Armour replied; &lsquo;I stuck on all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you had better get off now, as you didn&rsquo;t then, and look
      at your animal&rsquo;s near fore. The swelling&rsquo;s as big as a bun already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he made me no answer, but looked intently and questioningly at Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get off, Mr. Armour,&rsquo; she said, sharply, &lsquo;and lead your horse home. It is
      not fit to be ridden. Goodbye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no doubt he did it, but neither of us were inclined to look back to
      see. We pushed on under the deodars, and I was indulgent to a trot. At the
      end of it Dora remarked that Mr. Armour naturally could not be expected to
      know anything about riding, it was very plucky of him to get on a horse at
      all, among these precipices; and I of course agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Arthur was waiting when we arrived, on his chestnut polo pony, but
      Dora immediately scratched for the brilliant event in which they were
      paired. Ronald, she said, was simply cooked with the heat. Ronald had come
      every yard of the way on his toes and was fit for anything, but Lord
      Arthur did not insist. There were young ladies in Simla, I am glad to say,
      who appealed more vividly to his imagination than Dora Harris did, and one
      of them speedily replaced her, a fresh-coloured young Amazon who was
      staying at the Chief&rsquo;s. She wandered about restlessly over the dry turf
      for a few minutes, and then went and sat down in a corner of the little
      wooden Grand Stand and sent me for a cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come to the tent?&rsquo; I asked a little ruefully, eyeing the
      distance and the possible collisions between, but she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I simply couldn&rsquo;t bear it,&rsquo; she said, and I went feeling somehow
      chastened myself by the cloud that was upon her spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found her on my return regarding the scene with a more than usually
      critical eye, and a more than usually turned down lip. Yet it was exactly
      the scene it always was, and always, probably, will be. I sat down beside
      her and regarded it also, but more charitably than usual. Perhaps it was
      rather trivial, just a lot of pretty dresses and excited young men in
      white riding-breeches doing foolish things on ponies in the shortest
      possible time, with one little crowd about the Club&rsquo;s refreshment tent and
      another about the Staff&rsquo;s, while the hills sat round in an indifferent
      circle; but it appealed to me with a kind of family feeling that
      afternoon, and inspired me with tolerance, even benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s mainly youth and high spirits&mdash;two good
      things. And one knows them all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who are they to know?&rsquo; complained Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just decent young Englishmen and Englishwomen, out here on their
      country&rsquo;s business,&rsquo; I replied cheerfully; &lsquo;with the marks of Oxford and
      Cambridge and Sandhurst and Woolwich on the men. Well-set-up youngsters,
      who know what to do and how to do it. Oh, I like the breed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said she, in a tone of preposterous melancholy, &lsquo;if eventually
      I have to marry one of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not necessarily,&rsquo; I said. She looked at me with interest, as if I had
      contributed importantly to the matter in hand, and resumed tapping her
      boot with her riding-crop. We talked of indifferent things and had long
      lapses. At the close of one effort Dora threw herself back with a deep,
      tumultuous sigh. &lsquo;The poverty of this little wretched resort ties up one&rsquo;s
      tongue!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;It is the bottom of the cup; here one gets the very
      dregs of Simla&rsquo;s commonplace. Let us climb out of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought for a moment that Ronald had been too much for her nerves coming
      down, and offered to change saddles, but she would not. We took it out of
      the horses all along the first upward slopes, and as we pulled in to
      breathe them she turned to me paler than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel better now,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself I had got rid of Armour for the afternoon. I think my
      irritation with him about his pony rose and delivered me from the too
      insistent thought of him. With Dora it was otherwise; she had dismissed
      him; but he had never left her for a moment the whole long afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung a searching look at me. With a reckless turn of her head, she
      said, &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we take him with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did we want him?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I always want him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said I, and would have pondered this statement at some length in
      silence, but that she plainly did not wish me to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We might perfectly well have sent his pony home with one of our own
      servants&mdash;he would have been delighted to walk down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wasn&rsquo;t in proper kit,&rsquo; I remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I wish you would speak to him about that. Make him get some
      tennis-flannels and riding-things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you propose to get him asked to places?&rsquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me a charmingly unguarded smile. &lsquo;I propose to induce you to do
      so. I have done what I could. He has dined with us several times, and met
      a few people who would, I thought, be kind to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I have had him at the Club too, with old Lamb and
      Colonel Hamilton. He made us all miserable with his shyness. Don&rsquo;t ask me
      to do it again, please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve sent him to call on certain people,&rsquo; Dora continued, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve shown
      his pictures to everybody, and praised him and talked about him, but I
      can&rsquo;t go on doing that indefinitely, can I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;people might misunderstand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think they would MISunderstand,&rsquo; replied this astonishing girl,
      without flinching. She even sought my eyes to show me that hers were clear
      and full of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; I said to myself, but the words that fell from me were, &lsquo;He is
      outside all that life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the use of living a life that he is outside of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if you put it that way,&rsquo; I said, and set my teeth, &lsquo;I will do what I
      can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand with an affectionate gesture, and I was reluctantly
      compelled to press it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses broke into a trot, and we talked no more of Armour, or of
      anything, until Ted Harris joined us on the Mall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have rendered this conversation with Dora in detail because subsequent
      events depend so closely upon it. Some may not agree that it was basis
      enough for the action I thought well to take; I can only say that it was
      all I was ever able to obtain. Dora was always particularly civil and
      grateful about my efforts, but she gave me only one more glimpse, and that
      enigmatic, of any special reason why they should be made. Perhaps this was
      more than compensated for by the abounding views I had of the situation as
      it lay with Ingersoll Armour, but of that, other persons, approaching the
      subject without prejudice, will doubtless judge better than I.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was better not to inquire, so I never knew to what extent Kauffer
      worked upon the vanity of ancient houses the sinful dodge I suggested to
      him; but I heard before long that the line of Armour&rsquo;s rejected efforts
      had been considerably diminished. Armour told me himself that Kauffer&rsquo;s
      attitude had become almost conciliatory, that Kauffer had even hinted at
      the acceptance of, and adhesion to, certain principles which he would lay
      down as the basis of another year&rsquo;s contract. In talking to me about it,
      Armour dwelt on these absurd stipulations only as the reason why any idea
      of renewal was impossible. It was his proud theory with me that to work
      for a photographer was just as dignified as to produce under any other
      conditions, provided you did not stoop to ideals which for lack of a
      better word might be called photographic. How he represented it to Dora,
      or permitted Dora to represent it to him, I am not so certain&mdash;I
      imagine there may have been admissions and qualifications. Be that as it
      may, however, the fact was imperative that only three months of the hated
      bond remained, and that some working substitute for the hated bond would
      have to be discovered at their expiration. Simla, in short, must be made
      to buy Armour&rsquo;s pictures, to appreciate them, if the days of miracle were
      not entirely past, but to buy them any way. On one or two occasions I had
      already made Simla buy things. I had cleared out young Ludlow&rsquo;s stables
      for him in a week&mdash;he had a string of ten&mdash;when he played polo
      in a straw hat and had to go home with sunstroke; and I once auctioned off
      all the property costumes of the Amateur Dramatic Society at astonishing
      prices. Pictures presented difficulties which I have hinted at in an
      earlier chapter, but I did not despair. I began by hauling old Lamb,
      puffing and blowing like a grampus, up to Amy Villa, filling him up all
      the way with denunciations of Simla&rsquo;s philistinism and suggestions that he
      alone redeemed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a thing I am ashamed to think of, and it deserved its reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamb criticized and patronized every blessed thing he saw, advised Armour
      to beware of mannerisms and to be a little less liberal with his colour,
      and heard absolutely unmoved of the horses Armour had got into the Salon.
      &lsquo;I understand,&rsquo; he said, with a benevolent wink, &lsquo;that about four thousand
      pictures are hung every year at the Salon, and I don&rsquo;t know how many
      thousand are rejected. Let Mr. Armour get a picture accepted by the
      Academy. Then he will have something to talk about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither did Sir William Lamb buy anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experiment with Lady Pilkey was even more distressing. She gushed with
      fair appropriateness and great liberality, and finally fixed upon one
      scene to make her own. She winningly asked the price of it. She had never
      known anybody who did not understand prices. Poor Armour, the colour of a
      live coal, named one hundred rupees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One hundred rupees! Oh, my dear boy, I can never afford that! You must,
      you must really give it to me for seventy-five. It will break my heart if
      I can&rsquo;t have it for seventy-five.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the pleasure,&rsquo; said Armour, &lsquo;of making you a present of it. You
      have been so kind about everything, and it&rsquo;s so seldom one meets anybody
      who really cares. So let me send it to you.&rsquo; It was honest embarrassment;
      he did not mean to be impertinent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blum, of the Geological Department&mdash;Herr Blum in his own country&mdash;came
      up and honestly rejoiced, and at end of an interminable pipe did purchase
      a little Breton bit that I hated to see go&mdash;it was one of the things
      that gave the place its air; but Blum had a large family undergoing
      education at Heidelberg, and exclaimed, to Armour&rsquo;s keenest anguish, that
      on this account he could not more do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, during the months of August and September, persons resident in
      Simla drawing their income from Her Majesty, bought from the eccentric
      young artist from nowhere, living on Summer Hill, canvases and little
      wooden panels to the extent of two hundred and fifty rupees. Lady Pilkey
      had asked him to lunch&mdash;she might well! and he had appeared at three
      garden-parties and a picnic. It was not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not enough, and yet it was, in a manner, too much. Pitiful as it
      was in substance, it had an extraordinary personal effect. Armour suddenly
      began to turn himself out well&mdash;his apparel was of smarter cut than
      mine, and his neckties in better taste. Little elegances appeared in the
      studio&mdash;he offered you Scotch in a Venetian decanter and Melachrinos
      from a chased silver box. The farouche element faded out of his speech;
      his ideas remained as fresh and as simple as ever, but he gave them a
      form, bless me! that might have been used at the Club. He worked as hard
      as ever, but more variously; he tried his hand at several new things. He
      said he was feeling about for something that would really make his
      reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all this his little measure of success made him more
      contemptuous than before of its scene and its elements. He declared that
      he had a poorer idea than ever of society now that he saw the pattern from
      the smart side. That his convictions on this head survived one of the best
      Simla tailors shows that they must always have been strong. I think he
      believed that he was doing all that he did do to make himself socially
      possible with the purpose of pleasing Dora Harris. I would not now venture
      to say how far Dora inspired and controlled him in this direction, and how
      far the impulse was his own. The measure of appreciation that began to
      seek his pictures, poor and small though it was, gave him, on the other
      hand, the most unalloyed delight. He talked of the advice of Sir William
      Lamb as if it were anything but that of a pompous old ass, and he made a
      feast with champagne for Blum that must have cost him quite as much as
      Blum paid for the Breton sketch. He confirmed my guess that he had never
      in his life until he came to Simla sold anything, so that even these small
      transactions were great things to him, and the earnest of a future upon
      which he covered his eyes not to gaze too raptly. He mentioned to me that
      Kauffer had been asked for his address&mdash;who could it possibly be?&mdash;and
      looked so damped by my humourous suggestion that it was a friend of
      Kauffer&rsquo;s in some other line who wanted a bill paid, that I felt I had
      been guilty of brutality. And all the while the quality of his wonderful
      output never changed or abated. Pure and firm and prismatic it remained. I
      found him one day at the very end of October, with shining eyes and
      fingers blue with cold, putting the last of the afternoon light on the
      snows into one of the most dramatic hill pictures I ever knew him to do.
      He seemed intoxicated with his skill, and hummed the &lsquo;Marseillaise,&rsquo; I
      remember, all the way to Amy Villa whither I accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the last day of Kauffer&rsquo;s contract; and besides, all the world,
      secretaries, establishments, hill captains, grass widows, shops, and
      sundries, was trundling down the hill. I came to ask my young friend what
      he meant to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Why, eat, drink, and be merry! Kauffer has paid up, and
      his yoke is at the bottom of the sea. Come back and dine with me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour we spent together in his little inner room before dinner was
      served stands out among my strangest, loveliest memories of Armour. He was
      divinely caught up, and absurd as it is to write, he seemed to carry me
      with him. We drank each a glass of vermouth before dinner sitting over a
      scented fire of deodar branches, while outside the little window in front
      of me the lifted lines of the great empty Himalayan landscape faded and
      fell into a blur. I remembered the solitary scarlet dahlia that stood
      between us and the vast cold hills and held its colour when all was grey
      but that. The hill world waited for the winter; down a far valley we could
      hear a barking deer. Armour talked slowly, often hesitating for a word, of
      the joy there was in beauty and the divinity in the man who saw it with
      his own eyes. I have read notable pages that brought conviction pale
      beside that which stole about the room from what he said. The comment may
      seem fantastic, but it is a comment&mdash;I caressed the dog. The servant
      clattered in with the plates, and at a shout outside Armour left me. He
      came in radiant with Signor Strobo, also radiant and carrying a violin,
      for hotel-keeping was not the Signor&rsquo;s only accomplishment. I knew Strobo
      well; many a special dish had he ordered for my little parties; and we met
      at Armour&rsquo;s fireside like the genial old acquaintances we were. Another
      voice without and presently I was nodding to Rosario and vaguely wondering
      why he looked uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; said Armour, as we sat down, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing but beer. If I
      had known you were all coming, no vintage that crawls up the hill would
      have been good enough for me.&rsquo; He threw the bond of his wonderful smile
      round us as we swallowed his stuff, and our hearts were lightened. &lsquo;You
      fellows,&rsquo; he went on nodding at the other two, &lsquo;might happen any day, but
      my friend John Philips comes to me across aerial spaces; he is a star I&rsquo;ve
      trapped&mdash;you don&rsquo;t do that often. Pilsener, John Philips, or Black?&rsquo; 
      He was helping his only servant by pouring out the beer himself, and as I
      declared for Black he slapped me affectionately on the back and said my
      choice was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last person who had slapped me on the back was Lord Dufferin, and I
      smiled softly and privately at the remembrance, and what a difference
      there was. I had resented Dufferin&rsquo;s slap.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had spiced hump and jungle-fowl and a Normandy cheese, everybody will
      understand that; but how shall I make plain with what exultation and
      simplicity we ate and drank, how the four candid selves of us sat around
      the table in a cloud of tobacco and cheered each other on, Armour always
      far in front turning handsprings as he went. Scraps come back to me, but
      the whole queer night has receded and taken its place among those dreams
      that insist at times upon having been realities. Rosario told us stories
      Kipling might have coveted of the under life of Port Said. Strobo talked
      with glorious gusto of his uncle the brigand. They were liberated men; we
      were all liberated men. &lsquo;Let the direction go,&rsquo; cried Armour, &lsquo;and give
      the senses flight, taking the image as it comes, beating the air with
      happy pinions.&rsquo; He must have been talking of his work, but I can not now
      remember. And what made Strobo say, of life and art, &lsquo;I have waited for
      ten years and five thousand pounds&mdash;now my old violin says, &ldquo;Go,
      handle the ladle! Go, add up the account!&rdquo;&rsquo; And did we really discuss the
      chances of ultimate salvation for souls in the Secretariat? I know I
      lifted my glass once and cried, &lsquo;I, a slave, drink to freedom!&rsquo; and
      Rosario clinked with me. And Strobo played wailing Hungarian airs with
      sudden little shakes of hopeless laughter in them. I can not even now hear
      Naches without being filled with the recollection of how certain bare
      branches in me that night blossomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked alone down the hill and along the three miles to the Club, and at
      every step the tide sank in me till it cast me on my threshold at three in
      the morning, just the middle-aged shell of a Secretary to the Government
      of India that I was when I set forth. Next day when my head clerk brought
      me the files we avoided one another&rsquo;s glances; and it was quite three
      weeks before I could bring myself to address him with the dignity and
      distance prescribed for his station as &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; Rosario.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I went of course to Calcutta for the four winter months. Harris and I were
      together at the Club. It was the year, I remember, of the great shindy as
      to whether foreign consuls should continue to be made honourary members,
      in view of the sentiments some of them were freely reflecting from Europe
      upon the subject of a war in South Africa which was none of theirs.
      Certainly, feeling as they did, it would have been better if they had
      swaggered less about a club that stood for British Government; but I did
      not vote to withdraw the invitation. We can not, after all, take notice of
      every idle word that drops from Latin or Teutonic tongues; it isn&rsquo;t our
      way; but it was a liverish cold weather on various accounts, and the
      public temper was short. I heard from Dora oftener, Harris declared, than
      he did. She was spending the winter with friends in Agra, and Armour, of
      course, was there too, living at Laurie&rsquo;s Hotel, and painting, Dora
      assured me, with immense energy. It was just the place for Armour, a
      sumptuous dynasty wrecked in white marble and buried in desert sands for
      three hundred years; and I was glad to hear that he was making the most of
      it. It was quite by the way, but I had lent him the money to go there&mdash;somebody
      had to lend it to him&mdash;and when he asked me to decide whether he
      should take his passage for Marseilles or use it for this other purpose I
      could hardly hesitate, believing in him, as I did, to urge him to paint a
      little more of India before he went. I frankly despaired of his ever being
      able to pay his way in Simla without Kauffer, but that was no reason why
      he should not make a few more notes for further use at home, where I
      sometimes saw for him, when his desultory and experimental days were over
      and some definiteness and order had come into his work, a Bond Street
      exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not said all this time what I thought of Ingersoll Armour and Dora
      Harris together, because their connection seemed too vague and fantastic
      and impossible to hold for an instant before a steady gaze. I have no wish
      to justify myself when I write that I preferred to keep my eyes averted,
      enjoying perhaps just such a measure of vision as would enter at a corner
      of them. This may or may not have been immoral under the circumstances&mdash;the
      event did not prove it so&mdash;but for urgent private reasons I could not
      be the person to destroy the idyll, if indeed its destruction were
      possible, that flourished there in the corner of my eye. Besides, had not
      I myself planted and watered it? But it was foolish to expect other
      people, people who are forever on the lookout for trousseaux and
      wedding-bells, and who considered these two as mere man and maid, and had
      no sight of them as engaging young spirits in happy conjunction&mdash;it
      was foolish to expect such people to show equal consideration. Christmas
      was barely over before the lady with whom Miss Harris was staying found it
      her duty to communicate to Edward Harris the fact that dear Dora&rsquo;s
      charming friendship&mdash;she was sure it was nothing more&mdash;with the
      young artist&mdash;Mrs. Poulton believed Mr. Harris would understand who
      was meant&mdash;was exciting a good deal of comment in the station, and
      WOULD dear Mr. Harris please write to Dora himself, as Mrs. Poulton was
      beginning to feel so responsible?
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the letter; Harris showed it to me when he sat down to breakfast
      with the long face of a man in a domestic difficulty, and we settled
      together whom we should ask to put his daughter up in Calcutta. It should
      be the wife of a man in his own department of course; it is to one&rsquo;s
      Deputy Secretary that one looks for succour at times like this; and
      naturally one never looks in vain. Mrs. Symons would be delighted. I
      conjured up Dora&rsquo;s rage on receipt of the telegram. She loathed the
      Symonses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, but not at the jerk of a wire; she arrived a week later, with a
      face of great propriety and a smile of great unconcern. Harris, having got
      her effectually out of harm&rsquo;s way, shirked further insistence, and I have
      reason to believe that Armour was never even mentioned between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora applied herself to the gaieties of the season with the zest of a
      debutante; she seemed really refreshed, revitalized. She had never looked
      better, happier. I met her again for the first time at one of the Thursday
      dances at Government House. In the glance she gave me I was glad to detect
      no suspicion of collusion. She plainly could not dream that Edward Harris
      in his nefarious exercise of parental authority had acted upon any hint
      from me. It was rather sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the veranda, away from the blare of the Viceroy&rsquo;s band, she told me
      very delicately and with the most charming ellipses how Armour had been
      filling her life in Agra, how it had all been, for these two, a dream and
      a vision. There is a place below the bridge there, where the cattle come
      down from the waste pastures across the yellow sands to drink and stand in
      the low water of the Jumna, to stand and switch their tails while their
      herdsmen on the bank coax them back with &lsquo;Ari!&rsquo; &lsquo;Ari!&rsquo; &lsquo;Ari!&rsquo; long and
      high, faint and musical; and the minarets of Akbar&rsquo;s fort rise beyond
      against the throbbing sky and the sun fills it all. This place I shall
      never see more distinctly than I saw it that night on the veranda at
      Government House, Calcutta, with the conviction, like a margin for the
      picture, that its foreground had been very often occupied by the woman I
      profoundly worshiped and Ingersoll Armour. She told me that he had sent me
      a sketch of it, and I very much wished he hadn&rsquo;t. One felt that the gift
      would carry a trifle of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has told me,&rsquo; she said once brusquely, &lsquo;how good you have been to
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he coming to Simla again?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes! And please take it from me that this time he will conquer the
      place. He has undertaken to do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At your request?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At my persuasion&mdash;at my long entreaty. They must recognize him&mdash;they
      must be taught. I have set my heart on it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he himself very much care?&rsquo; I asked remembering the night of the
      thirty-first of October.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he does care. He despises it, of course, but in a way he cares. I&rsquo;ve
      been trying to make him care more. A human being isn&rsquo;t an orchid; he must
      draw something from the soil he grows in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he were stable,&rsquo; I mused; &lsquo;if he had a fixed ambition somewhere in the
      firmament. But his purpose is a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he has an ambition,&rsquo; said Miss Harris, into the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Then we must continue,&rsquo; I said&mdash;&lsquo;continue to push from behind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora did not reply. She is a person of energy and determination, and might
      have been expected to offer to cooperate gladly. But she didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is painting a large picture for next season&rsquo;s exhibition,&rsquo; she
      informed me. &lsquo;I was not allowed to see it or to know anything about it,
      but he declares it will bring Simla down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; I said, piously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I hope so. I have told him,&rsquo; Dora continued, slowly, &lsquo;that a great
      deal depends on it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is Mrs. Symons,&rsquo; I was able to return, &lsquo;and I am afraid she is
      looking for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      March came, and the city lay white under its own dust. The electric fans
      began to purr in the Club, and Lent brought the flagging season to a full
      stop. I had to go that year on tour through the famine district with the
      Member, and we escaped, gasping, from the Plains about the middle of
      April. Simla was crimson with rhododendron blossoms, and seemed a spur of
      Arcady. There had been the usual number of flittings from one house to
      another, and among them I heard with satisfaction that Armour no longer
      occupied Amy Villa. I would not for the world have blurred my
      recollections of that last evening&mdash;I could not have gone there
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is staying with Sir William Lamb,&rsquo; said Dora, handing me my cup of
      tea. &lsquo;And I am quite jealous. Sir William, only Sir William, has been
      allowed to see the exhibition picture.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does that portend?&rsquo; I said, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Sir William was here yesterday simply swelling with his
      impression of it. He says it&rsquo;s the finest thing that has been done in
      India. I told you he would conquer them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did,&rsquo; and without thinking I added, &lsquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be sorry that
      you asked him to.&rsquo; It must have been an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armour, those weeks before the exhibition, seemed invisible. Dora reported
      him torn with the incapacity of the bazaar frame-maker to follow a design,
      and otherwise excessively occupied, and there was no lack of demands upon
      my own time. Besides, my ardour to be of assistance to the young man found
      a slight damper in the fact that he was staying with Sir William Lamb.
      What competence had I to be of use to the guest of Sir William Lamb?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not for a moment think he will be there,&rsquo; said Dora, on the day of
      the private view as we went along the Mall towards the Town Hall together.
      &lsquo;He will not run with an open mouth to his success. He will take it from
      us later.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was there. We entered precisely at the dramatic moment of his
      presentation by Sir William Lamb to the Viceroy. He stood embarrassed and
      smiling in a little circle of compliments and congratulation. Behind him
      and a little to the left hung his picture, large and predominant, and in
      the corner of the frame was stuck the red ticket that signified the
      Viceroy&rsquo;s gold medal. We saw that, I think, before we saw anything else.
      Then with as little haste as was decent, considering His Excellency&rsquo;s
      proximity, we walked within range of the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not particularly pleased, even now, to have the task of describing
      the thing. Its subject was an old Mahomedan priest with a green turban and
      a white beard exhorting a rabble of followers. I heard myself saying to
      Dora that it was very well painted indeed, very conscientiously painted,
      and that is certainly what struck me. The expression of the fire-eater&rsquo;s
      face was extremely characteristic; his arm was flung out with a gesture
      that perfectly matched. The group of listeners was carefully composed and
      most &lsquo;naturally&rsquo;; that is the only word that would come to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced almost timidly at Dora. She was regarding it with a deep
      vertical line between her handsome brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&mdash;on earth&mdash;has he done with himself?&rsquo; she demanded, but
      before I could reply Armour was by our side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; he said, looking at Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s very nice,&rsquo; she stammered, &lsquo;but I miss YOU.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She only means, you know,&rsquo; I rushed in, &lsquo;that you&rsquo;ve put in everything
      that was never there before. Accuracy of detail, you know, and so forth.
      &lsquo;Pon my word, there&rsquo;s some drawing in that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Dora, calmly, &lsquo;what I complain of is that he has left out
      everything that was there before. But he has won the gold medal, and I
      congratulate him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, uneasily, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t congratulate me. I didn&rsquo;t do it.
      Positively I am not to blame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His Excellency says that it reminds him of an incident in one of Mrs.
      Steel&rsquo;s novels,&rsquo; said Armour, just turning his head to ascertain His
      Excellency&rsquo;s whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, so it does,&rsquo; I exclaimed, eagerly, &lsquo;one couldn&rsquo;t name the
      chapter&mdash;it&rsquo;s the general feeling.&rsquo; I went on to discourse of the
      general feeling. Words came generously, questions with point, comments
      with intelligence. I swamped the situation and so carried it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Viceroy has bought the thing,&rsquo; Armour went on, looking at Dora, &lsquo;and
      has commissioned me to paint another. The only restriction he makes is&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That it shall be of the same size?&rsquo; asked Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That it must deal with some phase of native life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Harris walked to a point behind us, and stood there with her eyes
      fixed upon the picture. I glanced at her once; her gaze was steady, but
      perfectly blank. Then she joined us again, and struck into the stream of
      my volubility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am delighted,&rsquo; she said, pleasantly, to Armour. &lsquo;You have done exactly
      what I wanted you to do. You have won the Viceroy&rsquo;s medal, and all the
      reputation there is to win in this place. Come and dine tonight, and we
      will rejoice together. But wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;for you&mdash;a little
      difficult?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her as if she had offered him a cup, and then dashed it from
      his lips; but the occasion was not one, of course, for crying out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; he said, putting on an excellent face. &lsquo;But it took a hideous
      time.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 2.X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Within a fortnight I was surprised and a little irritated to receive from
      Armour the amount of my loan in full. It was not in accordance with my
      preconceived idea of him that he should return it at all. I had arranged
      in my own mind that he should be governed by the most honest impulses and
      the most approved intentions up to the point of departure, but that he
      should never find it quite convenient to pay, and that in order to effect
      his final shipment to other shores I should be compelled to lend him some
      more money. In the far future, when he should be famous and I an obscure
      pauper on pension, my generous imagination permitted me to see the loan
      repaid; but not till then. These are perhaps stereotyped and conventional
      lines to conceive him on, but I hardly think that anybody who has followed
      my little account to this point will think them unjustifiable. I looked at
      his cheque with disgust. That a man turns out better than you expected is
      no reason why you such not be annoyed that your conception of him is
      shattered. You may be gratified on general grounds, but distinctly put out
      on personal ones, especially when your conception pointed to his
      inevitable removal. That was the way I felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheque stood for so much more than its money value. It stood for a
      possible, nay, a probable capacity in Armour to take his place in the
      stable body of society, to recognize and make demands, to become a
      taxpayer, a churchgoer, a householder, a husband. As I gazed, the
      signature changed from that of a gnome with luminous eyes who inhabited an
      inaccessible crag among the rhododendrons to that of a prosperous
      artist-bourgeois with a silk hat for Sundays. I have in some small degree
      the psychological knack, I saw the possibilities of the situation with
      immense clearness; and I cursed the cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coincidence is odious, tells on the nerves. I never felt it more so than a
      week later, when I read in the &lsquo;Pioneer&rsquo; the announcement of the death of
      my old friend Fry, Superintendent of the School of Art in Calcutta. The
      paragraph in which the journal dismissed poor Fry to his reward was not
      unkind, but it distinctly implied that the removal of Fry should include
      the removal of his ideas and methods, and the substitution of something
      rather more up to date. It remarked that the Bengali student had been
      pinned down long enough to drawing plaster casts, and declared that
      something should be done to awake within him the creative idea. I remember
      the phrase, it seemed so directly to suggest that the person to awake it
      should be Ingersoll Armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned the matter over in my mind; indeed, for the best part of an hour
      my brain revolved with little else. The billet was an excellent one, with
      very decent pay and charming quarters. It carried a pension, it was the
      completest sort of provision. There was a long vacation, with
      opportunities for original effort, and I had heard Fry call the work
      interesting. Fry was the kind of man to be interested in anything that
      gave him a living, but there was no reason why a more captious spirit, in
      view of the great advantages, should not accommodate itself to the routine
      that might present itself. The post was in the gift of the Government of
      Bengal, but that was no reason why the Government of Bengal should not be
      grateful in the difficulty of making a choice for a hint from us. The
      difficulty was really great. They would have to write home and advertise
      in the &lsquo;Athenaeum&rsquo;&mdash;for some reason Indian Governments always
      advertise educational appointments in the &lsquo;Athenaeum&rsquo;; it is a habit which
      dates from the days of John Company&mdash;and that would mean delay. And
      then the result might be a disappointment. Might Armour not also be a
      disappointment? That I really could not say. A new man is always a
      speculation, and departments, like individuals, have got to take their
      luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Viceroy was so delighted&mdash;everybody was so delighted&mdash;with
      the medal picture that the merest breath blown among them would secure
      Armour&rsquo;s nomination. Should I blow that breath? These happy thoughts must
      always occur to somebody. This one had occurred to me. Ten to one it would
      occur to nobody else, and last of all to Armour himself. The advertisement
      might already be on its way home to the &lsquo;Athenaeum&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would make everything possible. It would throw a very different
      complexion over the idyll. It would turn that interlacing wreath of
      laurels and of poppies into the strongest bond in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would simply have nothing to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no harm I asking Armour to dine with me; I sent the note off
      by messenger after breakfast and told the steward to put a magnum of
      Pommery to cool at seven precisely. I had some idea, I suppose, of
      drinking with Armour to his eternal discomfiture. Then I went to the
      office with a mind cleared of responsibility and comfortably pervaded with
      the glow of good intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I saw the young man, punctual and immediate and a little
      uncomfortable about the cuffs, I regretted not having asked one or two
      more fellows. It might have spoiled the occasion, but it would have saved
      the situation. That single glance of my accustomed eye&mdash;alas! that it
      was so well accustomed&mdash;revealed him anxious and screwed up, as
      nervous as a cat, but determined, revealed&mdash;how well I knew the
      signs!&mdash;that he had something confidential and important and highly
      personal to communicate, a matter in which I could, if I only would, be of
      the greatest possible assistance. From these appearances twenty years had
      taught me to fly to any burrow, but your dinner-table offers no retreat;
      you are hoist, so to speak, on your own carving-fork. There are men, of
      course, and even women, who have scruples about taking advantage of so
      intimate and unguarded an opportunity, but Armour, I rapidly decided, was
      not one of these. His sophistication was progressing, but it had not
      reached that point. He wanted something&mdash;I flew instantly to the mad
      conclusion that he wanted Dora. I did not pause to inquire why he should
      ask her of me. It had seemed for a long time eminently proper that anybody
      who wanted Dora should ask her of me. The application was impossible, but
      applications nearly always were impossible. Nobody knew that better than
      the Secretary to the Government of India in the Home Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      I squared my shoulders and we got through the soup. It was necessary to
      apologize for the fish. &lsquo;I suppose one must remember,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that it
      has to climb six thousand feet,&rsquo; when suddenly he burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir William Lamb tells me,&rsquo; he said, and stopped to swallow some wine,
      &lsquo;that there is something very good going in Calcutta and that I should ask
      you to help me to get it. May I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the miserable idea&mdash;the happy thought&mdash;had occurred to
      somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there?&rsquo; I said, with interest and attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s something in the School of Art. A man named Fry has died.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;a man named Fry. He, I think was Director of that
      institution.&rsquo; I looked at Armour in the considering, measuring way with
      which we suggest to candidates for posts that their fitness to fill them
      is not to be absolutely taken for granted. &lsquo;Fry was a man of fifty-six,&rsquo; I
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am thirty.&rsquo; He certainly did not look it, but years often fall lightly
      upon a temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a vile climate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know. Is it too vile, do you think,&rsquo; he said anxiously, &lsquo;to ask a lady
      to share?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lots of ladies do share it,&rsquo; I replied, with amazing calmness; &lsquo;but I
      must decline absolutely to enter into that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My frown was so forbidding that he couldn&rsquo;t and didn&rsquo;t dare to go on. He
      looked dashed and disappointed; he was really a fool of an applicant,
      quite ready to retire from the siege on the first intimation that the
      gates were not to be thrown open at his approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think you would like teaching?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can teach. Miss&mdash;my only pupil here has made capital progress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid you must not measure the Bengali art student by the standard
      of Miss Harris,&rsquo; I replied coldly. He WAS a fool. We talked of other
      things. I led him on to betray his ludicrous lack of knowledge of the
      world in various directions. At other times it had irritated me, that
      night it gave me purest pleasure. I agreed with him about everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he selected his smoke to go home with I said, &lsquo;Send your application in
      to the Director of Public Instruction, Bengal&mdash;Lamb will tell you how&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were only too thankful to get him. As a student it seemed he had been
      diligent both in London and Paris; he possessed diplomas or some such
      things bearing names which were bound to have weight with a Department of
      Public Instruction anywhere. I felt particularly thankful for this, for I
      was committed to him if he had not a rag to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was settled in three weeks, during which Armour became more and
      more the fashion in Simla. He was given every opportunity of experiment in
      the society of which he was about to become a permanent item. He dined out
      four or five times a week, and learned exactly what to talk about. He
      surprised me one day with a piece of news of my own department, which was
      a liberty of a very serious kind, but I forgave him upon finding that it
      was not true. He rode Lamb&rsquo;s weight-carriers, to cross which his short
      legs were barely adequate, and apart from this disadvantage he did not
      ride them badly. Only one thing marred the completeness of the
      transformation&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t dismiss the dog. The dog, fundamentally,
      was still and ever his companion. It was a suspicious circumstance if we
      had known; but we saw in it only a kind heart, and ignored it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw little of Dora Harris at this time. Making no doubt that she was
      enjoying her triumph as she deserved, I took the liberty of supposing that
      she would hardly wish to share so intimate a source of satisfaction. I met
      them both several times at people&rsquo;s houses&mdash;certain things had
      apparently been taken for granted&mdash;but I was only one of the little
      circle that wondered how soon it might venture upon open congratulations.
      The rest of us knew as much, it seemed, as Edward Harris did. Lady Pilkey
      asked him point-blank, and he said what his daughter found to like in the
      fellow the Lord only knew, and he was glad to say that at present he had
      no announcement to make. Lady Pilkey told me she thought it very romantic&mdash;like
      marrying a newspaper correspondent&mdash;but I pointed to a lifelong task,
      with a pension attached, of teaching fat young Bengalis to draw, and asked
      her if she saw extravagant romance in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wrote up from Calcutta that they would like to have a look at Armour
      before making the final recommendation, and he left us, I remember, by the
      mail tonga of the third of June. He dropped into my office to say goodbye,
      but I was busy with the Member and could see nobody, so he left a card
      with &lsquo;P.P.C.&rsquo; on it. I kept the card by accident, and I keep it still by
      design, for the sake of that inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strobo had given up his hotel in Simla to start one in Calcutta. It never
      occurred to me that Armour might go to Strobo&rsquo;s; but it was, of course,
      the natural thing for him to do, especially as Strobo happened to be in
      Calcutta himself at the time. He went and stayed with Strobo, and every
      day he and the Signor, clad in bath-towels, lay in closed rooms under
      punkahs and had iced drinks in the long tumblers of the East, and smoked
      and talked away the burden of the hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strobo was in Calcutta to meet a friend, an Austrian, who was shortly
      leaving India in the Messagerie Maritimes steamer Dupleix after agreeable
      wanderings disguised as a fakir in Tibet; and to this friend was attached,
      in what capacity I never thought well to inquire, a lady who was a Pole,
      and played and sang as well as Strobo fiddled. I believe they dined
      together every night, this precious quartet, and exchanged in various
      tongues their impressions of India under British control. &lsquo;A houri in
      stays,&rsquo; the lady who was a Pole described it. I believe she herself was a
      houri without them. And at midnight, when the south wind was cool and
      strong from the river, Strobo and Armour would walk up Chowringhee Road
      and look at the red brick School of Art from the outside in the light of
      the street lamps, as a preliminary to our friend&rsquo;s final acceptance of the
      task of superintending it from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      We in Simla, of course, knew nothing of all this at the time; the details
      leaked out later when Strobo came up again. I began to feel some joyful
      anxiety when in a letter dated a week after Armour&rsquo;s arrival in Calcutta,
      the Director of Public Instruction wrote to inquire whether he had yet
      left Simla; but the sweet blow did not fall with any precision or
      certainty until the newspaper arrived containing his name immediately
      under that of Herr Vanrig and Mme. Dansky in the list of passengers who
      had sailed per S.S. Dupleix on the fifteenth of June for Colombo. There it
      was, &lsquo;I. Armour,&rsquo; as significant as ever to two persons intimately
      concerned with it, but no longer a wrapping of mystery, rather a radiating
      centre of light. Its power of illumination was such that it tried my eyes.
      I closed them to recall the outlines of the School of Art&mdash;it had
      been built in a fit of economy&mdash;and the headings of the last
      Director&rsquo;s report, which I had kindly sent after Armour to Calcutta.
      Perhaps that had been the last straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real meaning of the task of implanting Western ideals in the Eastern
      mind rose before me when I thought of Armour&rsquo;s doing it&mdash;how they
      would dwindle in the process, and how he must go on handling them and
      looking at them withered and shrunken for twenty-odd years. I understood&mdash;there
      was enough left in me to understand&mdash;Armour&rsquo;s terrified escape. I was
      happy in the thought of him, sailing down the Bay. The possibilities of
      marriage, social position, assured income, support in old age, the strands
      in the bond that held him, the bond that holds us all, had been
      untwisting, untwisting, from the third of June to the fifteenth. The
      strand that stood for Dora doubtless was the last to break, but it did not
      detract from my beatitude to know that even this consideration, before the
      Dupleix and liberty, failed to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept out of Miss Harris&rsquo;s way so studiously for the next week or two
      that she was kind enough in the end to feel compelled to send for me. I
      went with misgivings&mdash;I expected, as may be imagined, to be very
      deeply distressed. She met me with a storm of gay reproaches. I had never
      seen her in better health or spirits. My surprise must have been more
      evident than I supposed or intended, for before I went away she told me
      the whole story. By that time she had heard from Ceylon, a delicious
      letter with a pen-and-ink sketch at the top. I have it still; it
      infallibly brought the man back to me. But it was all over; she assured me
      with shining eyes that it was. The reason of her plainly boundless
      thankfulness that Armour had run away from the School of Art did not come
      to the surface until I was just going. Then I gathered that if he had
      taken the post she would have felt compelled, compelled by all she had
      done for him, to share its honours with him; and this, ever since at her
      bidding he had begun to gather such things up, was precisely what she had
      lost all inclination to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were married the following October. We had a big, gorgeous official
      wedding, which we both enjoyed enormously. I took furlough, and we went
      home, but we found London very expensive and the country very slow; and
      with my K.C.S.I. came the offer of the Membership, so we went back to
      Simla for three perfectly unnecessary years, which we now look back upon
      with pleasure and regret. I fear that we, no more than Ingersoll Armour,
      were quite whole-hearted Bohemians; but I don&rsquo;t know that we really ever
      pretended to be.

      Chapter 3.I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When it became known that Madeline Anderson had finally decided to go
      abroad for two years, her little circle in New York naturally talked a
      good deal, in review, about her curious reason for never having gone
      before. So much that happened afterward, so much that I am going to tell,
      depends upon this reason for not going before, that I also must talk about
      it and explain it; I could never bring it out just as we went along. It
      would have been a curious reason in connection with anybody, but doubly so
      as explaining the behaviour of Miss Anderson, whose profile gave you the
      impression that she was anything but the shuttlecock of her emotions.
      Shortly, her reason was a convict, Number 1596, who, up to February in
      that year, had been working, or rather waiting, out his sentence in the
      State penitentiary. So long as he worked or waited, Madeline remained in
      New York, but when in February death gave him his quittance, she took her
      freedom too, with wide intentions and many coupons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier in his career Number 1596 had been known in New York society as
      Mr. Frederick Prendergast, and for a little while he was disapproved there
      on the score of having engaged himself to a Miss Anderson, Madeline
      Anderson, whom nobody knew anything about. There was her own little
      circle, as I have said, and it lacked neither dignity nor refinement, but
      I doubt whether any member of it was valeted from London, or could imply,
      in conversation, a personal acquaintance with Yvette Guilbert. There is no
      need, however, to insist that there are many persons of comfortable income
      and much cultivation in New York, who would not be met by strangers having
      what are called the &lsquo;best&rsquo; introductions there. The best so often fails to
      include the better. It may be accepted that Madeline Anderson and her
      people were of these, and that she wondered sometimes during the brief
      days of her engagement what it would be like to belong to the brilliant
      little world about her that had its visiting list in London, Paris, or St.
      Petersburg, and was immensely entertained by the gaucheries of the great
      ones of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came, with the most unexceptionable introductions, Miss Violet Forde,
      from a Sloane Square address, London. She came leaning on the arm of a
      brother, the only relative she had in the world, and so brilliant was the
      form of these young people that it occurred to nobody to imagine that it
      had the most precarious pecuniary foundation, must have faded and
      shrivelled indeed, after another year or two of anything but hospitality
      as generous as that of New York. Well-nourished and undimmed, however, it
      concealed for them admirably the fact that it was the hospitality they
      were after, and not the bracing climate or the desire to see the
      fascinating Americans of London and Paris at home. New York found them
      agreeable specimens of high-spirited young English people, and played with
      them indefinitely. Miss Forde, when she sat imperturbably on a cushion in
      the middle of the floor after dinner and sang to a guitar the songs of
      Albert Chevalier, was an anomaly in English decorum that was as pleasing
      to observe as it was amusing to criticize.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Americans she met delighted in drawing her out&mdash;it was a pastime
      that took the lead at dinner-parties, to an extent which her hostess often
      thought preposterous&mdash;and she responded with naivete and vigour,
      perfectly aware that she was scoring all along the line. Upon many
      charming people she made the impression that she was a type of the most
      finished class of what they called &lsquo;English society girls,&rsquo; that she
      represented the best they could do over there in this direction. As a
      matter of fact she might have sat to any of those &lsquo;black and white&rsquo; 
      artists, who draw townish young women of London, saying cynical things to
      young men in the weekly papers. That was her type, and if you look for her
      picture there, you will see that her face was very accurately oval, with
      eyes that knew their value, and other features that didn&rsquo;t very much
      matter, except in so far as they expressed a very full conception of the
      satisfactions of this life, and a wide philosophy as to methods of
      obtaining them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick Prendergast was unacquainted with the popular pictures I have
      mentioned, having a very reasonable preference for the illustrated papers
      of his own country; otherwise&mdash;there is no telling&mdash;he might
      have observed the resemblance and escaped the State prison, whither he
      assuredly never would have gone had he married Madeline Anderson&mdash;as
      he fully intended to do when Miss Forde came over. He was worth at that
      time a great deal of money, besides being more personable than any one
      would have believed who knew him as &lsquo;1596.&rsquo; His fiancee was never too
      obtrusively in evidence, and if Miss Forde thought of Miss Anderson with
      any scruple, it was probably to reflect that if she could not take care of
      these things she did not deserve to have them. This at all events was how
      her attitude expressed itself practically; and the upshot was that Miss
      Anderson lost them. There came a day when Frederick Prendergast, in much
      discomfort of mind, took to Violet the news that Madeline had brought
      their engagement to an end. She, Violet, gave him some tea, and they
      talked frankly of the absurd misconception of the relations between them
      upon which his dismissal was founded; and Prendergast went away much
      comforted and wholly disposed to respect Miss Anderson&rsquo;s startling wishes.
      She, with what both the others thought excellent taste, persuaded her
      mother and sister to move to Brooklyn; and so far as the thoroughfares and
      social theatres of New York were concerned, the city over the river might
      have been a nunnery which had closed its gates upon her. It was only in
      imagination that she heard Frederick Prendergast&rsquo;s wedding-bells when, two
      months later, he was united to Miss Forde in Grace Church, and that after
      the fact, their melody being brought to her inner sense next day by the
      marriage notice in the &lsquo;Tribune&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be painful, in view of what we know of Frederick Prendergast, to
      dwell upon what Madeline Anderson undeniably felt. Besides her emotions
      were not destructively acute, they only lasted longer than any one could
      have either expected or approved. She suffered for him as well; she saw as
      plainly as he did the first sordid consequences of his mistake the
      afternoon he came to solicit her friendship, having lost other claims; and
      it was then perhaps, that her responsibility in allowing Violet Forde to
      spoil his life for him began to suggest itself to her. Up to that time she
      had thought of the matter differently, as she would have said, selfishly.
      He was not permitted to come again; but he went away lightened, inasmuch
      as he had added his burden to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a year later the national credit involved that of Prendergast&rsquo;s firm,
      Madeline read financial articles in the newspapers with heavy concern,
      surprising her family with views on &lsquo;sound money&rsquo;; and when, shortly
      afterward, his partners brought that unhappy young man before the criminal
      courts for an irregular use of the firm&rsquo;s signature, which further
      involved it beyond hope of extrication, there was no moment of the day
      which did not find her, in spirit, beside him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case dragged on through appeal, and the decision of the lower courts
      was not reversed. The day this became known the fact also transpired that
      poor Prendergast would never live to complete his ten years&rsquo; term of
      imprisonment. He went to prison with hardly more than one lung, and in the
      most favourable physical condition to get rid of the other. Mrs.
      Prendergast wept a little over the installation, and assured Frederick
      that it was perfectly absurd; they were certain to get him out again;
      people always got people out again in America. She took him grapes and
      flowers once a week for about a month, and then she sailed for Europe. She
      put it about that her stay was to be as brief as was consistent with the
      transaction of certain necessary business in London; but she never came
      back, and Madeline Anderson had taken her place, in so far as the grapes
      and flowers were concerned, for many months, when the announcement of his
      wife&rsquo;s death reached Prendergast in an English paper published in Paris.
      About a year after that it began to be thought singular how he picked up
      in health, and Madeline&rsquo;s mother and sister occasionally romanced about
      the possibility of his recovering and marrying her after all&mdash;they
      had an enormous opinion of the artistic virtue of forgiveness&mdash;but it
      was not a contingency ever seriously contemplated by Miss Anderson
      herself. Her affection, pricked on by remorse, had long satisfied itself
      with the duties of her ministry. If she would not leave him until he died,
      it was because there was no one but herself to brighten the long day in
      the prison hospital for him, because she had thrown him into the arms of
      the woman who had deserted him, because he represented in her fancy her
      life&rsquo;s only budding towards the sun. Her patience lasted through six
      years, which was four years longer than any doctor had given Frederick
      Prendergast to live; but when one last morning she found an empty bed, and
      learned that Number 1596 had been discharged in his coffin, she rose from
      the shock with the sense of a task fully performed and a well-developed
      desire to see what else there might be in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She announced her intention of travelling for a year or two with a maid,
      and her family expressed the usual acquiescence. It would help her, they
      said, to &lsquo;shake it off&rsquo;; but they said that to one another. They were not
      aware&mdash;and it would have spoiled an ideal for them if they had been&mdash;that
      she had shaken it off, quite completely, into Prendergast&rsquo;s grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the curious reason why Miss Anderson&rsquo;s travels were so long
      postponed.

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Madeline&rsquo;s fancy to enjoy the contrast between West and East in all
      its sharpness, so she and Brookes embarked at San Francisco for Yokohama.
      Their wanderings in Japan were ideal, in spite of Brookes&rsquo;s ungrateful
      statement that she could have done with fewer eggs and more bacon; and
      Madeline prolonged the appeal of the country to her sense of humour and
      fantasy, putting off her departure for India from week to week. She went
      at last in March; and found herself down with fever at Benares in the
      middle of one particularly hot April, two months after the last of her
      fellow travellers had sailed from Bombay, haunted on her baking pillow by
      pictorial views of the burning ghat and the vultures. The station doctor,
      using appalling language to her punkah-coolie, ordered her to the hills;
      and thus it was that she went to Simla, where she had no intention of
      going, and where this story really begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brookes has always declared that Providence in sending Miss Anderson to
      Simla had it in mind to prevent a tragedy; but as to that there is room
      for a difference of opinion: besides I can not be anticipated by Brookes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the oddest place imaginable, and in many ways the most delightful,&rsquo; 
      Madeline wrote to her sister Adele, &lsquo;this microcosm of Indian official
      society withdrawn from all the world, and playing at being a municipality
      on three Himalayan mountaintops. You can&rsquo;t imagine its individuality, its
      airy, unsubstantial, superior poise. How can I explain to you elderly
      gentlemen, whose faces express daily electric communications with the
      Secretary of State, playing tennis violently every single afternoon in
      striped flannels&mdash;writing letters of admonition to the Amir all day
      long, and in the evening, with the assistance of yellow wigs and make-up
      sticks from the Calcutta hair-dresser, imagining that they produce things,
      poor dears, only a LITTLE less well done than is done at the Lyceum?
      Nothing is beyond them. I assure you they are contemplating at the moment
      &lsquo;The Second Mrs. Tanqueray&rsquo;. The effect of remoteness from the world, I
      suppose, and the enormous mutual appreciation of people who have watched
      each other climb. For to arrive officially at Simla they have had to climb
      in more ways than one...It is all so hilarious, so high-spirited, so young
      and yet, my word! what a cult of official dignity underlying! I saw a
      staff-officer in full uniform, red and white feathers and all, going to
      the birthday dinner at the Viceroy&rsquo;s the other evening in a perambulator&mdash;rickshaw,
      you know, such as they have in Japan. That is typical of the place. All
      the honours and dignities&mdash;and a perambulator to put them in&mdash;or
      a ridiculous little white-washed house made of mud and tin, and calling
      itself Warwick Castle, Blenheim, Abbotsford! They haven&rsquo;t a very good
      hold, these Simla residences, and sometimes they slip fifty yards or so
      down the mountain-side, but the chimneys (bad pun coming) are never any
      more out of drawing than they were before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet&mdash;never forget&mdash;the queer little place has a nobility, drawn
      I suppose from high standards of conduct in essentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;...This matter of precedence is a bore for an outsider. I am very tired
      of being taken in to dinner by subalterns, because I have no &ldquo;official
      position.&rdquo; Something of the kind was offered me, by the way, the other
      day, by a little gunner with red eyelids, in the Ordnance Department,
      named McDermott&mdash;Captain McDermott. He took my declining very
      cheerfully, said he knew Americans didn&rsquo;t like Englishmen, who hadn&rsquo;t been
      taught to pronounce their &ldquo;g&rsquo;s,&rdquo; but hoped I would change my mind before
      the rains, when he was goin&rsquo; down. Of course I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. The red eyelids
      alone...I am living in a boarding-house precisely under the deodars, and
      have &ldquo;tiffin&rdquo; with Mrs. Hauksbee every day when neither of us are having
      it anywhere else. And I&rsquo;ve been told the original of &ldquo;General Bangs,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;that most immoral man.&rdquo; You remember, don&rsquo;t you, the heliograph incident&mdash;I
      needn&rsquo;t quote it. It really happened! and the General still lives, none
      the worse&mdash;perhaps rather greater. Quite half the people seem
      materializations of Kipling, and it&rsquo;s very interesting; but one mustn&rsquo;t
      say so if one wants to be popular. Talking of materializations, I saw the
      original of Crawford&rsquo;s Mr. Isaacs, too, the other day. He used to be a
      diamond agent among the native princes when Crawford knew him. When I saw
      him he was auctioning off his collection of curios and things. These types
      of novelists look wonderfully little impaired; I suppose it&rsquo;s the dry air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;P.S.&mdash;Brookes is also quite happy. She was much struck, on arriving,
      by an apparent anomaly in nature. &ldquo;Have you noticed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;how at this height all the birds are crows and monkeys?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Anderson described Simla exhaustively in her letters to New York. She
      touched upon almost every feature, from Mrs. Mickie and Mrs. Gammidge,
      whose husbands were perspiring in the Plains, and nobody telling them
      anything, to the much larger number of ladies interested in the work of
      the Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association; from the &lsquo;type&rsquo; of the Military
      Secretary to the Viceroy to that of Ali Buksh, who sold raw turquoises in
      a little carved shop in the bazaar. I should like to quote more of her
      letters, but if I did I should find nothing about Colonel Horace Innes,
      who represented&mdash;she often acknowledged to herself&mdash;her only
      serious interest. Miss Anderson took the world at its own light valuation
      as it came; but she had a scale of recognitions and acceptances, which she
      kept apart for the very few, and Innes had claimed a place in it the first
      time they met. It seems a trifle ungrateful that she should have left him
      out, since it was he who gave her a standard by which to measure the
      frivolity of Simla. He went to gymkhanas&mdash;if he knew she was going&mdash;but
      he towered almost pictorially above them; and when he talked to Madeline
      his shoulders expressed a resentment of possible interruptions that
      isolated him still further. I would not suggest that he was superior by
      conviction; he was only intent, whereas most of the other people were
      extremely diffused, and discriminating, while the intimacies of the rest
      were practically coextensive with Government House list. Neither, for his
      part, would he admit that the tone of Simla was as wholly flippant as I
      have implied. They often talked about it; he recognized it as a feature
      likely to compel the attention of people from other parts of the world;
      and one afternoon he asked her, with some directness, if she could see no
      tragedies underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tragedies of the heart?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;Oh, I can not take them seriously.
      The emotion is so ephemeral! A woman came to tea with me three days ago,
      and made me her confessor. It was unexpected; if it hadn&rsquo;t been, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have asked her to tea. She was so unhappy that she forgot about
      the rouge, and it all came off on her handkerchief when she cried. The man
      likes somebody else better this season. Well, I gave her nougat and cheap
      cynicisms, and she allowed herself to be comforted! Why, the loves of
      kitchen-maids are more dignified.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were riding on the broad four-mile road, blasted out of the rock,
      that winds round Jakko. The deodars stood thick above them, with the
      sunlight filtering through; a thousand feet below lay the little square
      fields, yellow and green, of the King of Koti. The purple-brown Himalayas
      shouldered the eye out to the horizon, and there the Snows lifted
      themselves, hardly more palpable than the drifted clouds, except for a
      gleam of ice in their whiteness. A low stone wall ran along the verge of
      the precipice, and, looking down, they saw tangled patches of the white
      wild rose of the Himalayas, waving and drooping over the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said Innes, &lsquo;you are not even upon the fringe of the
      situation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the situation as I see it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then&mdash;excuse me&mdash;you do not see deep enough. That poor lady
      suffered, I suppose, to the extent of her capacity. You would not have
      have increased it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I should have preferred not to measure it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides, that was not quite the sort of thing I had in mind. I was
      thinking more of the&mdash;separations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not fair to ask women to live much in India. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the
      children, sometimes it&rsquo;s ill health, sometimes it&rsquo;s natural antipathy to
      the place; there&rsquo;s always a reason to take them away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Madeline, turning a glance of scrutiny on him. His face was
      impassive; he was watching mechanically for a chance to slay a teasing
      green spider-fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the beginning of the tragedy I was thinking of. Time does the
      rest, time and the aridity of separations. How many men and women can hold
      themselves together with letters? I don&rsquo;t mean aging or any physical
      change. I don&rsquo;t mean change at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Madeline, and this time, though her curiosity was greater, she
      did not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. The mind could accustom itself to expect that, and so forestall the
      blow, if it really would be a blow, which I doubt. For myself, I&rsquo;m pretty
      sure that nothing of that kind could have much effect upon one&rsquo;s feeling,
      if it were the real thing.&rsquo; He spoke practically to himself, as if he had
      reasoned this out many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; said Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But separation can do a worse thing than that. It can REINTRODUCE people,
      having deprived them of their mutual illusion under which they married. If
      they lived together the illusion would go, I suppose, but custom and
      comfort would step in to prevent a jar. There never would be that awful
      revelation of indifference.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped sharply, and the hope went through Madeline&rsquo;s mind that her
      face expressed no personal concern for him. There was a small red stain in
      the brown of his cheek as he looked at her to find out, and he added,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve known&mdash;in Bombay&mdash;one or two bad cases of that. But, of
      course, it is the wife who suffers most. Shall we canter on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a minute,&rsquo; said Madeline, and he drew his rein again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not let this be the last word; he must not imagine that she had
      seen, through the simple crystal of his convictions, the personal
      situation that gave them to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; she said, thoughtfully, &lsquo;you know the Anglo-Indian world and
      I don&rsquo;t. You must have observed this that you speak of it; it sounds only
      too probable. And I confess it makes my little impression very vulgar and
      superficial.&rsquo; She turned her head and a candid smile to him. &lsquo;All the
      same, I fancy that the people who are capable of suffering much that way
      are the exceptions. And&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I believe there is more
      cheap sentiment in this place than the other kind. What do you think I
      heard a woman say the other day at a tiffin-party? &ldquo;No man has touched my
      heart since I&rsquo;ve been married,&rdquo; she proclaimed, &ldquo;except my husband!&rdquo; AT A
      TIFFIN-party!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the relief in Innes&rsquo;s laugh and was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does it happen,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that women nowadays are critical of the
      world so young?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be thirty in September, and we no longer look at society through
      a tambour-frame,&rsquo; she said, hardily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I shall be forty-three next month, but hitherto I have known it to
      produce nothing like you,&rsquo; he returned, and if there was ambiguity in his
      phrase there was none in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Anderson made with her head her little smiling gesture&mdash;Simla
      called it very American&mdash;which expressed that all chivalrous speech
      was to be taken for granted and meant nothing whatever; and as they turned
      into the Ladies&rsquo; Mile gave her horse his head, and herself a chance for
      meditation. She thought of the matter again that evening before her little
      fire of snapping deodar twigs, thought of it intently. She remembered it
      all with perfect distinctness; she might have been listening to a
      telephonic reproduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the almost intimate glimpse Innes had given her of himself, and it
      brought her an excitement which she did not think of analyzing. She wrung
      from every sentence its last possibility of unconscious meaning, and she
      found when she had finished that it was eleven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went to bed, preferring not to call Brookes, with the somewhat
      foolish feeling of being unable to account for her evening. Her last
      reflection before she slept shaped itself in her mind in definite words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are no children,&rsquo; it ran, &lsquo;and her health has always been good, he
      says. She must have left him after that first six months in Lucknow,
      because of a natural antipathy to the country&mdash;and when she
      condescended to come out again for a winter he met the different lady he
      thinks about. With little hard lines around the mouth and common
      conventional habits of thought, full of subservience to his official
      superiors, and perfectly uninterested in him except as the source of
      supplies. But I don&rsquo;t know why I should WANT her to be so disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Mrs. Innes, travelling at the moment with the mails
      from London to Bombay, was hastening to present to Miss Anderson features
      astonishingly different.

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The lady guests at Peliti&rsquo;s&mdash;Mrs. Jack Owen and the rest&mdash;were
      giving a tea in the hotel pavilion. They had the band, the wife of the
      Commander-in-Chief, the governess from Viceregal Lodge and one little
      Viceregal girl, three A.D.C.&lsquo;s, one member of council, and the Archdeacon.
      These were the main features, moving among a hundred or so of people more
      miscellaneous, who, like the ladies at Peliti&rsquo;s, had come up out of the
      seething Plains to the Paradise of the summer capital. The Pavilion
      overhung the Mall; looking down one could see the coming and going of
      leisurely Government peons in scarlet and gold, Cashmiri vendors of great
      bales of embroideries and skins, big-turbaned Pahari horse-dealers,
      chaffering in groups, and here and there a mounted Secretary-sahib
      trotting to the Club. Beyond, the hills dipped blue and bluer to the
      plains, and against them hung a single waving yellow laburnum, a note of
      imagination. Madeline Anderson was looking at it when Mrs. Mickie and Mrs.
      Gammidge came up with an affectionate observation upon the cut of her
      skirt, after which Mrs. Mickie harked back to what they had been talking
      about before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s straight enough now, I suppose,&rsquo; this lady said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She goes down. But she gives people a good deal of latitude for
      speculation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is this?&rsquo; asked Madeline. &lsquo;I ask for information, to keep out of her
      way. I find I am developing the most shocking curiosity. I must be in a
      position to check it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies exchanged hardly perceptible glances. Then Mrs. Gammidge said,
      &lsquo;Mrs. Innes,&rsquo; and looked as if, for the moment, at any rate, she would
      withhold further judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t avoid the poor lady,&rsquo; put in Mrs. Mickie, &lsquo;simply because
      of her past. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair. Besides&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her past?&rsquo; Madeline made one little effort to look indifferent, and then
      let the question leap up in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Gammidge, with brief impatience, &lsquo;he married her in
      Cairo, and she was&mdash;dancing there. Case of chivalry, I believe,
      though there are different versions. Awful row in the regiment&mdash;he
      had to take a year&rsquo;s leave. Then he succeeded to the command, and the
      Twenty-third were ordered out here. She came with him to Lucknow&mdash;and
      made slaves of every one of them. They&rsquo;ll swear to you now that she was
      staying at Shepheard&rsquo;s with an invalid mother when he met her. And now
      she&rsquo;s accepted like everybody else; and that&rsquo;s all there is about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in that,&rsquo; said Madeline, determinedly, &lsquo;to prove that she
      wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;respectable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;N&mdash;no. Of course not,&rsquo; and again the eye of Mrs. Gammidge met that
      of Mrs. Mickie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though, you see love,&rsquo; added the latter lady, &lsquo;it would have been nicer
      for his people&mdash;they&rsquo;ve never spoken to him since&mdash;if she had
      been making her living otherwise in Cairo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As a barmaid, for instance,&rsquo; said Madeline, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As a barmaid, for instance,&rsquo; repeated Mrs. Gammidge, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Simla isn&rsquo;t related to him&mdash;Simla doesn&rsquo;t care!&rsquo; Mrs. Mickie
      exclaimed. &lsquo;Everybody will be as polite as possible when she turns up.
      You&rsquo;ll see. You knew, didn&rsquo;t you, that she was coming out in the
      Caledonia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Madeline. She looked carefully where she was going to put her
      coffee-cup, and then she glanced out again at the laburnum hanging over
      the plains. &lsquo;I&mdash;I am glad to hear it. These separations you take so
      lightly out here are miserable, tragic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other ladies did not exchange glances this time. Miss Anderson&rsquo;s
      change of tone was too marked for comment which she might have detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Colonel Innes got the telegram this morning. She wired from Brindisi,&rsquo; 
      Mrs. Gammidge said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he seem pleased?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Mickie, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said he was afraid she would find it very hot coming up here from
      Bombay. And, of course, he is worried about a house. When a man has been
      living for months at the Club&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, poor fellow! I do love that dear old Colonel Innes, though I
      can&rsquo;t say I know him a bit. He won&rsquo;t take the trouble to be nice to me,
      but I am perfectly certain he must be the dearest old thing inside of him.
      Worth any dozen of these little bow-wows that run round after rickshaws,&rsquo; 
      said Mrs. Mickie, with candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he&rsquo;s a ridiculous old glacier,&rsquo; Mrs. Gammidge remarked, and Mrs.
      Mickie looked at Madeline and said, &lsquo;Slap her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; asked Miss Anderson, with composure. &lsquo;I dare say he is&mdash;occasionally.
      It isn&rsquo;t a bad thing to be, I should think, in Indian temperatures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I guess you got it that time, dear lady,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mickie to Mrs.
      Gammidge, as Madeline slipped toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Meant to be cross, did she? How silly of her! If she gives her little
      heart away like that often, people will begin to make remarks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The worst of that girl is,&rsquo; Mrs. Mickie continued, &lsquo;that you never can
      depend upon her. For days together she&rsquo;ll be just as giddy and jolly as
      anybody and then suddenly she&rsquo;ll give you a nasty superior bit of ice down
      the back of your neck like that. I&rsquo;ve got her coming to tea tomorrow
      afternoon,&rsquo; Mrs. Mickie added, with sudden gloom, &lsquo;and little Lord Billy
      and all that set are coming. They&rsquo;ll throw buns at each other&mdash;I know
      they will. What, in heaven&rsquo;s name, made me ask her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll have recovered by then. You must make allowance for the shock
      we gave her, poor dear. Consider how you would feel if Lady Worsley
      suddenly appeared upon the scene, and demanded devotion from Sir Frank.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t get it,&rsquo; Mrs. Mickie dimpled candidly. &lsquo;Frank always loses
      his heart and his conscience at the same time. But you don&rsquo;t suppose
      there&rsquo;s anything serious in this affair? Pure pretty platonics, I should
      call it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gammidge lifted her eyebrows. &lsquo;I dare say that is what they imagine
      it. Well, they&rsquo;re never in the same room for two minutes without being
      aware of it, and their absorption when they get in a corner&mdash;I saw
      her keep the Viceroy waiting, the other night after dinner, while Colonel
      Innes finished a sentence. And then she was annoyed at the interruption.
      Here&rsquo;s Kitty Vesey, lookin&rsquo; SUCH a dog! Hello, Kitty! where did you get
      that hat, where did you get that tile? But that wasn&rsquo;t the colour of your
      hair last week, Kitty!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t feel any kind of a dog&rsquo;&mdash;Mrs. Vesey&rsquo;s pout, though becoming,
      was genuine. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in a perfectly furious rage, my dears, and I&rsquo;m coming
      home to cry, just as soon as I&rsquo;ve had an ice. What do you think&mdash;they
      won&rsquo;t let me have Val for Captain Wynne&rsquo;s part in &lsquo;The Outcast Pearl&rsquo;&mdash;they
      say he&rsquo;s been tried before, and he&rsquo;s a stick. Did you ever hear of such
      brutes? They want me to act with Major Dalton, and he&rsquo;s MUCH too old for
      the part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kitten,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mickie, with conviction, &lsquo;Valentine Drake on the stage
      would be fatal to your affection for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care, I won&rsquo;t act with anybody else&mdash;I&rsquo;ll throw up the part.
      Haven&rsquo;t I got to make love to the man? How am I to play up to such an
      unkissable-looking animal as Major Dalton? I shall CERTAINLY throw up the
      part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything rash, Kitty. If you do, they&rsquo;ll probably offer it to
      me, and I warn you I won&rsquo;t give it back to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, refuse it, like a dear! I am dying to put them in a hole. It&rsquo;s
      jealousy, that&rsquo;s what it is. Goodbye, Mrs. Jack, I&rsquo;ve had a lovely time.
      Val and I have been explaining our affection to the Archdeacon, and he
      says it&rsquo;s perfectly innocent. We&rsquo;re going to get him to put it on paper to
      produce when Jimmy sues for a divorce, aren&rsquo;t we, Val?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going?&rsquo; said Mrs. Jack Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, I must. But I&rsquo;ve enjoyed myself awfully, and so has everybody
      I&rsquo;ve been talking to. I say, Mickie, dear&mdash;about tomorrow afternoon&mdash;I
      suppose I may bring Val?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear, yes,&rsquo; Mrs. Mickie replied. &lsquo;But you must let me hold his hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know which of you is the most ridiculous,&rsquo; Mrs. Owen remarked; &lsquo;I
      shall write to both your husbands this very night,&rsquo; but as the group
      shifted and left her alone with Mrs. Gammidge, she said she didn&rsquo;t know
      whether Mrs. Vesey would be quite so chirpy three weeks hence. &lsquo;When Mrs.
      Innes comes out,&rsquo; she added in explanation. &lsquo;Oh, yes, Valentine Drake is
      quite her property. My own idea is that Kitty won&rsquo;t be in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the road past Peliti&rsquo;s dips to the Mall Madeline met Horace Innes.
      When she appeared in her rickshaw he dismounted, and gave the reins to his
      syce. She saw in his eyes the look of a person who has been all day
      lapsing into meditation and rousing himself from it. &lsquo;You are very late,&rsquo; 
      she said as he came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going; at least, you are just coming away, aren&rsquo;t you? I
      think it is too late. I&rsquo;ll turn back with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do,&rsquo; she said, and looked at his capable, sensitive hand as he laid it on
      the side of her little carriage. Miss Anderson had not the accomplishment
      of palm-reading, but she took general manual impressions. She had observed
      Colonel Innes&rsquo;s hand before, but it had never offered itself so intimately
      to her inspection. That, perhaps, was why the conviction seemed new to
      her, as she thought &lsquo;He is admirable&mdash;and it is all there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got to the level Mall he kept his hold, which was a perfectly
      natural and proper thing for him to do, walking alongside; but she still
      looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard your good news,&rsquo; she said, smiling congratulation at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good news? Oh, about my wife, of course. Yes, she ought to be here by
      the end of the month. I thought of writing to tell you when the telegram
      came, and then I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t. The files drove it out of my head, I
      fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heavy day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, absently. They went along together in an intimacy of
      silence, and Madeline was quite aware of the effort with which she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall look forward to meeting Mrs. Innes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that his smile was perfunctory, but he put it on with
      creditable alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will be delighted. My wife is a clever woman,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;very
      bright and attractive. She keeps people well amused.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She must be a great success in India, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think she is liked. She has a tremendous fund of humour and spirits. A
      fellow feels terribly dull beside her sometimes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline cast a quick glance at him, but he was only occupied to find
      other matters with which he might commend his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is very fond of animals,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and she sings and plays well&mdash;really
      extremely well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That must be charming,&rsquo; murmured Madeline, privately iterating, &lsquo;He
      doesn&rsquo;t mean to damn her&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t mean to damn her.&rsquo; &lsquo;Have you a
      photograph of her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quantities of them,&rsquo; he said, with simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have never shown me one. But how could you?&rsquo; she added in haste; &lsquo;a
      photograph is always about the size of a door nowadays. It is simply
      impossible to keep one&rsquo;s friends and relations in a pocketbook as one used
      to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They might have stopped there, but some demon of persistence drove
      Madeline on. She besought help from her imagination; she was not for the
      moment honest. It was an impulse&mdash;an equivocal impulse&mdash;born
      doubtless of the equivocal situation, and it ended badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will bring something of the spring out to you,&rsquo; said Madeline&mdash;&lsquo;the
      spring in England. How many years is it since you have seen it? There will
      be a breath of the cowslips about her, and in her eyes the soft wet of the
      English sky. Oh, you will be very glad to see her.&rsquo; The girl was well
      aware of her insincerity, but only dimly of her cruelty. She was drawn on
      by something stronger than her sense of honesty and humanity, a
      determination to see, to know, that swept these things away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Innes&rsquo;s hand tightened on the rickshaw, and he made at first no answer.
      Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has been staying in town, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was just a quiver of Madeline&rsquo;s eyelid; it said nothing of the
      natural rapacity behind. This man&rsquo;s testimony was coming out in throes,
      and yet&mdash;it must be said&mdash;again she probed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then she will put you in touch again,&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;you will remember when
      you see her all the vigour of great issues and the fascination of great
      personalities. For a little while, anyway, after she comes, you will be in
      a world&mdash;far away from here&mdash;where people talk and think and
      live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in wonder, not understanding, as indeed how could he?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you speak of what YOU have done&rsquo;; and before the truth of
      this she cast down her eyes and turned a hot, deep red, and had nothing to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my wife is not like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked along in absorption, from which he roused himself with
      resentment in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can not leave such a fabric of illusion in your mind. It irritates me
      that it should be there&mdash;about anybody belonging to me. My wife is
      not in the least what you imagine her. She has her virtues, but she is&mdash;like
      the rest. I can not hope that you will take to her, and she won&rsquo;t like you
      either&mdash;we never care about the same people. And we shall see nothing
      of you&mdash;nothing. I can hardly believe that I am saying this of my own
      wife, but&mdash;I wish that she had stayed in England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Mickie!&rsquo; cried Madeline to a passing rickshaw, &lsquo;what are you rushing
      on like that for? Just go quietly and peaceably along with us, please, and
      tell us what Mrs. Vesey decided to do about her part in &lsquo;The Outcast
      Pearl&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m dining out tonight&mdash;I must know.&rsquo; And Mrs. Mickie was
      kind enough to accompany them all the rest of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Anderson dined out, and preferred to suppose that she had no time to
      think until she was on her way home along the empty road round Jakko at
      eleven o&rsquo;clock that night. Then it pleased her to get out of her rickshaw
      and walk. There was an opulent moon, the vast hills curving down to the
      plains were all grey and silvery, and the deodars overhead fretted the
      road with dramatic shadows. About her hung the great stillness in a mighty
      loneliness in which little Simla is set, and it freed her from what had
      happened, so that she could look at it and cry out. She actually did
      speak, pausing in the little pavilion on the road where the nursemaids
      gather in the daytime, but very low, so that her words fell round her even
      in that silence, and hardly a deodar was aware. &lsquo;I will not go now,&rsquo; she
      said. &lsquo;I will stay and realize that he is another woman&rsquo;s husband. That
      should cure me if anything will&mdash;to see him surrounded by the
      commonplaces of married life, that kind of married life. I will stay till
      she comes and a fortnight after. Besides, I want to see her&mdash;I want
      to see how far she comes short.&rsquo; She was silent for a moment, and the
      moonlight played upon her smile of quiet triumph. &lsquo;He cares too,&rsquo; she
      said; &lsquo;he cares too, but he doesn&rsquo;t know it, and I promise you one thing,
      Madeline Anderson, you won&rsquo;t help him to find out. And in five weeks I
      will go away and leave my love where I found it&mdash;on a mountaintop in
      the middle of Asia!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madeline did her best to make certain changes delicately, imperceptibly,
      so that Innes would not, above all things, be perplexed into seeking for
      their reason. The walks and rides came to a vague conclusion, and Miss
      Anderson no longer kept the Viceroy or anybody else waiting, while Innes
      finished what he had to say to her in public, since his opportunities for
      talking to her seemed to become gradually more and more like everybody
      else&rsquo;s. So long as she had been mistress of herself she was indifferent to
      the very tolerant and good-natured gossip of the hill capital; but as soon
      as she found her citadel undermined, the lightest kind of comment became a
      contingency unbearable. In arranging to make it impossible, she was really
      over-considerate and over-careful. Her soldier never thought of analyzing
      his bad luck or searching for motive in it. To him the combinations of
      circumstances that seemed always to deprive him of former pleasures were
      simply among the things that might happen. Grieving, she left him under
      that impression for the sake of its expediency, and tried to make it by
      being more than ever agreeable on the occasions when he came and demanded
      a cup of tea, and would not be denied. After all, she consoled herself, no
      situation was improved by being turned too suddenly upside down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not wholly withdraw his privilege of taking counsel with her, and
      he continued to go away freshened and calmed, leaving her to toss little
      sad reflections into the fire, and tremulously wonder whether the jewel of
      her love had flashed ever so little behind the eyes. They both saw it a
      conspicuous thing that as those three weeks went on, neither he nor she
      alluded even remotely to Mrs. Innes, but the fact remained, and they
      allowed it to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Madeline knew precisely when that lady was expected, and as
      she sauntered in the bazaar one morning, and heard Innes&rsquo;s steps and voice
      behind her, her mind became one acute surmise as to whether he could
      possibly postpone the announcement any longer. But he immediately made it
      plain that this was his business in stopping to speak to her. &lsquo;Good
      morning,&rsquo; he said, and then, &lsquo;My wife comes tomorrow.&rsquo; He had not told her
      a bit of personal news, he had made her an official communication, as
      briefly as it could be done, and he would have raised his hat and gone on
      without more words if Madeline had not thwarted him. &lsquo;What a stupidity for
      him to be haunted by afterward!&rsquo; was the essence of the thought that
      visited her; and she put out a detaining hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really! By the Bombay mail, I suppose&mdash;no, an hour or so later;
      private tongas are always as much as that behind the mail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About eleven, I fancy. You&mdash;you are not inclined for a canter round
      Summer Hill before breakfast?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am terrified of Summer Hill. The Turk always misbehaves there.
      Yesterday he got one leg well over the khud&mdash;I WAS thankful he had
      four. Tell me, are you ready for Mrs. Innes&mdash;everything in the house?
      Is there anything I can do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, thanks very much! I don&rsquo;t think so. The house isn&rsquo;t ready, as a
      matter of fact, but two or three people have offered to put us up for a
      day or so until it is. I&rsquo;ve left it open till my wife comes, as I dare say
      she has already arranged to go to somebody. What are you buying? Country
      tobacco, upon my word! For your men? That&rsquo;s subversive of all discipline!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines on his face relaxed; he looked at her with fond recognition of
      another delightful thing in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You give sugar-cane to your horses,&rsquo; she declared; &lsquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t I give
      tobacco to mine? Goodbye; I hope Mrs. Innes will like &ldquo;Two Gables&rdquo;. There
      are roses waiting for her in the garden, at all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are there?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice. Goodbye, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to his office thinking of the roses, and that they were in his
      garden, and that Madeline had seen them there. He thought that if they
      were good roses&mdash;in fact, any kind of roses&mdash;they should be
      taken care of, and he asked a Deputy Assistant Inspector-General of
      Ordnance whether he knew of a gardener that was worth anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most of them are mere coolies,&rsquo; said Colonel Innes, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve got some
      roses in this little place I&rsquo;ve taken that I want to look after.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Madeline took Brookes, and &lsquo;The Amazing Marriage&rsquo;, and a
      lunch-basket, and went out to Mashobra, where the deodars shadow hardly
      any scandal at all, and the Snows come, with perceptible confidence, a
      little nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They almost step,&rsquo; she said to Brookes, looking at them, &lsquo;out of the
      realm of the imagination.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brookes said that they did indeed, and hoped that she hadn&rsquo;t by any chance
      forgotten the mustard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wind is keen off the glaciers over there&mdash;anybody would think of
      a condiment,&rsquo; Miss Anderson remarked in deprecation, and to this Brookes
      made no response. It was a liberty she often felt compelled to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Snows appealed to Madeline even more than did Carintha, Countess of
      Fleetwood, to whose fortunes she gave long pauses while she looked across
      their summits at renunciation, and fancied her spirit made strong and
      equal to its task. She was glad of their sanctuary; she did not know where
      she should find such another. Perhaps the spectacle was more than ever
      sublime in its alternative to the one she had come away to postpone the
      sight of; at all events it drove the reunion of the Inneses from her mind
      several times for five minutes together, during which she thought of
      Horace by himself, and went over, by way of preparation for her departure,
      all that had come and gone between them. There had been luminous moments,
      especially as they irradiated him, and she dwelt on these. There was no
      reason why she should not preserve in London or in New York a careful
      memory of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the lights were twinkling all up and down and round about Simla when
      she cantered back to it and it was late when she started for the Worsleys,
      where she was dining. One little lighted house looked much like another
      perched on the mountainside, and the wooden board painted &lsquo;Branksome Hall,
      Maj.-Gen. T.P. Worsley, R.E.,&rsquo; nailed to the most conspicuous tree from
      the main road, was invisible in the darkness. Madeline arrived in
      consequence at the wrong dinner-party, and was acclaimed and redirected
      with much gaiety, which gave her a further agreeable impression of the
      insouciance of Simla, but made her later still at the Worsleys. So that
      half the people were already seated when she at last appeared, and her
      hostess had just time to cry, &lsquo;My dear, we thought the langurs must have
      eaten you! Captain Gordon, you are not abandoned after all. You know Miss
      Anderson?&rsquo; when she found herself before her soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gordon heard her account of herself with complacence, and
      declared, wiping his moustache, that a similar experience had befallen him
      only a fortnight before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever hear the story of that absent-minded chap, Sir James
      Jackson, who went to the RIGHT dinner-party by mistake?&rsquo; he asked, &lsquo;and
      apologized like mad, by Jove! and insisted he couldn&rsquo;t stay. The people
      nearly had to tie him down in his&mdash;&rsquo; Captain Gordon stopped, arrested
      by his companion&rsquo;s sudden and complete inattention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see a lady,&rsquo; interrupted Madeline, with odd distinctness, &lsquo;curiously
      like somebody I have known before.&rsquo; Her eyes convinced themselves, and
      then refused to be convinced of the inconceivable fact that they were
      resting on Violet Prendergast. It was at first too amazing, too amazing
      only. Then an old forgotten feeling rose in her bosom; the hand on the
      stem of her wine-glass grew tense. The sensation fell away; she remembered
      her emancipation, the years arose and reassured her during which Violet
      Prendergast, living or dead, had been to her of absolutely no importance.
      Yet there was a little aroused tremour in her voice as she went on, &lsquo;She
      is on the General&rsquo;s right&mdash;he must have taken her in. Can you see
      from where you are sitting?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These narrow oval tables are a nuisance that way, aren&rsquo;t they? You don&rsquo;t
      know who you&rsquo;re dining with till the end of the function. Oh! I see&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      Mrs. Innes, just out, and fresh as paint, isn&rsquo;t she? The Colonel&rsquo;&mdash;Captain
      Gordon craned his head again&mdash;&lsquo;is sitting fourth from me on this
      side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Innes! Really!&rsquo; said Madeline. &lsquo;Then&mdash;then of course I must be
      mistaken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She removed her eyes almost stealthily from the other woman&rsquo;s face and
      fixed them on the pattern of the table-cloth. Her brain guided her clearly
      through the tumult of her perception, and no emotion could be observed in
      the smiling attention which she gave to Captain Gordon&rsquo;s account of the
      afternoon&rsquo;s tandem racing; but there was a furious beating in her breast,
      and she thought she could never draw a breath long enough to control it.
      It helped her that there was food to swallow, wine to drink, and Captain
      Gordon to listen to; and under cover of these things she gradually,
      consciously, prepared herself for the shock of encounter which should be
      conclusive. Presently she leaned a little forward and let her glance, in
      which no outsider could see the steady recognition, rest upon the lady on
      the General&rsquo;s right, until that person&rsquo;s agreeable blue eyes wandered down
      the table and met it. Perhaps Madeline&rsquo;s own eyelids fluttered a little as
      she saw the sudden stricture in the face that received her message, and
      the grimace with which it uttered, pallid with apprehension, its response
      to a pleasantry of General Worsley&rsquo;s. She was not consummate in her
      self-control, but she was able at all events to send the glance travelling
      prettily on with a casual smile for an intervening friend, and bring it
      back to her dinner-roll without mischief. It did not adventure again; she
      knew, and she set herself to hold her knowledge, to look at it and
      understand it, while the mechanical part of her made up its mind about the
      entrees, and sympathized with Captain Gordon on his hard luck in having
      three ponies laid up at once. She did not look again, although she felt
      the watching of the other woman, and was quite aware of the moment at
      which Mrs. Innes allowed herself the reprieve of believing that at the
      Worsley&rsquo;s dinner-party at least there would be no scandal. The belief had
      its reflex action, doing something to calm her. How could there be&mdash;scandal&mdash;she
      asked herself, and dismissed with relief the denunciations which crowded
      vague but insistent in her brain. Even then she had not grasped the
      salient points of the situation; she was too much occupied with its irony
      as it affected her personally; her impressions circled steadily round the
      word &lsquo;twice&rsquo; and the unimaginable coincidence. Her resentment filled her,
      and her indignation was like a clear flame behind her smiling face. Robbed
      twice, once in New York and&mdash;oh! preposterous&mdash;the second time
      in Simla! Robbed of the same things by the same hand! She perceived in the
      shock of it only a monstrous fatality, a ludicrously wicked chance. This
      may have been due to the necessity of listening to Captain Gordon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events it was only as she passed Colonel Innes on her way to the
      drawing-room and saw ahead of her the very modish receding back of Mrs.
      Innes that she realized other things&mdash;crime and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the reversion of power; it brought her a great exultation. She sat
      down under it in a corner, hoping to be left alone, with a white face and
      shining eyes. Power and opportunity and purpose&mdash;righteous purpose!
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances had come to her in a flash; she brought them up again
      steadily and scrutinized them. The case was absolutely clear. Frank
      Prendergast had been dead just seven months. Colonel Innes imagined
      himself married four years. Violet Prendergast was a bigamist, and Horace
      Innes had no wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the marvellous transcendent fact; that was what lifted her and
      carried her on great pulsing waves that rolled beyond the walls of the
      little fripperied drawing-room and its collection of low-necked women, out
      into her life, which had not these boundaries. She lived again in a
      possible world. There was no stone wall between herself and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Mussulman butler who offered her coffee looked at her with aroused
      curiosity&mdash;here was certainly a memsahib under the favour of God&mdash;and
      as she stirred it, the shadow that Violet Prendergast had thrown upon her
      life faded out of her mind in the light that was there. Then she looked up
      and met that lady&rsquo;s vivid blue eyes. Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s colour had not returned,
      but there was a recklessness in the lines of her mouth. In the way she
      held her chin, expressing that she had been reflecting on old scores, and
      anticipated the worst. Meeting this vigilance Miss Anderson experienced a
      slight recoil. Her happiness, she realized, had been brought to her in the
      hands of ugly circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so melodramatic,&rsquo; she told herself. &lsquo;It is really almost vulgar. In a
      story I should have no patience with it.&rsquo; But she went on stirring her
      coffee with a little uncontrollable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she had to contemplate the circumstance that her hostess
      was addressing her. Mrs. Innes wished to be introduced. Mrs. Innes,
      incarnate, conscious sensation, was smiling at her, saying that she must
      know so great a friend of her husband&rsquo;s. He made so few friends, and she
      was so grateful to anybody who was good to him. Eyes and voice tolerably
      in rein, aware of the situation at every point, she had a meretricious
      daring; and it occurred to Madeline, looking at her, that she was after
      all a fairly competent second-class adventuress. She would not refuse the
      cue. It would make so little difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, I am tremendously indebted to Colonel Innes. He has been
      so very kind about ponies and jhampanies and things. Simla is full of
      pitfalls for a stranger, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo; And Miss Anderson, unclosing
      her fan, turned her reposeful head a little in the direction of three
      married schoolgirls voluble on her left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not when you get to know the language. You must learn the language; it&rsquo;s
      indispensable. But of course it depends on how long you mean to stay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I will learn the language,&rsquo; said Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But General Worsley told me you were leaving Simla in a fortnight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no. My plans are very indefinite; but I shall stay much longer than
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is Miss Anderson, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;Miss Madeline Anderson, of New York&mdash;no,
      Brooklyn?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline looked at her. &lsquo;Did not the General say so?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he did. But one looks to make quite sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can understand that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Innes leaned forward with one elbow on her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a graceful attitude, but it gave the casual air to the
      conversation which was desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My plans are as indefinite as possible, really,&rsquo; Madeline returned. &lsquo;I
      may spend the cold weather in Calcutta, or go into camp with the Dovedells&mdash;I
      should like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Innes,&rsquo; cried the nearest schoolgirl, &lsquo;we are coming tomorrow to see
      all the lovely things in your boxes, may we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do, duckies. But mind, no copying of them by durzies in the veranda.
      They&rsquo;re all Paris things&mdash;Coulter&rsquo;s&mdash;and you know he doesn&rsquo;t
      copy well, does he? Oh, dear! here are the men&mdash;they always come too
      soon, don&rsquo;t they? So glad to have had even a little chat, Miss Anderson.
      I&rsquo;ll come and see you tomorrow. You know newcomers in India always make
      the first calls. I shall find you at home, sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; Madeline said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Innes crossed the room, crying out that the heat was perfectly absurd
      for Simla, it must be cooler outside; and as Captain Valentine Drake
      followed her into the semi-darkness of the veranda, the three married
      schoolgirls looked at each other and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be naughty,&rsquo; said Captain Gordon, leaning over the sofa from
      behind. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re very dear friends, and they&rsquo;ve been separated for two
      years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline heard this as plainly as they did. She noted disdainfully how it
      all fell in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How absent you are tonight!&rsquo; Horace Innes exclaimed, when Miss Anderson
      had asked him a trivial question for the third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Mrs. Scallepa is going to sing;&rsquo; and as Mrs. Scallepa
      sang she let her eyes play over him with a light in them so tender, that
      once catching it the felt a sudden answering throb, and looked again; but
      after that her eyes were on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are staying here,&rsquo; he said a quarter of an hour later, as he saw her
      into her rickshaw; &lsquo;and I think I must see you to your quarters. It&rsquo;s very
      dark, and there is an ugly little slip half-way between this and the Mall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran upstairs to get his coat and stick, and a white face like an
      apparition suddenly hung itself on the edge of Madeline&rsquo;s rickshaw-hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him tonight,&rsquo; it said, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you ready, Colonel Innes? Then good night, everybody,&rsquo; cried
      Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not at all sure that she would not tell Horace Innes &lsquo;tonight&rsquo;.

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.V.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;My wife,&rsquo; said Colonel Innes, &lsquo;is looking extremely well.&rsquo; 
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She seems so, indeed,&rsquo; Madeline replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is delighted with &ldquo;Two Gables&rdquo;. Likes it better, she says, than any
      other house we could have got.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a good thing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a record trip for the Caledonia, thirteen days from Brindisi to
      Bombay. Was she telling you about the voyage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Madeline impatiently, &lsquo;she didn&rsquo;t mention it. How shall I tell
      the men to put down the hood, please? A rickshaw is detestable with the
      hood up&mdash;stifling! Thanks. I beg your pardon. The Caledonia made a
      good run?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thirteen days. Wonderful weather, of course, which was luck for Violet.
      She is an atrocious sailor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline fancied she heard repose and reassurance in his voice. Her
      thought cried, &lsquo;It is not so bad as he expected!&rsquo; We can not be surprised
      that she failed to see in herself the alleviation of that first evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has brought quantities of things for the house with her,&rsquo; Innes went
      on, &lsquo;as well as three dachshund puppies,&rsquo; and he laughed. &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you
      like one? What can we do with three&mdash;and the terrier, and Brutus?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, thank you, no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How could he laugh? How could he speak pleasantly of these intimate
      details of his bondage? How could he conceive that she would accept&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Already she has arranged four dinner-parties! It will be a relief not to
      have to think of that sort of thing&mdash;to be able to leave it to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Innes must have great energy. To drive all the way up from Kalka by
      noon and appear at a dinner-party at night&mdash;wonderful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, great energy,&rsquo; Horace said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will take you everywhere&mdash;to all the functions. She will insist
      on your duty to society.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline felt that she must get him somehow back into his slough of
      despond. His freedom paralyzed her. And he returned with a pathetic change
      of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose there is no alternative. Violet is very good about being
      willing to go alone, or with somebody else; but I never think it quite
      fair on one&rsquo;s wife to impose on her the necessity of going about with
      other men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Worsley introduced us after dinner,&rsquo; said Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept disparagement out of her mind, but he could not help perceiving
      aloofness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The monosyllable told her sensitive ear that while he admitted her
      consideration in going on with the subject, he was willing to recognize
      that there was no more to say, and have done with it. She gathered up her
      scruples and repugnances in a firm grasp. She would not let him throw his
      own shadow, as an effectual obstacle, between himself and liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to ask you something,&rsquo; she said; it might come naturally
      enough from another man with whom your friendship was as candid as it is
      with me; but there is an awkwardness in it from a woman. You must believe
      I have a good reason. Will you tell me about your first meeting with Mrs.
      Innes, when&mdash;when you became engaged?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew she was daring a good deal; but when a man&rsquo;s prison is to be
      brought down about his ears, one might as well begin, she thought, at the
      foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Innes did not speak, and then his words came slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find it difficult,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to answer you. How can it matter&mdash;it
      is impossible. I suppose you have heard some story, and it is like you to
      want to be in a position to negative it. Ignore it instead. She has very
      successfully championed herself. Believe nothing to her disadvantage that
      may be said about that&mdash;that time. I was pleased to marry her, and
      she was pleased to marry me. But for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let us talk about
      it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke Madeline saw the vivid clearness of the situation grow blurred
      and confused. It was as if her point of view had suddenly changed and her
      eyes failed her. Her eager impulse had beat less and less strongly from
      the Worsley&rsquo;s door; now it seemed to shrink away in fetters. Her eyes
      filled with vaguely resentful tears, which sprang, if she could have
      traced them, from the fact that the man she loved was loyal to his own
      mistake, and the formless premonition that he might continue to be. She
      contorted her lip to keep her emotion back, and deliberately turned away
      from a matter in which she was not mistress, and which contained ugly
      possibilities of buffeting. She would wait a little, and though
      consideration for Violet Prendergast had nothing to do with it, she would
      not tell him tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; she said; and, after a moment, &lsquo;Did I tell you that I have
      changed my plans?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not going so soon?&rsquo; she took all the comfort there was in his
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not going at all for the present. I have abandoned my intentions and
      my dates. I mean to drift for a little while. I have been too&mdash;too
      conscientious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you quite serious&mdash;do you mean it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And in less than a fortnight you will not go out of one&rsquo;s life. You will
      stay on&mdash;you summer day! It&rsquo;s hard to believe in luck like that. I
      sent a poor devil of a sepoy a reprieve last week&mdash;one knows now how
      he must have felt about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does it make all that difference?&rsquo; Madeline asked, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It makes a difference,&rsquo; he answered, controlling his words, &lsquo;that I am
      glad you can not conceive, since that would mean that your life has been
      as barren as mine.&rsquo; He seemed to refrain from saying more, and then he
      added, &lsquo;You must be careful when you plant your friendship that you mean
      it to stay, and blossom. It will not come easily up by the roots, and it
      will leave an ugly hole.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was helping her out of her rickshaw, and as they followed the servant
      who carried her wraps the few yards to the door, she left her hand lightly
      on his arm. It was the seal, he thought, of her unwritten bond that there
      should be no uprooting of the single flower he cherished; and he went back
      almost buoyantly because of it to the woman who had been sitting in the
      sackcloth and ashes of misfortune, turning over the expedients for which
      his step might make occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the monkeys began to scramble about the roof in the early
      creeping of the dawn among the deodars, Madeline had groped her way to a
      tolerably clear conception of what might happen. The impeding circumstance
      everywhere, it must be acknowledged, was Frederick Prendergast&rsquo;s coffin.
      The case, had convict No. 1596 been still alive and working out his debt
      to society, would have been transcendentally simple, she told herself.
      Even a convict has a right&mdash;a prospective right&mdash;to his wife,
      and no honest man should be compelled to retain a criminal&rsquo;s property.
      This was an odd reflection, perhaps, to be made by Madeline Anderson, but
      the situation as a whole might be described as curious. And there was no
      doubt about the coffin.

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The veranda of which Miss Anderson&rsquo;s little sitting-room claimed its
      section hung over the road, and it seemed to her that she heard the sound
      of Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s arrival about ten minutes after breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, she had spent two whole hours contemplating, with very
      fixed attention, first the domestic circumstances of Colonel Horace Innes
      and their possible development, and then, with a pang of profoundest
      acknowledgment, the moral qualities which he would bring to bear upon
      them. She was further from knowing what course she personally intended to
      pursue than ever, when she heard the wheels roll up underneath; and she
      had worked herself into a state of sufficient detachment from the whole
      problem to reflect upon the absurdity of a bigamist rattling forth to
      discuss her probable ruin in the fanciful gaiety of a rickshaw. The
      circumstances had its value though; it lightened all responsibility for
      the lady concerned. As Madeline heard her jump out and give pronounced
      orders for the securing of an accompanying dachshund, it did not seem to
      matter so particularly what became of Violet Prendergast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s footsteps came briskly along the veranda. Madeline noted that
      there was no lagging. &lsquo;Number seven,&rsquo; she said aloud; as she passed other
      doors, &lsquo;Number eight&mdash;number nine! Ah! there you are.&rsquo; The door was
      open. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let them bring up my card for fear of some mistake. How
      do you do? Now please don&rsquo;t get up&mdash;you look so comfortable with your
      book. What is it? Oh, yes, of course, THAT. People were talking about it a
      good deal when I left London, but I haven&rsquo;t read it. Is it good?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like it,&rsquo; said Madeline. She half rose as Mrs. Innes entered; but as
      the lady did not seem to miss the ceremony of greeting, she was glad to
      sink back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how do you like Simla? Charming in many ways, isn&rsquo;t it? A little too
      flippant, I always say&mdash;rather TOO much champagne and silliness. But
      awfully bracing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Snows are magnificent,&rsquo; Madeline said, &lsquo;when you can see them. And
      there&rsquo;s a lot of good work done here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t they divine? I did nothing, absolutely nothing, my first season
      but paint them. And the shops&mdash;they&rsquo;re not bad, are they, for the
      size of the place? Though today, upon my soul, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a
      yard of white spotted veiling among them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is annoying,&rsquo; said Madeline, &lsquo;if you want spotted veiling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? Well&rsquo;&mdash;Mrs. Innes take a deep breath&mdash;&lsquo;you DIDN&rsquo;T
      tell him last night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;N&mdash;no,&rsquo; said Madeline, with deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I WAS grateful. I knew I could rely upon you not to. It would have been
      too cruel when we have only just been reunited&mdash;dear Horace would
      have had to sleep in the&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Horace is the soul of honour. Is your ayah in there?&rsquo; Mrs. Innes
      nodded towards the bedroom door. &lsquo;You can not imagine what long ears she
      has.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no ayah. There is only Brookes;&rsquo; and as that excellent woman
      passed through the room with a towel over her arm, Madeline said, &lsquo;You can
      go now, Brookes, and see about that alpaca. Take the rickshaw; it looks
      very threatening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maid! You ARE a swell! There are only four genuine maids in Simla that I
      know of&mdash;the rest are really nurse-girls. What a comfort she must be!
      THE luxury of all others that I long for; but alas! army pay, you know. I
      did once bring a dear thing out with me from Nice&mdash;you should have
      seen Horace&rsquo;s face.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t very well go about quite alone; it would be uncomfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except that you Americans are so perfectly independent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary. If I could order about a servant the way an Englishwoman
      does&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say you are not going to tell him! I&rsquo;ve got such a lot of other calls to
      make,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Innes. &lsquo;Dear Lady Bloomfield won&rsquo;t understand it if
      I don&rsquo;t call today, especially after the baby. What people in that
      position want with more babies I can not comprehend. Of course you haven&rsquo;t
      noticed it, but a baby is such a shock to Simla.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let me keep you,&rsquo; Madeline said, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you haven&rsquo;t promised. Do promise, Miss Anderson. You gain nothing by
      telling him, except your revenge; and I should think by this time you
      would have forgiven me for taking Frederick away from you. He didn&rsquo;t turn
      out so well! You can&rsquo;t still bear me malice over that convict in Sing
      Sing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For his sake, poor fellow, I might.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coming along I said to myself, &ldquo;She CAN score off me badly, but surely
      she doesn&rsquo;t want to so much as all that.&rdquo; Besides, I really only took your
      leavings, you know. You threw poor Fred Prendergast over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not prepared to discuss that,&rsquo; Madeline said, at no pains to smooth
      the curve out of her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I thought, &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;you never can tell with people&mdash;she
      will think it her DUTY to make a fuss.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a possible point of view.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know. You think I&rsquo;m an imposter on society and I ought to be exposed,
      and I suppose you could shut every door in Simla against me if you liked.
      But you are a friend of my husband&rsquo;s, Miss Anderson. You would not turn
      his whole married life into a scandal and ruin his career?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ruin his career?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course. Government is awfully particular. It mayn&rsquo;t be his fault in
      the least, but no man is likely to get any big position with a cloud over
      his domestic affairs. Horace would resign, naturally.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or take long leave,&rsquo; Mrs. Innes added to herself, but she did not give
      Madeline this alternative. A line or two of nervous irritation marked
      themselves about her eyes, and her colour had faded. Her hat was less
      becoming than it had been, and she had pulled a button off her glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; she went on quickly, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t as if you could do any good, you
      know. The harm was done once for all when I let him think he&rsquo;d married me.
      I thought then&mdash;well, I had to take it or leave it&mdash;and every
      week I expected to hear of Frederick&rsquo;s death. Then I meant to tell Horace
      myself, and have the ceremony over again. He couldn&rsquo;t refuse. And all
      these years it&rsquo;s been like living on a volcano, in the fear of meeting New
      York people. Out here there never are any, but in England I dye my hair,
      and alter my complexion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you change your mind,&rsquo; Madeline asked, &lsquo;about telling Colonel
      Innes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t! Why should I change my mind? For my own protection, I mean to
      get things put straight instantly&mdash;when the time comes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When the time comes,&rsquo; Madeline repeated; and her eyes, as she fixed them
      on Mrs. Innes, were suddenly so lightened with a new idea that she dropped
      the lids over them as she waited for the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When poor Frederick does pass away,&rsquo; Mrs. Innes said, with an air of
      observing the proprieties. &lsquo;When they put him in prison it was a matter of
      months, the doctors said. That was one reason why I went abroad. I
      couldn&rsquo;t bear to stay there and see him dying by inches, poor fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t. And the idea of the hard labour made me SICK. But it
      seems to have improved his health, and now&mdash;there is no telling! I
      sometimes believe he will live out his sentence. Should you think that
      possible in the case of a man with half a lung?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no knowledge of pulmonary disease,&rsquo; Madeline said. She forced the
      words from her lips and carefully looked away, taking this second key to
      the situation mechanically, and for a moment groping with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What arrangement did you make to be informed about&mdash;about him?&rsquo; she
      asked, and instantly regretted having gone so perilously near provoking a
      direct question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I subscribe to the &ldquo;New York World&rdquo;. I used to see lots of things in it&mdash;about
      the shock the news of my death gave him&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A flash of hysterical amusement shot into Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s eyes, and she
      questioned Madeline&rsquo;s face to see whether it responded to her humour. Then
      she put her own features straight behind her handkerchief and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And about his failing health, and then about his being so much better.
      But nothing now for ages.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did the &ldquo;World&rdquo; tell you,&rsquo; asked Miss Anderson, with sudden interest,
      &lsquo;that Mr. Prendergast came into a considerable fortune before&mdash;about
      two years ago?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s face turned suddenly blank. &lsquo;How much?&rsquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About five hundred thousand dollars, I believe. Left him by a cousin.
      Then you didn&rsquo;t know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That must have been Gordon Prendergast&mdash;the engineer!&rsquo; Mrs. Innes
      said, with excitement. &lsquo;Fancy that! Leaving money to a relation in Sing
      Sing! Hadn&rsquo;t altered his will, I suppose. Who could possibly,&rsquo; and her
      face fell visibly, &lsquo;have foreseen such a thing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one, I think,&rsquo; said Madeline, through a little edged smile. &lsquo;On that
      point you will hardly be criticized.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Innes, with clasped hands, was sunk in thought. She raised her eyes
      with a conviction in them which she evidently felt to be pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;there is something in what the padres say about
      our reaping the reward of our misdeeds in this world&mdash;some of us,
      anyway. If I had stayed in New York&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said Madeline. &lsquo;I shall wake up presently,&rsquo; she reflected, &lsquo;and
      find that I have been dreaming melodrama.&rsquo; But that was a fantastic
      underscoring of her experience. She knew very well she was making it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Innes, again wrapped in astonished contemplation, did not reply. Then
      she jumped to her feet with a gesture that cast fortunes back into the lap
      of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One thing is certain,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything NOW, can I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline laid hold of silence and made armour with it. At all events, she
      must have time to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I decline to advise you,&rsquo; she said, and she spoke with a barely
      perceptive movement of her lips only. The rest of her face was stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How unkind and unforgiving you are! Must people would think the loss of a
      hundred thousand pounds about punishment enough for what I have done. You
      don&rsquo;t seem to see it. But on top of that you won&rsquo;t refuse to promise not
      to tell Horace?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not bind myself in any way whatever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even when you know that the moment I hear of the&mdash;death I intend
      to&mdash;to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make an honest man of him? Not even when I know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want me to go down on my knees to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline glanced at the flowered fabric involved and said, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, I
      think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this is to hang over me the whole season? I shall enjoy nothing&mdash;absolutely
      NOTHING.&rsquo; The blue eyes were suddenly eclipsed by angry tears, which the
      advent of a servant with cards checked as suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodbye, then, dear,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Innes, as if in response to the
      advancing rustle of skirts in the veranda. &lsquo;So glad to have found you at
      home. Dear me, has Trilby made her way up&mdash;and I gave such particular
      orders! Oh, you NAUGHTY dog!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the complication that surged round Miss Anderson&rsquo;s waking hours one
      point emerged, and gave her a perch for congratulation. That was the
      determination she had shown in refusing to let Frederick Prendergast leave
      her his money, or any part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that he had outlived her tenderness, if not her care, and
      this fact, which she never found it necessary to communicate to poor
      Frederick himself, naturally made his desire in the matter sharply
      distasteful. She was even unaware of the disposition he had made of his
      ironical fortune, a reflection which brought her thankfulness that there
      was something she did not know. &lsquo;If I had let him do it,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;I
      should have felt compelled to tell her everything, instantly. And think of
      discussing it with her!&rsquo; This was quite a fortnight later, and Mrs. Innes
      still occupied her remarkable position only in her own mind and
      Madeline&rsquo;s, still knowing herself the wife of 1596 and of 1596 only, and
      still unaware that 1596 was in his grave. Simla had gone on with its
      dances and dinners and gymkhanas quite as if no crucial experience were
      hanging over the heads of three of the people one met &lsquo;everywhere,&rsquo; and
      the three people continued to be met everywhere, although only one of them
      was unconscious. The women tried to avoid each other without accenting it,
      exchanging light words only as occasion demanded, but they were not clever
      enough for Mrs. Gammidge and Mrs. Mickie, who went about saying that Mrs.
      Innes&rsquo;s treatment of Madeline Anderson was as ridiculous as it was
      inexplicable. &lsquo;Did you ever know her to be jealous of anybody before?&rsquo; 
      demanded Mrs. Mickie, to which Mrs. Gammidge responded, with her customary
      humour, that the Colonel had never, in the memory of the oldest
      inhabitant, been known to give her occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; declared Mrs. Mickie, &lsquo;if friendships&mdash;UNSENTIMENTAL
      friendships&mdash;between men and women are not understood in Simla, I&rsquo;d
      like to be told what is understood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them they gave Madeline a noble support, for which&mdash;although
      she did not particularly require it, and they did not venture to offer it
      in so many words&mdash;she was grateful. A breath of public criticism from
      any point of view would have blown over the toppling structure she was
      defending against her conscience. The siege was severe and obstinate, with
      an undermining conviction ever at work that in the end she would yield; in
      the end she would go away, at least as far as Bombay or Calcutta, and from
      there send to Mrs. Innes the news of her liberation. It would not be
      necessary, after all, or even excusable, to tell Horace. His wife would do
      that quickly enough&mdash;at least, she had said she would. If she didn&rsquo;t&mdash;well,
      if she didn&rsquo;t, nothing would be possible but another letter, giving HIM
      the simple facts, she, Madeline, carefully out of the way of his path of
      duty&mdash;at all events, at Calcutta or Bombay. But there was no danger
      that Mrs. Innes would lose the advantage of confession, of throwing
      herself on his generosity&mdash;and at this point Madeline usually felt
      her defenses against her better nature considerably strengthened, and the
      date of her sacrifice grow vague again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, she was astonished to observe that, in spite of her threat to
      the contrary, Mrs. Innes appeared to be enjoying herself particularly
      well. Madeline had frequent occasion for private comment on the advantages
      of a temperament that could find satisfaction in dancing through whole
      programmes at the very door, so to speak, of the criminal courts; and it
      can not be denied that this capacity of Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s went far to increase
      the vacillation with which Miss Anderson considered her duty towards that
      lady. If she had shown traces of a single hour of genuine suffering, there
      would have been an end to Madeline&rsquo;s hesitation. But beyond an occasional
      watchful glance at conversations in which she might be figuring
      dramatically, and upon which she instantly turned her back as soon as she
      was perceived, Mrs. Innes gave no sign even of preoccupation. If she had
      bad half-hours, they occurred between the teas and tennises, the picnics,
      riding-parties, luncheons, and other entertainments, at which you could
      always count upon meeting her; and in that case they must have been short.
      She looked extremely well, and her admirable frocks gave an accent even to
      &lsquo;Birthday&rsquo; functions at Viceregal Lodge, which were quite hopelessly
      general. If any one could have compelled a revelation of her mind, I think
      it would have transpired that her anxieties about Capt. Valentine Drake
      and Mrs. Vesey gave her no leisure for lesser ones. These for a few days
      had been keen and indignant&mdash;Captain Drake had so far forgotten
      himself as to ride with Mrs. Vesey twice since Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s arrival&mdash;and
      any display of poverty of spirit was naturally impossible under the
      circumstances. The moment was a critical one; Captain Drake seemed
      inclined to place her in the category of old, unexacting friends&mdash;ladies
      who looked on and smiled, content to give him tea on rainy days, and call
      him by his Christian name, with perhaps the privilege of a tapping finger
      on his shoulder, and an occasional order about a rickshaw. Mrs. Violet was
      not an introspective person, or she might have discovered here that the
      most stable part of her self-respect was her EXIGENCE with Captain Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found out quickly enough, however, that she did not mean to discard
      it. She threw herself, therefore&mdash;her fine shoulders and arms, her
      pretty clothes, her hilarity, her complexion, her eyelashes, and all that
      appertained to her&mdash;into the critical task of making other men
      believe, at Captain Drake&rsquo;s expense, that they were quite as fond of her
      as he was. Mrs. Vesey took opposite measures, and the Club laid bets on
      the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Club was not prepossessed by Captain Drake. He said too little and he
      implied too much. He had magnificent shoulders, which he bent a great deal
      over secluded sofas, and a very languid interest in matters over which
      ordinary men were enthusiastic. He seemed to believe that if he smiled all
      the way across his face, he would damage a conventionality. His clothes
      were unexceptionable, and he always did the right thing, though bored by
      the necessity. He was good-looking in an ugly way, which gave him an air
      of restrained capacity for melodrama, and made women think him
      interesting. Somebody with a knack of disparagement said that he was too
      much expressed. It rather added to his unpopularity that he was a man whom
      women usually took with preposterous seriousness&mdash;all but Kitty
      Vesey, who charmed and held him by her outrageous liberties. When Mrs.
      Vesey chaffed him, he felt picturesque. He was also aware of inspiring
      entertainment for the lookers-on, with the feeling at such times that he,
      too, was an amused spectator. This was, of course, their public attitude.
      In private there was sentiment, and they talked about the tyranny of
      society, or delivered themselves of ideas suggested by works of fiction
      which everybody simply HAD to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week Mrs. Innes looked on, apparently indifferent, rather apparently
      not observing; and an Assistant Secretary in the Home Department began to
      fancy that his patience in teaching the three dachshund puppies tricks was
      really appreciated. He was an on-coming Assistant Secretary, with other
      conspicuous parts, and hitherto his time had been too valuable to spend
      upon ladies&rsquo; dachshunds. Mrs. Innes had selected him well. There came an
      evening when, at a dance at the Lieutenant-Governor&rsquo;s, Mrs. Innes was so
      absorbed in what the Assistant Secretary was saying to her, as she passed
      on his arm, that she did not see Captain Drake in the corridor at all,
      although he had carefully broken an engagement to walk with Kitty Vesey
      that very afternoon, as the beginning of gradual and painless reform in
      her direction. His unrewarded virtue rose up and surprised him with the
      distinctness of its resentment; and while his expression was successfully
      amused, his shoulders and the back of his neck, as well as the hand on his
      moustache, spoke of discipline which promised to be efficient. Reflection
      assured him that discipline was after all deserved, and a quarter of an
      hour later found him wagging his tail, so to speak, over Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s
      programme in a corner pleasantly isolated. The other chair was occupied by
      the Assistant Secretary. Captain Drake represented an interruption, and
      was obliged to take a step towards the nearest lamp to read the card.
      Three dances were rather ostentatiously left, and Drake initialled them
      all. He brought back the card with a bow, which spoke of dignity under
      bitter usage, together with the inflexible intention of courteous
      self-control, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if you please, Captain Drake&mdash;let me see what you&rsquo;ve done. All
      those? But&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it after eleven, Mrs. Innes?&rsquo; asked the Assistant Secretary, with a
      timid smile. He was enjoying himself, but he had a respect for vested
      interests, and those of Captain Drake were so well known that he felt a
      little like a buccaneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, so it is!&rsquo; Mrs. Innes glanced at one of her bracelets. &lsquo;Then,
      Captain Drake, I&rsquo;m sorry&rsquo;&mdash;she carefully crossed out the three
      &lsquo;V.D.&lsquo;s&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I promised all the dances I had left after ten to Mr.
      Holmcroft. Most of the others I gave away at the gymkhana&mdash;really.
      Why weren&rsquo;t you there? That Persian tutor again! I&rsquo;m afraid you are
      working too hard. And what did the Rani do, Mr. Holmcroft? It&rsquo;s like the
      Arabian Nights, only with real jewels&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I say, Holmcroft, this is too much luck, you know. Regular
      sweepstakes, by Jove!&rsquo; And Captain Drake lingered on the fringe of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I have been greedy,&rsquo; said the Assistant Secretary, deprecatingly.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in the very least! That is,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Violet, pouting, &lsquo;if I&rsquo;M
      to be considered. We&rsquo;ll sit out all but the waltzes, and you shall tell me
      official secrets about the Rani. She put us up once, she&rsquo;s a delicious old
      thing. Gave us string beds to sleep on and gold plate to eat from, and
      swore about every other word. She had been investing in Government paper,
      and it had dropped three points. &ldquo;Just my damn luck!&rdquo; she said. Wasn&rsquo;t it
      exquisite? Captain Drake&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Innes&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be rude, but you&rsquo;re a dreadful embarrassment. Mr.
      Holmcroft won&rsquo;t tell you official secrets!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she would only behave!&rsquo; thought Madeline, looking on, &lsquo;I would tell
      her&mdash;indeed I would&mdash;at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Innes detached himself from a group of men in mess dress as she
      appeared with the Worsleys, and let himself drift with the tide that
      brought them always together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are looking tired&mdash;ill,&rsquo; she said, seriously, as they sought the
      unconfessed solace of each other&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;Last night it was the
      Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s, and the night before the dance at Peliti&rsquo;s. And
      again tonight. And you are not like those of us who can rest next morning&mdash;you
      have always your heavy office work!&rsquo; She spoke with indignant, tender
      reproach, and he gave himself up to hearing it. &lsquo;You will have to take
      leave and go away,&rsquo; she insisted, foolishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave! Good heavens, no! I wish all our fellows were as fit as I am. And&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t pity me, dear friend. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good for me. The world
      really uses me very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s all right, I suppose,&rsquo; Madeline said, with sudden depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it is. You are dining with us on the eighth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, I&rsquo;m engaged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Engaged again? Don&rsquo;t you WANT to break bread in my house, Miss Anderson?&rsquo; 
      She was silent, and he insisted, &lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him instead a kind, mysterious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will explain to you what I feel about that some day,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;some
      day soon. I can&rsquo;t accept Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s invitation for the eighth, but&mdash;Brookes
      and I are going to take tea with the fakir&rsquo;s monkeys on the top of Jakko
      tomorrow afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anybody else, or only Brookes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only Brookes.&rsquo; And she thought she had abandoned coquetry!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then may I come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed you may.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; reflected Madeline, as she caught another glimpse
      of Mrs. Innes vigorously dancing the reel opposite little Lord Billy in
      his Highland uniform, with her hands on her flowered-satin hips, &lsquo;that I
      am behaving very well myself.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Horace Innes looked round his wife&rsquo;s drawing-room as if he were making an
      inventory of it, carefully giving each article its value, which happened,
      however, to have nothing to do with rupees. Madeline Anderson had been
      saying something the day before about the intimacy and accuracy with which
      people&rsquo;s walls expressed them, and though the commonplace was not new to
      him, this was the first time it had ever led him to scan his wife&rsquo;s. What
      he saw may be imagined, but his only distinct reflection was that he had
      no idea that she had been photographed so variously or had so many friends
      who wore resplendent Staff uniforms. The relation of cheapness in
      porcelain ornaments to the lady&rsquo;s individuality was beyond him, and he
      could not analyze his feelings of sitting in the midst of her poverty of
      spirit. Indeed, thinking of his ordinary unsusceptibility to such things,
      he told himself sharply that he was adding an affectation of discomfort to
      the others that he had to bear; and that if Madeline had not given him the
      idea it would never have entered his mind. The less, he mused, that one
      had to do with finicking feelings in this world the better. They were well
      enough for people who were tolerably conditioned in essentials&mdash;he
      preferred this vagueness, even with himself, in connection with his
      marriage&mdash;otherwise they added pricks. Besides he had that other
      matter to think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the other matter with such obvious irritation that the
      butler coming in to say that the &lsquo;English water&rsquo; was finished, and how
      many dozen should he order, put a chair in its place instead, closed the
      door softly again, and went away. It was not good for the dignity of
      butlers to ask questions of any sort with a look of that kind under the
      eyebrows of the sahib. The matter was not serious, Colonel Innes told
      himself, but he would prefer by comparison to deal with matters that were
      serious. He knew Simla well enough to attach no overwhelming importance to
      things said about women at the Club, where the broadest charity prevailed
      underneath, and the idle comment of the moment had an intrinsic value as a
      distraction rather than a reflective one as a criticism. This
      consideration, however, was more philosophical in connection with other
      men&rsquo;s wives. He found very little in it to palliate what he had overheard,
      submerged in the &lsquo;Times of India&rsquo;, that afternoon. And to put an edge on
      it, the thing had been said by one of his own juniors. Luckily the boy had
      left the room without discovering who was behind the &lsquo;Times of India&rsquo;.
      Innes felt that he should be grateful for having been spared the exigency
      of defending his wife against a flippant word to which she had very
      probably laid herself open. He was very angry, and it is perhaps not
      surprising that he did not pause to consider how far his anger was due to
      the humiliating necessity of speaking to her about it. She was coming at
      last though; she was in the hall. He would get it over quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodbye!&rsquo; said Mrs. Innes at the door. &lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t possibly let you come
      in to tea. I don&rsquo;t know how you have the conscience after drinking three
      cups at Mrs. Mickie&rsquo;s, where I had no business to take you! Tomorrow? Oh,
      all right if you want to VERY badly. But I won&rsquo;t promise you strawberries&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      nearly all gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of a departing pony&rsquo;s trot, and Mrs. Innes came into
      the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good heavens, Horace! what are you sitting there for like a&mdash;like a
      ghost? Why didn&rsquo;t you make a noise or something, and why aren&rsquo;t you at
      office? I can&rsquo;t tell you how you startled me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is early,&rsquo; Colonel Innes said. &lsquo;We are neither of us in the house, as
      a rule, at this hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coincidence!&rsquo; Violet turned a cool, searching glance on her husband, and
      held herself ready. &lsquo;I came home early because I want to alter the lace on
      my yellow bodice for tonight. It&rsquo;s too disgusting as it is. But I was
      rather glad to get away from Mrs. Mickie&rsquo;s lot. So rowdy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I came because I had a special reason for wanting to speak to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Violet&rsquo;s lips parted, and her breath, in spite of herself, came a
      little faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As we are dining out tonight, I thought that if I didn&rsquo;t catch you now I
      might not have another opportunity&mdash;till tomorrow morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s always a pity to spoil one&rsquo;s breakfast. I can tell from your
      manner, mon ami, it&rsquo;s something disagreeable. What have I been and gone
      and done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dancing, poor thing, in her little vulgar way, on hot iron. But
      her eyes kept their inconsistent coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard something today which you are not in the way of hearing. You have&mdash;probably&mdash;no
      conception that it could be said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then she has been telling other people. ABSOLUTELY the worst thing she
      could do!&rsquo; Mrs. Innes exclaimed privately, sitting unmoved, her face a
      little too expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be prepared for it&mdash;you may be shocked and hurt by it.
      Indeed, I think there is no need to repeat it to you. But I must put you
      on your guard. Men are coarser, you know, than women; they are apt to put
      their own interpretation&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a physical gasp, a sharpness in her voice that brought Innes&rsquo;s
      eyes from the floor to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but&mdash;don&rsquo;t overestimate it, don&rsquo;t let it
      worry you. It was simply a very impertinent&mdash;a very disagreeable
      reference to you and Mr. Holmcroft, I think, in connection with the
      Dovedell&rsquo;s picnic. It was a particularly silly thing as well, and I am
      sure no one would attach any importance to it, but it was said openly at
      the Club, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who said it?&rsquo; Mrs. Innes demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flood of colour rushed over her face. Horace marked that she blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to tell you, Violet. It certainly was not
      meant for your ears.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I&rsquo;m not to know who said it, I don&rsquo;t see why I should pay any
      attention to it. Mere idle rumour&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Innes bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Gordon said it,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bobby Gordon! DO tell me what he said! I&rsquo;m dying to know. Was he very
      disagreeable? I DID give his dance away on Thursday night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Innes looked at her with the curious distrust which she often inspired in
      him. He had a feeling that he would like to put her out of the room into a
      place by herself, and keep her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t repeat what he said.&rsquo; Colonel Innes took up the &lsquo;Saturday
      Review&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, do, Horace! I particularly want to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Innes said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horace! Was it&mdash;was it anything about Mr. Holmcroft being my
      Secretariat baa-lamb?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you adorn your guess with a little profanity,&rsquo; said Innes, acidly,
      &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t be far wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Violet burst into a peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you old goose!&rsquo; she articulated, behind her handkerchief; &lsquo;he said
      that to ME.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Innes laid down the &lsquo;Saturday Review&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To you!&rsquo; he repeated; &lsquo;Gordon said it to you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather!&rsquo; Mrs. Violet was still mirthful. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that he didn&rsquo;t
      call poor little Homie something worse than that. It&rsquo;s the purest jealousy
      on his part&mdash;nothing to make a fuss about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth skin which enables so many of us to be callous to all but the
      relative meaning of careless phrases had not been given to Innes, and her
      words fell upon his bare sense of propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jealous,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;of a married woman? I find that difficult to
      understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Violet&rsquo;s face straightened out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Horace. These boys are always jealous of somebody or
      other&mdash;it&rsquo;s the occupation of their lives! I really don&rsquo;t see how one
      can prevent it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems to me that a self-respecting woman should see how. Your point of
      view in these matters is incomprehensible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; Violet was driven by righteous anger to say, &lsquo;you find Miss
      Anderson&rsquo;s easier to understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Innes&rsquo;s face took its regimental disciplinary look, and, though
      his eyes were aroused, his words were quiet with repression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see no reason to discuss Miss Anderson with you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;She has
      nothing to do with what we are talking about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you, really! Hasn&rsquo;t she, indeed! I take it you are trying to
      make me believe that compromising things are said about Mr. Holmcroft and
      me at the Club. Well, I advise you to keep your ears open a little more,
      and listen to the things said about you and Madeline Anderson there. But I
      don&rsquo;t suppose you would be in such a hurry to repeat them to HER.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Innes turned very white, and the rigidity of his face gave place to heavy
      dismay. His look was that of a man upon whom misfortune had fallen out of
      a clear sky. For an instant he stared at his wife. When he spoke his voice
      was altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;let us have done with this pitiful wrangling.
      I dare say you can take care of yourself; at all events, I only meant to
      warn you. But now you must tell me exactly what you mean by this that you
      have said&mdash;this&mdash;about&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fat&rsquo;s in the fire,&rsquo; was Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shout, please!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean simply that all Simla is talking about your affair with Miss
      Anderson. You may imagine that because you are fifteen years older than
      she is things won&rsquo;t be thought of, but they are, and I hear it&rsquo;s been
      spoken about at Viceregal Lodge. I KNOW Lady Bloomfield has noticed it,
      for she herself mentioned it to me. I told her I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest
      objection, and neither have I, but there&rsquo;s an old proverb about people in
      glass houses. What are you going to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Innes&rsquo;s expression was certainly alarming, and he had made a step
      toward her that had menace in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going out,&rsquo; he said, and turned and left her to her triumph.

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      She&mdash;Violet&mdash;had unspeakably vulgarized it, but it must be true&mdash;it
      must be, to some extent, true. She may even have lied about it, but the
      truth was there, fundamentally, in the mere fact that it had been
      suggested to her imagination. Madeline&rsquo;s name, which had come to be for
      him an epitome of what was finest and most valuable, most to be lived for,
      was dropping from men&rsquo;s lips into a kind of an abyss of dishonourable
      suggestion. There was no way out of it or around it. It was a cloud which
      encompassed them, suddenly blackening down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing that he could do&mdash;nothing. Except, yes, of course&mdash;that
      was obvious, as obvious as any other plain duty. Through his selfishness
      it had a beginning; in spite of his selfishness it should have an end.
      That went without saying. No more walks or rides. In a conventional way,
      perhaps&mdash;but nothing deliberate, designed&mdash;and never alone
      together. Gossip about flippant married women was bad enough, but that it
      should concern itself with an unprotected creature like Madeline was
      monstrous, incredible. He strode fiercely into the road round Jakko, and
      no little harmless snake, if it had crawled across his path, would have
      failed to suffer a quick fate under the guidance of his imagination. But
      there was nothing for him to kill, and he turned upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun went down into the Punjab and left great blue-and-purple hill
      worlds barring the passage behind him. The deodars sank waist deep into
      filmy shadow, and the yellow afterlight lay silently among the branches. A
      pink-haunched monkey lopading across the road with a great show of
      prudence seemed to have strayed into an unfamiliar country, and the
      rustling twigs behind him made an episode of sound. The road in perpetual
      curve between its little stone parapet and the broad flank of the hill
      rose and fell under the deodars; Innes took its slopes and its steepnesses
      with even, unslackened stride, aware of no difference, aware of little
      indeed except the physical necessity of movement, spurred on by a futile
      instinct that the end of his walk would be the end of his trouble&mdash;his
      amazing, black, menacing trouble. A pony&rsquo;s trot behind him struck through
      the silence like percussion-caps; all Jakko seemed to echo with it; and it
      came nearer&mdash;insistent, purposeful&mdash;but he was hardly aware of
      it until the creature pulled up beside him, and Madeline, slipping quickly
      off, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his hat and stared at her. She seemed to represent a climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming too,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired of picking flies off the Turk, and
      he&rsquo;s really unbearable about them tonight. Here, syce.&rsquo; She threw the
      reins to the man and turned to Innes with a smile of relief. &lsquo;I would much
      rather do a walk. Why&mdash;you want me to come too, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was all one negative, and under the unexpectedness of it and the
      amazement of it her questioning eyes slowly filled with sudden,
      uncontrollable tears, so that she had to lower them, and look steadily at
      the hoof-marks in the road while she waited for his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know how I feel about seeing you&mdash;how glad I always am,&rsquo; he
      stammered. &lsquo;But there are reasons&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reasons?&rsquo; she repeated, half audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to tell you. I will write. But let me put you up again&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; Madeline said, with a sob, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be sent home like a
      child. I am going to walk, but&mdash;but I can quite well go alone.&rsquo; She
      started forward, and her foot caught in her habit so that she made an
      awkward stumble and came down on her knee. In rising she stumbled again,
      and his quick arm was necessary. Looking down at her, he saw that she was
      crying bitterly. The tension had lasted long, and the snap had come when
      she least expected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; Innes said, firmly, hardly daring to turn his head and ascertain
      the blessed fact that they were still alone. &lsquo;Stop instantly. You shall
      not go by yourself.&rsquo; He flicked the dust off her habit with his
      pocket-handkerchief. &lsquo;Come, please; we will go on together.&rsquo; Her distress
      seemed to make things simple again. It was as if the cloud that hung over
      them had melted as she wept, and lifted, and drifted a little further on.
      For the moment, naturally, nothing mattered except that she should be
      comforted. As she walked by his side shaken with her effort at
      self-control, he had to resist the impulse to touch her. His hand tingled
      to do its part in soothing her, his arm ached to protect her, while he
      vaguely felt an element of right, of justice, in her tears; they were in a
      manner his own. What he did was to turn and ask the syce following if he
      had loosened the Turk&rsquo;s saddle-girths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be better&mdash;in a moment,&rsquo; Madeline said, and he answered, &lsquo;Of
      course&rsquo;; but they walked on and said nothing more until the road ran out
      from under the last deodar and round the first bare boulder that marked
      the beginning of the Ladies&rsquo; Mile. It lay rolled out before them, the
      Ladies&rsquo; Mile, sinuous and grey and empty, along the face of the cliff;
      they could see from one end of it to the other. It was the bleak side of
      Jakko; even tonight there was a fresh springing coldness in it blowing
      over from the hidden snows behind the rims of the nearer hills. Madeline
      held up her face to it, and gave herself a moment of its grateful
      discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been as foolish as possible,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;as foolish as possible. I
      have distressed you. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;that is all there is
      to be said. Now if you will tell me&mdash;what is in your mind&mdash;what
      you spoke of writing&mdash;I will mount again and go home. It doesn&rsquo;t
      matter&mdash;I know you didn&rsquo;t mean to be unkind.&rsquo; Her lip was trembling
      again, and he knew it, and dared not look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you ask me to tell you&mdash;miserable things!&rsquo; he exclaimed.
      &lsquo;How can I find the words? And I have only just been told&mdash;I can
      hardly myself conceive it&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not a child in her teens that my ears should be guarded from
      miserable things. I have come of age, I have entered into my inheritance
      of the world&rsquo;s bitterness with the rest. I can listen,&rsquo; Madeline said.
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked to her with grave tenderness. &lsquo;You think yourself very old, and
      very wise about the world,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but you are a woman, and you will be
      hurt. And when I think that a little ordinary forethought on my part would
      have protected you, I feel like the criminal I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make too much of it,&rsquo; she said, simply. &lsquo;I have a presentiment&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; Innes said, slowly; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t niggle about it. The people
      of this place&mdash;idiots!&mdash;are unable to believe that a man and a
      woman can be to each other what we are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said Madeline. She paused beside the parapet and looked down at the
      indistinct little fields below, and the blurred masses of white wild roses
      waving midway against the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They can not understand that there can be any higher plane of intercourse
      between us than the one they know. They won&rsquo;t see&mdash;they can&rsquo;t see&mdash;that
      the satisfaction we find in being together is of a different nature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Madeline. She had raised her eyes, and they sought the
      solemn lines of the horizon. She looked as if she saw something infinitely
      lifted above the pettiness he retailed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So they say&mdash;good God, why should I tell you what they say!&rsquo; It
      suddenly flashed upon him that the embodiment of it in words would be at
      once, from him, sacrilegious and ludicrous. It flashed upon him that her
      natural anger would bring him pain, and that if she laughed&mdash;it was
      so hard to tell when she would laugh&mdash;it would be as if she struck
      him. He cast about him dumb and helpless while she kept her invincibly
      quiet gaze upon the farther hills. She was thinking that this breath of
      gossip, now that it had blown, was a very slight affair compared with
      Horace Innes&rsquo;s misery&mdash;which he did not seem to understand. Then her
      soul rose up in her, brushing everything aside, and forgetting, alas! the
      vow it had once made to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I know,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;They are indeed foolish. They say that we&mdash;love
      each other. Is not that what they say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked in amazement into her tender eyes and caught at the little
      mocking smile about her lips. Suddenly the world grew light about him, the
      shadows fled away. Somewhere down in the valley, he remembered afterward,
      a hill-flute made music. When he spoke it was almost in a whisper, lest he
      should disturb some newly perceived lovely thing that had wings, and might
      leave him. &lsquo;Oh, Madeline,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is it true?&rsquo; She only smiled on in
      gladness that took no heed of any apprehension, any fear or scruple, and
      he himself keeping his eyes upon her face, said, &lsquo;It is true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they stood for a little time in silence while she resisted her great
      opportunity. She resisted it to the end, and presently beckoned to the
      syce, who came up leading the pony. Innes mounted her mechanically and
      said, &lsquo;Is that all right?&rsquo; as she put her foot in the stirrup, without
      knowing that he had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodbye,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I am going away&mdash;immediately. It will be
      better. And listen&mdash;I have known this for weeks&mdash;and I have gone
      on seeing you. And I hope I am not any more wicked than I feel. Goodbye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodbye,&rsquo; he said, taking his hand from the pony&rsquo;s neck, and she rode
      buoyantly away. He, turning to breast the road again, saw darkness
      gathering over the end of it, and drawing nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock next morning Brookes rose from her packing to take a
      note addressed to her mistress from the hand of a messenger in the
      Imperial red and gold. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Miss Anderson&mdash;I write to tell you that I have obtained three
      weeks&rsquo; leave, and I am going into the interior to shoot, starting this
      afternoon. You spoke yesterday of leaving Simla almost immediately. I
      trust you will not do this, as it would be extremely risky to venture down
      to the Plains just now. In ten days the rains will have broken, when it
      will be safe. Pray wait till then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horace Innes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily the letter found its way to Madeline&rsquo;s lips, and remained
      there until she saw the maid observing her with intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brookes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am strongly advised not to start until the rains
      break. I think, on the whole, that we won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, miss,&rsquo; returned Brookes, &lsquo;Mrs. Sergeant Simmons told me that it
      was courting cholera to go&mdash;and nothing short of it. I must say I&rsquo;m
      thankful.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 3.X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week later Colonel Innes had got his leave, and had left Simla for the
      snow-line by what is facetiously known as &lsquo;the carriage road to Tibet.&rsquo; 
      Madeline had done as she was bidden, and was waiting for the rains to
      break. Another day had come without them. To write and tell Innes, to
      write to tell Violet, to go away and leave the situation as she found it;
      she had lived and moved and slept and awakened to these alternatives. At
      the moment she slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early, very early in the morning. The hills all about seemed still
      unaware of it, standing in the greyness, compact, silent, immutable, as if
      they slept with their eyes open. Nothing spoke of the oncoming sun,
      nothing was yet surprised. The hill world lifted itself unconscious in a
      pale solution of daylight, and only on the sky-line, very far away, it
      rippled into a cloud. The flimsy town clinging steeply roof above roof to
      the slope, mounting to the saddle and slipping over on the other side, cut
      the dawn with innumerable little lines and angles all in one tone like a
      pencil drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no feeling in it, no expression. It had a temporary air in that
      light, like trampled snow, and even the big Secretariat buildings that
      raised themselves here and there out of the huddling bazaar looked
      trivial, childish enterprises in the simple revelation of the morning. A
      cold silence was abroad, which a crow now and then vainly tried to disturb
      with a note of tentative enterprise, forced, premature. It announced that
      the sun would probably rise, but nothing more. In the little dark shops of
      the wood-carvers an occasional indefinite figure moved, groping among last
      night&rsquo;s tools, or an old woman in a red sari washed a brass dish over the
      shallow open drain that ran past her door. At the tonga terminus, below
      the Mall, a couple of coughing syces, muffled in their blankets, pulled
      one of these vehicles out of the shed. They pushed it about sleepily, with
      clumsy futility; nothing else stirred or spoke at all in Simla. Nothing
      disturbed Miss Anderson asleep in her hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brown figure in a loin-cloth, with a burden, appeared where the road
      turned down from the Mall, and then another, and several following. They
      were coolies, and they carried luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first to arrive beside the tonga bent and loosed the trunk he brought,
      which slipped from his back to the ground. The syces looked at him, saying
      nothing, and he straightened himself against the wall of the hillside,
      also in silence. It was too early for conversation. Thus did all the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last portmanteau had been deposited, a khaki-coloured heap on the
      shed floor rose up as a broad-shouldered Punjabi driver, and walked round
      the luggage, looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, owls&rsquo; brethren,&rsquo; he said, with sarcasm, addressing the first
      coolie, &lsquo;you have undertaken to carry these matter fifty-eight kos to
      Kalka, have you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Na,&rsquo; replied the coolie, stolidly, and spat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How else, then, is it to be taken?&rsquo; the driver cried, with anger in his
      argument. &lsquo;Behold the memsahib has ordered but one tonga, and a fool-thing
      of an ekka. Here is work for six tongas! What reason is there in this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The coolie folded his naked arms, and dug in the dust with an unconcerned
      toe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, what can I do?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;It is the order of the memsahib.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ram Singh grunted and said no more. A rickshaw was coming down from the
      Mall, and the memsahib was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later the ponies stood in their traces under the iron bar, and
      the lady sat in the tonga behind Ram Singh. Her runners, in uniform,
      waited beside the empty rickshaw with a puzzled look, at which she
      laughed, and threw a rupee to the head man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The luggage was piled and corded on three ekkas behind, and their
      cross-legged drivers, too, were ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chellao!&rsquo; she cried, crisply, and Ram Singh imperturbably lifted the
      reins. The little procession clanked and jingled along the hillside,
      always tending down, and broke upon the early grey melancholy with a
      forced and futile cheerfulness, too early, like everything else. As it
      passed the last of Simla&rsquo;s little gardens, spread like a
      pocket-handkerchief on the side of the hill, the lady leaned forward and
      looked back as if she wished to impress the place upon her memory. Her
      expression was that of a person going forth without demur into the day&rsquo;s
      hazards, ready to cope with them, yet there was some regret in the
      backward look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a place,&rsquo; she said aloud, &lsquo;where EVERYBODY has a good time!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Amusement Club went out of sight behind a curve; and she settled
      herself more comfortably among her cushions, and drew a wrap round her to
      meet the chill wind of the valley. It was all behind her. The lady looked
      out as the ponies galloped up to the first changing-place, and, seeing a
      saddled horse held by a syce, cramped herself a little into one corner to
      make room. The seat would just hold two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ram Singh salaamed, getting down to harness the fresh pair, and a man put
      his face in at the side of the tonga and took off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you all right?&rsquo; he said. His smile was as conscious as his words were
      casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite right. The ayah was silly about coming&mdash;didn&rsquo;t want to leave
      her babies or something&mdash;so I had to leave her behind. Everything
      else is either here or in the ekkas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The brute! Never mind&mdash;they&rsquo;re not much use in a railway journey.
      You can pick up another at Bombay. Then I suppose I&rsquo;d better get in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you better had. Unless you think of walking,&rsquo; she laughed, and
      he took the place beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ram Singh again unquestioningly took up the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody else going down?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not another soul. We might just as well have started together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well, we couldn&rsquo;t tell. Beastly awkward if there had been anybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, but thrust up her under lip indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the effect of turning to the business in hand, she bent her
      eyes upon him understandingly and smiled in frank reference to something
      that had not been mentioned. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s goodbye Simla, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; she said. He
      smiled in response and put his hand upon her firm, round arm,
      possessively, and they began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ram Singh, all unaware, kept his horses at their steady clanking downward
      gallop, and Simla, clinging to the hilltops, was brushed by the first rays
      of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came a gloriously clear morning; early riders round Jakko saw the real
      India lying beyond the outer ranges, flat and blue and pictured with
      forests and rivers like a map. The plains were pretty and interesting in
      this aspect, but nobody found them attractive. Sensitive people liked it
      better when the heat mist veiled them and it was possible to look abroad
      without a sudden painful thought of contrasting temperatures. We may
      suppose that the inhabitants of Paradise sometimes grieve over their luck.
      Even Madeline Anderson, whose heart knew no constriction at the
      remembrance of brother or husband at some cruel point in the blue expanse,
      had come to turn her head more willingly the other way, towards the hills
      rolling up to the snows, being a woman who suffered by proxy, and by
      observation, and by Rudyard Kipling.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular morning, however, she had not elected to do either. She
      slept late instead, and was glad to sleep. I might as well say at once
      that on the night before she had made up her mind, had brought herself to
      the point, and had written to Mrs. Innes, at &lsquo;Two Gables&rsquo;, all the facts,
      in so far as she was acquainted with them, connected with Frederick
      Prendergast&rsquo;s death. She was very much ashamed of herself, poor girl; she
      was aware that, through her postponement, Horace Innes would now see his
      problem in all its bitterness, make his choice with his eyes wide open. If
      it had only happened before he knew&mdash;anything about her!
    </p>
    <p>
      She charged herself with having deliberately waited, and then spent an
      exhausting hour trying to believe that she had drifted unconsciously to
      the point of their mutual confession. Whatever the truth was, she did not
      hesitate to recognize a new voice in her private counsels from that hour,
      urging her in one way or another to bring matters to an end. It was a
      strong instinct; looking at the facts, she saw it was the gambler&rsquo;s. When
      she tried to think of the ethical considerations involved she saw only the
      chances. The air seemed to throb with them all night; she had to count
      them finally to get rid of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brookes was up betimes, however, and sent off the letter. It went duly, by
      Surnoo, to Mrs. Innes at &lsquo;Two Gables&rsquo;. Madeline woke at seven with a
      start, and asked if it had gone, then slept again contentedly. So far as
      she was concerned the thing was finished. The breakfast gong had sounded,
      and the English mail had arrived before she opened her eyes again upon the
      day&rsquo;s issues; she gave it her somewhat desultory attention while Brookes
      did her hair. There was only one scrap of news. Adele mentioned in a
      postscript that poor Mr. Prendergast&rsquo;s money was likely to go to a distant
      relative, it having transpired that he died without leaving a will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is sure, absolutely sure,&rsquo; Madeline mused, &lsquo;to answer my letter in
      person. She will be here within an hour. I shall have this to tell her,
      too. How pleased she will be! She will come into it all, I suppose&mdash;if
      she is allowed. Though she won&rsquo;t be allowed, that is if&mdash;&rsquo; But there
      speculation began, and Madeline had forbidden herself speculation, if not
      once and for all, at least many times and for fifteen minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reasonable purpose would be served by Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s visit, Madeline
      reflected, as she sat waiting in the little room opening on the veranda;
      but she would come, of course she would come. She would require the
      satisfaction of the verbal assurance; she would hope to extract more
      details; she would want the objectionable gratification of talking if
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of any assurance, she would believe that Madeline had not told
      her before in order to make her miserable a little longer than she need
      be; but, after all, her impression about that did not particularly matter.
      It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a pleasant interview, yet Madeline found herself
      impatient for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surnoo,&rsquo; she said of her messenger, &lsquo;must be idling on his way back in
      the bazaar. I must try to remember to fine him two pice. Surnoo is
      incorrigible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She forgot, however, to fine Surnoo. The pad of his bare feet sounded
      along the veranda almost immediately, and the look in his Pahari eyes was
      that of expected reproach, and ability to defend himself against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out two letters at arm&rsquo;s-length, for as he was expected to bring
      only one there was a fault in this; and all his domestic traditions told
      him that he might be chastened. One was addressed to Madeline in Mrs.
      Innes&rsquo;s handwriting; the other, she saw with astonishment, was her own
      communication to that lady, her own letter returned. Surnoo explained
      volubly all the way along the veranda, and in the flood of his unknown
      tongue Madeline caught a sentence or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The memsahib was not,&rsquo; said Surnoo. Clearly he could not deliver a letter
      to a memsahib who was not. &lsquo;Therefore,&rsquo; Surnoo continued, &lsquo;I have brought
      back your honour&rsquo;s letter, and the other I had from the hand of the
      memsahib&rsquo;s runner, the runner with one eye, who was on the road to bring
      it here. More I do not know, but it appears that the memsahib has gone to
      her father and mother in Belaat, being very sorrowful because the
      Colonel-sahib has left her to shoot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The letter will tell me,&rsquo; said Madeline to herself, fingering it.
      &lsquo;Enough, Surnoo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man went away, and Madeline closed and locked the door of her
      sitting-room. The letter would tell her&mdash;what? She glanced about her
      with dissatisfaction, and sought the greater privacy of her bedroom, where
      also she locked the door and drew the muslin curtain across the window.
      She laid the letter on the dressing-table and kept her eyes upon it while
      she unfastened, with trembling hands, the brooch at her neck and the belt
      at her waist. She did one or two other meaningless things, as if she
      wanted to gain time, to fortify her nerves even against an exhibition
      before herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she sat down with her back towards the light and opened the letter.
      It had a pink look and a scented air. Even in her beating suspense
      Madeline held it a little farther away from her, as she unfolded it, and
      it ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Miss Anderson&mdash;What will you say, I wonder, and what will Simla
      say, when you know that Captain Drake and I have determined to DISREGARD
      CONVENTIONALITIES, and live henceforward only for one another! I am all
      packed up, and long before this meets your eye we shall have taken the
      step which society condemns, but which I have a feeling that you, knowing
      my storm-tossed history, will be broad-minded enough to sympathize with,
      at least to some extent. That is the reason I am writing to you rather
      than to any of my own chums, and also of course to have the satisfaction
      of telling you that I no longer care what you do about letting out the
      secret of my marriage to Frederick Prendergast. I am now ABOVE AND BEYOND
      IT. Any way you look at it, I do not see that I am much to blame. As I
      never have been Colonel Innes&rsquo;s wife there can be no harm in leaving him,
      though if he had ever been sympathetic, or understood me the LEAST LITTLE
      BIT, I might have felt bound to him. But he has never been able to evoke
      the finer parts of my nature, and when this is the case marriage is a mere
      miserable fleshly failure. You may say, &ldquo;Why try it a third time?&rdquo;&mdash;but
      my union with Val will be different. I have never been fond of the
      opposite sex&mdash;so far as that goes I should have made a very good nun&mdash;but
      for a long time Valentine Drake has been the only man I cared to have come
      within a mile of me, and lately we have discovered that we are absolutely
      necessary to each other&rsquo;s existence on the higher plane. I don&rsquo;t care much
      what Simla thinks, but if you happen to be talking about it to dear Lady
      Bloomfield, you might just mention this. Val has eight hundred a year of
      his own, so it is perfectly practicable. Of course, he will send in his
      papers. WHATEVER HAPPENS, Val and I will never bind ourselves in any way.
      We both think it wrong and enslaving. I have nothing more to add, except
      that I am depending on you to explain to Simla that I never was Mrs.
      Innes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Violet Prendergast.

    <p>
      &lsquo;P.S.&mdash;I have written to Horace, telling him everything about
      everything, and sent my letter off to him in the wilds by a runner. If you
      see him you might try and smooth him down. I don&rsquo;t want him coming after
      Val with a revolver.&rsquo;

      Madeline read this communication through twice. Then quietly and
      deliberately she lay down upon the bed, and drew herself out of the
      control of her heart by the hard labour of thought. When she rose, she had
      decided that there were only two things for her to do, and she began at
      once to do them, continuing her refuge in action. She threw her little
      rooms open again, and walked methodically round the outer one, collecting
      the odds and ends of Indian fabrics with which she had garnished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the maid came in, she looked up from folding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have news, Brookes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that necessitates my going home at
      once. No, it is not bad news, but&mdash;important. I will go now and see
      about the tonga. We must start tomorrow morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brookes called Surnoo, and the rickshaw came round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline looked at her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The telegraph office,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and as quickly as may be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the runners panted over the Mall, up and down and on, Madeline said to
      herself, &lsquo;She shall have her chance. She shall choose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The four reeking Paharis pulled up at the telegraph office, and Madeline
      sped up the steps. There was a table, with forms printed &lsquo;Indian
      Telegraphs,&rsquo; and the usual bottle of thickened ink and pair of rusty pens.
      She sat down to her intention as if she dared not let it cool; she wrote
      her message swiftly, she had worded it on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Mrs. Innes, Dak Bungalow, Solon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From M. Anderson, Simla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Frederick Prendergast died on January 7th, at Sing Sing. Your letter
      considered confidential if you return. Prendergast left no will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. Anderson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send this &ldquo;urgent,&rdquo; Babu,&rsquo; she said to the clerk, &lsquo;and repeat it to the
      railway station, Kalka. Shall I fill up another form? No? Very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door she turned and came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is now eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;The person I am telegraphing to is
      on her way down to get tonight&rsquo;s train at Kalka. I am hoping to catch her
      half-way at Solon. Do you think I can?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so, madam. Oyess! It is the custom to stop at Solon for tiffin.
      The telegram can arrive there. All urgent telegram going very quick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And in any case,&rsquo; said Madeline, &lsquo;it can not fail to reach her at Kalka?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not possible to fail, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will have her chance,&rsquo; she said to herself, on her way to the post
      office to order her tonga. And with a little nauseated shudder at the
      thought of the letter in her pocket, she added, &lsquo;It is amazing. I should
      have thought her too good a woman of business!&rsquo; After which she
      concentrated her whole attention upon the necessities of departure. Her
      single immediate apprehension was that Horace Innes might, by some magic
      of circumstances, be transported back into Simla before she could get out
      of it. That such a contingency was physically impossible made no
      difference to her nerves, and to the last Brookes was the hurrying victim
      of unnecessary promptings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little rambling hotel of Kalka, where the railway spreads out over the
      plains, raises its white-washed shelter under the very walls of the
      Himalayas. Madeline, just arrived, lay back in a long wicker chair on the
      veranda, and looked up at them as they mounted green and grey and silent
      under the beating of the first of the rains. Everywhere was a luxury of
      silence, the place was steeped in it, drowned in it. A feeding cow flicked
      an automatic tail under a tree. Near the low mud wall that strolled
      irresolutely between the house and the hills leaned a bush with a few
      single pink roses; their petals were floating down under the battering
      drops. A draggled bee tried to climb to a dry place on a pillar of the
      veranda. Above all, the hills, immediate, towering, all grey and green,
      solidly ideal, with phantasies of mist. Everything drippingly soft and
      silent. Suddenly the venetian blind that hung before the door of a bedroom
      farther on swayed out before a hand variously ringed to emit a lady in a
      pink lawn dress with apt embroideries. Madeline&rsquo;s half-closed eyes opened
      very wide, and for an instant she and the lady, to whom I must once more
      refer as Mrs. Innes, confronted each other. Then Mrs. Innes&rsquo;s countenance
      expanded, and she took three or four light steps forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you dear thing!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;I thought you were in Simla! Imagine
      you being here! Do you know you have SAVED me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline regarded her in silence, while a pallor spread over her face and
      lips, and her features grew sharp with a presage of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I?&rsquo; she stammered. She could not think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed you have. I don&rsquo;t know how to be grateful enough to you. Your
      telegram of yesterday reached me at Solon. We had just sat down to tiffin.
      Nothing will ever shake my faith in providence again! My dear, THINK of it&mdash;after
      all I&rsquo;ve been through, my darling Val&mdash;and one hundred thousand
      pounds!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;I stayed behind there last night, and Val came on here and
      made the necessary arrangement, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we were married this morning. Good heavens! What&rsquo;s the matter with
      you! Here&mdash;oh, Brookes! Water, salts&mdash;anything!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brookes, I know, would think that I should dwell at greater length upon
      Miss Anderson&rsquo;s attack of faintness in Kalka, and the various measures
      which were resorted to for her succour, but perhaps the feelings and
      expedients of any really capable lady&rsquo;s-maid under the circumstances may
      be taken for granted. I feel more seriously called upon to explain that
      Colonel Horace Innes, shortly after these last events, took two years&rsquo; 
      furlough to England, during which he made a very interesting tour in the
      United States with the lady with now bears his name by inalienable right.
      Captain and Mrs. Valentine Drake are getting the most that is to be had
      out of Frederick Prendergast&rsquo;s fortune with courage in London and the
      European capitals, where Mrs. Drake is sometimes mentioned as a lady with
      a romantic past. They have not returned to Simla, where the situation has
      never been properly understood. People always supposed that Mrs. Drake ran
      away that June morning with her present husband, who must have been
      tremendously fond of her to have married her &lsquo;after the divorce.&rsquo; She is
      also occasionally mentioned in undertones as &lsquo;the first Mrs. Innes.&rsquo; All
      of which we know to be quite erroneous, like most scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mickie and Mrs. Gammidge, in retirement, are superintending the
      education of their children in Bedford, where it is cheap and practical.
      They converse when they meet about the iniquitous prices of dressmakers
      and the degeneracy of the kind of cook obtainable in England at eighteen
      pounds a year. Mrs. Gammidge has grown rather portly and very ritualistic.
      They seldom speak of Simla, and when they do, if too reminiscent a spark
      appears in Mrs. Mickie&rsquo;s eye, Mrs. Gammidge changes the subject. Kitty
      Vesey still fills her dance cards at Viceregal functions, though people do
      not quote her as they used to, and subalterns imagine themselves vastly
      witty about her colour, which is unimpaired. People often commend her,
      however, for her good nature to debutantes, and it is admitted that she
      may still ride with credit in &lsquo;affinity stakes&rsquo;&mdash;and occasionally win
      them.

      4. The Pool in the Desert.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I knew Anna Chichele and Judy Harbottle so well, and they figured so
      vividly at one time against the rather empty landscape of life in a
      frontier station, that my affection for one of them used to seem little
      more, or less, than a variant upon my affection for the other. That
      recollection, however, bears examination badly; Judy was much the better
      sort, and it is Judy&rsquo;s part in it that draws me into telling the story.
      Conveying Judy is what I tremble at: her part was simple. Looking back&mdash;and
      not so very far&mdash;her part has the relief of high comedy with the
      proximity of tears; but looking closely, I find that it is mostly Judy,
      and what she did is entirely second, in my untarnished picture, to what
      she was. Still I do not think I can dissuade myself from putting it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would, of course, inevitably have found each other sooner or later,
      Mrs. Harbottle and Mrs. Chichele, but it was I who actually introduced
      them; my palmy veranda in Rawul Pindi; where the teacups used to assemble,
      was the scene of it. I presided behind my samovar over the early
      formalities that were almost at once to drop from their friendship, like
      the sheath of some bursting flower. I deliberately brought them together,
      so the birth was not accidental, and my interest in it quite legitimately
      maternal. We always had tea in the veranda in Rawul Pindi, the
      drawing-room was painted blue, blue for thirty feet up to the whitewashed
      cotton ceiling; nothing of any value in the way of a human relation, I am
      sure, could have originated there. The veranda was spacious and open,
      their mutual observation had room and freedom; I watched it to and fro. I
      had not long to wait for my reward; the beautiful candour I expected
      between them was not ten minutes in coming. For the sake of it I had taken
      some trouble, but when I perceived it revealing I went and sat down beside
      Judy&rsquo;s husband, Robert Harbottle, and talked about Pharaoh&rsquo;s split hoof.
      It was only fair; and when next day I got their impressions of one
      another, I felt single-minded and deserving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew it would be a satisfactory sort of thing to do, but perhaps it was
      rather more for Judy&rsquo;s sake than for Anna&rsquo;s that I did it. Mrs. Harbottle
      was only twenty-seven then and Robert a major, but he had brought her to
      India out of an episode too colour-flushed to tone with English hedges;
      their marriage had come, in short, of his divorce, and as too natural a
      consequence. In India it is well known that the eye becomes accustomed to
      primitive pigments and high lights; the aesthetic consideration, if
      nothing else, demanded Robert&rsquo;s exchange. He was lucky to get a Piffer
      regiment, and the Twelfth were lucky to get him; we were all lucky, I
      thought, to get Judy. It was an opinion, of course, a good deal
      challenged, even in Rawul Pindi, where it was thought, especially in the
      beginning, that acquiescence was the most the Harbottles could hope for.
      That is not enough in India; cordiality is the common right. I could not
      have Judy preserving her atmosphere at our tea-parties and gymkhanas. Not
      that there were two minds among us about &lsquo;the case&rsquo;; it was a preposterous
      case, sentimentally undignified, from some points of view deplorable. I
      chose to reserve my point of view, from which I saw it, on Judy&rsquo;s behalf,
      merely quixotic, preferring on Robert&rsquo;s just to close my eyes. There is no
      doubt that his first wife was odious to a degree which it is simply
      pleasanter not to recount, but her malignity must almost have amounted to
      a sense of humour. Her detestation of her cousin Judy Thynne dated much
      further back than Robert&rsquo;s attachment. That began in Paris, where Judy, a
      young widow, was developing a real vein at Julian&rsquo;s. I am entirely
      convinced that there was nothing, as people say, &lsquo;in it,&rsquo; Judy had not a
      thought at that time that was not based on Chinese white and permeated
      with good-fellowship; but there was a good deal of it, and no doubt the
      turgid imagination of the first Mrs. Harbottle dealt with it honestly
      enough. At all events, she saw her opportunity, and the depths of her
      indifference to Robert bubbled up venomously into the suit. That it was
      undefended was the senseless mystery; decency ordained that he and Judy
      should have made a fight, even in the hope that it would be a losing one.
      The reason it had to be a losing one&mdash;the reason so immensely
      criticized&mdash;was that the petitioning lady obstinately refused to
      bring her action against any other set of circumstances than those to
      which, I have no doubt, Judy contributed every indiscretion. It is hard to
      imagine Robert Harbottle refusing her any sort of justification that the
      law demands short of beating her, but her malice would accept nothing of
      which the account did not go for final settlement to Judy Thynne. If her
      husband wanted his liberty, he should have it, she declared, at that price
      and no other. Major Harbottle did indeed deeply long for his liberty, and
      his interesting friend, Mrs. Thynne, had, one can only say, the most vivid
      commiseration for his bondage. Whatever chance they had of winning, to win
      would be, for the end they had at heart, to lose, so they simply
      abstained, as it were, from comment upon the detestable procedure which
      terminated in the rule absolute. I have often wondered whether the whole
      business would not have been more defensible if there had been on Judy&rsquo;s
      part any emotional spring for the leap they made. I offer my conviction
      that there was none, that she was only extravagantly affected by the
      ideals of the Quarter&mdash;it is a transporting atmosphere&mdash;and held
      a view of comradeship which permitted the reversal of the modern situation
      filled by a blameless correspondent. Robert, of course, was tremendously
      in love with her; but my theory is that she married him as the logical
      outcome of her sacrifice and by no means the smallest part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all quite unimaginable, as so many things are, but the upshot of it
      brought Judy to Rawul Pindi, as I have said, where I for one thought her
      mistake insignificant compared with her value. It would have been great,
      her value, anywhere; in the middle of the Punjab it was incalculable. To
      explain why would be to explain British India, but I hope it will appear;
      and I am quite willing, remember, to take the responsibility if it does
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somers Chichele, Anna&rsquo;s son, it is absurd to think, must have been about
      fifteen then, reflecting at Winchester with the other &lsquo;men&rsquo; upon the
      comparative merits of tinned sardines and jam roll, and whether a packet
      of real Egyptians was not worth the sacrifice of either. His father was
      colonel of the Twelfth; his mother was still charming. It was the year
      before Dick Forsyth came down from the neighbourhood of Sheikhbudin with a
      brevet and a good deal of personal damage. I mention him because he proved
      Anna&rsquo;s charm in the only conclusive way before the eyes of us all; and the
      station, I remember, was edified to observe that if Mrs. Chichele came out
      of the matter &lsquo;straight&rsquo;&mdash;one relapses so easily into the simple
      definitions of those parts&mdash;which she undoubtedly did, she owed it in
      no small degree to Judy Harbottle. This one feels to be hardly a
      legitimate reference, but it is something tangible to lay hold upon in
      trying to describe the web of volitions which began to weave itself
      between the two that afternoon on my veranda and which afterward became so
      strong a bond. I was delighted with the thing; its simplicity and
      sincerity stood out among our conventional little compromises at
      friendship like an ideal. She and Judy had the assurance of one another;
      they made upon one another the finest and often the most unconscionable
      demands. One met them walking at odd hours in queer places, of which I
      imagine they were not much aware. They would turn deliberately off the
      Maidan and away from the bandstand to be rid of our irrelevant bows; they
      did their duty by the rest of us, but the most egregious among us, the
      Deputy-Commissioner for selection, could see that he hardly counted. I
      thought I understood, but that may have been my fatuity; certainly when
      their husbands inquired what on earth they had been talking of, it usually
      transpired that they had found an infinite amount to say about nothing. It
      was a little worrying to hear Colonel Chichele and Major Harbottle
      describe their wives as &lsquo;pals,&rsquo; but the fact could not be denied, and
      after all we were in the Punjab. They were pals too, but the terms were
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      People discussed it according to their lights, and girls said in pretty
      wonderment that Mrs. Harbottle and Mrs. Chichele were like men, they never
      kissed each other. I think Judy prescribed these conditions. Anna was far
      more a person who did as the world told her. But it was a poor negation to
      describe all that they never did; there was no common little convention of
      attachment that did not seem to be tacitly omitted between them. I hope
      one did not too cynically observe that they offered these to their
      husbands instead; the redeeming observation was their husbands&rsquo; complete
      satisfaction. This they maintained to the end. In the natural order of
      things Robert Harbottle should have paid heavily for interfering as he did
      in Paris between a woman and what she was entitled to live for. As a
      matter of fact he never paid anything at all; I doubt whether he ever knew
      himself a debtor. Judy kept her temperament under like a current and swam
      with the tides of the surface, taking refreshing dips only now and then
      which one traced in her eyes and her hair when she and Robert came back
      from leave. That sort of thing is lost in the sands of India, but it makes
      an oasis as it travels, and it sometimes seemed to me a curious pity that
      she and Anna should sit in the shade of it together, while Robert and
      Peter Chichele, their titular companions, blundered on in the desert. But
      after all, if you are born blind&mdash;and the men were both immensely
      liked, and the shooting was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten years later Somers joined. The Twelfth were at Peshawur. Robert
      Harbottle was Lieutenant-Colonel by that time and had the regiment.
      Distinction had incrusted, in the Indian way, upon Peter Chichele, its
      former colonel; he was General Commanding the District and K.C.B. So we
      were all still together in Peshawur. It was great luck for the Chicheles,
      Sir Peter&rsquo;s having the district, though his father&rsquo;s old regiment would
      have made it pleasant enough for the boy in any case. He came to us, I
      mean, of course, to two or three of us, with the interest that hangs about
      a victim of circumstances; we understood that he wasn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;born soldier.&rsquo; 
      Anna had told me on the contrary that he was a sacrifice to family
      tradition made inevitable by the General&rsquo;s unfortunate investments.
      Bellona&rsquo;s bridegroom was not a role he fancied, though he would make a
      kind of compromise as best man; he would agree, she said, to be a war
      correspondent and write picturesque specials for the London halfpenny
      press. There was the humour of the poor boy&rsquo;s despair in it, but she
      conveyed it, I remember, in exactly the same tone with which she had said
      to me years before that he wanted to drive a milk-cart. She carried quite
      her half of the family tradition, though she could talk of sacrifice and
      make her eyes wistful, contemplating for Somers the limitations of the
      drill-book and the camp of exercise, proclaiming and insisting upon what
      she would have done if she could only have chosen for him. Anna Chichele
      saw things that way. With more than a passable sense of all that was
      involved, if she could have made her son an artist in life or a
      commander-in-chief, if she could have given him the seeing eye or Order of
      the Star of India, she would not have hesitated for an instant. Judy, with
      her single mind, cried out, almost at sight of him, upon them both, I mean
      both Anna and Sir Peter. Not that the boy carried his condemnation badly,
      or even obviously; I venture that no one noticed it in the mess; but it
      was naturally plain to those of us who were under the same. He had put in
      his two years with a British regiment at Meerut&mdash;they nurse
      subalterns that way for the Indian army&mdash;and his eyes no longer
      played with the tinsel vision of India; they looked instead into the arid
      stretch beyond. This preoccupation conveyed to the Surgeon-Major&rsquo;s wife
      the suggestion that Mr. Chichele was the victim of a hopeless attachment.
      Mrs. Harbottle made no such mistake; she saw simply, I imagine, the
      beginnings of her own hunger and thirst in him, looking back as she told
      us across a decade of dusty sunsets to remember them. The decade was
      there, close to the memory of all of us; we put, from Judy herself
      downward, an absurd amount of confidence in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked so well the night she met him. It was English mail day; she
      depended a great deal upon her letters, and I suppose somebody had written
      her a word that brought her that happy, still excitement that is the inner
      mystery of words. He went straight to her with some speech about his
      mother having given him leave, and for twenty minutes she patronized him
      on a sofa as his mother would not have dreamed of doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Chichele, from the other side of the room, smiled on the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I depend on you and Judy to be good to him while we are away,&rsquo; she said.
      She and Sir Peter were going on leave at the end of the week to Scotland,
      as usual, for the shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following her glance I felt incapable of the proportion she assigned me.
      &lsquo;I will see after his socks with pleasure,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I think, don&rsquo;t you,
      we may leave the rest to Judy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes remained upon the boy, and I saw the passion rise in them, at
      which I turned mine elsewhere. Who can look unperturbed upon such a
      privacy of nature as that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor old Judy!&rsquo; she went on. &lsquo;She never would be bothered with him in all
      his dear hobble-dehoy time; she resented his claims, the unreasonable
      creature, used to limit me to three anecdotes a week; and now she has him
      on her hands, if you like. See the pretty air of deference in the way he
      listens to her! He has nice manners, the villain, if he is a Chichele!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you have improved Sir Peter&rsquo;s,&rsquo; I said kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do hope Judy will think him worth while. I can&rsquo;t quite expect that he
      will be up to her, bless him, she is so much cleverer, isn&rsquo;t she, than any
      of us? But if she will just be herself with him it will make such a
      difference.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two crossed the room to us at that, and Judy gaily made Somers
      over to his mother, trailing off to find Robert in the billiard-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what has Mrs. Harbottle been telling you?&rsquo; Anna asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s eye followed Judy, his hand went musingly to his
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was telling me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that people in India were sepulchers of
      themselves, but that now and then one came who could roll away another&rsquo;s
      stone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It sounds promising,&rsquo; said Lady Chichele to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It sounds cryptic,&rsquo; I laughed to Somers, but I saw that he had the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can not say that I attended diligently to Mr. Chichele&rsquo;s socks, but the
      part corresponding was freely assigned me. After his people went I saw him
      often. He pretended to find qualities in my tea, implied that he found
      them in my talk. As a matter of fact it was my inquiring attitude that he
      loved, the knowledge that there was no detail that he could give me about
      himself, his impressions and experiences, that was unlikely to interest
      me. I would not for the world imply that he was egotistical or complacent,
      absolutely the reverse, but he possessed an articulate soul which found
      its happiness in expression, and I liked to listen. I feel that these are
      complicated words to explain a very simple relation, and I pause to wonder
      what is left to me if I wished to describe his commerce with Mrs.
      Harbottle. Luckily there is an alternative; one needn&rsquo;t do it. I wish I
      had somewhere on paper Judy&rsquo;s own account of it at this period, however.
      It is a thing she would have enjoyed writing and more enjoyed
      communicating, at this period.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a grave reticence in his talk about her which amused me in the
      beginning. Mrs. Harbottle had been for ten years important enough to us
      all, but her serious significance, the light and the beauty in her, had
      plainly been reserved for the discovery of this sensitive and intelligent
      person not very long from Sandhurst and exactly twenty-six. I was barely
      allowed a familiar reference, and anything approaching a flippancy was met
      with penetrating silence. I was almost rebuked for lightly suggesting that
      she must occasionally find herself bored in Peshawur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not anywhere,&rsquo; said Mr. Chichele; &lsquo;Mrs. Harbottle is one of the
      few people who sound the privilege of living.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This to me, who had counted Mrs. Harbottle&rsquo;s yawns on so many occasions!
      It became presently necessary to be careful, tactful, in one&rsquo;s
      implications about Mrs. Harbottle, and to recognize a certain distinction
      in the fact that one was the only person with whom Mr. Chichele discussed
      her at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came when we talked of Robert; it was bound to come in the
      progress of any understanding and affectionate colloquy which had his wife
      for inspiration. I was familiar, of course, with Somers&rsquo;s opinion that the
      Colonel was an awfully good sort; that had been among the preliminaries
      and become understood as the base of all references. And I liked Robert
      Harbottle very well myself. When his adjutant called him a born leader of
      men, however, I felt compelled to look at the statement consideringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a tight place,&rsquo; I said&mdash;dear me, what expressions had the freedom
      of our little frontier drawing-rooms!&mdash;&lsquo;I would as soon depend on him
      as on anybody. But as for leadership&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is such a good fellow that nobody here does justice to his soldierly
      qualities,&rsquo; said Mr. Chichele, &lsquo;except Mrs. Harbottle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she been telling you about them?&rsquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he hesitated, &lsquo;she told me about the Mulla Nulla affair. She is
      rather proud of that. Any woman would be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor dear Judy!&rsquo; I mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somers said nothing, but looked at me, removing his cigarette, as if my
      words would be the better of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has taken refuge in them&mdash;in Bob Harbottle&rsquo;s soldierly qualities&mdash;ever
      since she married him,&rsquo; I continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Taken refuge,&rsquo; he repeated, coldly, but at my uncompromising glance his
      eyes fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I mean what I say,&rsquo; I laughed. &lsquo;Your cigarette has gone out&mdash;have
      another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think her devotion to him splendid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite splendid. Have you seen the things he brought her from the Simla
      Art Exhibition? He said they were nice bits of colour, and she has hung
      them in the drawing-room, where she will have to look at them every day.
      Let us admire her&mdash;dear Judy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he said, with a fine air of detachment, &lsquo;do you think they are so
      necessary, those agreements?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;we see that they are not indispensable. More sugar? I
      have only given you one lump. And we know, at all events,&rsquo; I added,
      unguardedly, &lsquo;that she could never have had an illusion about him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked up quickly. &lsquo;Is that story true?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was a story, but most of us have forgotten it. Who told you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The doctor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Surgeon-Major,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;has an accurate memory and a sense of
      proportion. As I suppose you were bound to get it from somebody, I am glad
      you got it from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not prepared to go on, and saw with some relief that Somers was not
      either. His silence, as he smoked, seemed to me deliberate; and I had
      oddly enough at this moment for the first time the impression that he was
      a man and not a boy. Then the Harbottles themselves joined us, very cheery
      after a gallop from the Wazir-Bagh. We talked of old times, old
      friendships, good swords that were broken, names that had carried far, and
      Somers effaced himself in the perfect manner of the British subaltern. It
      was a long, pleasant gossip, and I thought Judy seemed rather glad to let
      her husband dictate its level, which, of course, he did. I noticed when
      the three rode away together that the Colonel was beginning to sit down
      rather solidly on his big New Zealander; and I watched the dusk come over
      from the foothills for a long time thinking more kindly than I had spoken
      of Robert Harbottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often wondered how far happiness is contributed to a temperament
      like Judy Harbottle&rsquo;s, and how far it creates its own; but I doubt
      whether, on either count, she found as much in any other winter of her
      life except perhaps the remote ones by the Seine. Those ardent hours of
      hers, when everything she said was touched with the flame of her
      individuality, came oftener; she suddenly cleaned up her palate and began
      to translate in one study after another the language of the frontier
      country, that spoke only in stones and in shadows under the stones and in
      sunlight over them. There is nothing in the Academy of this year, at all
      events, that I would exchange for the one she gave me. She lived her
      physical life at a pace which carried us all along with her; she hunted
      and drove and danced and dined with such sincere intention as convinced us
      all that in hunting and driving and dancing and dining there were
      satisfactions that had been somehow overlooked. The Surgeon-Major&rsquo;s wife
      said it was delightful to meet Mrs. Harbottle, she seemed to enjoy
      everything so thoroughly; the Surgeon-Major looked at her critically and
      asked her if she were quite sure she hadn&rsquo;t a night temperature. He was a
      Scotchman. One night Colonel Harbottle, hearing her give away the last
      extra, charged her with renewing her youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Bob,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;only imitating it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, that question of her youth. It was so near her&mdash;still, she told
      me once, she heard the beat of its flying, and the pulse in her veins
      answered the false signal. That was afterward, when she told the truth.
      She was not so happy when she indulged herself otherwise. As when she
      asked one to remember that she was a middle-aged woman, with middle-aged
      thoughts and satisfactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am now really happiest,&rsquo; she declared, &lsquo;when the Commissioner takes me
      in to dinner, when the General Commanding leads me to the dance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did her best to make it an honest conviction. I offered her a recent
      success not crowned by the Academy, and she put it down on the table. &lsquo;By
      and by,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;At present I am reading Pascal and Bossuet.&rsquo; Well, she
      was reading Pascal and Bossuet. She grieved aloud that most of our
      activities in India were so indomitably youthful, owing to the accident
      that most of us were always so young. &lsquo;There is no dignified distraction
      in this country,&rsquo; she complained, &lsquo;for respectable ladies nearing forty.&rsquo; 
      She seemed to like to make these declarations in the presence of Somers
      Chichele, who would look at her with a little queer smile&mdash;a bad
      translation, I imagine, of what he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave herself so generously to her seniors that somebody said Mrs.
      Harbottle&rsquo;s girdle was hung with brass hats. It seems flippant to add that
      her complexion was as honest as the day, but the fact is that the year
      before Judy had felt compelled, like the rest of us, to repair just a
      little the ravages of the climate. If she had never done it one would not
      have looked twice at the absurdity when she said of the powder-puff in the
      dressing-room, &lsquo;I have raised that thing to the level of an immorality,&rsquo; 
      and sailed in to dance with an uncompromising expression and a face
      uncompromised. I have not spoken of her beauty; for one thing it was not
      always there, and there were people who would deny it altogether, or whose
      considered comment was, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call her plain.&rsquo; They, of course, were
      people in whom she declined to be interested, but even for those of us who
      could evoke some demonstration of her vivid self her face would not always
      light in correspondence. When it did there was none that I liked better to
      look at; and I envied Somers Chichele his way to make it the pale, shining
      thing that would hold him lifted, in return, for hours together, with I
      know not what mystic power of a moon upon the tide. And he? Oh, he was
      dark and delicate, by nature simple, sincere, delightfully intelligent.
      His common title to charm was the rather sweet seriousness that rested on
      his upper lip, and a certain winning gratification in his attention; but
      he had a subtler one in his eyes, which must be always seeking and smiling
      over what they found; those eyes of perpetual inquiry for the exquisite
      which ask so little help to create it. A personality to button up in a
      uniform, good heavens!
    </p>
    <p>
      As I begin to think of them together I remember how the maternal note
      appeared in her talk about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His youth is pathetic,&rsquo; she told me, &lsquo;but there is nothing that he does
      not understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize, Judy,&rsquo; I said. We were so brusque on the frontier.
      Besides, the matter still suffered a jocular presentment. Mrs. Harbottle
      and Mr. Chichele were still &lsquo;great friends&rsquo;; we could still put them next
      each other at our dinner-parties without the feeling that it would be
      &lsquo;marked.&rsquo; There was still nothing unusual in the fact that when Mrs.
      Harbottle was there Mr. Chichele might be taken for granted. We were so
      broad-minded also, on the frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew more obvious, the maternal note. I began positively to dread it,
      almost as much, I imagine, as Somers did. She took her privileges all in
      Anna&rsquo;s name, she exercised her authority quite as Lady Chichele&rsquo;s proxy.
      She went to the very limit. &lsquo;Anna Chichele,&rsquo; she said actually in his
      presence, &lsquo;is a fortunate woman. She has all kinds of cleverness, and she
      has her tall son. I have only one little talent, and I have no tall son.&rsquo; 
      Now it was not in nature that she could have had a son as tall as Somers,
      nor was that desire in her eyes. All civilization implies a good deal of
      farce, but this was a poor refuge, a cheap device; I was glad when it fell
      away from her sincerity, when the day came on which she looked into my
      fire and said simply, &lsquo;An attachment like ours has no terms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For what comes and goes,&rsquo; she went on dreamily, &lsquo;how could there be a
      formula?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, Judy,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you know me very well. What if the flesh leaps
      with the spirit?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me, very white. &lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited, but there seemed nothing more that she could say; and in the
      silence the futile negative seemed to wander round the room repeating
      itself like an echo, &lsquo;Oh no, no.&rsquo; I poked the fire presently to drown the
      sound of it. Judy sat still, with her feet crossed and her hands thrust
      into the pockets of her coat, staring into the coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you live independently, satisfied with your interests and
      occupations?&rsquo; she demanded at last. &lsquo;Yes, I know you can. I can&rsquo;t. I must
      exist more than half in other people. It is what they think and feel that
      matters to me, just as much as what I think and feel. The best of life is
      in that communication.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has always been a passion with you, Judy,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;I can imagine
      how much you must miss&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anna Chichele,&rsquo; I said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up and walked about the room, fixing here and there an intent
      regard upon things which she did not see. &lsquo;Oh, I do,&rsquo; she said at one
      point, with the effect of pulling herself together. She took another turn
      or two, and then finding herself near the door she went out. I felt as
      profoundly humiliated for her as if she had staggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night was one of those that stand out so vividly, for no reason
      that one can identify, in one&rsquo;s memory. We were dining with the
      Harbottles, a small party, for a tourist they had with them. Judy and I
      and Somers and the traveller had drifted out into the veranda, where the
      scent of Japanese lilies came and went on the spring wind to trouble the
      souls of any taken unawares. There was a brightness beyond the foothills
      where the moon was coming, and I remember how one tall clump swayed out
      against it, and seemed in passionate perfume to lay a burden on the
      breast. Judy moved away from it and sat clasping her knees on the edge of
      the veranda. Somers, when his eyes were not upon her, looked always at the
      lily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the spirit of the globe-trotter was stirred, and he said, &lsquo;I think
      you Anglo-Indians live in a kind of little paradise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant&rsquo;s silence, and then Judy turned her face into the
      lamplight from the drawing-room. &lsquo;With everything but the essentials,&rsquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stayed late; Mr. Chichele and ourselves were the last to go. Judy
      walked with us along the moonlit drive to the gate, which is so
      unnecessary a luxury in India that the servants always leave it open. She
      swung the stiff halves together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it is shut.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; said Somers Chichele, softly and quickly, &lsquo;am on the other side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even over that depth she could flash him a smile. &lsquo;It is the business of
      my life,&rsquo; she gave him in return, &lsquo;to keep this gate shut.&rsquo; I felt as if
      they had forgotten us. Somers mounted and rode off without a word. We were
      walking in a different direction. Looking back, I saw Judy leaning
      immovable on the gate, while Somers turned in his saddle, apparently to
      repeat the form of lifting his hat. And all about them stretched the
      stones of Kabul valley, vague and formless in the tide of the moonlight...
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day a note from Mrs. Harbottle informed me that she had gone to
      Bombay for a fortnight. In a postscript she wrote, &lsquo;I shall wait for the
      Chicheles there, and come back with them.&rsquo; I remember reflecting that if
      she could not induce herself to take a passage to England in the ship that
      brought them, it seemed the right thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did come back with them. I met the party at the station. I knew Somers
      would meet them, and it seemed to me, so imminent did disaster loom, that
      someone else should be there, someone to offer a covering movement or a
      flank support wherever it might be most needed. And among all our smiling
      faces disaster did come, or the cold premonition of it. We were all
      perfect, but Somers&rsquo;s lip trembled. Deprived for a fortnight he was eager
      for the draft, and he was only twenty-six. His lip trembled, and there,
      under the flickering station-lamps, suddenly stood that of which there
      never could be again any denial, for those of us who saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did we make, I wonder, even a pretense of disguising the consternation
      that sprang up among us, like an armed thing, ready to kill any further
      suggestion of the truth? I don&rsquo;t know. Anna Chichele&rsquo;s unfinished sentence
      dropped as if someone had given her a blow upon the mouth. Coolies were
      piling the luggage into a hired carriage at the edge of the platform. She
      walked mechanically after them, and would have stepped in with it but for
      the sight of her own gleaming landau drawn up within a yard or two, and
      the General waiting. We all got home somehow, taking it with us, and I
      gave Lady Chichele twenty-four hours to come to me with her face all one
      question and her heart all one fear. She came in twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you seen it&mdash;long?&rsquo; Prepared as I was her directness was
      demoralizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t a mortal disease.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, not with certainty, for more than a month.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little spasmodic movement with her hands, then dropped them
      pitifully. &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you do ANYthing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her, and she said at once, &lsquo;No, of course you couldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two I took my share of the heavy sense of it, my trivial
      share, which yet was an experience sufficiently exciting. &lsquo;I am afraid it
      will have to be faced,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will happen?&rsquo; Anna cried. &lsquo;Oh, what will happen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not the usual thing?&rsquo; Lady Chichele looked up quickly as if at a
      reminder. &lsquo;The ambiguous attachment of the country,&rsquo; I went on, limping
      but courageous, &lsquo;half declared, half admitted, that leads vaguely nowhere,
      and finally perishes as the man&rsquo;s life enriches itself&mdash;the thing we
      have seen so often.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever Judy is capable of it won&rsquo;t be the usual thing. You know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to confess in silence that I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It flashed at me&mdash;the difference in her&mdash;in Bombay.&rsquo; She
      pressed her lips together and then went on unsteadily. &lsquo;In her eyes, her
      voice. She was mannered, extravagant, elaborate. With me! All the way up I
      wondered and worried. But I never thought&mdash;&rsquo; She stopped; her voice
      simply shook itself into silence. I called a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to give you a good stiff peg,&rsquo; I said. I apologize for the
      &lsquo;peg,&rsquo; but not for the whisky and soda. It is a beverage on the frontier,
      of which the vulgarity is lost in the value. While it was coming I tried
      to talk of other things, but she would only nod absently in the pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last night we dined with him, it was guest night at the mess, and she was
      there. I watched her, and she knew it. I don&rsquo;t know whether she tried, but
      anyway, she failed. The covenant between them was written on her forehead
      whenever she looked at him, though that was seldom. She dared not look at
      him. And the little conversation that they had&mdash;you would have
      laughed&mdash;it was a comedy of stutters. The facile Mrs. Harbottle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do well to be angry, naturally,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but it would be fatal to
      let yourself go, Anna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Angry?&rsquo; Oh, I am SICK. The misery of it! The terror of it! If it were
      anybody but Judy! Can&rsquo;t you imagine the passion of a temperament like that
      in a woman who has all these years been feeding on herself? I tell you she
      will take him from my very arms. And he will go&mdash;to I dare not
      imagine what catastrophe! Who can prevent it? Who can prevent it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is you,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Chichele laughed hysterically. &lsquo;I think you ought to say, &ldquo;There are
      you.&rdquo; I&mdash;what can I do? Do you realize that it&rsquo;s JUDY? My friend&mdash;my
      other self? Do you think we can drag all that out of it? Do you think a
      tie like that can be broken by an accident&mdash;by a misfortune? With it
      all I ADORE Judy Harbottle. I love her, as I have always loved her, and&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      damnable, but I don&rsquo;t know whether, whatever happened, I wouldn&rsquo;t go on
      loving her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Finish your peg,&rsquo; I said. She was sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where I blame myself most,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;is for not seeing in him all
      that makes him mature to her&mdash;that makes her forget the absurd
      difference between them, and take him simply and sincerely as I know she
      does, as the contemporary of her soul if not of her body. I saw none of
      that. Could I, as his mother? Would he show it to me? I thought him just a
      charming boy, clever, too, of course, with nice instincts and well
      plucked; we were always proud of that, with his delicate physique. Just a
      boy! I haven&rsquo;t yet stopped thinking how different he looks without his
      curls. And I thought she would be just kind and gracious and delightful to
      him because he was my son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, of course,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;is the only chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&mdash;what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is your son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have me appeal to her? Do you know I don&rsquo;t think I could?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, no. Your case must present itself. It must spring upon her and
      grow before her out of your silence, and if you can manage it, your
      confidence. There is a great deal, after all, remember, to hold her in
      that. I can&rsquo;t somehow imagine her failing you. Otherwise&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Chichele and I exchanged a glance of candid admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Otherwise she would be capable of sacrificing everything&mdash;everything.
      Of gathering her life into an hour. I know. And do you know if the thing
      were less impossible, less grotesque, I should not be so much afraid? I
      mean that the ABSOLUTE indefensibility of it might bring her a
      recklessness and a momentum which might&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send her over the verge,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Well, go home and ask her to dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal more to say, of course, than I have thought proper
      to put down here, but before Anna went I saw that she was keyed up to the
      heroic part. This was none the less to her credit because it was the only
      part, the dictation of a sense of expediency that despaired while it
      dictated. The noble thing was her capacity to take it, and, amid all that
      warred in her, to carry it out on the brave high lines of her inspiration.
      It seemed a literal inspiration, so perfectly calculated that it was hard
      not to think sometimes, when one saw them together, that Anna had been
      lulled into a simple resumption of the old relation. Then from the least
      thing possible&mdash;the lift of an eyelid&mdash;it flashed upon one that
      between these two every moment was dramatic, and one took up the word with
      a curious sense of detachment and futility, but with one&rsquo;s heart beating
      like a trip-hammer with the mad excitement of it. The acute thing was the
      splendid sincerity of Judy Harbottle&rsquo;s response. For days she was
      profoundly on her guard, then suddenly she seemed to become practically,
      vividly aware of what I must go on calling the great chance, and
      passionately to fling herself upon it. It was the strangest cooperation
      without a word or a sign to show it conscious&mdash;a playing together for
      stakes that could not be admitted, a thing to hang upon breathless. It was
      there between them&mdash;the tenable ground of what they were to each
      other: they occupied it with almost an equal eye upon the tide that
      threatened, while I from my mainland tower also made an anguished
      calculation of the chances. I think in spite of the menace, they found
      real beatitudes; so keenly did they set about the business that it brought
      them moments finer than any they could count in the years that were behind
      them, the flat and colourless years that were gone. Once or twice the wild
      idea even visited me that it was, after all, the projection of his mother
      in Somers that had so seized Judy Harbottle, and that the original was all
      that was needed to help the happy process of detachment. Somers himself at
      the time was a good deal away on escort duty: they had a clear field.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can not tell exactly when&mdash;between Mrs. Harbottle and myself&mdash;it
      became a matter for reference more or less overt, I mean her defined
      problem, the thing that went about between her and the sun. It will be
      imagined that it did not come up like the weather; indeed, it was hardly
      ever to be envisaged and never to be held; but it was always there, and
      out of our joint consciousness it would sometimes leap and pass, without
      shape or face. It might slip between two sentences, or it might remain, a
      dogging shadow, for an hour. Or a week would go by while, with a strong
      hand, she held it out of sight altogether and talked of Anna&mdash;always
      of Anna. Her eyes shone with the things she told me then: she seemed to
      keep herself under the influence of them as if they had the power of
      narcotics. At the end of a time like this she turned to me in the door as
      she was going and stood silent, as if she could neither go nor stay. I had
      been able to make nothing of her that afternoon: she had seemed
      preoccupied with the pattern of the carpet which she traced continually
      with her riding crop, and finally I, too, had relapsed. She sat haggard,
      with the fight forever in her eyes, and the day seemed to sombre about her
      in her corner. When she turned in the door, I looked up with sudden
      prescience of a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t jump,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it was only to tell you that I have persuaded
      Robert to apply for furlough. Eighteen months. From the first of April.
      Don&rsquo;t touch me.&rsquo; I suppose I made a movement towards her. Certainly I
      wanted to throw my arms about her; with the instinct, I suppose, to steady
      her in her great resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the end of that time, as you know, he will be retired. I had some
      trouble, he is so keen on the regiment, but I think&mdash;I have
      succeeded. You might mention it to Anna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; sprang past my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t. It would be like taking an oath to tell her, and&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      take an oath to go. But I mean to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing to be said,&rsquo; I brought out, feeling indeed that there
      was not. &lsquo;But I congratulate you, Judy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, there is nothing to be said. And you congratulate me, no doubt!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood for a moment quivering in the isolation she made for herself;
      and I felt a primitive angry revolt against the delicate trafficking of
      souls that could end in such ravage and disaster. The price was too heavy;
      I would have denuded her, at the moment, of all that had led her into
      this, and turned her out a clod with fine shoulders like fifty other women
      in Peshawur. Then, perhaps, because I held myself silent and remote and
      she had no emotion of fear from me, she did not immediately go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will beat itself away, I suppose, like the rest of the unreasonable
      pain of the world,&rsquo; she said at last; and that, of course, brought me to
      her side. &lsquo;Things will go back to their proportions. This,&rsquo; she touched an
      open rose, &lsquo;will claim its beauty again. And life will become&mdash;perhaps&mdash;what
      it was before.&rsquo; Still I found nothing to say, I could only put my arm in
      hers and walk with her to the edge of the veranda where the syce was
      holding her horse. She stroked the animal&rsquo;s neck. &lsquo;Everything in me
      answered him,&rsquo; she informed me, with the grave intelligence of a patient
      who relates a symptom past. As she took the reins she turned to me again.
      &lsquo;His spirit came to mine like a homing bird,&rsquo; she said, and in her smile
      even the pale reflection of happiness was sweet and stirring. It left me
      hanging in imagination over the source and the stream, a little blessed in
      the mere understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much blessed for confidence, or any safe feeling that the source was
      bound. Rather I saw it leaping over every obstacle, flashing to its
      destiny. As I drove to the Club next day I decided that I would not tell
      Anna Chichele of Colonel Harbottle&rsquo;s projected furlough. If to Judy
      telling her would be like taking an oath that they would go, to me it
      would at least be like assuming sponsorship for their intention. That
      would be heavy indeed. From the first of April&mdash;we were then in
      March. Anna would hear it soon enough from the General, would see it soon
      enough, almost, in the &lsquo;Gazette&rsquo;, when it would have passed into
      irrecoverable fact. So I went by her with locked lips, kept out of the way
      of those eyes of the mother that asked and asked, and would have seen
      clear to any depth, any hiding-place of knowledge like that. As I pulled
      up at the Club I saw Colonel Harbottle talking concernedly to the wife of
      our Second-in-Command, and was reminded that I had not heard for some days
      how Major Watkins was going on. So I, too, approached Mrs. Watkins in her
      victoria to ask. Robert Harbottle kindly forestalled her reply. &lsquo;Hard
      luck, isn&rsquo;t it? Watkins has been ordered home at once. Just settled into
      their new house, too&mdash;last of the kit came up from Calcutta
      yesterday, didn&rsquo;t it, Mrs. Watkins? But it&rsquo;s sound to go&mdash;Peshawur is
      the worst hole in Asia to shake off dysentery in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We agreed upon this and discussed the sale-list of her new furniture that
      Mrs. Watkins would have to send round the station, and considered the
      chances of a trooper&mdash;to the Watkinses with two children and not a
      penny but his pay it did make it easier not to have to go by a liner&mdash;and
      Colonel Harbottle and I were halfway to the reading-room before the
      significance of Major Watkins&rsquo;s sick-leave flashed upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;will make a difference to your plans. You won&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be able to ask for that furlough Judy wants. Rather not. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s
      disappointed&mdash;she was tremendously set on going&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t
      matter tuppence to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I sought out Mrs. Harbottle, at the end of the room. She looked radiant;
      she sat on the edge of the table and swung a light-hearted heel. She was
      talking to people who in themselves were a witness to high spirits,
      Captain the Hon. Freddy Gisborne, Mrs. Flamboys.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of me her face clouded, fell suddenly into the old weary lines.
      It made me feel somehow a little sick; I went back to my cart and drove
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than a week I did not see her except when I met her riding with
      Somers Chichele along the peach-bordered road that leads to the
      Wazir-Bagh. The trees were all in blossom and made a picture that might
      well catch dreaming hearts into a beatitude that would correspond. The air
      was full of spring and the scent of violets, those wonderful Peshawur
      violets that grow in great clumps, tall and double. Gracious clouds came
      and trailed across the frontier barrier; blue as an idyll it rose about
      us; the city smiled in her gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had it all in her face, poor Judy, all the spring softness and more,
      the morning she came, intensely controlled, to announce her defeat. I was
      in the drawing-room doing the flowers; I put them down to look at her. The
      wonderful telegram from Simla arrived&mdash;that was the wonderful part&mdash;at
      the same time; I remembered how the red, white, and blue turban of the
      telegraph peon bobbed up behind her shoulder in the veranda. I signed and
      laid it on the table; I suppose it seemed hardly likely that anything
      could be important enough to interfere at the moment with my impression of
      what love, unbound and victorious, could do with a face I thought I knew.
      Love sat there careless of the issue, full of delight. Love proclaimed
      that between him and Judith Harbottle it was all over&mdash;she had met
      him, alas, in too narrow a place&mdash;and I marvelled at the paradox with
      which he softened every curve and underlined every vivid note of
      personality in token that it had just begun. He sat there in great
      serenity, and though I knew that somewhere behind lurked a vanquished
      woman, I saw her through such a radiance that I could not be sure of
      seeing her at all...
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to the very first of it; she seemed herself intensely
      interested in the facts; and there is no use in pretending that, while she
      talked, the moral consideration was at all present with me either; it
      wasn&rsquo;t. Her extremity was the thing that absorbed us; she even, in tender
      thoughtfulness, diagnosed it from its definite beautiful beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was there, in my heart, when I woke one morning, exquisite and
      strange, the assurance of a gift. How had it come there, while I slept? I
      assure you when I closed my eyes it did not exist for me... Yes, of
      course, I had seen him, but only somewhere at dinner... As the day went on
      it changed&mdash;it turned into a clear pool, into a flower. And I&mdash;think
      of my not understanding! I was pleased with it! For a long time, for days,
      I never dreamed that it could be anything but a little secret joy. Then,
      suddenly&mdash;oh, I had not been perceiving enough!&mdash;it was in all
      my veins, a tide, an efflorescence, a thing of my very life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then&mdash;it was a little late&mdash;I understood, and since&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I began by hating it&mdash;being furious, furious&mdash;and afraid, too.
      Sometimes it was like a low cloud, hovering and travelling always with me,
      sometimes like a beast of prey that went a little way off and sat looking
      at me....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have&mdash;done my best. But there is nothing to do, to kill, to
      abolish. How can I say, &ldquo;I will not let you in,&rdquo; when it is already there?
      How can I assume indifference when this thing is imposed upon every moment
      of my day? And it has grown so sweet&mdash;the longing&mdash;that&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it strange?&mdash;I could more willingly give him up than the desire of
      him. That seems as impossible to part with as life itself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat reflective for a moment, and I saw her eyes slowly fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t CRY, Judy,&rsquo; I faltered, wanting to horribly, myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled them dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not now. But I am giving myself, I suppose, to many tears.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God help you,&rsquo; I said. What else was there to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no such person,&rsquo; she replied, gaily. &lsquo;There is only a blessed
      devil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you go all the way&mdash;to the logical conclusion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hardly hesitated. &lsquo;To the logical conclusion. What poor words!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I ask&mdash;when?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to tell you that quite definitely, and I think I can. The
      English mail leaves tonight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have arranged to take it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have arranged nothing. Do you know&rsquo;&mdash;she smiled as if at the
      fresh colours of an idyll&mdash;&lsquo;we have not even come to the admission?
      There has been between us no word, no vision. Ah, we have gone in bonds,
      and dumb! Hours we have had, exquisite hours of the spirit, but never a
      moment of the heart, a moment confessed. It was mine to give&mdash;that
      moment, and he has waited&mdash;I know&mdash;wondering whether perhaps it
      would ever come. And today&mdash;we are going for a ride today, and I do
      not think we shall come back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Judy,&rsquo; I cried, catching at her sleeve, &lsquo;he is only a boy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There were times when I thought that conclusive. Now the misery of it has
      gone to sleep; don&rsquo;t waken it. It pleases me to believe that the years are
      a convention. I never had any dignity, you know, and I seem to have missed
      the moral deliverance. I only want&mdash;oh, you know what I want. Why
      don&rsquo;t you open your telegram?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been folding and fingering the brown envelope as if it had been a
      scrap of waste paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is probably from Mrs. Watkins about the victoria,&rsquo; I said, feeling its
      profound irrelevance. &lsquo;I wired an offer to her in Bombay. However&rsquo;&mdash;and
      I read the telegram, the little solving telegram from Army Headquarters. I
      turned my back on her to read it again, and then I replaced it very
      carefully and put it in my pocket. It was a moment to take hold of with
      both hands, crying on all one&rsquo;s gods for steadiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How white you look!&rsquo; said Mrs. Harbottle, with concern. &lsquo;Not bad news?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, excellent news. Judy, will you stay to lunch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me, hesitating. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it seem rather a compromise on your
      part? When you ought to be rousing the city&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to rouse the city,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have given you the chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; I said, grimly, &lsquo;but the only real favour you can do me is to
      stay to lunch.&rsquo; It was then just on one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if you will promise not to make any sort of
      effort. I shouldn&rsquo;t mind, but it would distress you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise absolutely,&rsquo; I said, and ironical joy rose up in me, and the
      telegram burned in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would talk of it, though I found it hard to let her go on, knowing and
      knowing and knowing as I did that for that day at least it could not be.
      There was very little about herself that she wanted to tell me; she was
      there confessed a woman whom joy had overcome; it was understood that we
      both accepted that situation. But in the details which she asked me to
      take charge of it was plain that she also kept a watchful eye upon fate&mdash;matters
      of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in the drawing-room. The little round clock in its Armritsar case
      marked half-past three. Judy put down her coffee cup and rose to go. As
      she glanced at the clock the light deepened in her eyes, and I, with her
      hand in mine, felt like an agent of the Destroyer&mdash;for it was
      half-past three&mdash;consumed myself with fear lest the blow had
      miscarried. Then as we stood, suddenly, the sound of hoofs at a gallop on
      the drive, and my husband threw himself off at the door and tore through
      the hall to his room; and in the certainty that overwhelmed me even Judy,
      for an instant, stood dim and remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Major Jim seems to be in a hurry,&rsquo; said Mrs. Harbottle, lightly. &lsquo;I have
      always liked your husband. I wonder whether he will say tomorrow that he
      always liked me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Judy, I don&rsquo;t think he will be occupied with you tomorrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, surely, just a little, if I go tonight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t go tonight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me helplessly. I felt as if I were insisting upon her
      abasement instead of her salvation. &lsquo;I wish&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going&mdash;you&rsquo;re not! You can&rsquo;t! Look!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled it out of my pocket and thrust it at her&mdash;the telegram. It
      came, against every regulation, from my good friend the Deputy
      Adjutant-General, in Simla, and it read, &lsquo;Row Khurram 12th probably
      ordered front three hours&rsquo; time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face changed&mdash;how my heart leaped to see it change!&mdash;and
      that took command there which will command trampling, even in the women of
      the camp, at news like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What luck that Bob couldn&rsquo;t take his furlough!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
      single-thoughted. &lsquo;But you have known this for hours&rsquo;&mdash;there was even
      something of the Colonel&rsquo;s wife, authority, incisiveness. &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you
      tell me? Ah&mdash;I see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood before her abashed, and that was ridiculous, while she measured me
      as if I presented in myself the woman I took her to be. &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like
      that,&rsquo; she said. I had to defend myself. &lsquo;Judy,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if you weren&rsquo;t
      in honour bound to Anna, how could I know that you would be in honour
      bound to the regiment? There was a train at three.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg to assure you that you have overcalculated,&rsquo; said Mrs. Harbottle.
      Her eyes were hard and proud. &lsquo;And I am not sure&rsquo;&mdash;a deep red swept
      over her face, a man&rsquo;s blush&mdash;&lsquo;in the light of this I am not sure
      that I am not in honour bound to Anna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We had reached the veranda, and at her signal her coachman drove quickly
      up. &lsquo;You have kept me here three hours when there was the whole of Bob&rsquo;s
      kit to see to,&rsquo; she said, as she flung herself in; &lsquo;you might have thought
      of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a more than usually tedious campaign, and Colonel Robert Harbottle
      was ambushed and shot in a place where one must believe pure boredom
      induced him to take his men. The incident was relieved, the newspapers
      said&mdash;and they are seldom so clever in finding relief for such
      incidents&mdash;by the dash and courage shown by Lieutenant Chichele, who,
      in one of those feats which it has lately been the fashion to criticize,
      carried the mortally wounded body of his Colonel out of range at
      conspicuous risk of depriving the Queen of another officer. I helped Judy
      with her silent packing; she had forgiven me long before that; and she
      settled almost at once into the flat in Chelsea which has since been
      credited with so delightful an atmosphere, went back straight into her own
      world. I have always kept her first letters about it, always shall. For
      months after, while the expedition still raged after snipers and
      rifle-thieves, I discussed with Lady Chichele the probable outcome of it
      all. I have sometimes felt ashamed of leaping as straight as I did with
      Anna to what we thought the inevitable. I based no calculation on all Mrs.
      Harbottle had gone back to, just as I had based no calculation on her ten
      years&rsquo; companionship in arms when I kept her from the three o&rsquo;clock train.
      This last was a retrospection in which Anna naturally could not join me;
      she never knew, poor dear, how fortunate as to its moment was the campaign
      she deplored, and nothing to this day can have disturbed her conviction
      that the bond she was at such magnificent pains to strengthen, held
      against the strain, as long, happily, as the supreme need existed. &lsquo;How
      right you were!&rsquo; she often said. &lsquo;She did, after all, love me best, dear,
      wonderful Judy!&rsquo; Her distress about poor Robert Harbottle was genuine
      enough, but one could not be surprised at a certain ambiguity; one tear
      for Robert, so to speak, and two for her boy. It could hardly be, for him,
      a marriage after his mother&rsquo;s heart. And she laid down with some emphasis
      that Somers was brilliantly entitled to all he was likely to get&mdash;which
      was natural, too...
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been from the beginning so much &lsquo;in it&rsquo; that Anna showed me, a year
      later, though I don&rsquo;t believe she liked doing it, the letter in part of
      which Mrs. Harbottle shall finally excuse herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somers will give you this,&rsquo; I read, &lsquo;and with it take back your son. You
      will not find, I know, anything grotesque in the charming enthusiasm with
      which he has offered his life to me; you understand too well, you are too
      kind. And if you wonder that I can so render up a dear thing which I might
      keep and would once have taken, think how sweet in the desert is the pool,
      and how barren was the prospect from Balclutha.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like her to abandon in pride a happiness that asked so much less
      humiliation; I don&rsquo;t know why, but it was like her. And of course, when
      one thought of it, she had consulted all sorts of high expediencies. But I
      sat silent with remembrance, quieting a pang in my heart, trying not to
      calculate how much it had cost Judy Harbottle to take her second chance.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
