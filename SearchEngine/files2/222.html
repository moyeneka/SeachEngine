<h1>CHILDREN'S CLASSICS IN DRAMATIC FORM</h1>
<br>
<h3>A READER FOR THE FOURTH GRADE</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>BY AUGUSTA STEVENSON</h3>
<h5>Formerly a Teacher in the Indianapolis Public Schools</h5>
<h5>1908</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>TO MISS N. CROPSEY</h4>
<h5>Assistant Superintendent<br>
Indianapolis Public Schools</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>This book is intended to accomplish three distinct purposes:
first, to arouse a greater interest in oral reading; second, to
develop an expressive voice&mdash;sadly lacking in the case of most
Americans; and third, to give freedom and grace in the bodily
attitudes and movements which are involved in reading and speaking.
The stories given are for the most part adaptations of favorite
tales from folklore,&mdash;Andersen, Grimm, Aesop, and the Arabian
Nights having been freely drawn upon.</p>
<p>Children are dramatic by nature. They <i>are</i> for the time
the kings, the fairies, and the heroes that they picture in their
imaginations. They <i>are</i> these characters with such abandon
and with such intense pleasure that the on-looker must believe that
nature intended that they should give play to this dramatic
instinct, not so much formally, with all the trappings of the
man-made stage, but spontaneously and naturally, as they talk and
read. If this expressive instinct can be utilized in the teaching
of reading, we shall be able both to add greatly to the child's
enjoyment and to improve the quality of his oral reading. In these
days when so many books are hastily read in school, there is a
tendency to sacrifice expression to the mechanics and
interpretation of reading. Those acquainted with school work know
too well the resulting monotonous, indistinct speech and the
self-conscious, listless attitude which characterize so much of the
reading of pupils in grades above the third. It is believed that
this little book will aid in overcoming these serious faults in
reading, which all teachers and parents deplore. The dramatic
appeal of the stories will cause the child to lose himself in the
character he is impersonating and read with a naturalness and
expressiveness unknown to him before, and this improvement will be
evident in all his oral reading, and even in his speech.</p>
<p>The use of the book permits the whole range of expression, from
merely reading the stories effectively, to "acting them out" with
as little, or as much, stage-setting or costuming as a parent or
teacher may desire. The stories are especially designed to be read
as a part of the regular reading work. Many different plans for
using the book will suggest themselves to the teacher. After a
preliminary reading of a story during the study period, the teacher
may assign different parts to various children, she herself reading
the stage directions and the other brief descriptions inclosed in
brackets. The italicized explanations in parentheses are not
intended to be read aloud; they will aid in giving the child the
cue as to the way the part should be rendered. After the story has
been read in this way, if thought advisable it can be played
informally and simply, with no attempt at costuming or theatric
effects. It will often add to the interest of the play to have some
of the children represent certain of the inanimate objects of the
scene, as the forest, the town gate, a door, etc. Occasionally, for
the "open day," or as a special exercise, a favorite play may be
given by the children with the simplest kind of costuming and
stage-setting. These can well be made in the school as a part of
the manual training and sewing work. In giving the play, it will
generally be better not to have pupils memorize the exact words of
the book, but to depend upon the impromptu rendering of their
parts. This method will contribute more largely to the training in
English.</p>
<p>The best results will usually be obtained by using these stories
in the fourth grade. In some schools, however, the stories in the
first part of the book may profitably be used in the third
grade.</p>
<p>The author has been led to believe from her own experience and
from her conversation with many other teachers that there is a
pronounced call for this kind of book. She therefore hopes that in
the preparation of this book she may have been of service to the
teachers and children who may be led to use it.</p>

bacon with eggs and sweet herbs.</p>
<p>GOODMAN. But we have no sweet herbs.</p>

nothing to lend, not even a rotten apple." Now I can lend

<p>TURKEY (<i>showing displeasure</i>). A new brood of ducks! Look
you all&mdash;a new brood of ducks!</p>
<p>GRAY GANDER (<i>also displeased</i>). As if there were not
enough of us here already!</p>
<p>WHITE GOOSE (<i>likewise displeased</i>). True enough,&mdash;I
can scarce find a corner for my afternoon nap!</p>
<p>RED ROOSTER. It seems to me, Madam Duck, that you should not
have brought us a new brood this summer.</p>
<p>MADAM DUCK. What is that you are saying?</p>
<p>TURKEY. It seems to all of us, madam, that there is no room here
for a new brood.</p>
<p>PLYMOUTH ROCK HEN. Friends, be just. Madam Duck has a perfect
right to bring her ducklings here. Besides, the children are quite
pretty.</p>
<p>MADAM DUCK. They are beautiful! You shall all see that for
yourselves. Come, children, into a row with you!</p>
<p>[<i>The Ducklings form themselves into a row. The Ugly Duckling

there belong to you?</p>

<p>MADAM DUCK. Oh yes! He is larger than the others and perhaps not
so pretty, but&mdash;</p>
<p>TURKEY (<i>interrupting</i>). Make no excuses for him, madam. We
can see for ourselves what he is.</p>
<p>GRAY GANDER. In all my life I never saw anything so ugly!</p>
<p>WHITE GOOSE. He is neither duck nor goose!</p>
<p>PLYMOUTH ROCK HEN. Nor duck nor chick!</p>
<p>TURKEY. I'd be 'shamed to have a turkey look like that!</p>
<p>RED ROOSTER. I'd allow no hen of mine to claim him!</p>
<p>MADAM DUCK. Come now, come now, friends. The poor child is not
pretty, but he is good, and he can swim even better than the
others.</p>
<p>TURKEY. That he can swim well is nothing to me!</p>
<p>RED ROOSTER. Nor to me! He should be driven out, I say!</p>
<p>MADAM DUCK. Let him alone; he is not doing any harm.</p>
<p>FIRST DUCKLING. But, mother, no one will look at us if he stays
with us!</p>

ago?</p>
<p>SECOND DUCKLING. He turned his toes out, but quack he would
not.</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> NEIGHBORS <i>sit with the</i> GRANDMOTHER <i>in the
spare room because it is Sunday.</i>]</p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOR. I did not see you at church to-day,
Grandmother.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. I could not go, but I sent little Karen.</p>
<p>SECOND NEIGHBOR (<i>mysteriously</i>). Oh, yes; we saw her!
Everybody saw her!</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER (<i>proudly</i>). People do look at her; she is so
pretty.</p>
<p>THIRD NEIGHBOR. People didn't look at her face to-day.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER (<i>alarmed</i>). What do you mean?</p>
<p>THIRD NEIGHBOR. Ask Karen when she returns. We're not the ones
to carry tales.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER (<i>looking out window</i>). Here she comes now!</p>
<p>FOURTH NEIGHBOR. Just ask her about the sermon and the
hymns!</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER (<i>proudly</i>). She will tell me almost every word
the pastor said. She is a smart girl&mdash;that Karen.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> KAREN.]</p>
<p>KAREN. Well, Grandmother, here I am! Good morning,
Neighbors.</p>
<p>NEIGHBORS (<i>coldly</i>). Good morning, Karen.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. Now tell me about the sermon, Karen. What was the
text?</p>
<p>KAREN (<i>with confusion; stammering</i>). The text? It
was&mdash;it was&mdash;Oh, I will tell you all about it by and by,
Grandmother. Our Neighbors want to talk with you now.</p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOR. Oh, no! We would rather hear you tell your
Grandmother about the sermon and the music.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. What hymns did they sing, Karen?</p>
<p>KAREN (<i>as before</i>). Hymns? They sang&mdash;let me
see&mdash;they sang&mdash;</p>
<p>[<i>She stops in confusion.</i>]</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. Why, Karen! Are you ill?</p>
<p>SECOND NEIGHBOR. No, Grandmother, Karen is not ill. She is
ashamed. She was not thinking of the beautiful music nor of the
sermon this morning. Is that not true, Karen?</p>
<p>KAREN (<i>ashamed</i>). Y-e-s&mdash;</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. What is this?</p>
<p>THIRD NEIGHBOR. Tell your Grandmother what you were thinking
about in church, Karen.</p>
<p>KAREN. I was thinking about&mdash;about&mdash;my new shoes.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. A great thing to think about in church&mdash;a pair
of plain black shoes!</p>
<p>FOURTH NEIGHBOR. She did not wear her black shoes; she wore
<i>red shoes!</i></p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER (<i>gasping</i>). Red shoes&mdash;to church?</p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOR (<i>nodding</i>). Every one was terribly
shocked!</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER (<i>still gasping</i>). Red shoes to church!</p>
<p>SECOND NEIGHBOR. Even the pastor looked at her shoes!</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER (<i>indignantly</i>). Red shoes to church!</p>
<p>THIRD NEIGHBOR. The choir looked! All fixed their eyes on
Karen's red shoes.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. It is the most shocking thing I ever heard! Do you
hear me, Karen?</p>
<p>KAREN (<i>hanging her head in shame</i>). Yes, Grandmother.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. You must never, never, so long as you live, wear
red shoes to church again. It is not at all proper. Do you hear me,
Karen?</p>
<p>KAREN (<i>as before</i>). Yes, Grandmother.</p>
<p>FOURTH NEIGHBOR. Do you think she should have her Sunday
dinner?</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. Not one bite! She shall stay in her room all day.
Do you hear me, Karen?</p>
<p>KAREN. Yes, Grandmother.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER. Thank you for telling me, Neighbors. To think of
it! Red shoes to church!</p>

<p>KAREN. See without looking?</p>
<p>OLD SOLDIER (<i>nodding</i>). I was not in the church, yet I saw
you clearly when you knelt at the altar and raised the golden cup
to your lips.</p>

<p>OLD SOLDIER (<i>nodding</i>). And more&mdash;I saw your
thoughts.</p>
<p>KAREN. You saw my thoughts?</p>

passed before your eyes in the cup. Am I not right?</p>
<p>KAREN (<i>showing fear</i>). Y-e-s&mdash;</p>
<p>OLD SOLDIER. And I saw by the light of my beard that you forgot
to sing the hymns; eh, Karen?</p>
<p>KAREN. Y-e-s&mdash;</p>
<p>OLD SOLDIER. And that you forgot to say your prayers; eh,
Karen?</p>
<p>KAREN. Y-e-s&mdash;</p>

<hr>
<p>[<i>The</i> MERCHANT <i>and his</i> WIFE <i>are at
supper.</i>]</p>
<p>WIFE. Our neighbors bought some fine olives to-day. It has been
a long time since we have had olives. I am quite hungry for
them.</p>
<p>MERCHANT. Now you speak of olives, you put me in mind of the jar
which Ali Cogia left with me.</p>
<p>WIFE (<i>pointing to a jar in another part of the room</i>).
There is the very jar waiting for him against his return.</p>
<p>MERCHANT. Certainly he must be dead, since he has not returned
in all this time. Give me a plate; I will open the jar, and if the
olives be good, we will eat them.</p>
<p>WIFE. Pray, husband, do not commit so base an action. You know
nothing is more sacred than what is left to one's care and
trust.</p>
<p>MERCHANT. But I am certain All Cogia will never return.</p>
<p>WIFE. And I have a strong feeling that he will. What will he
think of your honor if he finds the jar has been opened?</p>
<p>MERCHANT. Surely a jar of olives is not to be guarded so
carefully, year after year.</p>
<p>WIFE. That is Ali Cogia's affair, not ours. Besides, the olives
can't be good after all this time.</p>
<p>MERCHANT (<i>taking a plate</i>). I mean to have a taste of
them, at least.</p>
<p>WIFE (<i>indignantly</i>). You are betraying the trust your
friend placed in you! I will not remain to witness it.</p>
<p>[<i>She leaves the room. The Merchant crosses and takes cover
from jar.</i>]</p>
<p>MERCHANT (<i>looking in jar</i>). My wife was right&mdash;the
olives are covered with mould, but those at the bottom may still be
good.</p>
<p>[<i>He turns the jar up and shakes out the olives. Several gold
pieces fall out.</i>]</p>
<p>MERCHANT. What is this? Gold pieces! As I live! Gold! gold!</p>
<p>[<i>He shakes the jar again; a shower of gold pieces
fall.</i>]</p>
<p>MERCHANT (<i>dropping the jar in astonishment</i>). A thousand
pieces at least! The top of the jar only was laid with olives!</p>
<p>(<i>He puts the gold into his pockets.</i>)</p>
<p>To-night, when my wife is asleep, I will fill the jar entirely
with fresh olives, for these show they have been disturbed. And I
will make up the jar so that no one, except Ali Cogia himself, will
know they have been touched.</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> CALIPH, <i>accompanied by his</i> GRAND VIZIER,
<i>enters the narrow street upon which the court opens. They are in
disguise, appearing as merchants.</i>]</p>
<p>CALIPH. Perhaps we may hear some talk of this affair of Ali
Cogia and the merchant, as we go through the city to-night.</p>
<p>VIZIER. It is possible, O Commander of the true Believers! The
affair has made a great noise in Bagdad.</p>
<p>CALIPH. Ali Cogia carried the merchant before the Cauzee, I
believe.</p>
<p>VIZIER. Yes; he claimed that the merchant had taken from him one
thousand pieces of gold.</p>
<p>CALIPH. Proceed; I would know all.</p>
<p>VIZIER. Ali Cogia left with this merchant, so he says, a jar in
which he had placed this money. Upon his return, which was but
yesterday, he went to the merchant, and, having received the jar,
opened it. To his surprise he found that the gold, which he had
hidden below a layer of olives, was no longer there.</p>
<p>CALIPH. Ah, that is what Ali Cogia says. What says the
merchant?</p>
<p>VIZIER. The merchant made oath before the Cauzee that he did not
know there was money in the jar, and so of course could not have
taken it.</p>
<p>CALIPH. And the Cauzee dismissed the merchant, I believe.</p>
<p>VIZIER. Yes, Commander of the Faithful, the merchant was
acquitted.</p>
<p>CALIPH. This Ali Cogia presented a petition to me to-day, and I
promised to hear him to-morrow. Would that I could know the truth
of the matter that I may give a just sentence!</p>
<p>[<i>They arrive at the court where several</i> CHILDREN <i>are
playing in the moonlight. The Caliph stops to watch them.</i>]</p>
<p>FIRST CHILD. Let us play that the Cauzee is trying the
Merchant.</p>
<p>SECOND CHILD (<i>joyfully</i>). Yes, yes!</p>
<p>THIRD CHILD (<i>joyfully</i>). Yes, yes!</p>
<p>ALL CHILDREN (<i>clapping their hands</i>). Yes, yes!</p>
<p>CALIPH (<i>softly to Vizier</i>). Let us sit on this bench. I
would know what these children are playing.</p>
<p>[<i>They sit, but are not seen by children.</i>]</p>
<p>FIRST CHILD (<i>taking his seat with great dignity</i>). I
choose to be the Cauzee!</p>
<p>SECOND CHILD (<i>taking his place behind the Cauzee</i>). I
choose to be the Officer!</p>
<p>THIRD CHILD. I choose to be Ali Cogia!</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Who chooses to be the Merchant?</p>
<p>[<i>Long pause; all the Children hang back.</i>]</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Come, Zeyn, you be the Merchant.</p>
<p>ZEYN. Not I! The part does not please me.</p>
<p>OFFICER. Would you spoil everything, Zeyn?</p>
<p>ZEYN. Oh, well, then, I'll be the Merchant this time.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Officer, bring in the accused and his accuser.</p>
<p>[<i>The Officer presents the Merchant and Ali Cogia before the
Cauzee.</i>]</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Ali Cogia, what charge have you to make against this
Merchant?</p>
<p>ALI COGIA (<i>bowing</i>). Sir, when I journeyed from Bagdad
seven years ago, I left with this Merchant a jar. Now, into this
jar I had put, with some olives, a thousand pieces of gold. When I
opened the jar, I found that it had been entirely filled with
olives; the gold had disappeared. I beseech your honor that I may
not lose so great a sum of money!</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Merchant, what have you to say to this charge?</p>
<p>MERCHANT. I confess that I had the jar in my house, but Ali
Cogia found it exactly as he had left it. Did he ever tell me there
was gold in the jar? No. He now demands that I pay him one thousand
pieces of gold. I wonder that he does not ask me for diamonds and
pearls instead of gold. I will take my oath that what I say is the
truth.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Not so fast! Before you come to your oath, I should be
glad to see the jar of olives.</p>
<p>(<i>Turning to Ali Cogia.</i>)</p>
<p>Ali Cogia, have you brought the jar?</p>
<p>ALI COGIA. No; I did not think of that.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Then go and fetch it.</p>
<p>[<i>Ali Cogia goes.</i>]</p>
<p>CAUZEE (<i>to the Merchant</i>). You thought the jar contained
olives all this time?</p>
<p>MERCHANT. Ali Cogia told me it contained olives at the first. I
will take oath that what I say is the truth.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. We are not yet ready for your oath.</p>
<p>[ALI COGIA <i>enters. He pretends to set a jar before the
Cauzee.</i>]</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Ali Cogia, is this jar the same you left with the
Merchant?</p>
<p>ALI COGIA. Sir, it is the same.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Merchant, do you confess this jar to be the same?</p>
<p>MERCHANT. Sir, it is the same.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Officer, remove the cover.</p>
<p>(<i>The Officer pretends to remove the cover.</i>)</p>
<p>These are fine olives! Let me taste them.</p>
<p>(<i>Pretending to eat an olive.</i>)</p>
<p>They are excellent! But I cannot think that olives will keep
seven years and be so good. Therefore, Officer, bring in Olive
Merchants, and let me hear what is their opinion.</p>
<p>OFFICER (<i>announcing</i>). Forward, two Olive Merchants!</p>
<p>[<i>Two</i> BOYS <i>present themselves</i>].</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Are you Olive Merchants?</p>
<p>BOYS (<i>bowing</i>). Sir, we are.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Tell me how long olives will keep.</p>
<p>FIRST OLIVE MERCHANT. Let us take what care we can, they will
hardly be worth anything the third year.</p>
<p>SECOND OLIVE MERCHANT. It is true, for then they will have
neither taste nor color.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. If it be so, look into that jar and tell me how long it
is since those olives were put into it.</p>
<p>[<i>Both Merchants pretend to examine and taste the
olives.</i>]</p>
<p>FIRST OLIVE MERCHANT. These olives are new and good.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. You are mistaken. Ali Cogia says he put them into the
jar seven years ago.</p>
<p>SECOND OLIVE MERCHANT. Sir, they are of this year's growth.
There is not a merchant in Bagdad that will not say the same.</p>
<p>CAUZEE. Merchant, you stand accused. You must return the
thousand pieces of gold to Ali Cogia.</p>
<p>MERCHANT. Sir, I protest&mdash;</p>
<p>CAUZEE (<i>interrupting</i>). Be silent! You are a rogue. Take
him to prison, Officer.</p>
<p>[<i>All the children seize the Merchant and run from the court,
laughing and shouting.</i>]</p>
<p>CALIPH (<i>rising</i>). I know now what will be a just trial. I
have learned it from the child Cauzee. Do you think I could give a
better sentence?</p>
<p>VIZIER. I think not, if the case be as these children played
it.</p>
<p>CALIPH. Take care to bid Ali Cogia bring his jar of olives
to-morrow. And let two olive merchants attend.</p>
<p>VIZIER. It shall be done, O Commander of true Believers!</p>
<p>CALIPH. If the olives be indeed fresh, then the merchant will
receive his punishment and Ali Cogia his thousand pieces of
gold.</p>
<p>(<i>Starting off; stopping.</i>)</p>
<p>Take notice of this street, and to-morrow present the boy Cauzee

<p>[<i>The</i> GOODY <i>is seen walking along the shore.</i> ELIZA
<i>enters from the forest.</i>]</p>
<p>GOODY. Bless me! What is the little girl doing in this lonely
place? And alone, too!</p>
<p>ELIZA. I seek my eleven brothers.</p>
<p>GOODY. Ah! Then you must be the Princess Eliza!</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>sadly</i>). Yes, Goody.</p>
<p>GOODY. And the eleven brothers you seek are the eleven little
princes!</p>
<p>ELIZA. Yes; do you know them?</p>
<p>GOODY. I saw them in school one day. Each prince wore a golden
crown on his head, a star on his breast, and a sword by his
side.</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>nodding</i>). They studied very hard, just as princes
should.</p>
<p>GOODY. They wrote on gold slates with diamond pencils. I myself
saw them!</p>
<p>ELIZA. I sat on a little stool of plate-glass. Did you know
that?</p>
<p>GOODY. Oh, yes! And I know about your picture-book worth half a
kingdom.</p>
<p>ELIZA. We were all so happy then! Our dear mother was alive and
sometimes went to school with us. Now all is changed.</p>
<p>GOODY. What has happened?</p>
<p>ELIZA. They have driven us from the palace.</p>
<p>GOODY (<i>indignantly</i>). I said so! On the day of that
wedding I said so.</p>
<p>ELIZA. Then you know that my father married again?</p>
<p>GOODY. Yes, I know. I wept when I heard our good king had
married that wicked queen.</p>
<p>ELIZA. She drove my brothers away, the very day of the wedding
feast.</p>
<p>GOODY. And now she has driven you away!</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>nodding</i>). If only I could find my dear
brothers!</p>
<p>GOODY. You may hear something about them very soon.</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>quickly</i>). Do you know where they are? Tell me! I
pray you tell me!</p>
<p>GOODY (<i>shaking her head mysteriously</i>). I cannot say where
they are. I only know what they are.</p>
<p>ELIZA. I do not understand&mdash;</p>
<p>GOODY. The wicked queen has turned your brothers into wild
swans.</p>
<p>ELIZA. Wild swans?</p>
<p>GOODY (<i>nodding</i>). I saw them yesterday, at sunrise, flying
out over the sea. Each swan wore a gold crown on his head.</p>
<p>ELIZA. The queen could not take their crowns from them!</p>
<p>GOODY. As the swans flew upward, their eleven crowns glittered
like eleven suns. My eyes were dazzled. I was obliged to look away.
At that moment the swans disappeared.</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>sadly to herself</i>). My poor brothers! I shall never
see them again.</p>
<p>GOODY (<i>suddenly</i>). Do you see those great blue bluffs to
the south?</p>
<p>ELIZA. Yes; the sea is dashing against them.</p>
<p>GOODY. In those bluffs, back from the shore, is a cave. Go at
once to that cave and enter.</p>
<p>ELIZA. And what shall I do there, good woman?</p>
<p>GOODY. Perhaps you may learn how to break the spell over your
brothers.</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>surprised</i>). How to break the spell?</p>
<p>GOODY. Ask no questions, but go at once to the cave.</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>going</i>). Thank you, good woman. You are very kind
to me.</p>
<p>GOODY. Go now, child, and fear nothing.</p>
<p>[<i>Eliza goes; the Goody disappears.</i>]</p>

<p>(<i>Listening.</i>)</p>
<p>Not a sound do I hear! But wild animals are cunning. They know

<p>Well, be it so. I will enter, for I must save my brothers.</p>
<p>[<i>She enters the cave.</i> FAIRY <i>is within the cave, but

<p>FAIRY. You have courage, little Eliza.</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>showing relief</i>). Oh! Are you here, good woman?</p>
<p>FAIRY. Behold!</p>
<p>[<i>The cave is filled with light; a beautiful Fairy is
seen.</i>]</p>
<p>ELIZA. Ah! I thought it was the Goody.</p>
<p>FAIRY. No matter, dear child. I knew you were to come here.</p>
<p>ELIZA. I was afraid to enter.</p>
<p>FAIRY. But you did enter. Your love for your brothers was
greater than your fear.</p>
<p>ELIZA. It was that which gave me courage.</p>
<p>FAIRY. It was a test of your courage. And now I can tell you how
to break the spell over your brothers.</p>
<p>ELIZA. I will do whatever you say.</p>
<p>FAIRY. You will suffer greatly.</p>
<p>ELIZA. What matter, if I save my brothers!</p>
<p>FAIRY (<i>nodding</i>). Then listen. Do you see the stinging
nettles which I hold in my hand?</p>
<p>ELIZA. Yes, dear Fairy.</p>
<p>FAIRY. You must gather great quantities of these.</p>
<p>ELIZA. I noticed many of the same sort growing near this
cave.</p>
<p>FAIRY (<i>shaking head</i>). You must gather only those that
grow in graveyards.</p>
<p>ELIZA. It shall be exactly as you say, dear Fairy.</p>
<p>FAIRY. The nettles will make blisters on your hands.</p>
<p>ELIZA. I will not think of myself; I will think only of my
brothers.</p>
<p>FAIRY. Break the nettles into pieces with your hands and feet,
and they will become flax. From this flax you must spin and weave
eleven coats with long sleeves. If these eleven coats can be thrown
over the eleven swans, the spell will be broken.</p>
<p>ELIZA. It shall be done.</p>
<p>FAIRY. But remember, that from the moment you begin your task,
until it is finished, you must not speak. Even though it should
occupy years of your life, you must not speak.</p>
<p>ELIZA. I shall remember.</p>
<p>FAIRY. The first word you utter will pierce through the hearts
of your brothers like a dagger. Their lives hang upon your tongue.
Go now and begin your task.</p>
<p>ELIZA (<i>going</i>). I go, dear Fairy.</p>
<p>FAIRY. Remember all I have told you, dear child. Farewell!</p>

disappears.</i>]</p>

<p>WICKED UNCLE. Welcome, your Majesty! Welcome home from your
hunt! But who is this maiden?</p>
<p>KING. I know not, my Uncle.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. What?</p>
<p>KING. My huntsmen found her in a cave in a far-off country.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. In a cave? Alone?</p>
<p>KING (<i>nodding</i>). Alone; spinning coats out of flax.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. This is very strange.</p>
<p>(<i>To Eliza.</i>)</p>
<p>Why were you all alone in a cave, and why were you spinning
coats?</p>
<p>(<i>Eliza shakes her head.</i>)</p>
<p>KING. She is dumb, Uncle. Not a word has she uttered since we
found her.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. Why did you bring her with you?</p>
<p>KING. I will make her my queen.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>angrily</i>). Your queen?</p>
<p>KING. See how beautiful she is.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>whispering to King</i>). She is a witch!</p>
<p>KING. Nonsense! She is as good as she is beautiful.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>whispering as before</i>). She has bewitched
your heart!</p>
<p>KING. Nonsense, I say! She did not want to leave the cave. She
wept bitterly when I put her on my horse.</p>
<p>(<i>He turns to the servants.</i>)</p>
<p>Let the music sound! Prepare the wedding feast!</p>
<p>(<i>He turns to Eliza, who weeps.</i>)</p>
<p>Do not weep, my beautiful maid.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>whispering to King</i>). She is not beautiful.
She has bewitched your eyes.</p>
<p>KING. I will not listen to you! Go, bid them ring the church
bells.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>going; speaking aside</i>). I must poison his
heart against her in some way; else I'll never wear the crown.</p>
<p>[<i>Wicked Uncle goes.</i>]</p>
<p>KING (<i>to Eliza</i>). Do not weep. You shall be dressed in
silks and velvets and I will place a golden crown upon your
head.</p>

<p>Well, then, I know how to make you smile.</p>
<p>[<i>The King opens a door into an inner room. Eliza looks in,
smiles, and claps her hands for joy.</i>]</p>
<p>KING. I thought 't would make you happy! 'T is very like your
cave&mdash;I had it made so.</p>
<p>(<i>Eliza tries to thank King with her eyes.</i>)</p>
<p>But no more spinning! Your fingers shall be covered with
diamonds instead of blisters.</p>

<p>Your queen is never to do any of the work about the castle. Do
you hear me, Guardsmen?</p>
<p>GUARDSMEN (<i>bowing</i>). We hear, O King!</p>
<p>KING. Not even the spinning or weaving. Do you hear me,
Guardsmen?</p>
<p>GUARDSMEN (<i>bowing</i>). We hear, O King!</p>

sir?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. Do not call me 'sir.'</p>
<p>GOODY. What shall I say, sir?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. Say, 'Your Highness.'</p>
<p>GOODY. But you are not the King, sir.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. I'm very near it, old woman.</p>
<p>GOODY. Not so near, sir, as you were, sir. There is the new
queen, sir.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. The new queen is about to die.</p>
<p>GOODY (<i>alarmed</i>). About to die?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>nodding</i>). Aye, because she's a witch.
They're bringing her out here now.</p>
<p>GOODY. The King permits it?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>nodding</i>). He soon found out the truth about
her.</p>
<p>GOODY. And what was that?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. Just what I told him the first time I saw her.
"She's a witch," said I, but he would not believe me.</p>
<p>GOODY. What has so changed him?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. 'T was I who saw her slip forth from the castle
one midnight. I followed her; straight to the graveyard she
went.</p>
<p>GOODY. To the graveyard?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>nodding</i>). In she went&mdash;I following. I
saw her gather the stinging nettles that grow there.</p>
<p>GOODY. But they would blister her hands. Did she not cry
out?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. Not a sound did she utter! That would prove her a
witch, were there nothing more.</p>
<p>GOODY. Ah, there is something more, then?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>nodding; mysteriously</i>). I followed her back
to the castle; through the marble halls and up to the little cave
room. I saw her break up the nettles. Then I saw her spin and weave
this flax into a magic coat.</p>
<p>GOODY. Bless me! A magic coat?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>nodding</i>). There were ten of them hanging
from the ceiling.</p>
<p>GOODY. Of course you told the King?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. Just as soon as I could waken him, but he would
not believe me. He said there was but one coat when they brought
her here, and that there could be but one now.</p>
<p>GOODY. She worked at night, then, while the castle slept.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. True queens do not work&mdash;nay, can't be made
to work. Every one knows that.</p>
<p>GOODY. But how did the King find out the truth?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. I persuaded him to watch with me the next night.
Just at midnight the queen came out. We followed her to the
graveyard. "That is enough," said his Majesty, "she is a witch and
must die."</p>
<p>[<i>The</i> CITIZENS <i>rush to the gates.</i>]</p>
<p>CITIZENS (<i>calling</i>). See the witch!</p>
<p>GOODY. Is she coming?</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE (<i>looking</i>). Yes, she is just within the gate.
She rides in an old cart drawn by an old horse&mdash;quite good
enough for a witch.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter the</i> KING <i>with servants and</i> GUARDS.
<i>Behind them is the cart. In the cart sits</i> ELIZA. <i>She is
spinning and weaving, never once looking up.</i>]</p>
<p>GOODY. How pale she is! Bless me! She is spinning and
weaving.</p>
<p>WICKED UNCLE. It is the eleventh coat and it will be the
last.</p>

before.</i>]</p>

Wake up! Wake up!</p>
<p>[<i>Each yawns; stretches; throws off his blanket;
arises.</i>]</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>remembering</i>). Ah, the gourds!</p>
<p>[<i>Each looks at his ankle, then at the other's ankle.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. How's this!</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Did we not tie gourds around our ankles?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN (<i>nodding</i>). Why, surely we did.</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>looking about</i>). Did we not have two
baskets of gourds with us?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN (<i>nodding</i>). Surely; there in the
corner.</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>holding up foot to which flag is tied</i>).
Is this a gourd or is it not a gourd?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Of a surety it is a flag.</p>
<p>(<i>Holding up his foot with flag.</i>)</p>
<p>And if this be not a gourd, keep thy silence.</p>
<p>[<i>The First Countryman stares at the flag, placing his finger
on his closed lips.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Then it hath indeed happened!</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. What hath happened?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. The dreadful thing foretold by the citizens.
I am not I! Thou art not thou!</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>trembling with fear</i>). How can that
be?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. I know not. I only know that it is.</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>weeping</i>). I cannot think I am not
myself!</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN (<i>weeping</i>). Thou needst must think it,
whether thou wouldst or no.</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Dost thou indeed think thou art some other
person?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. If I were myself, would not the gourd still
be around my ankle?</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Then who art thou? And who am I?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Alas! I know not.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter the</i> WAGS.]</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>joyfully</i>). Here come those who will
know whether we are ourselves!</p>

before them. They pass on.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Stop, good sirs!</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. A word with thee!</p>
<p>[<i>The Wags stop.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Dost thou not know us?</p>
<p>FIRST WAG. I have not that pleasure.</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Thou didst talk with us but yester-eve!</p>
<p>SECOND WAG. Some mistake, I fear, my good man.</p>
<p>[<i>The Wags start off.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN (<i>weeping</i>). Wait! I pray thee, wait!</p>
<p>(<i>The Wags stop.</i>)</p>
<p>Canst thou not tell us who we are?</p>
<p>FIRST WAG. Do you not know yourselves?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Alas! we are not ourselves.</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Thou wouldst know us were we as we were
once.</p>
<p>SECOND WAG. Perhaps those flags will solve the riddle.</p>
<p>FIRST WAG. True enough; let us look at them.</p>
<p>[<i>The Countrymen remove flags and hand them to Wags, who look
at them intently.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND WAG (<i>mysteriously</i>). Can it be?</p>
<p>FIRST WAG. It is! It is!</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Eh?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Eh?</p>
<p>SECOND WAG (<i>to Countrymen</i>). Your pardon! I do crave your
pardon!</p>
<p>FIRST WAG (<i>taking a ring from his finger; turning to Second
Countryman</i>). Please to accept this ring. I shall then know I am
forgiven for not recognizing you at first.</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN (<i>accepting ring; putting it on the first
finger of his right hand</i>). Why, yes, I forgive thee.</p>
<p>SECOND WAG (<i>to First Countryman, taking off his gold
chain</i>). Please to accept this chain. By that I shall know I too
am forgiven.</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>accepting chain; putting it on</i>). Thou
art forgiven. Now tell me what great person I have become.</p>
<p>SECOND WAG (<i>gravely</i>). Jest with us no more!</p>
<p>FIRST WAG. We go now to announce your arrival to the Lord
Mayor.</p>
<p>SECOND WAG. Presently, we will return. Await us here.</p>
<p>[<i>They go, laughing aside.</i>]</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Dost thou know, I have always felt that I was
really a great person. Hast thou not always noticed something
unusual about me?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. I cannot say that I have. There is, however,
certainly something wonderful about me. I have noticed it for a
long time. Hast thou not felt it when in my company?</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. I have not.</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN (<i>indignantly</i>). Thou hast not?</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Never! thou silly goose!</p>
<p>[<i>The Second Countryman snatches First Countryman's chain and
throws it over the wall.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Mind how thou callest me names, thou
booby!</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>tearing off Second Countryman's ring and
throwing it over the wall</i>). Silly goose!</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. I will now depart for my home. I do not
desire thy company.</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. I likewise will return, and likewise I wish to
journey alone.</p>
<p>[<i>They take up their blankets and discover the
gourds.</i>]</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Eh?</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Eh?</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Let us tie them around our ankles. We may then
discover whether we are ourselves.</p>
<p>[<i>They tie the gourds around their ankles.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN (<i>joyfully</i>). I am myself!</p>
<p>FIRST COUNTRYMAN (<i>joyfully</i>). And I am myself!</p>
<p>SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Come, let us journey back together.</p>
<p>[<i>They go out. Pause. Enter the</i> WAGS. <i>They remain at
entrance, not knowing Countrymen have gone.</i>]</p>
<p>FIRST WAG (<i>whispering</i>). Do you think the musicians should
follow them?</p>
<p>SECOND WAG (<i>whispering</i>). No, they should follow the
music. What a joke it is!</p>
<p>[<i>They look around and discover that the Countrymen have
gone.</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> MAN <i>enters the garden carrying his big stick and
small net. The garden has been almost destroyed by the</i>
ALLIGATOR, <i>who still wallows among the beds.</i>]</p>
<p>MAN. There should be enough apples on the ground to fill my net.
'T was a fierce storm last night!</p>
<p>(<i>He looks about; sees the Alligator; shows
indignation.</i>)</p>
<p>Thou&mdash;within my garden!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>meekly</i>). Be not angry with me, O master! By
accident I&mdash;</p>
<p>MAN (<i>indignantly</i>). Accident! Thou hast wallowed among my
flowers by accident, hast thou?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. It is true; not of my own will came I hither.</p>
<p>MAN (<i>more indignantly</i>). Thou hast broken my fruit trees
by accident, I suppose!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>nodding</i>). It was not of my own intentions, I
assure you. I&mdash;</p>
<p>MAN (<i>interrupting</i>). Thou art this moment crushing my
strawberry plants beneath thy great body! I've a mind to beat thee
with my big stick!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Do not beat me, O master! The cyclone is at
fault.</p>
<p>MAN (<i>surprised</i>). The cyclone?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>nodding</i>). Aye, it blew me here from the river
last night.</p>
<p>MAN. Ha, ha! A likely story!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. I speak the truth. A great waterspout lifted me out
of the river. Then a fierce wind caught me and blew me about as if
I were a feather. Finally, I was dropped here within thy
garden.</p>
<p>MAN (<i>only half convinced</i>). Well, there's no cyclone to
blow thee back. Wilt thou be good enough to walk thyself out?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Alas! I can scarcely move me. I fear some of my ribs
are broken.</p>
<p>MAN. Nonsense! Out with thee!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. But see how the wind has crippled me! It has even
blown some of my claws loose&mdash;</p>
<p>MAN (<i>interrupting</i>). I am sorry for thee, but thou canst
not remain here.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. I will go now, if thou wilt help me.</p>
<p>MAN (<i>surprised</i>). <i>I</i> help thee?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>nodding</i>). I will be so grateful to thee!</p>
<p>MAN. Oh, I know how grateful thou canst be! The other animals
have told me that!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. What say they?</p>
<p>MAN. That thou art the most cruel of all the animals&mdash;that
thou never dost any one a favor&mdash;</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>interrupting</i>). Nonsense! No one could be more
grateful for favors than I! I'll prove it to thee!</p>
<p>MAN. Prove it? How?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. If thou wilt help me to the river, I'll show thee
where to find the biggest fish.</p>
<p>MAN. Well&mdash;that's something&mdash;</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. And when thou wouldst cross the river, I'll carry
thee.</p>
<p>MAN. Of a surety, that's good of thee! Perhaps, after all, thou
art not so black as thou art painted. I'll help thee this time.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Thanks to thee, master. I will never forget thy
kindness; I will always be thy friend.</p>
<p>MAN. Why, I am glad to help thee. Now how am I to get thee to
the river?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Carry me, please, O master!</p>
<p>MAN. What! carry thee?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>nodding</i>). I'll get into thy net.</p>
<p>MAN. Thou get into my small net!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Only hold thy net open!</p>
<p>MAN (<i>holding his net open</i>). I tell thee, thou canst never
get in!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. See how I fold my arms! My legs go under&mdash;so!
Now I roll myself up and up and up! And now I am in&mdash;all
in!</p>
<p>MAN. Well, seeing is believing!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Please to tie up thy net, master, that I may not fall
out.</p>
<p>MAN (<i>tying net</i>). 'T is done!</p>
<p>(<i>Throwing net over shoulder.</i>)</p>
<p>Thou art heavy!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. I know, it will be hard work for thee, but some day
thou wilt see how grateful I am.</p>

<p>ALLIGATOR. No matter&mdash;I mean to eat thee.</p>
<p>MAN. Is that the way to repay a favor&mdash;by doing a
wrong?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>nodding</i>). That's the way of all the
animals.</p>
<p>MAN. Thou art surely mistaken&mdash;not all the
animals&mdash;</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>interrupting</i>). There's not one of them
remembers a favor or a friend when hungry.</p>

<p>ALLIGATOR. I don't intend waiting for thee to find out.</p>
<p>MAN. I pray thee wait till the next animal comes to drink!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>impatiently</i>). Have I not told thee of my
hunger?</p>
<p>MAN. Listen! Some animal comes through the forest now.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter the</i> LEOPARD. <i>He comes down to drink.</i>]</p>
<p>Leopard, I would question thee.</p>

<p>RABBIT. Why dost thou ask?</p>
<p>MAN. I found the Alligator in my garden this morning. He had
destroyed my plants, my fruits, and&mdash;</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>interrupting</i>). I was blown in by the cyclone
last night.</p>
<p>MAN. He said he had been hurt and begged me to help him to the
river. He promised me his friendship if I would do so.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Ha, ha, ha! I told him I'd show him where to find the
biggest fish.</p>
<p>RABBIT. And now thou wilt not?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. But I will. He'll find it after he is <i>inside</i>
of me. Ha, ha!</p>
<p>RABBIT. Ha, ha! A good joke!</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. I told him I'd carry him across the river. I didn't
explain he'd go <i>inside</i>. Ha, ha!</p>
<p>RABBIT. What a joker thou art, Ally dear!</p>
<p>(<i>He turns to the Man.</i>)</p>
<p>But how didst thou get him here?</p>
<p>MAN. I carried him in this small net.</p>
<p>RABBIT (<i>looking surprised</i>). Thou art trying to fool
me!</p>
<p>MAN. No, Brother Rabbit, it is quite true.</p>

as get thy head into that net.</p>

wouldst.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. And we will! Get thy net ready, Man.</p>
<p>MAN. But how? Thou art holding my leg.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>freeing the Man; turning to the Rabbit</i>). We'll
show thee just how it was done, young man.</p>
<p>RABBIT. Seeing is believing.</p>

arms&mdash;so! Now I roll myself up and up and up. And now I am
in&mdash;all in!</p>
<p>RABBIT. As I live&mdash;thou art! Well, seeing is believing. But
how couldst thou remain within the net? It is quite open.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Tie it up, Man. Show him exactly how we did it.</p>
<p>MAN (<i>tying net</i>). I tied it tight&mdash;like this, Brother
Rabbit.</p>
<p>RABBIT. Is it quite tight?</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Let him try the knot, Man.</p>
<p>RABBIT (<i>trying knot</i>). Most truly, it is tight.</p>
<p>(<i>Turning to the Alligator.</i>)</p>
<p>Thou dost look as if thou couldst not move, Ally dear.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Of a surety&mdash;I cannot.</p>
<p>RABBIT. Well, Brother Man, now that thou hast him, don't be
foolish enough to let him go. Get thy big stick and beat him to
death.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR (<i>surprised</i>). Eh?</p>
<p>MAN (<i>not heeding the Alligator</i>). That is just what I will
do, that I will! Thanks to thee for helping me, Brother Rabbit.</p>
<p>ALLIGATOR. Have pity!</p>
<p>RABBIT (<i>not heeding the Alligator</i>). No thanks are
necessary, Brother Man. I haven't forgotten the good turnips thou
didst give me last winter when the ground was covered with snow.
Some of us know how to return favor for favor.</p>

beautiful they are! How like sentinels they stand at our door
guarding us!</p>
<p>FLAT-FOOT (<i>growling</i>). What nonsense! You'd better be
spinning.</p>
<p>ISABEL (<i>not heeding</i>). Mother, see you that old oak! See
how proudly it lifts its head up into the sky! 'T is the king of
the forest!</p>
<p>HANGING-LIP (<i>growling</i>). I never heard such foolish
talk!</p>
<p>ISABEL (<i>not heeding</i>). Mother, a song has come to
me,&mdash;'t is a song to the beautiful trees. Let me stop to write
it down, while my heart is full of it.</p>
<p>BROAD-THUMB (<i>to the Dame</i>). Do not permit it, sister! She
should be working. She can scarcely spin at all.</p>
<p>DAME (<i>showing much feeling</i>). Isabel! Isabel! Not a maid
in the village thinks of anything but spinning.</p>
<p>ISABEL. Mother, let me stop! Soon the song will leave me. I may
ne'er hear it again.</p>
<p>FLAT-FOOT (<i>to the Dame</i>). Sister, she will bring you to
shame.</p>
<p>HANGING-LIP. Already the village folk laugh at her!</p>

you different from other folk.</p>

spinning.</p>

in all the world did love to spin, I'd say the same&mdash;I like it
not!</p>

door, that none without may hear such words.</p>

<p>DAME. Because&mdash;because&mdash;I will not let her spin.</p>
<p>QUEEN (<i>showing surprise</i>). Because you will not let her
spin?</p>
<p>DAME (<i>nodding</i>). Yes, your Majesty.</p>
<p>QUEEN. Why, this is most strange.</p>
<p>DAME (<i>nodding</i>). Would I but let her, she'd spin from morn
till night, and from then on till morn again.</p>
<p>QUEEN. I see how it can be so. There's nothing I like better
than spinning.</p>
<p>DAME. She weeps whenever I make her leave off.</p>
<p>QUEEN. 'T is because she loves it! I am never more pleased than
when the wheels are whirring.</p>
<p>DAME. But stop she must, for to-day at least. There is no more
flax.</p>

a trouble to you.</p>
<p>QUEEN. Why, no! In fact, I am so pleased with your daughter's
industry I will have my son marry her.</p>
<p>DAME (<i>so frightened she can scarcely breathe</i>). O your
Majesty&mdash;</p>
<p>QUEEN (<i>interrupting</i>). But first she must spin all my
flax. There are three rooms full of it&mdash;from top to
bottom.</p>
<p>ISABEL (<i>showing alarm</i>). Three rooms full!</p>
<p>QUEEN (<i>nodding</i>). Aye, my dear, and when you have spun it
all, you shall become a princess!</p>
<p>(<i>Turning to the Dame.</i>)</p>
<p>Bring your daughter to my castle to-morrow.</p>
<p>DAME (<i>bowing</i>). Yes, your Majesty.</p>
<p>QUEEN (<i>going</i>). To-morrow, mind you.</p>
<p>DAME (<i>bowing</i>). Yes, your Majesty.</p>
<p>[<i>All bow to the Queen, who goes.</i>]</p>
<p>ISABEL. Mother, how could you tell the Queen I love to spin?</p>
<p>DAME. Think you I'd let the truth be known? I'd not shame myself
so!</p>
<p>ISABEL. I could not spin three rooms of flax in three hundred
years.</p>
<p>DAME. Alas! alas! What shall we do?</p>
<p>FLAT-FOOT (<i>to Hanging-lip and Broad-thumb</i>). Sisters, let
us speak together.</p>
<p>[<i>The three Great-Aunts whisper together for a
moment.</i>]</p>
<p>HANGING-LIP. Isabel, we will help you&mdash;</p>
<p>FLAT-FOOT (<i>interrupting</i>). On one condition!</p>
<p>BROAD-THUMB (<i>nodding</i>). Aye,&mdash;on a certain
condition!</p>
<p>ISABEL. What do you mean?</p>
<p>HANGING-LIP. We'll spin the flax for you&mdash;</p>
<p>FLAT-FOOT (<i>interrupting</i>). On one condition.</p>
<p>BROAD-THUMB (<i>nodding</i>). Aye,&mdash;on a certain
condition!</p>
<p>DAME. You speak in riddles, sisters.</p>
<p>HANGING-LIP. 'T is this&mdash;if Isabel will invite us to her
wedding, we'll spin the flax.</p>
<p>FLAT-FOOT. That's the condition.</p>
<p>BROAD-THUMB (<i>nodding</i>). Aye,&mdash;that's the certain
condition.</p>
<p>ISABEL. 'T will be deceiving the Queen and the Prince, both.</p>
<p>DAME. There's no other way to mend things. Go now! Since you are
so soon to be a princess, I'll give you leave to write down your
song.</p>
<p>ISABEL (<i>sadly</i>). The song is no longer in my heart.</p>
<p>DAME. 'T is well. Now listen&mdash;you must never let the Prince
know about your songs. He'd send you from the castle.</p>
<p>BROAD-THUMB (<i>nodding</i>). Besides, 't would bring great
shame upon us, for we are a family of spinners.</p>
<p>FLAT-FOOT (<i>nodding</i>). Aye, aye!</p>
<p>HANGING-LIP (<i>nodding</i>). Aye, aye!</p>

Prince, but a week ago these rooms were filled with flax. Now look

nothing to me.</p>

<p>HANGING-LIP. You'd never be sorry to take me for your bride, my
lord.</p>

me better than the flat-foot and the hanging-lip and the

gaze upon flowers and trees and running brooks, for these things

<p>GENERAL. You have come to see the Emperor?</p>
<p>THE LADIES. General, we have.</p>
<p>GENERAL. His Majesty wishes you to leave your sons here in camp
until evening.</p>
<p>MAYOR'S WIFE. General, could you not tell us the Emperor's
plans?</p>
<p>GENERAL. Yes, madam. The Emperor must march southward where the
enemy is in camp. He wishes a guide who can lead him safely through
this great forest.</p>
<p>RICH MERCHANT'S WIFE. We were told the Emperor would greatly
honor the lad he chooses.</p>
<p>GENERAL. 'T is true, madam. The lad chosen will be made an
aide.</p>
<p>MAYOR'S WIFE. I thought only princes were chosen for the
Emperor's aides.</p>
<p>GENERAL. They have always been princes. This is a great
opportunity for the lads of this village.</p>

will prove his fitness to be guide.</p>

families, madam.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter the</i> EMPEROR, GENERAL, <i>and</i> CAPTAIN; <i>they

<p>POOR WOODCUTTER'S WIFE (<i>sighing</i>). I suppose that is true,
but Pierre is a smart boy. If the Emperor could only see
him&mdash;</p>
<p>RICH MERCHANT'S WIFE (<i>interrupting</i>). The Emperor wants a
boy with proud manners such as our boys have.</p>

<p>EMPEROR. Fiddlesticks and candles, I say!</p>

how it was. Come, Pierre.</p>

Ladies, you shall know whom I have chosen when the test is
finished. I bid you good-day.</p>

<p>EMPEROR (<i>turning to the boys</i>). My lads, go through the
forest southward, till you come to the river. You may then return.
Captain, see that guards go with them. My lads, you must not speak
the one to the other until I have again seen you. I must have your
word on that. Do you promise?</p>

clear space I went to one side, hiding behind trees, to look ahead.
Then I ran across.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. That must have tired you, Ludwig. You're not quite well
yet.</p>

the banks and wade them.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. You rested by the way, didn't you?</p>

<p>EMPEROR. I shall not want you; you may go.</p>

Just like a prince, sire!</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Fiddlesticks! Captain, the last boy there.</p>
<p>[<i>The Captain brings up</i> PIERRE].</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Well, my lad, what did you see in the forest?</p>
<p>PIERRE. I saw that a man had passed southward just before us,
sire.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. How did you know that? Did you see him?</p>
<p>PIERRE. No, sire, I saw his footprints. He was lame in the left
leg.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. How did you learn that?</p>
<p>PIERRE. The footprints were deeper on the right side. His dog
was lame also.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. He had a dog?</p>
<p>PIERRE. Yes, sire; a lame dog I'm sure, because one of his
tracks was always faint or missing.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Did you trace this man and dog by their footprints?</p>
<p>PIERRE. Yes, sire, to the river. There were traces of them in
the grass, in the mud, in the dust, on rocks, and in still water. I
am certain they had passed but a short time before&mdash;not more
than a half hour.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. How could you tell that?</p>
<p>PIERRE. The grass had not yet straightened up. The tracks in the
mud had not yet filled with water. The prints in the dust were
still clear although a wind was blowing.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Good! But how did you know they had but just passed
through still water and over rocks?</p>
<p>PIERRE. The water had not yet settled, and the rocks were still
damp.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Good! Very good!</p>
<p>PIERRE. Sire, I fear this man is one of the enemy!</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Indeed! What proof have you of that?</p>
<p>PIERRE. This, sire.</p>
<p>(<i>Handing a small piece of cloth to Emperor.</i>)</p>
<p>'T is the color of the enemy's uniform.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. It is, my lad. How came you by it?</p>
<p>PIERRE. I found it on a thorn-bush. It was torn from his cloak,
sire.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. And why from his cloak?</p>
<p>PIERRE. The thorn-bush was at least three feet from the man's
line of travel. The wind blew the cloak about.</p>
<p>EMPEROR (<i>handing the cloth to an aide; whispering to
him</i>). Take this to Ludwig.</p>
<p>(<i>The Aide goes.</i>)</p>
<p>Well, Pierre, do you think we should be in fear of this
enemy?</p>
<p>PIERRE. I do not know, sire. I only know that he has a good
disposition.</p>
<p>EMPEROR (<i>surprised</i>). A good disposition? How do you know
that?</p>
<p>PIERRE. The dog was always near him. When the man stopped to
rest, the dog lay down at his feet.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. But he may have held the dog there, my lad.</p>
<p>PIERRE. Not while he was picking berries, sire.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. So our enemy picked berries, did he?</p>
<p>PIERRE. Yes, sire, the dog lying by the bushes all the
while.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Do you think we could capture this man?</p>
<p>PIERRE. Yes, sire, for he was very tired.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. How do you know that?</p>
<p>PIERRE. He climbed down the banks of every small stream. I
should have leaped them.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. You think it would be an easy matter, then, to follow
and capture him?</p>
<p>PIERRE. Not easy, sire, for he was always on the lookout.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. How do you know that?</p>
<p>PIERRE. Whenever he reached a clear space, he went to one side,
hiding behind trees to look ahead. Then he ran across the open.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Your proof of this, my lad?</p>
<p>PIERRE. His footprints in every clear space showed only the
balls of the feet.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. Good! You followed him only to the river.</p>
<p>PIERRE. Those were the orders, sire. Had I gone on, I could have
overtaken him by evening.</p>
<p>EMPEROR. That you could not, my lad, for the man is now here, in
camp. He returned by boat. Ladies, the test is over.</p>
<p>(<i>He turns to Pierre's mother.</i>)</p>
<p>Madam, your son shall be my guide. I am proud to have a boy of
such keen sight and quick thought in my kingdom. And 't is much to
be the mother of such a lad. I salute you, madam! With greatest
respect I salute you!</p>
<p>[<i>He bows to the happy woman with great courtesy.</i>]</p>
<p>EMPEROR (<i>turning to the ladies</i>). Ladies, I bid you
farewell.</p>

<p>ROQUE (<i>stopping; listening</i>). There's stirring in the
King's courtyard!</p>
<p>[<i>He runs to closed gates; peeps through a crack.</i>]</p>
<p>CARLOS. Come, Roque, we shall be late to school.</p>
<p>ROQUE (<i>throwing down books</i>). Come, look! They are laying
the red carpets in the court!</p>
<p>PANCHO (<i>throwing down books; peeping</i>). 'T is for the King
they lay them!</p>
<p>CARLOS. Come, the master will be angry.</p>
<p>ROQUE. But the King will soon be coming!</p>
<p>PANCHO. Let's wait and see him, Carlos!</p>
<p>CARLOS. Not I! I know how the master flogs! Yesterday I came
late to school.</p>
<p>PANCHO. Why were you late?</p>
<p>CARLOS. I stopped to watch the crazy Italian, Columbus.</p>
<p>[<i>He starts off; the others follow.</i>]</p>
<p>ROQUE. I saw him once!</p>
<p>PANCHO. I wish I might see him!</p>
<p>CARLOS. There he comes now! (<i>Calling.) Loco!</i>[Footnote:

<p>ROQUE. Aye, there he is! (<i>Calling.) Loco! Loco!</i></p>

<p>ALL BOYS. <i>Loco! Loco! Loco! Loco!</i></p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> SCHOOLMASTER, <i>carrying a switch.</i>]</p>
<p>MASTER (<i>flourishing switch</i>). To school with you! To
school now!</p>
<p>[<i>Boys run off in alarm.</i>]</p>
<p>MASTER (<i>turning angrily upon Columbus</i>). You were teaching
them your foolish notions, sir!</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>smiling</i>). I'd like the chance to do so,
master.</p>
<p>MASTER. Ah, then you <i>have</i> been at it! I saw them all
about you!</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. I taught them nothing, master,&mdash;this time.</p>
<p>MASTER. 'T is well for you, sir, that you did not. The world is
flat, sir, flat! Do you not know that, sir?</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. I was so taught&mdash;</p>
<p>MASTER. How do you dare, then, to say the world is round?</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. Much study and common sense, dear master, have made me
dare.</p>
<p>MASTER. The lessons taught your fathers are good enough for you,
sir.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. That cannot be, dear master. How, then, could the
world move on?</p>
<p>MASTER. Move on? Hear him talk! Do you think, sir, that an
elephant carries this flat world on his back and walks about with
it? Ha, ha!</p>
<p>[<i>Gates are opened;</i> PORTER <i>is seen.</i>]</p>
<p>MASTER (<i>going</i>). Go tell the King this world is round! Ha,
ha! Go tell the King!</p>
<p>[<i>Schoolmaster goes.</i>]</p>
<p>PORTER (<i>seeing Columbus; aside</i>). Ah, 't is the crazy
Italian!</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. Porter, I seek the King!</p>
<p>PORTER. Do you think he'll listen to your silly talk? O, I've
heard of you! Away!</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. Come, let me in!</p>
<p>PORTER. Away! Away with you, <i>loco</i>!</p>
<p>[<i>Enter from gates, the</i> JESTER <i>in cap and bells,</i>
HOSTLERS <i>and</i> SERVANTS.]</p>
<p>JESTER. Who's away? Who's crazy?</p>
<p>PORTER. The Italian there! He who says this world is round!</p>
<p>JESTER. Round? How now? Round, say you?</p>
<p>PORTER (<i>nodding; laughing</i>). With people on the other
side!</p>
<p>JESTER. A-standing on their heads&mdash;so!</p>
<p>[<i>Jester stands on his head; all laugh. Enter a</i>
COURTIER.]</p>
<p>COURTIER. The King comes!</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> KING JOHN <i>and many</i> COURTIERS.]</p>
<p>JESTER (<i>capering about Columbus</i>). Ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>KING. What's this, Jester?</p>
<p>JESTER. Here's he, sire, who says this world is round!</p>
<p>[<i>He capers about Columbus; all laugh.</i>]</p>
<p>KING. I've heard of your notions, Columbus. So you think there's
land to be discovered, do you?</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. Yes, your Majesty, I'm sure of it.</p>
<p>JESTER. With people a-standing on their heads&mdash;so!</p>
<p>[<i>He stands on his head; all laugh.</i>]</p>
<p>KING. Silence! Columbus, I've a mind to listen, and give you
ships and money. Have you maps and charts to prove your plans?</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>taking maps from cloak</i>). Yes, sire.</p>
<p>KING. Wait, then, till I have spoken with my Courtiers.</p>
<p>[<i>Columbus bows, retires, and unrolls maps.</i> CAPTAIN
RIVERRA <i>crosses to Columbus; talks with him aside.</i>]</p>
<p>KING (<i>speaking softly to Courtiers</i>). You know, my
Courtiers, that should there be new lands, great glory will be
given the discoverer of them.</p>
<p>FIRST COURTIER. Aye, sire, 't will bring him great honor.</p>
<p>SECOND COURTIER. And riches.</p>
<p>KING. 'T is I, and I alone, who should have the honor and the
riches!</p>
<p>FIRST COURTIER. Aye, sire!</p>
<p>SECOND COURTIER. Aye, sire!</p>
<p>THIRD COURTIER. But nothing can be done without the Italian's
maps and charts. No one but he knows the route over the unknown
seas.</p>
<p>KING. Well, we must have his maps and charts.</p>
<p>FIRST COURTIER. He'll not sell them, sire. You may depend on
that.</p>
<p>KING. And we'll not buy them. Go, bid my fool take them.</p>
<p>(<i>Courtiers showing surprise.</i>)</p>
<p>Go, I say, and see to it!</p>
<p>[<i>Courtiers talk aside with Jester.</i>]</p>
<p>RIVERRA (<i>to Columbus</i>). I wish you well, sir, for I
believe that what you say is true.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. I'm glad to hear you say that, Captain.</p>
<p>RIVERRA. My ship is in the harbor now, and I must go. But I wish
you well, Columbus, I wish you well.</p>
<p>[<i>Columbus, throwing his maps on the stone bench near gates,
takes Riverra's hands in his. The Jester creeps up, takes maps,
runs into the court with them, and disappears.</i>]</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>with feeling</i>). I thank you, Captain&mdash;so
few believe in me&mdash;</p>
<p>KING. Come now within, Columbus; I'll look at your maps and
charts.</p>
<p>[<i>Riverra goes.</i>]</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>turning to take up maps</i>). Why, how is this! My
maps were here but just a moment ago!</p>
<p>KING. Who saw his maps?</p>
<p>(<i>Pause.</i>)</p>
<p>The Courtiers are silent, sir.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. I laid them there, sire!</p>
<p>KING. Then there they should be.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. Some one has taken them&mdash;'t is a joke&mdash;</p>
<p>KING (<i>interrupting</i>). My Courtiers do not play jokes in my
presence.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. Those maps and charts are precious to me, sire!</p>
<p>KING. Come, now, I'm not so sure you ever had maps or
charts.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. Your Majesty!</p>
<p>KING. Well, produce them.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. But, sire,&mdash;</p>
<p>KING (<i>interrupting</i>). I'll not hear excuses! Your maps,
sir,&mdash;at once, sir!</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. I'll make other maps and charts&mdash;</p>
<p>KING. Away with you!</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. Your Majesty&mdash;</p>
<p>KING. Away, I say! And come to us no more with tales of unknown
lands.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> JESTER <i>from gates.</i>]</p>
<p>JESTER. With people a-walking on their heads&mdash;so!</p>

bitter disappointment.</i>]</p>

<p>KING. Speak, good Father.</p>
<p>MONK. I pray your Majesties to see one Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p>KING (<i>inquiringly</i>). Columbus?</p>
<p>MONK. The Italian who thinks he can find a short route to the
Indies, sire.</p>
<p>KING (<i>nodding</i>). Ah, I remember. You brought his plans to
us some time ago, good Father.</p>
<p>QUEEN (<i>nodding</i>). Let us see him to-day, sire.</p>
<p>KING (<i>to First Courtier</i>). Admit this Christopher
Columbus.</p>
<p>(<i>Courtier admits</i> COLUMBUS. <i>He kneels before the
King.</i>)</p>
<p>Rise, Columbus, and tell us what you seek.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>rising</i>). Ships, sire, to prove the plans which
I did send your Majesties; plans for sailing in the unknown
seas.</p>
<p>QUEEN. They seemed to me most wise and sensible.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>with joy</i>). Ah, your Majesty believes with
me?</p>
<p>KING (<i>hastily</i>). I'd have our Wise Men speak. Unfold your
maps before them, sir.</p>
<p>[<i>Columbus crosses to Wise Men and unfolds a map before them.
They look at it, shake their heads and laugh.</i>]</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>with dignity</i>). I propose to sail by this route
to find that eastern land.</p>
<p>FIRST WISE MAN. Ha, ha! I never heard anything so absurd! He'd
sail west to find the east! Ha, ha!</p>
<p>SECOND WISE MAN (<i>pointing to map</i>). The edge of the world
is out there in those strange waters! And you are willing to fall
off with your ships into space, sir?</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. I'm sure the water continues&mdash;</p>
<p>THIRD WISE MAN (<i>interrupting</i>). How could there be land
beyond? 'T would be under us, and the trees would have to grow
their roots in the air.</p>
<p>[<i>Wise Men nod wisely.</i>]</p>
<p>SECOND WISE MAN. And the rain must needs fall upward there!</p>
<p>ALL WISE MEN (<i>nodding wisely</i>). Aye! Aye!</p>
<p>QUEEN. I've heard you did lay your plans before King John of
Portugal?</p>
<p>COLUMBUS. I did, your Majesty.</p>
<p>KING. That was bad for you, Columbus. King John sent ships, but
they soon returned.</p>
<p>(<i>Turning to</i> CAPTAIN RIVERRA.)</p>
<p>Was not that the way of it, Captain? You sailed with them, I
believe?</p>
<p>RIVERRA. Yes, sire. But the failure came because the sailors
were afraid and refused to go on.</p>
<p>(<i>To Columbus.</i>)</p>
<p>You were thus avenged for the theft of your maps, sir.</p>
<p>QUEEN. Would you sail again with this man as your leader,
Captain?</p>
<p>RIVERRA. I would, your Majesty! I believe not in the monsters
and the edge.</p>
<p>QUEEN. Nor I! Let's provide the ships, sire.</p>
<p>KING. Our people would not like it&mdash;they'd grumble. And so
't would be bad for us.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> MESSENGER <i>in great haste; kneels before King
and Queen.</i>]</p>
<p>KING. What news do you bring? Speak!</p>
<p>MESSENGER. The Turks have captured the Spanish merchant
ships!</p>
<p>KING. Our ships bound for the Indies?</p>
<p>MESSENGER. Yes, your Majesty.</p>
<p>KING. Alas! Alas!</p>
<p>QUEEN. The merchants and the sailors&mdash;did the Turks spare
them?</p>
<p>MESSENGER. Not one, your Majesty!</p>
<p>QUEEN. Alas, such loss of life! And 't is not the first time!
Not a month that does not bring us the same sad news!</p>
<p>FIRST WISE MAN (<i>to Monk</i>). You must give our people
consolation, Father.</p>
<p>MONK. 'T is not so much consolation they need, as another
passage to the Indies; one far away from Turkey and the cruel
Turks.</p>
<p>QUEEN. You are right, Father. Speak on.</p>
<p>MONK. To find such a passage is the chief purpose of Christopher
Columbus. That is the hope that has given him courage when half the
world called him <i>fool</i>.</p>
<p>QUEEN. Sire, we must find ships and money!</p>
<p>KING. We dare not tax the people more&mdash;</p>
<p>QUEEN. Then I'll help you, Columbus! I'll pledge my own jewels
to raise the funds.</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>joyfully</i>). Your Majesty!</p>
<p>QUEEN. 'T is for the safety of our merchants! 'T is for the
glory of Spain!</p>
<p>COLUMBUS (<i>kneeling before Queen; kissing her robe</i>). My
Queen!</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
