<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Long-Beard paused in his
narrative, licked his greasy fingers, and wiped them on his naked
sides where his one piece of ragged bearskin failed to cover
him.&nbsp; Crouched around him, on their hams, were three young
men, his grandsons, Deer-Runner, Yellow-Head, and
Afraid-of-the-Dark.&nbsp; In appearance they were much the
same.&nbsp; Skins of wild animals partly covered them.&nbsp; They
were lean and meagre of build, narrow-hipped and crooked-legged,
and at the same time deep-chested, with heavy arms and enormous
hands.&nbsp; There was much hair on their chests and shoulders,
and on the outsides of their arms and legs.&nbsp; Their heads
were matted with uncut hair, long locks of which often strayed
before their eyes, beady and black and glittering like the eyes
of birds.&nbsp; They were narrow between the eyes and broad
between the cheeks, while their lower jaws were projecting and
massive.</p>
<p>It was a night of clear starlight, and below them, stretching
away remotely, lay range on range of forest-covered hills.&nbsp;
In the distance the heavens were red from the glow of a
volcano.&nbsp; At their backs yawned the black mouth of a cave,
out of which, from time to time, blew draughty gusts of
wind.&nbsp; Immediately in front of them blazed a fire.&nbsp; At
one side, partly devoured, lay the carcass of a bear, with about
it, at a respectable distance, several large dogs, shaggy and
wolf-like.&nbsp; Beside each man lay his bow and arrows and a
huge club.&nbsp; In the cave-mouth a number of rude spears leaned
against the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was how we moved from the cave to the
tree,&rdquo; old Long-Beard spoke up.</p>
<p>They laughed boisterously, like big children, at recollection
of a previous story his words called up.&nbsp; Long-Beard
laughed, too, the five-inch bodkin of bone, thrust midway through
the cartilage of his nose, leaping and dancing and adding to his
ferocious appearance.&nbsp; He did not exactly say the words
recorded, but he made animal-like sounds with his mouth that
meant the same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is the first I remember of the Sea
Valley,&rdquo; Long-Beard went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were a very
foolish crowd.&nbsp; We did not know the secret of
strength.&nbsp; For, behold, each family lived by itself, and
took care of itself.&nbsp; There were thirty families, but we got
no strength from one another.&nbsp; We were in fear of each other
all the time.&nbsp; No one ever paid visits.&nbsp; In the top of
our tree we built a grass house, and on the platform outside was
a pile of rocks, which were for the heads of any that might
chance to try to visit us.&nbsp; Also, we had our spears and
arrows.&nbsp; We never walked under the trees of the other
families, either.&nbsp; My brother did, once, under old
Boo-oogh&rsquo;s tree, and he got his head broken and that was
the end of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Boo-oogh was very strong.&nbsp; It was said he
could pull a grown man&rsquo;s head right off.&nbsp; I never
heard of him doing it, because no man would give him a
chance.&nbsp; Father wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; One day, when father
was down on the beach, Boo-oogh took after mother.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t run fast, for the day before she had got her leg
clawed by a bear when she was up on the mountain gathering
berries.&nbsp; So Boo-oogh caught her and carried her up into his
tree.&nbsp; Father never got her back.&nbsp; He was afraid.&nbsp;
Old Boo-oogh made faces at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But father did not mind.&nbsp; Strong-Arm was another
strong man.&nbsp; He was one of the best fishermen.&nbsp; But one
day, climbing after sea-gull eggs, he had a fall from the
cliff.&nbsp; He was never strong after that.&nbsp; He coughed a
great deal, and his shoulders drew near to each other.&nbsp; So
father took Strong-Arm&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; When he came around
and coughed under our tree, father laughed at him and threw rocks
at him.&nbsp; It was our way in those days.&nbsp; We did not know
how to add strength together and become strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would a brother take a brother&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;
Deer-Runner demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if he had gone to live in another tree by
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we do not do such things now,&rdquo;
Afraid-of-the-Dark objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because I have taught your fathers
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; Long-Beard thrust his hairy paw into the
bear meat and drew out a handful of suet, which he sucked with a
meditative air.&nbsp; Again he wiped his hands on his naked sides
and went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I am telling you happened in the
long ago, before we knew any better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been fools not to know better,&rdquo; was
Deer-Runner&rsquo;s comment, Yellow-Head grunting approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we were, but we became bigger fools, as you shall
see.&nbsp; Still, we did learn better, and this was the way of
it.&nbsp; We Fish-Eaters had not learned to add our strength
until our strength was the strength of all of us.&nbsp; But the
Meat-Eaters, who lived across the divide in the Big Valley, stood
together, hunted together, fished together, and fought
together.&nbsp; One day they came into our valley.&nbsp; Each
family of us got into its own cave and tree.&nbsp; There were
only ten Meat-Eaters, but they fought together, and we fought,
each family by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-Beard counted long and perplexedly on his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were sixty men of us,&rdquo; was what he managed
to say with fingers and lips combined.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we were
very strong, only we did not know it.&nbsp; So we watched the ten
men attack Boo-oogh&rsquo;s tree.&nbsp; He made a good fight, but
he had no chance.&nbsp; We looked on.&nbsp; When some of the
Meat-Eaters tried to climb the tree, Boo-oogh had to show himself
in order to drop stones on their heads, whereupon the other
Meat-Eaters, who were waiting for that very thing, shot him full
of arrows.&nbsp; And that was the end of Boo-oogh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next, the Meat-Eaters got One-Eye and his family in his
cave.&nbsp; They built a fire in the mouth and smoked him out,
like we smoked out the bear there to-day.&nbsp; Then they went
after Six-Fingers, up his tree, and, while they were killing him
and his grown son, the rest of us ran away.&nbsp; They caught
some of our women, and killed two old men who could not run fast
and several children.&nbsp; The women they carried away with them
to the Big Valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that the rest of us crept back, and, somehow,
perhaps because we were in fear and felt the need for one
another, we talked the thing over.&nbsp; It was our first
council&mdash;our first real council.&nbsp; And in that council
we formed our first tribe.&nbsp; For we had learned the
lesson.&nbsp; Of the ten Meat-Eaters, each man had had the
strength of ten, for the ten had fought as one man.&nbsp; They
had added their strength together.&nbsp; But of the thirty
families and the sixty men of us, we had had the strength of but
one man, for each had fought alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great talk we had, and it was hard talk, for
we did not have the words then as now with which to talk.&nbsp;
The Bug made some of the words long afterward, and so did others
of us make words from time to time.&nbsp; But in the end we
agreed to add our strength together and to be as one man when the
Meat-Eaters came over the divide to steal our women.&nbsp; And
that was the tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We set two men on the divide, one for the day and one
for the night, to watch if the Meat-Eaters came.&nbsp; These were
the eyes of the tribe.&nbsp; Then, also, day and night, there
were to be ten men awake with their clubs and spears and arrows
in their hands, ready to fight.&nbsp; Before, when a man went
after fish, or clams, or gull-eggs, he carried his weapons with
him, and half the time he was getting food and half the time
watching for fear some other man would get him.&nbsp; Now that
was all changed.&nbsp; The men went out without their weapons and
spent all their time getting food.&nbsp; Likewise, when the women
went into the mountains after roots and berries, five of the ten
men went with them to guard them.&nbsp; While all the time, day
and night, the eyes of the tribe watched from the top of the
divide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But troubles came.&nbsp; As usual, it was about the
women.&nbsp; Men without wives wanted other men&rsquo;s wives,
and there was much fighting between men, and now and again one
got his head smashed or a spear through his body.&nbsp; While one
of the watchers was on top of the divide, another man stole his
wife, and he came down to fight.&nbsp; Then the other watcher was
in fear that some one would take his wife, and he came down
likewise.&nbsp; Also, there was trouble among the ten men who
carried always their weapons, and they fought five against five,
till some ran away down the coast and the others ran after
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was that the tribe was left without eyes or
guards.&nbsp; We had not the strength of sixty.&nbsp; We had no
strength at all.&nbsp; So we held a council and made our first
laws.&nbsp; I was but a cub at the time, but I remember.&nbsp; We
said that, in order to be strong, we must not fight one another,
and we made a law that when a man killed another him would the
tribe kill.&nbsp; We made another law that whoso stole another
man&rsquo;s wife him would the tribe kill.&nbsp; We said that
whatever man had too great strength, and by that strength hurt
his brothers in the tribe, him would we kill that his strength
might hurt no more.&nbsp; For, if we let his strength hurt, the
brothers would become afraid and the tribe would fall apart, and
we would be as weak as when the Meat-Eaters first came upon us
and killed Boo-oogh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knuckle-Bone was a strong man, a very strong man, and
he knew not law.&nbsp; He knew only his own strength, and in the
fullness thereof he went forth and took the wife of
Three-Clams.&nbsp; Three-Clams tried to fight, but Knuckle-Bone
clubbed out his brains.&nbsp; Yet had Knuckle-Bone forgotten that
all the men of us had added our strength to keep the law among
us, and him we killed, at the foot of his tree, and hung his body
on a branch as a warning that the law was stronger than any
man.&nbsp; For we were the law, all of us, and no man was greater
than the law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there were other troubles, for know, O
Deer-Runner, and Yellow-Head, and Afraid-of-the-Dark, that it is
not easy to make a tribe.&nbsp; There were many things, little
things, that it was a great trouble to call all the men together
to have a council about.&nbsp; We were having councils morning,
noon, and night, and in the middle of the night.&nbsp; We could
find little time to go out and get food, because of the councils,
for there was always some little thing to be settled, such as
naming two new watchers to take the place of the old ones on the
hill, or naming how much food should fall to the share of the men
who kept their weapons always in their hands and got no food for
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stood in need of a chief man to do these things, who
would be the voice of the council, and who would account to the
council for the things he did.&nbsp; So we named Fith-Fith the
chief man.&nbsp; He was a strong man, too, and very cunning, and
when he was angry he made noises just like that,
<i>fith-fith</i>, like a wild-cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ten men who guarded the tribe were set to work
making a wall of stones across the narrow part of the
valley.&nbsp; The women and large children helped, as did other
men, until the wall was strong.&nbsp; After that, all the
families came down out of their caves and trees and built grass
houses behind the shelter of the wall.&nbsp; These houses were
large and much better than the caves and trees, and everybody had
a better time of it because the men had added their strength
together and become a tribe.&nbsp; Because of the wall and the
guards and the watchers, there was more time to hunt and fish and
pick roots and berries; there was more food, and better food, and
no one went hungry.&nbsp; And Three-Legs, so named because his
legs had been smashed when a boy and who walked with a
stick&mdash;Three-Legs got the seed of the wild corn and planted
it in the ground in the valley near his house.&nbsp; Also, he
tried planting fat roots and other things he found in the
mountain valleys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the safety in the Sea Valley, which was
because of the wall and the watchers and the guards, and because
there was food in plenty for all without having to fight for it,
many families came in from the coast valleys on both sides and
from the high back mountains where they had lived more like wild
animals than men.&nbsp; And it was not long before the Sea Valley
filled up, and in it were countless families.&nbsp; But, before
this happened, the land, which had been free to all and belonged
to all, was divided up.&nbsp; Three-Legs began it when he planted
corn.&nbsp; But most of us did not care about the land.&nbsp; We
thought the marking of the boundaries with fences of stone was a
foolishness.&nbsp; We had plenty to eat, and what more did we
want?&nbsp; I remember that my father and I built stone fences
for Three-Legs and were given corn in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So only a few got all the land, and Three-Legs got most
of it.&nbsp; Also, others that had taken land gave it to the few
that held on, being paid in return with corn and fat roots, and
bear-skins, and fishes which the farmers got from the fishermen
in exchange for corn.&nbsp; And, the first thing we knew, all the
land was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about this time that Fith-Fith died and
Dog-Tooth, his son, was made chief.&nbsp; He demanded to be made
chief anyway, because his father had been chief before him.&nbsp;
Also, he looked upon himself as a greater chief than his
father.&nbsp; He was a good chief at first, and worked hard, so
that the council had less and less to do.&nbsp; Then arose a new
voice in the Sea Valley.&nbsp; It was Twisted-Lip.&nbsp; We had
never thought much of him, until he began to talk with the
spirits of the dead.&nbsp; Later we called him Big-Fat, because
he ate over-much, and did no work, and grew round and
large.&nbsp; One day Big-Fat told us that the secrets of the dead
were his, and that he was the voice of God.&nbsp; He became great
friends with Dog-Tooth, who commanded that we should build
Big-Fat a grass house.&nbsp; And Big-Fat put taboos all around
this house and kept God inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More and more Dog-Tooth became greater than the
council, and when the council grumbled and said it would name a
new chief, Big-Fat spoke with the voice of God and said no.&nbsp;
Also, Three-Legs and the others who held the land stood behind
Dog-Tooth.&nbsp; Moreover, the strongest man in the council was
Sea-Lion, and him the land-owners gave land to secretly, along
with many bearskins and baskets of corn.&nbsp; So Sea-Lion said
that Big-Fat&rsquo;s voice was truly the voice of God and must be
obeyed.&nbsp; And soon afterward Sea-Lion was named the voice of
Dog-Tooth and did most of his talking for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was Little-Belly, a little man, so thin in
the middle that he looked as if he had never had enough to
eat.&nbsp; Inside the mouth of the river, after the sand-bar had
combed the strength of the breakers, he built a big
fish-trap.&nbsp; No man had ever seen or dreamed a fish-trap
before.&nbsp; He worked weeks on it, with his son and his wife,
while the rest of us laughed at their labours.&nbsp; But, when it
was done, the first day he caught more fish in it than could the
whole tribe in a week, whereat there was great rejoicing.&nbsp;
There was only one other place in the river for a fish-trap, but,
when my father and I and a dozen other men started to make a very
large trap, the guards came from the big grass-house we had built
for Dog-Tooth.&nbsp; And the guards poked us with their spears
and told us begone, because Little-Belly was going to build a
trap there himself on the word of Sea-Lion, who was the voice of
Dog-Tooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was much grumbling, and my father called a
council.&nbsp; But, when he rose to speak, him the Sea-Lion
thrust through the throat with a spear and he died.&nbsp; And
Dog-Tooth and Little-Belly, and Three-Legs and all that held land
said it was good.&nbsp; And Big-Fat said it was the will of
God.&nbsp; And after that all men were afraid to stand up in the
council, and there was no more council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another man, Pig-Jaw, began to keep goats.&nbsp; He had
heard about it as among the Meat-Eaters, and it was not long
before he had many flocks.&nbsp; Other men, who had no land and
no fish-traps, and who else would have gone hungry, were glad to
work for Pig-Jaw, caring for his goats, guarding them from wild
dogs and tigers, and driving them to the feeding pastures in the
mountains.&nbsp; In return, Pig-Jaw gave them goat-meat to eat
and goat-skins to wear, and sometimes they traded the goat-meat
for fish and corn and fat roots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this time that money came to be.&nbsp; Sea-Lion
was the man who first thought of it, and he talked it over with
Dog-Tooth and Big-Fat.&nbsp; You see, these three were the ones
that got a share of everything in the Sea Valley.&nbsp; One
basket out of every three of corn was theirs, one fish out of
every three, one goat out of every three.&nbsp; In return, they
fed the guards and the watchers, and kept the rest for
themselves.&nbsp; Sometimes, when a big haul of fish was made
they did not know what to do with all their share.&nbsp; So
Sea-Lion set the women to making money out of shell&mdash;little
round pieces, with a hole in each one, and all made smooth and
fine.&nbsp; These were strung on strings, and the strings were
called money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each string was of the value of thirty fish, or forty
fish, but the women, who made a string a day, were given two fish
each.&nbsp; The fish came out of the shares of Dog-Tooth,
Big-Fat, and Sea-Lion, which they three did not eat.&nbsp; So all
the money belonged to them.&nbsp; Then they told Three-Legs and
the other land-owners that they would take their share of corn
and roots in money, Little-Belly that they would take their share
of fish in money, Pig-Jaw that they would take their share of
goats and cheese in money.&nbsp; Thus, a man who had nothing,
worked for one who had, and was paid in money.&nbsp; With this
money he bought corn, and fish, and meat, and cheese.&nbsp; And
Three-Legs and all owners of things paid Dog-Tooth and Sea-Lion
and Big-Fat their share in money.&nbsp; And they paid the guards
and watchers in money, and the guards and watchers bought their
food with the money.&nbsp; And, because money was cheap,
Dog-Tooth made many more men into guards.&nbsp; And, because
money was cheap to make, a number of men began to make money out
of shell themselves.&nbsp; But the guards stuck spears in them
and shot them full of arrows, because they were trying to break
up the tribe.&nbsp; It was bad to break up the tribe, for then
the Meat-Eaters would come over the divide and kill them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big-Fat was the voice of God, but he took Broken-Rib
and made him into a priest, so that he became the voice of
Big-Fat and did most of his talking for him.&nbsp; And both had
other men to be servants to them.&nbsp; So, also, did
Little-Belly and Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw have other men to lie in
the sun about their grass houses and carry messages for them and
give commands.&nbsp; And more and more were men taken away from
work, so that those that were left worked harder than ever
before.&nbsp; It seemed that men desired to do no work and strove
to seek out other ways whereby men should work for them.&nbsp;
Crooked-Eyes found such a way.&nbsp; He made the first fire-brew
out of corn.&nbsp; And thereafter he worked no more, for he
talked secretly with Dog-Tooth and Big-Fat and the other masters,
and it was agreed that he should be the only one to make
fire-brew.&nbsp; But Crooked-Eyes did no work himself.&nbsp; Men
made the brew for him, and he paid them in money.&nbsp; Then he
sold the fire-brew for money, and all men bought.&nbsp; And many
strings of money did he give Dog-Tooth and Sea-Lion and all of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big-Fat and Broken-Rib stood by Dog-Tooth when he took
his second wife, and his third wife.&nbsp; They said Dog-Tooth
was different from other men and second only to God that Big-Fat
kept in his taboo house, and Dog-Tooth said so, too, and wanted
to know who were they to grumble about how many wives he
took.&nbsp; Dog-Tooth had a big canoe made, and, many more men he
took from work, who did nothing and lay in the sun, save only
when Dog-Tooth went in the canoe, when they paddled for
him.&nbsp; And he made Tiger-Face head man over all the guards,
so that Tiger-Face became his right arm, and when he did not like
a man Tiger-Face killed that man for him.&nbsp; And Tiger-Face,
also, made another man to be his right arm, and to give commands,
and to kill for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this was the strange thing: as the days went by we
who were left worked harder and harder, and yet did we get less
and less to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of the goats and the corn and the fat roots
and the fish-trap?&rdquo; spoke up Afraid-of-the-Dark,
&ldquo;what of all this?&nbsp; Was there not more food to be
gained by man&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; Long-Beard agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three
men on the fish-trap got more fish than the whole tribe before
there was a fish-trap.&nbsp; But have I not said we were
fools?&nbsp; The more food we were able to get, the less food did
we have to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was it not plain that the many men who did not work
ate it all up?&rdquo; Yellow-Head demanded.</p>
<p>Long-Beard nodded his head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog-Tooth&rsquo;s dogs were stuffed with meat, and the
men who lay in the sun and did no work were rolling in fat, and,
at the same time, there were little children crying themselves to
sleep with hunger biting them with every wail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deer-Runner was spurred by the recital of famine to tear out a
chunk of bear-meat and broil it on a stick over the coals.&nbsp;
This he devoured with smacking lips, while Long-Beard went
on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we grumbled Big-Fat arose, and with the voice of
God said that God had chosen the wise men to own the land and the
goats and the fish-trap, and the fire-brew, and that without
these wise men we would all be animals, as in the days when we
lived in trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there arose one who became a singer of songs for
the king.&nbsp; Him they called the Bug, because he was small and
ungainly of face and limb and excelled not in work or deed.&nbsp;
He loved the fattest marrow bones, the choicest fish, the milk
warm from the goats, the first corn that was ripe, and the snug
place by the fire.&nbsp; And thus, becoming singer of songs to
the king, he found a way to do nothing and be fat.&nbsp; And when
the people grumbled more and more, and some threw stones at the
king&rsquo;s grass house, the Bug sang a song of how good it was
to be a Fish-Eater.&nbsp; In his song he told that the
Fish-Eaters were the chosen of God and the finest men God had
made.&nbsp; He sang of the Meat-Eaters as pigs and crows, and
sang how fine and good it was for the Fish-Eaters to fight and
die doing God&rsquo;s work, which was the killing of
Meat-Eaters.&nbsp; The words of his song were like fire in us,
and we clamoured to be led against the Meat-Eaters.&nbsp; And we
forgot that we were hungry, and why we had grumbled, and were
glad to be led by Tiger-Face over the divide, where we killed
many Meat-Eaters and were content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But things were no better in the Sea Valley.&nbsp; The
only way to get food was to work for Three-Legs or Little-Belly
or Pig-Jaw; for there was no land that a man might plant with
corn for himself.&nbsp; And often there were more men than
Three-Legs and the others had work for.&nbsp; So these men went
hungry, and so did their wives and children and their old
mothers.&nbsp; Tiger-Face said they could become guards if they
wanted to, and many of them did, and thereafter they did no work
except to poke spears in the men who did work and who grumbled at
feeding so many idlers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we grumbled, ever the Bug sang new
songs.&nbsp; He said that Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and the rest
were strong men, and that that was why they had so much.&nbsp; He
said that we should be glad to have strong men with us, else
would we perish of our own worthlessness and the
Meat-Eaters.&nbsp; Therefore, we should be glad to let such
strong men have all they could lay hands on.&nbsp; And Big-Fat
and Pig-Jaw and Tiger-Face and all the rest said it was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Long-Fang, &lsquo;then
will I, too, be a strong man.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he got himself
corn, and began to make fire-brew and sell it for strings of
money.&nbsp; And, when Crooked-Eyes complained, Long-Fang said
that he was himself a strong man, and that if Crooked-Eyes made
any more noise he would bash his brains out for him.&nbsp;
Whereat Crooked-Eyes was afraid and went and talked with
Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw.&nbsp; And all three went and talked to
Dog-Tooth.&nbsp; And Dog-Tooth spoke to Sea-Lion, and Sea-Lion
sent a runner with a message to Tiger-Face.&nbsp; And Tiger-Face
sent his guards, who burned Long-Fang&rsquo;s house along with
the fire-brew he had made.&nbsp; Also, they killed him and all
his family.&nbsp; And Big-Fat said it was good, and the Bug sang
another song about how good it was to observe the law, and what a
fine land the Sea Valley was, and how every man who loved the Sea
Valley should go forth and kill the bad Meat-Eaters.&nbsp; And
again his song was as fire to us, and we forgot to grumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very strange.&nbsp; When Little-Belly caught too
many fish, so that it took a great many to sell for a little
money, he threw many of the fish back into the sea, so that more
money would be paid for what was left.&nbsp; And Three-Legs often
let many large fields lie idle so as to get more money for his
corn.&nbsp; And the women, making so much money out of shell that
much money was needed to buy with, Dog-Tooth stopped the making
of money.&nbsp; And the women had no work, so they took the
places of the men.&nbsp; I worked on the fish-trap, getting a
string of money every five days.&nbsp; But my sister now did my
work, getting a string of money for every ten days.&nbsp; The
women worked cheaper, and there was less food, and Tiger-Face
said we should become guards.&nbsp; Only I could not become a
guard because I was lame of one leg and Tiger-Face would not have
me.&nbsp; And there were many like me.&nbsp; We were broken men
and only fit to beg for work or to take care of the babies while
the women worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yellow-Head, too, was made hungry by the recital and broiled a
piece of bear-meat on the coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you rise up, all of you, and kill
Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and Big-Fat and the rest and get enough to
eat?&rdquo; Afraid-in-the-Dark demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we could not understand,&rdquo; Long-Beard
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was too much to think about, and,
also, there were the guards sticking spears into us, and Big-Fat
talking about God, and the Bug singing new songs.&nbsp; And when
any man did think right, and said so, Tiger-Face and the guards
got him, and he was tied out to the rocks at low tide so that the
rising waters drowned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a strange thing&mdash;the money.&nbsp; It was
like the Bug&rsquo;s songs.&nbsp; It seemed all right, but it
wasn&rsquo;t, and we were slow to understand.&nbsp; Dog-Tooth
began to gather the money in.&nbsp; He put it in a big pile, in a
grass house, with guards to watch it day and night.&nbsp; And the
more money he piled in the house the dearer money became, so that
a man worked a longer time for a string of money than
before.&nbsp; Then, too, there was always talk of war with the
Meat-Eaters, and Dog-Tooth and Tiger-Face filled many houses with
corn, and dried fish, and smoked goat-meat, and cheese.&nbsp; And
with the food, piled there in mountains the people had not enough
to eat.&nbsp; But what did it matter?&nbsp; Whenever the people
grumbled too loudly the Bug sang a new song, and Big-Fat said it
was God&rsquo;s word that we should kill Meat-Eaters, and
Tiger-Face led us over the divide to kill and be killed.&nbsp; I
was not good enough to be a guard and lie fat in the sun, but,
when we made war, Tiger-Face was glad to take me along.&nbsp; And
when we had eaten, all the food stored in the houses we stopped
fighting and went back to work to pile up more food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then were you all crazy,&rdquo; commented
Deer-Runner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then were we indeed all crazy,&rdquo; Long-Beard
agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was strange, all of it.&nbsp; There was
Split-Nose.&nbsp; He said everything was wrong.&nbsp; He said it
was true that we grew strong by adding our strength
together.&nbsp; And he said that, when we first formed the tribe,
it was right that the men whose strength hurt the tribe should be
shorn of their strength&mdash;men who bashed their
brothers&rsquo; heads and stole their brothers&rsquo;
wives.&nbsp; And now, he said, the tribe was not getting
stronger, but was getting weaker, because there were men with
another kind of strength that were hurting the tribe&mdash;men
who had the strength of the land, like Three-Legs; who had the
strength of the fish-trap, like Little-Belly; who had the
strength of all the goat-meat, like Pig-Jaw.&nbsp; The thing to
do, Split-Nose said, was to shear these men of their evil
strength; to make them go to work, all of them, and to let no man
eat who did not work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Bug sang another song about men like
Split-Nose, who wanted to go back, and live in trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Split-Nose said no; that he did not want to go
back, but ahead; that they grew strong only as they added their
strength together; and that, if the Fish-Eaters would add their
strength to the Meat-Eaters, there would be no more fighting and
no more watchers and no more guards, and that, with all men
working, there would be so much food that each man would have to
work not more than two hours a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Bug sang again, and he sang that Split-Nose
was lazy, and he sang also the &lsquo;Song of the
Bees.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a strange song, and those who listened
were made mad, as from the drinking of strong fire-brew.&nbsp;
The song was of a swarm of bees, and of a robber wasp who had
come in to live with the bees and who was stealing all their
honey.&nbsp; The wasp was lazy and told them there was no need to
work; also, he told them to make friends with the bears, who were
not honey-stealers but only very good friends.&nbsp; And the Bug
sang in crooked words, so that those who listened knew that the
swarm was the Sea Valley tribe, that the bears were the
Meat-Eaters, and that the lazy wasp was Split-Nose.&nbsp; And
when the Bug sang that the bees listened to the wasp till the
swarm was near to perishing, the people growled and snarled, and
when the Bug sang that at last the good bees arose and stung the
wasp to death, the people picked up stones from the ground and
stoned Split-Nose to death till there was naught to be seen of
him but the heap of stones they had flung on top of him.&nbsp;
And there were many poor people who worked long and hard and had
not enough to eat that helped throw the stones on Split-Nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, after the death of Split-Nose, there was but one
other man that dared rise up and speak his mind, and that man was
Hair-Face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is the strength of the
strong?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are the strong, all of
us, and we are stronger than Dog-Tooth and Tiger-Face and
Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and all the rest who do nothing and eat
much and weaken us by the hurt of their strength which is bad
strength.&nbsp; Men who are slaves are not strong.&nbsp; If the
man who first found the virtue and use of fire had used his
strength we would have been his slaves, as we are the slaves
to-day of Little-Belly, who found the virtue and use of the
fish-trap; and of the men who found the virtue and use of the
land, and the goats, and the fire-brew.&nbsp; Before, we lived in
trees, my brothers, and no man was safe.&nbsp; But we fight no
more with one another.&nbsp; We have added our strength
together.&nbsp; Then let us fight no more with the
Meat-Eaters.&nbsp; Let us add our strength and their strength
together.&nbsp; Then will we be indeed strong.&nbsp; And then we
will go out together, the Fish-Eaters and the Meat-Eaters, and we
will kill the tigers and the lions and the wolves and the wild
dogs, and we will pasture our goats on all the hill-sides and
plant our corn and fat roots in all the high mountain
valleys.&nbsp; In that day we will be so strong that all the wild
animals will flee before us and perish.&nbsp; And nothing will
withstand us, for the strength of each man will be the strength
of all men in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So said Hair-Face, and they killed him, because, they
said, he was a wild man and wanted to go back and live in a
tree.&nbsp; It was very strange.&nbsp; Whenever a man arose and
wanted to go forward all those that stood still said he went
backward and should be killed.&nbsp; And the poor people helped
stone him, and were fools.&nbsp; We were all fools, except those
who were fat and did no work.&nbsp; The fools were called wise,
and the wise were stoned.&nbsp; Men who worked did not get enough
to eat, and the men who did not work ate too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the tribe went on losing strength.&nbsp; The
children were weak and sickly.&nbsp; And, because we ate not
enough, strange sicknesses came among us and we died like
flies.&nbsp; And then the Meat-Eaters came upon us.&nbsp; We had
followed Tiger-Face too often over the divide and killed
them.&nbsp; And now they came to repay in blood.&nbsp; We were
too weak and sick to man the big wall.&nbsp; And they killed us,
all of us, except some of the women, which they took away with
them.&nbsp; The Bug and I escaped, and I hid in the wildest
places, and became a hunter of meat and went hungry no
more.&nbsp; I stole a wife from the Meat-Eaters, and went to live
in the caves of the high mountains where they could not find
me.&nbsp; And we had three sons, and each son stole a wife from
the Meat-Eaters.&nbsp; And the rest you know, for are you not the
sons of my sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Bug?&rdquo; queried Deer-Runner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What became of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to live with the Meat-Eaters and to be a singer
of songs to the king.&nbsp; He is an old man now, but he sings
the same old songs; and, when a man rises up to go forward, he
sings that that man is walking backward to live in a
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-Beard dipped into the bear-carcass and sucked with
toothless gums at a fist of suet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he said, wiping his hands on his
sides, &ldquo;all the fools will be dead and then all live men
will go forward.&nbsp; The strength of the strong will be theirs,
and they will add their strength together, so that, of all the
men in the world, not one will fight with another.&nbsp; There
will be no guards nor watchers on the walls.&nbsp; And all the
hunting animals will be killed, and, as Hair-Face said, all the
hill-sides will be pastured with goats and all the high mountain
valleys will be planted with corn and fat roots.&nbsp; And all
men will be brothers, and no man will lie idle in the sun and be
fed by his fellows.&nbsp; And all that will come to pass in the
time when the fools are dead, and when there will be no more
singers to stand still and sing the &lsquo;Song of the
Bees.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bees are not men.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>SOUTH
OF THE SLOT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> San Francisco, which is the San
Francisco of only the other day, the day before the Earthquake,
was divided midway by the Slot.&nbsp; The Slot was an iron crack
that ran along the centre of Market Street, and from the Slot
arose the burr of the ceaseless, endless cable that was hitched
at will to the cars it dragged up and down.&nbsp; In truth, there
were two slots, but in the quick grammar of the West time was
saved by calling them, and much more that they stood for,
&ldquo;The Slot.&rdquo;&nbsp; North of the Slot were the
theatres, hotels, and shopping district, the banks and the staid,
respectable business houses.&nbsp; South of the Slot were the
factories, slums, laundries, machine-shops, boiler works, and the
abodes of the working class.</p>
<p>The Slot was the metaphor that expressed the class cleavage of
Society, and no man crossed this metaphor, back and forth, more
successfully than Freddie Drummond.&nbsp; He made a practice of
living in both worlds, and in both worlds he lived signally
well.&nbsp; Freddie Drummond was a professor in the Sociology
Department of the University of California, and it was as a
professor of sociology that he first crossed over the Slot, lived
for six mouths in the great labour-ghetto, and wrote <i>The
Unskilled Labourer</i>&mdash;a book that was hailed everywhere as
an able contribution to the literature of progress, and as a
splendid reply to the literature of discontent.&nbsp; Politically
and economically it was nothing if not orthodox.&nbsp; Presidents
of great railway systems bought whole editions of it to give to
their employees.&nbsp; The Manufacturers&rsquo; Association alone
distributed fifty thousand copies of it.&nbsp; In a way, it was
almost as immoral as the far-famed and notorious <i>Message to
Garcia</i>, while in its pernicious preachment of thrift and
content it ran <i>Mr. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch</i> a close
second.</p>
<p>At first, Freddie Drummond found it monstrously difficult to
get along among the working people.&nbsp; He was not used to
their ways, and they certainly were not used to his.&nbsp; They
were suspicious.&nbsp; He had no antecedents.&nbsp; He could talk
of no previous jobs.&nbsp; His hands were soft.&nbsp; His
extraordinary politeness was ominous.&nbsp; His first idea of the
r&ocirc;le he would play was that of a free and independent
American who chose to work with his hands and no explanations
given.&nbsp; But it wouldn&rsquo;t do, as he quickly
discovered.&nbsp; At the beginning they accepted him, very
provisionally, as a freak.&nbsp; A little later, as he began to
know his way about better, he insensibly drifted into the
r&ocirc;le that would work&mdash;namely, he was a man who had
seen better days, very much better days, but who was down on his
luck, though, to be sure, only temporarily.</p>
<p>He learned many things, and generalized much and often
erroneously, all of which can be found in the pages of <i>The
Unskilled Labourer</i>.&nbsp; He saved himself, however, after
the sane and conservative manner of his kind, by labelling his
generalizations as &ldquo;tentative.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of his
first experiences was in the great Wilmax Cannery, where he was
put on piece-work making small packing cases.&nbsp; A box factory
supplied the parts, and all Freddie Drummond had to do was to fit
the parts into a form and drive in the wire nails with a light
hammer.</p>
<p>It was not skilled labour, but it was piece-work.&nbsp; The
ordinary labourers in the cannery got a dollar and a half per
day.&nbsp; Freddie Drummond found the other men on the same job
with him jogging along and earning a dollar and seventy-five
cents a day.&nbsp; By the third day he was able to earn the
same.&nbsp; But he was ambitious.&nbsp; He did not care to jog
along and, being unusually able and fit, on the fourth day earned
two dollars.</p>
<p>The next day, having keyed himself up to an exhausting
high-tension, he earned two dollars and a half.&nbsp; His fellow
workers favoured him with scowls and black looks, and made
remarks, slangily witty and which he did not understand, about
sucking up to the boss and pace-making and holding her down, when
the rains set in.&nbsp; He was astonished at their malingering on
piece-work, generalized about the inherent laziness of the
unskilled labourer, and proceeded next day to hammer out three
dollars&rsquo; worth of boxes.</p>
<p>And that night, coming out of the cannery, he was interviewed
by his fellow workmen, who were very angry and incoherently
slangy.&nbsp; He failed to comprehend the motive behind their
action.&nbsp; The action itself was strenuous.&nbsp; When he
refused to ease down his pace and bleated about freedom of
contract, independent Americanism, and the dignity of toil, they
proceeded to spoil his pace-making ability.&nbsp; It was a fierce
battle, for Drummond was a large man and an athlete, but the
crowd finally jumped on his ribs, walked on his face, and stamped
on his fingers, so that it was only after lying in bed for a week
that he was able to get up and look for another job.&nbsp; All of
which is duly narrated in that first book of his, in the chapter
entitled &ldquo;The Tyranny of Labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later, in another department of the Wilmax Cannery,
lumping as a fruit-distributor among the women, he essayed to
carry two boxes of fruit at a time, and was promptly reproached
by the other fruit-lumpers.&nbsp; It was palpable malingering;
but he was there, he decided, not to change conditions, but to
observe.&nbsp; So he lumped one box thereafter, and so well did
he study the art of shirking that he wrote a special chapter on
it, with the last several paragraphs devoted to tentative
generalizations.</p>
<p>In those six months he worked at many jobs and developed into
a very good imitation of a genuine worker.&nbsp; He was a natural
linguist, and he kept notebooks, making a scientific study of the
workers&rsquo; slang or argot, until he could talk quite
intelligibly.&nbsp; This language also enabled him more
intimately to follow their mental processes, and thereby to
gather much data for a projected chapter in some future book
which he planned to entitle <i>Synthesis of Working-Class
Psychology</i>.</p>
<p>Before he arose to the surface from that first plunge into the
underworld he discovered that he was a good actor and
demonstrated the plasticity of his nature.&nbsp; He was himself
astonished at his own fluidity.&nbsp; Once having mastered the
language and conquered numerous fastidious qualms, he found that
he could flow into any nook of working-class life and fit it so
snugly as to feel comfortably at home.&nbsp; As he said, in the
preface to his second book, <i>The Toiler</i>, he endeavoured
really to know the working people, and the only possible way to
achieve this was to work beside them, eat their food, sleep in
their beds, be amused with their amusements, think their
thoughts, and feel their feeling.</p>
<p>He was not a deep thinker.&nbsp; He had no faith in new
theories.&nbsp; All his norms and criteria were
conventional.&nbsp; His Thesis on the French Revolution was
noteworthy in college annals, not merely for its painstaking and
voluminous accuracy, but for the fact that it was the dryest,
deadest, most formal, and most orthodox screed ever written on
the subject.&nbsp; He was a very reserved man, and his natural
inhibition was large in quantity and steel-like in quality.&nbsp;
He had but few friends.&nbsp; He was too undemonstrative, too
frigid.&nbsp; He had no vices, nor had any one ever discovered
any temptations.&nbsp; Tobacco he detested, beer he abhorred, and
he was never known to drink anything stronger than an occasional
light wine at dinner.</p>
<p>When a freshman he had been baptized &ldquo;Ice-Box&rdquo; by
his warmer-blooded fellows.&nbsp; As a member of the faculty he
was known as &ldquo;Cold-Storage.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had but one
grief, and that was &ldquo;Freddie.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had earned it
when he played full-back in the &lsquo;Varsity eleven, and his
formal soul had never succeeded in living it down.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Freddie&rdquo; he would ever be, except officially, and
through nightmare vistas he looked into a future when his world
would speak of him as &ldquo;Old Freddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For he was very young to be a doctor of sociology, only
twenty-seven, and he looked younger.&nbsp; In appearance and
atmosphere he was a strapping big college man, smooth-faced and
easy-mannered, clean and simple and wholesome, with a known
record of being a splendid athlete and an implied vast possession
of cold culture of the inhibited sort.&nbsp; He never talked shop
out of class and committee rooms, except later on, when his books
showered him with distasteful public notice and he yielded to the
extent of reading occasional papers before certain literary and
economic societies.</p>
<p>He did everything right&mdash;too right; and in dress and
comportment was inevitably correct.&nbsp; Not that he was a
dandy.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; He was a college man, in dress
and carriage as like as a pea to the type that of late years is
being so generously turned out of our institutions of higher
learning.&nbsp; His handshake was satisfyingly strong and
stiff.&nbsp; His blue eyes were coldly blue and convincingly
sincere.&nbsp; His voice, firm and masculine, clean and crisp of
enunciation, was pleasant to the ear.&nbsp; The one drawback to
Freddie Drummond was his inhibition.&nbsp; He never unbent.&nbsp;
In his football days, the higher the tension of the game, the
cooler he grew.&nbsp; He was noted as a boxer, but he was
regarded as an automaton, with the inhuman precision of a machine
judging distance and timing blows, guarding, blocking, and
stalling.&nbsp; He was rarely punished himself, while he rarely
punished an opponent.&nbsp; He was too clever and too controlled
to permit himself to put a pound more weight into a punch than he
intended.&nbsp; With him it was a matter of exercise.&nbsp; It
kept him fit.</p>
<p>As time went by, Freddie Drummond found himself more
frequently crossing the Slot and losing himself in South of
Market.&nbsp; His summer and winter holidays were spent there,
and, whether it was a week or a week-end, he found the time spent
there to be valuable and enjoyable.&nbsp; And there was so much
material to be gathered.&nbsp; His third book, <i>Mass and
Master</i>, became a text-book in the American universities; and
almost before he knew it, he was at work on a fourth one, <i>The
Fallacy of the Inefficient</i>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in his make-up there was a strange twist or
quirk.&nbsp; Perhaps it was a recoil from his environment and
training, or from the tempered seed of his ancestors, who had
been book-men generation preceding generation; but at any rate,
he found enjoyment in being down in the working-class
world.&nbsp; In his own world he was &ldquo;Cold-Storage,&rdquo;
but down below he was &ldquo;Big&rdquo; Bill Totts, who could
drink and smoke, and slang and fight, and be an all-round
favourite.&nbsp; Everybody liked Bill, and more than one working
girl made love to him.&nbsp; At first he had been merely a good
actor, but as time went on, simulation became second
nature.&nbsp; He no longer played a part, and he loved sausages,
sausages and bacon, than which, in his own proper sphere, there
was nothing more loathsome in the way of food.</p>
<p>From doing the thing for the need&rsquo;s sake, he came to
doing the thing for the thing&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He found
himself regretting as the time drew near for him to go back to
his lecture-room and his inhibition.&nbsp; And he often found
himself waiting with anticipation for the dreamy time to pass
when he could cross the Slot and cut loose and play the
devil.&nbsp; He was not wicked, but as &ldquo;Big&rdquo; Bill
Totts he did a myriad things that Freddie Drummond would never
have been permitted to do.&nbsp; Moreover, Freddie Drummond never
would have wanted to do them.&nbsp; That was the strangest part
of his discovery.&nbsp; Freddie Drummond and Bill Totts were two
totally different creatures.&nbsp; The desires and tastes and
impulses of each ran counter to the other&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Bill
Totts could shirk at a job with clear conscience, while Freddie
Drummond condemned shirking as vicious, criminal, and
un-American, and devoted whole chapters to condemnation of the
vice.&nbsp; Freddie Drummond did not care for dancing, but Bill
Totts never missed the nights at the various dancing clubs, such
as The Magnolia, The Western Star, and The Elite; while he won a
massive silver cup, standing thirty inches high, for being the
best-sustained character at the Butchers and Meat Workers&rsquo;
annual grand masked ball.&nbsp; And Bill Totts liked the girls
and the girls liked him, while Freddie Drummond enjoyed playing
the ascetic in this particular, was open in his opposition to
equal suffrage, and cynically bitter in his secret condemnation
of coeducation.</p>
<p>Freddie Drummond changed his manners with his dress, and
without effort.&nbsp; When he entered the obscure little room
used for his transformation scenes, he carried himself just a bit
too stiffly.&nbsp; He was too erect, his shoulders were an inch
too far back, while his face was grave, almost harsh, and
practically expressionless.&nbsp; But when he emerged in Bill
Totts&rsquo; clothes he was another creature.&nbsp; Bill Totts
did not slouch, but somehow his whole form limbered up and became
graceful.&nbsp; The very sound of the voice was changed, and the
laugh was loud and hearty, while loose speech and an occasional
oath were as a matter of course on his lips.&nbsp; Also, Bill
Totts was a trifle inclined to late hours, and at times, in
saloons, to be good-naturedly bellicose with other workmen.&nbsp;
Then, too, at Sunday picnics or when coming home from the show,
either arm betrayed a practised familiarity in stealing around
girls&rsquo; waists, while he displayed a wit keen and delightful
in the flirtatious badinage that was expected of a good fellow in
his class.</p>
<p>So thoroughly was Bill Totts himself, so thoroughly a workman,
a genuine denizen of South of the Slot, that he was as
class-conscious as the average of his kind, and his hatred for a
scab even exceeded that of the average loyal union man.&nbsp;
During the Water Front Strike, Freddie Drummond was somehow able
to stand apart from the unique combination, and, coldly critical,
watch Bill Totts hilariously slug scab longshoremen.&nbsp; For
Bill Totts was a dues-paying member of the Longshoremen Union and
had a right to be indignant with the usurpers of his job.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Big&rdquo; Bill Totts was so very big, and so very able,
that it was &ldquo;Big&rdquo; Bill to the front when trouble was
brewing.&nbsp; From acting outraged feelings, Freddie Drummond,
in the r&ocirc;le of his other self, came to experience genuine
outrage, and it was only when he returned to the classic
atmosphere of the university that he was able, sanely and
conservatively, to generalize upon his underworld experiences and
put them down on paper as a trained sociologist should.&nbsp;
That Bill Totts lacked the perspective to raise him above
class-consciousness Freddie Drummond clearly saw.&nbsp; But Bill
Totts could not see it.&nbsp; When he saw a scab taking his job
away, he saw red at the same time, and little else did he
see.&nbsp; It was Freddie Drummond, irreproachably clothed and
comported, seated at his study desk or facing his class in
<i>Sociology</i> 17, who saw Bill Totts, and all around Bill
Totts, and all around the whole scab and union-labour problem and
its relation to the economic welfare of the United States in the
struggle for the world market.&nbsp; Bill Totts really
wasn&rsquo;t able to see beyond the next meal and the prize-fight
the following night at the Gaiety Athletic Club.</p>
<p>It was while gathering material for <i>Women and Work</i> that
Freddie received his first warning of the danger he was in.&nbsp;
He was too successful at living in both worlds.&nbsp; This
strange dualism he had developed was after all very unstable,
and, as he sat in his study and meditated, he saw that it could
not endure.&nbsp; It was really a transition stage, and if he
persisted he saw that he would inevitably have to drop one world
or the other.&nbsp; He could not continue in both.&nbsp; And as
he looked at the row of volumes that graced the upper shelf of
his revolving book-case, his volumes, beginning with his Thesis
and ending with <i>Women and Work</i>, he decided that that was
the world he would hold to and stick by.&nbsp; Bill Totts had
served his purpose, but he had become a too dangerous
accomplice.&nbsp; Bill Totts would have to cease.</p>
<p>Freddie Drummond&rsquo;s fright was due to Mary Condon,
President of the International Glove Workers&rsquo; Union No.
974.&nbsp; He had seen her, first, from the spectators&rsquo;
gallery, at the annual convention of the Northwest Federation of
Labour, and he had seen her through Bill Totts&rsquo; eyes, and
that individual had been most favourably impressed by her.&nbsp;
She was not Freddie Drummond&rsquo;s sort at all.&nbsp; What if
she were a royal-bodied woman, graceful and sinewy as a panther,
with amazing black eyes that could fill with fire or
laughter-love, as the mood might dictate?&nbsp; He detested women
with a too exuberant vitality and a lack of . . . well, of
inhibition.&nbsp; Freddie Drummond accepted the doctrine of
evolution because it was quite universally accepted by college
men, and he flatly believed that man had climbed up the ladder of
life out of the weltering muck and mess of lower and monstrous
organic things.&nbsp; But he was a trifle ashamed of this
genealogy, and preferred not to think of it.&nbsp; Wherefore,
probably, he practised his iron inhibition and preached it to
others, and preferred women of his own type, who could shake free
of this bestial and regrettable ancestral line and by discipline
and control emphasize the wideness of the gulf that separated
them from what their dim forbears had been.</p>
<p>Bill Totts had none of these considerations.&nbsp; He had
liked Mary Condon from the moment his eyes first rested on her in
the convention hall, and he had made it a point, then and there,
to find out who she was.&nbsp; The next time he met her, and
quite by accident, was when he was driving an express waggon for
Pat Morrissey.&nbsp; It was in a lodging-house in Mission Street,
where he had been called to take a trunk into storage.&nbsp; The
landlady&rsquo;s daughter had called him and led him to the
little bedroom, the occupant of which, a glove-maker, had just
been removed to hospital.&nbsp; But Bill did not know this.&nbsp;
He stooped, up-ended the trunk, which was a large one, got it on
his shoulder, and struggled to his feet with his back toward the
open door.&nbsp; At that moment he heard a woman&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belong to the union?&rdquo; was the question asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s it to you?&rdquo; he retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Run along now, an&rsquo; git outa my way.&nbsp; I wanta
turn round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next he know, big as he was, he was whirled half around
and sent reeling backward, the trunk overbalancing him, till he
fetched up with a crash against the wall.&nbsp; He started to
swear, but at the same instant found himself looking into Mary
Condon&rsquo;s flashing, angry eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I b&rsquo;long to the union,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was only kiddin&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your card?&rdquo; she demanded in
businesslike tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my pocket.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t git it out
now.&nbsp; This trunk&rsquo;s too damn heavy.&nbsp; Come on down
to the waggon an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll show it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that trunk down,&rdquo; was the command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&nbsp; I got a card, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo;
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it down, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; No scab&rsquo;s
going to handle that trunk.&nbsp; You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, you big coward, scabbing on honest men.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you join the union and be a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Condon&rsquo;s colour had left her face, and it was
apparent that she was in a rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of a big man like you turning traitor to his
class.&nbsp; I suppose you&rsquo;re aching to join the militia
for a chance to shoot down union drivers the next strike.&nbsp;
You may belong to the militia already, for that matter.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re the sort&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, now, that&rsquo;s too much!&rdquo;&nbsp; Bill
dropped the trunk to the floor with a bang, straightened up, and
thrust his hand into his inside coat pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told
you I was only kiddin&rsquo;.&nbsp; There, look at
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a union card properly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, take it along,&rdquo; Mary Condon
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the next time don&rsquo;t kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face relaxed as she noticed the ease with which he got the
big trunk to his shoulder, and her eyes glowed as they glanced
over the graceful massiveness of the man.&nbsp; But Bill did not
see that.&nbsp; He was too busy with the trunk.</p>
<p>The next time he saw Mary Condon was during the Laundry
Strike.&nbsp; The Laundry Workers, but recently organized, were
green at the business, and had petitioned Mary Condon to engineer
the strike.&nbsp; Freddie Drummond had had an inkling of what was
coming, and had sent Bill Totts to join the union and
investigate.&nbsp; Bill&rsquo;s job was in the wash-room, and the
men had been called out first, that morning, in order to stiffen
the courage of the girls; and Bill chanced to be near the door to
the mangle-room when Mary Condon started to enter.&nbsp; The
superintendent, who was both large and stout, barred her
way.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t going to have his girls called out,
and he&rsquo;d teach her a lesson to mind her own business.&nbsp;
And as Mary tried to squeeze past him he thrust her back with a
fat hand on her shoulder.&nbsp; She glanced around and saw
Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you, Mr. Totts,&rdquo; she called.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lend a hand.&nbsp; I want to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill experienced a startle of warm surprise.&nbsp; She had
remembered his name from his union card.&nbsp; The next moment
the superintendent had been plucked from the doorway raving about
rights under the law, and the girls were deserting their
machines.&nbsp; During the rest of that short and successful
strike, Bill constituted himself Mary Condon&rsquo;s henchman and
messenger, and when it was over returned to the University to be
Freddie Drummond and to wonder what Bill Totts could see in such
a woman.</p>
<p>Freddie Drummond was entirely safe, but Bill had fallen in
love.&nbsp; There was no getting away from the fact of it, and it
was this fact that had given Freddie Drummond his warning.&nbsp;
Well, he had done his work, and his adventures could cease.&nbsp;
There was no need for him to cross the Slot again.&nbsp; All but
the last three chapters of his latest, <i>Labour Tactics and
Strategy</i>, was finished, and he had sufficient material on
hand adequately to supply those chapters.</p>
<p>Another conclusion he arrived at, was that in order to
sheet-anchor himself as Freddie Drummond, closer ties and
relations in his own social nook were necessary.&nbsp; It was
time that he was married, anyway, and he was fully aware that if
Freddie Drummond didn&rsquo;t get married, Bill Totts assuredly
would, and the complications were too awful to contemplate.&nbsp;
And so, enters Catherine Van Vorst.&nbsp; She was a college woman
herself, and her father, the one wealthy member of the faculty,
was the head of the Philosophy Department as well.&nbsp; It would
be a wise marriage from every standpoint, Freddie Drummond
concluded when the engagement was consummated and
announced.&nbsp; In appearance cold and reserved, aristocratic
and wholesomely conservative, Catherine Van Vorst, though warm in
her way, possessed an inhibition equal to Drummond&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>All seemed well with him, but Freddie Drummond could not quite
shake off the call of the underworld, the lure of the free and
open, of the unhampered, irresponsible life South of the
Slot.&nbsp; As the time of his marriage approached, he felt that
he had indeed sowed wild oats, and he felt, moreover, what a good
thing it would be if he could have but one wild fling more, play
the good fellow and the wastrel one last time, ere he settled
down to grey lecture-rooms and sober matrimony.&nbsp; And,
further to tempt him, the very last chapter of <i>Labour Tactics
and Strategy</i> remained unwritten for lack of a trifle more of
essential data which he had neglected to gather.</p>
<p>So Freddie Drummond went down for the last time as Bill Totts,
got his data, and, unfortunately, encountered Mary Condon.&nbsp;
Once more installed in his study, it was not a pleasant thing to
look back upon.&nbsp; It made his warning doubly
imperative.&nbsp; Bill Totts had behaved abominably.&nbsp; Not
only had he met Mary Condon at the Central Labour Council, but he
had stopped at a chop-house with her, on the way home, and
treated her to oysters.&nbsp; And before they parted at her door,
his arms had been about her, and he had kissed her on the lips
and kissed her repeatedly.&nbsp; And her last words in his ear,
words uttered softly with a catchy sob in the throat that was
nothing more nor less than a love cry, were &ldquo;Bill . . .
dear, dear Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freddie Drummond shuddered at the recollection.&nbsp; He saw
the pit yawning for him.&nbsp; He was not by nature a polygamist,
and he was appalled at the possibilities of the situation.&nbsp;
It would have to be put an end to, and it would end in one only
of two ways: either he must become wholly Bill Totts and be
married to Mary Condon, or he must remain wholly Freddie Drummond
and be married to Catherine Van Vorst.&nbsp; Otherwise, his
conduct would be beneath contempt and horrible.</p>
<p>In the several months that followed, San Francisco was torn
with labour strife.&nbsp; The unions and the employers&rsquo;
associations had locked horns with a determination that looked as
if they intended to settle the matter, one way or the other, for
all time.&nbsp; But Freddie Drummond corrected proofs, lectured
classes, and did not budge.&nbsp; He devoted himself to Catherine
Van Vorst, and day by day found more to respect and admire in
her&mdash;nay, even to love in her.&nbsp; The Street Car Strike
tempted him, but not so severely as he would have expected; and
the great Meat Strike came on and left him cold.&nbsp; The ghost
of Bill Totts had been successfully laid, and Freddie Drummond
with rejuvenescent zeal tackled a brochure, long-planned, on the
topic of &ldquo;diminishing returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wedding was two weeks off, when, one afternoon, in San
Francisco, Catherine Van Vorst picked him up and whisked him away
to see a Boys&rsquo; Club, recently instituted by the settlement
workers in whom she was interested.&nbsp; It was her
brother&rsquo;s machine, but they were alone with the exception
of the chauffeur.&nbsp; At the junction with Kearny Street,
Market and Geary Streets intersect like the sides of a
sharp-angled letter &ldquo;V.&rdquo;&nbsp; They, in the auto,
were coming down Market with the intention of negotiating the
sharp apex and going up Geary.&nbsp; But they did not know what
was coming down Geary, timed by fate to meet them at the
apex.&nbsp; While aware from the papers that the Meat Strike was
on and that it was an exceedingly bitter one, all thought of it
at that moment was farthest from Freddie Drummond&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; Was he not seated beside Catherine?&nbsp; And
besides, he was carefully expositing to her his views on
settlement work&mdash;views that Bill Totts&rsquo; adventures had
played a part in formulating.</p>
<p>Coming down Geary Street were six meat waggons.&nbsp; Beside
each scab driver sat a policeman.&nbsp; Front and rear, and along
each side of this procession, marched a protecting escort of one
hundred police.&nbsp; Behind the police rearguard, at a
respectful distance, was an orderly but vociferous mob, several
blocks in length, that congested the street from sidewalk to
sidewalk.&nbsp; The Beef Trust was making an effort to supply the
hotels, and, incidentally, to begin the breaking of the
strike.&nbsp; The St. Francis had already been supplied, at a
cost of many broken windows and broken heads, and the expedition
was marching to the relief of the Palace Hotel.</p>
<p>All unwitting, Drummond sat beside Catherine, talking
settlement work, as the auto, honking methodically and dodging
traffic, swung in a wide curve to get around the apex.&nbsp; A
big coal waggon, loaded with lump coal and drawn by four huge
horses, just debouching from Kearny Street as though to turn down
Market, blocked their way.&nbsp; The driver of the waggon seemed
undecided, and the chauffeur, running slow but disregarding some
shouted warning from the crossing policemen, swerved the auto to
the left, violating the traffic rules, in order to pass in front
of the waggon.</p>
<p>At that moment Freddie Drummond discontinued his
conversation.&nbsp; Nor did he resume it again, for the situation
was developing with the rapidity of a transformation scene.&nbsp;
He heard the roar of the mob at the rear, and caught a glimpse of
the helmeted police and the lurching meat waggons.&nbsp; At the
same moment, laying on his whip, and standing up to his task, the
coal driver rushed horses and waggon squarely in front of the
advancing procession, pulled the horses up sharply, and put on
the big brake.&nbsp; Then he made his lines fast to the
brake-handle and sat down with the air of one who had stopped to
stay.&nbsp; The auto had been brought to a stop, too, by his big
panting leaders which had jammed against it.</p>
<p>Before the chauffeur could back clear, an old Irishman,
driving a rickety express waggon and lashing his one horse to a
gallop, had locked wheels with the auto.&nbsp; Drummond
recognized both horse and waggon, for he had driven them often
himself.&nbsp; The Irishman was Pat Morrissey.&nbsp; On the other
side a brewery waggon was locking with the coal waggon, and an
east-bound Kearny Street car, wildly clanging its gong, the
motorman shouting defiance at the crossing policeman, was dashing
forward to complete the blockade.&nbsp; And waggon after waggon
was locking and blocking and adding to the confusion.&nbsp; The
meat waggons halted.&nbsp; The police were trapped.&nbsp; The
roar at the rear increased as the mob came on to the attack,
while the vanguard of the police charged the obstructing
waggons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for it,&rdquo; Drummond remarked coolly
to Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she nodded, with equal coolness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What savages they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His admiration for her doubled on itself.&nbsp; She was indeed
his sort.&nbsp; He would have been satisfied with her even if she
had screamed, and clung to him, but this&mdash;this was
magnificent.&nbsp; She sat in that storm centre as calmly as if
it had been no more than a block of carriages at the opera.</p>
<p>The police were struggling to clear a passage.&nbsp; The
driver of the coal waggon, a big man in shirt sleeves, lighted a
pipe and sat smoking.&nbsp; He glanced down complacently at a
captain of police who was raving and cursing at him, and his only
acknowledgment was a shrug of the shoulders.&nbsp; From the rear
arose the rat-rat-tat of clubs on heads and a pandemonium of
cursing, yelling, and shouting.&nbsp; A violent accession of
noise proclaimed that the mob had broken through and was dragging
a scab from a waggon.&nbsp; The police captain reinforced from
his vanguard, and the mob at the rear was repelled.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, window after window in the high office building on the
right had been opened, and the class-conscious clerks were
raining a shower of office furniture down on the heads of police
and scabs.&nbsp; Waste-baskets, ink-bottles, paper-weights,
type-writers&mdash;anything and everything that came to hand was
filling the air.</p>
<p>A policeman, under orders from his captain, clambered to the
lofty seat of the coal waggon to arrest the driver.&nbsp; And the
driver, rising leisurely and peacefully to meet him, suddenly
crumpled him in his arms and threw him down on top of the
captain.&nbsp; The driver was a young giant, and when he climbed
on his load and poised a lump of coal in both hands, a policeman,
who was just scaling the waggon from the side, let go and dropped
back to earth.&nbsp; The captain ordered half-a-dozen of his men
to take the waggon.&nbsp; The teamster, scrambling over the load
from side to side, beat them down with huge lumps of coal.</p>
<p>The crowd on the sidewalks and the teamsters on the locked
waggons roared encouragement and their own delight.&nbsp; The
motorman, smashing helmets with his controller bar, was beaten
into insensibility and dragged from his platform.&nbsp; The
captain of police, beside himself at the repulse of his men, led
the next assault on the coal waggon.&nbsp; A score of police were
swarming up the tall-sided fortress.&nbsp; But the teamster
multiplied himself.&nbsp; At times there were six or eight
policemen rolling on the pavement and under the waggon.&nbsp;
Engaged in repulsing an attack on the rear end of his fortress,
the teamster turned about to see the captain just in the act of
stepping on to the seat from the front end.&nbsp; He was still in
the air and in most unstable equilibrium, when the teamster
hurled a thirty-pound lump of coal.&nbsp; It caught the captain
fairly on the chest, and he went over backward, striking on a
wheeler&rsquo;s back, tumbling on to the ground, and jamming
against the rear wheel of the auto.</p>
<p>Catherine thought he was dead, but he picked himself up and
charged back.&nbsp; She reached out her gloved hand and patted
the flank of the snorting, quivering horse.&nbsp; But Drummond
did not notice the action.&nbsp; He had eyes for nothing save the
battle of the coal waggon, while somewhere in his complicated
psychology, one Bill Totts was heaving and straining in an effort
to come to life.&nbsp; Drummond believed in law and order and the
maintenance of the established, but this riotous savage within
him would have none of it.&nbsp; Then, if ever, did Freddie
Drummond call upon his iron inhibition to save him.&nbsp; But it
is written that the house divided against itself must fall.&nbsp;
And Freddie Drummond found that he had divided all the will and
force of him with Bill Totts, and between them the entity that
constituted the pair of them was being wrenched in twain.</p>
<p>Freddie Drummond sat in the auto, quite composed, alongside
Catherine Van Vorst; but looking out of Freddie Drummond&rsquo;s
eyes was Bill Totts, and somewhere behind those eyes, battling
for the control of their mutual body, were Freddie Drummond the
sane and conservative sociologist, and Bill Totts, the
class-conscious and bellicose union working man.&nbsp; It was
Bill Totts, looking out of those eyes, who saw the inevitable end
of the battle on the coal waggon.&nbsp; He saw a policeman gain
the top of the load, a second, and a third.&nbsp; They lurched
clumsily on the loose footing, but their long riot-clubs were out
and swinging.&nbsp; One blow caught the teamster on the
head.&nbsp; A second he dodged, receiving it on the
shoulder.&nbsp; For him the game was plainly up.&nbsp; He dashed
in suddenly, clutched two policemen in his arms, and hurled
himself a prisoner to the pavement, his hold never relaxing on
his two captors.</p>
<p>Catherine Van Vorst was sick and faint at sight of the blood
and brutal fighting.&nbsp; But her qualms were vanquished by the
sensational and most unexpected happening that followed.&nbsp;
The man beside her emitted an unearthly and uncultured yell and
rose to his feet.&nbsp; She saw him spring over the front seat,
leap to the broad rump of the wheeler, and from there gain the
waggon.&nbsp; His onslaught was like a whirlwind.&nbsp; Before
the bewildered officer on the load could guess the errand of this
conventionally clad but excited-seeming gentleman, he was the
recipient of a punch that arched him back through the air to the
pavement.&nbsp; A kick in the face led an ascending policeman to
follow his example.&nbsp; A rush of three more gained the top and
locked with Bill Totts in a gigantic clinch, during which his
scalp was opened up by a club, and coat, vest, and half his
starched shirt were torn from him.&nbsp; But the three policemen
were flung far and wide, and Bill Totts, raining down lumps of
coal, held the fort.</p>
<p>The captain led gallantly to the attack, but was bowled over
by a chunk of coal that burst on his head in black baptism.&nbsp;
The need of the police was to break the blockade in front before
the mob could break in at the rear, and Bill Totts&rsquo; need
was to hold the waggon till the mob did break through.&nbsp; So
the battle of the coal went on.</p>
<p>The crowd had recognized its champion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Big&rdquo;
Bill, as usual, had come to the front, and Catherine Van Vorst
was bewildered by the cries of &ldquo;Bill!&nbsp; O you
Bill!&rdquo; that arose on every hand.&nbsp; Pat Morrissey, on
his waggon seat, was jumping and screaming in an ecstasy,
&ldquo;Eat &rsquo;em, Bill!&nbsp; Eat &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Eat
&rsquo;em alive!&rdquo;&nbsp; From the sidewalk she heard a
woman&rsquo;s voice cry out, &ldquo;Look out, Bill&mdash;front
end!&rdquo;&nbsp; Bill took the warning and with well-directed
coal cleared the front end of the waggon of assailants.&nbsp;
Catherine Van Vorst turned her head and saw on the curb of the
sidewalk a woman with vivid colouring and flashing black eyes who
was staring with all her soul at the man who had been Freddie
Drummond a few minutes before.</p>
<p>The windows of the office building became vociferous with
applause.&nbsp; A fresh shower of office chairs and filing
cabinets descended.&nbsp; The mob had broken through on one side
the line of waggons, and was advancing, each segregated policeman
the centre of a fighting group.&nbsp; The scabs were torn from
their seats, the traces of the horses cut, and the frightened
animals put in flight.&nbsp; Many policemen crawled under the
coal waggon for safety, while the loose horses, with here and
there a policeman on their backs or struggling at their heads to
hold them, surged across the sidewalk opposite the jam and broke
into Market Street.</p>
<p>Catherine Van Vorst heard the woman&rsquo;s voice calling in
warning.&nbsp; She was back on the curb again, and crying
out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat it, Bill!&nbsp; Now&rsquo;s your time!&nbsp; Beat
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police for the moment had been swept away.&nbsp; Bill
Totts leaped to the pavement and made his way to the woman on the
sidewalk.&nbsp; Catherine Van Vorst saw her throw her arms around
him and kiss him on the lips; and Catherine Van Vorst watched him
curiously as he went on down the sidewalk, one arm around the
woman, both talking and laughing, and he with a volubility and
abandon she could never have dreamed possible.</p>
<p>The police were back again and clearing the jam while waiting
for reinforcements and new drivers and horses.&nbsp; The mob had
done its work and was scattering, and Catherine Van Vorst, still
watching, could see the man she had known as Freddie
Drummond.&nbsp; He towered a head above the crowd.&nbsp; His arm
was still about the woman.&nbsp; And she in the motor-car,
watching, saw the pair cross Market Street, cross the Slot, and
disappear down Third Street into the labour ghetto.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the years that followed no more lectures were given in the
University of California by one Freddie Drummond, and no more
books on economics and the labour question appeared over the name
of Frederick A. Drummond.&nbsp; On the other hand there arose a
new labour leader, William Totts by name.&nbsp; He it was who
married Mary Condon, President of the International Glove
Workers&rsquo; Union No. 974; and he it was who called the
notorious Cooks and Waiters&rsquo; Strike, which, before its
successful termination, brought out with it scores of other
unions, among which, of the more remotely allied, were the
Chicken Pickers and the Undertakers.</p>
<h2><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>THE
UNPARALLELED INVASION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the year 1976 that the
trouble between the world and China reached its
culmination.&nbsp; It was because of this that the celebration of
the Second Centennial of American Liberty was deferred.&nbsp;
Many other plans of the nations of the earth were twisted and
tangled and postponed for the same reason.&nbsp; The world awoke
rather abruptly to its danger; but for over seventy years,
unperceived, affairs had been shaping toward this very end.</p>
<p>The year 1904 logically marks the beginning of the development
that, seventy years later, was to bring consternation to the
whole world.&nbsp; The Japanese-Russian War took place in 1904,
and the historians of the time gravely noted it down that that
event marked the entrance of Japan into the comity of
nations.&nbsp; What it really did mark was the awakening of
China.&nbsp; This awakening, long expected, had finally been
given up.&nbsp; The Western nations had tried to arouse China,
and they had failed.&nbsp; Out of their native optimism and
race-egotism they had therefore concluded that the task was
impossible, that China would never awaken.</p>
<p>What they had failed to take into account was this: <i>that
between them and China was no common psychological
speech</i>.&nbsp; Their thought-processes were radically
dissimilar.&nbsp; There was no intimate vocabulary.&nbsp; The
Western mind penetrated the Chinese mind but a short distance
when it found itself in a fathomless maze.&nbsp; The Chinese mind
penetrated the Western mind an equally short distance when it
fetched up against a blank, incomprehensible wall.&nbsp; It was
all a matter of language.&nbsp; There was no way to communicate
Western ideas to the Chinese mind.&nbsp; China remained
asleep.&nbsp; The material achievement and progress of the West
was a closed book to her; nor could the West open the book.&nbsp;
Back and deep down on the tie-ribs of consciousness, in the mind,
say, of the English-speaking race, was a capacity to thrill to
short, Saxon words; back and deep down on the tie-ribs of
consciousness of the Chinese mind was a capacity to thrill to its
own hieroglyphics; but the Chinese mind could not thrill to
short, Saxon words; nor could the English-speaking mind thrill to
hieroglyphics.&nbsp; The fabrics of their minds were woven from
totally different stuffs.&nbsp; They were mental aliens.&nbsp;
And so it was that Western material achievement and progress made
no dent on the rounded sleep of China.</p>
<p>Came Japan and her victory over Russia in 1904.&nbsp; Now the
Japanese race was the freak and paradox among Eastern
peoples.&nbsp; In some strange way Japan was receptive to all the
West had to offer.&nbsp; Japan swiftly assimilated the Western
ideas, and digested them, and so capably applied them that she
suddenly burst forth, full-panoplied, a world-power.&nbsp; There
is no explaining this peculiar openness of Japan to the alien
culture of the West.&nbsp; As well might be explained any
biological sport in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Having decisively thrashed the great Russian Empire, Japan
promptly set about dreaming a colossal dream of empire for
herself.&nbsp; Korea she had made into a granary and a colony;
treaty privileges and vulpine diplomacy gave her the monopoly of
Manchuria.&nbsp; But Japan was not satisfied.&nbsp; She turned
her eyes upon China.&nbsp; There lay a vast territory, and in
that territory were the hugest deposits in the world of iron and
coal&mdash;the backbone of industrial civilization.&nbsp; Given
natural resources, the other great factor in industry is
labour.&nbsp; In that territory was a population of 400,000,000
souls&mdash;one quarter of the then total population of the
earth.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Chinese were excellent workers,
while their fatalistic philosophy (or religion) and their stolid
nervous organization constituted them splendid soldiers&mdash;if
they were properly managed.&nbsp; Needless to say, Japan was
prepared to furnish that management.</p>
<p>But best of all, from the standpoint of Japan, the Chinese was
a kindred race.&nbsp; The baffling enigma of the Chinese
character to the West was no baffling enigma to the
Japanese.&nbsp; The Japanese understood as we could never school
ourselves or hope to understand.&nbsp; Their mental processes
were the same.&nbsp; The Japanese thought with the same
thought-symbols as did the Chinese, and they thought in the same
peculiar grooves.&nbsp; Into the Chinese mind the Japanese went
on where we were balked by the obstacle of incomprehension.&nbsp;
They took the turning which we could not perceive, twisted around
the obstacle, and were out of sight in the ramifications of the
Chinese mind where we could not follow.&nbsp; They were
brothers.&nbsp; Long ago one had borrowed the other&rsquo;s
written language, and, untold generations before that, they had
diverged from the common Mongol stock.&nbsp; There had been
changes, differentiations brought about by diverse conditions and
infusions of other blood; but down at the bottom of their beings,
twisted into the fibres of them, was a heritage in common, a
sameness in kind that time had not obliterated.</p>
<p>And so Japan took upon herself the management of China.&nbsp;
In the years immediately following the war with Russia, her
agents swarmed over the Chinese Empire.&nbsp; A thousand miles
beyond the last mission station toiled her engineers and spies,
clad as coolies, under the guise of itinerant merchants or
proselytizing Buddhist priests, noting down the horse-power of
every waterfall, the likely sites for factories, the heights of
mountains and passes, the strategic advantages and weaknesses,
the wealth of the farming valleys, the number of bullocks in a
district or the number of labourers that could be collected by
forced levies.&nbsp; Never was there such a census, and it could
have been taken by no other people than the dogged, patient,
patriotic Japanese.</p>
<p>But in a short time secrecy was thrown to the winds.&nbsp;
Japan&rsquo;s officers reorganized the Chinese army; her drill
sergeants made the medi&aelig;val warriors over into twentieth
century soldiers, accustomed to all the modern machinery of war
and with a higher average of marksmanship than the soldiers of
any Western nation.&nbsp; The engineers of Japan deepened and
widened the intricate system of canals, built factories and
foundries, netted the empire with telegraphs and telephones, and
inaugurated the era of railroad-building.&nbsp; It was these same
protagonists of machine-civilization that discovered the great
oil deposits of Chunsan, the iron mountains of Whang-Sing, the
copper ranges of Chinchi, and they sank the gas wells of Wow-Wee,
that most marvellous reservoir of natural gas in all the
world.</p>
<p>In China&rsquo;s councils of empire were the Japanese
emissaries.&nbsp; In the ears of the statesmen whispered the
Japanese statesmen.&nbsp; The political reconstruction of the
Empire was due to them.&nbsp; They evicted the scholar class,
which was violently reactionary, and put into office progressive
officials.&nbsp; And in every town and city of the Empire
newspapers were started.&nbsp; Of course, Japanese editors ran
the policy of these papers, which policy they got direct from
Tokio.&nbsp; It was these papers that educated and made
progressive the great mass of the population.</p>
<p>China was at last awake.&nbsp; Where the West had failed,
Japan succeeded.&nbsp; She had transmuted Western culture and
achievement into terms that were intelligible to the Chinese
understanding.&nbsp; Japan herself, when she so suddenly
awakened, had astounded the world.&nbsp; But at the time she was
only forty millions strong.&nbsp; China&rsquo;s awakening, with
her four hundred millions and the scientific advance of the
world, was frightfully astounding.&nbsp; She was the colossus of
the nations, and swiftly her voice was heard in no uncertain
tones in the affairs and councils of the nations.&nbsp; Japan
egged her on, and the proud Western peoples listened with
respectful ears.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s swift and remarkable rise was due, perhaps more
than to anything else, to the superlative quality of her
labour.&nbsp; The Chinese was the perfect type of industry.&nbsp;
He had always been that.&nbsp; For sheer ability to work no
worker in the world could compare with him.&nbsp; Work was the
breath of his nostrils.&nbsp; It was to him what wandering and
fighting in far lands and spiritual adventure had been to other
peoples.&nbsp; Liberty, to him, epitomized itself in access to
the means of toil.&nbsp; To till the soil and labour interminably
was all he asked of life and the powers that be.&nbsp; And the
awakening of China had given its vast population not merely free
and unlimited access to the means of toil, but access to the
highest and most scientific machine-means of toil.</p>
<p>China rejuvenescent!&nbsp; It was but a step to China
rampant.&nbsp; She discovered a new pride in herself and a will
of her own.&nbsp; She began to chafe under the guidance of Japan,
but she did not chafe long.&nbsp; On Japan&rsquo;s advice, in the
beginning, she had expelled from the Empire all Western
missionaries, engineers, drill sergeants, merchants, and
teachers.&nbsp; She now began to expel the similar
representatives of Japan.&nbsp; The latter&rsquo;s advisory
statesmen were showered with honours and decorations, and sent
home.&nbsp; The West had awakened Japan, and, as Japan had then
requited the West, Japan was not requited by China.&nbsp; Japan
was thanked for her kindly aid and flung out bag and baggage by
her gigantic prot&eacute;g&eacute;.&nbsp; The Western nations
chuckled.&nbsp; Japan&rsquo;s rainbow dream had gone
glimmering.&nbsp; She grew angry.&nbsp; China laughed at
her.&nbsp; The blood and the swords of the Samurai would out, and
Japan rashly went to war.&nbsp; This occurred in 1922, and in
seven bloody months Manchuria, Korea, and Formosa were taken away
from her and she was hurled back, bankrupt, to stifle in her
tiny, crowded islands.&nbsp; Exit Japan from the world
drama.&nbsp; Thereafter she devoted herself to art, and her task
became to please the world greatly with her creations of wonder
and beauty.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectation, China did not prove warlike.&nbsp;
She had no Napoleonic dream, and was content to devote herself to
the arts of peace.&nbsp; After a time of disquiet, the idea was
accepted that China was to be feared, not in war, but in
commerce.&nbsp; It will be seen that the real danger was not
apprehended.&nbsp; China went on consummating her
machine-civilization.&nbsp; Instead of a large standing army, she
developed an immensely larger and splendidly efficient
militia.&nbsp; Her navy was so small that it was the laughing
stock of the world; nor did she attempt to strengthen her
navy.&nbsp; The treaty ports of the world were never entered by
her visiting battleships.</p>
<p>The real danger lay in the fecundity of her loins, and it was
in 1970 that the first cry of alarm was raised.&nbsp; For some
time all territories adjacent to China had been grumbling at
Chinese immigration; but now it suddenly came home to the world
that China&rsquo;s population was 500,000,000.&nbsp; She had
increased by a hundred millions since her awakening.&nbsp;
Burchaldter called attention to the fact that there were more
Chinese in existence than white-skinned people.&nbsp; He
performed a simple sum in arithmetic.&nbsp; He added together the
populations of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia,
South Africa, England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, European
Russia, and all Scandinavia.&nbsp; The result was
495,000,000.&nbsp; And the population of China overtopped this
tremendous total by 5,000,000.&nbsp; Burchaldter&rsquo;s figures
went round the world, and the world shivered.</p>
<p>For many centuries China&rsquo;s population had been
constant.&nbsp; Her territory had been saturated with population;
that is to say, her territory, with the primitive method of
production, had supported the maximum limit of population.&nbsp;
But when she awoke and inaugurated the machine-civilization, her
productive power had been enormously increased.&nbsp; Thus, on
the same territory, she was able to support a far larger
population.&nbsp; At once the birth rate began to rise and the
death rate to fall.&nbsp; Before, when population pressed against
the means of subsistence, the excess population had been swept
away by famine.&nbsp; But now, thanks to the
machine-civilization, China&rsquo;s means of subsistence had been
enormously extended, and there were no famines; her population
followed on the heels of the increase in the means of
subsistence.</p>
<p>During this time of transition and development of power, China
had entertained no dreams of conquest.&nbsp; The Chinese was not
an imperial race.&nbsp; It was industrious, thrifty, and
peace-loving.&nbsp; War was looked upon as an unpleasant but
necessary task that at times must be performed.&nbsp; And so,
while the Western races had squabbled and fought, and
world-adventured against one another, China had calmly gone on
working at her machines and growing.&nbsp; Now she was spilling
over the boundaries of her Empire&mdash;that was all, just
spilling over into the adjacent territories with all the
certainty and terrifying slow momentum of a glacier.</p>
<p>Following upon the alarm raised by Burchaldter&rsquo;s
figures, in 1970 France made a long-threatened stand.&nbsp;
French Indo-China had been overrun, filled up, by Chinese
immigrants.&nbsp; France called a halt.&nbsp; The Chinese wave
flowed on.&nbsp; France assembled a force of a hundred thousand
on the boundary between her unfortunate colony and China, and
China sent down an army of militia-soldiers a million
strong.&nbsp; Behind came the wives and sons and daughters and
relatives, with their personal household luggage, in a second
army.&nbsp; The French force was brushed aside like a fly.&nbsp;
The Chinese militia-soldiers, along with their families, over
five millions all told, coolly took possession of French
Indo-China and settled down to stay for a few thousand years.</p>
<p>Outraged France was in arms.&nbsp; She hurled fleet after
fleet against the coast of China, and nearly bankrupted herself
by the effort.&nbsp; China had no navy.&nbsp; She withdrew like a
turtle into her shell.&nbsp; For a year the French fleets
blockaded the coast and bombarded exposed towns and
villages.&nbsp; China did not mind.&nbsp; She did not depend upon
the rest of the world for anything.&nbsp; She calmly kept out of
range of the French guns and went on working.&nbsp; France wept
and wailed, wrung her impotent hands and appealed to the
dumfounded nations.&nbsp; Then she landed a punitive expedition
to march to Peking.&nbsp; It was two hundred and fifty thousand
strong, and it was the flower of France.&nbsp; It landed without
opposition and marched into the interior.&nbsp; And that was the
last ever seen of it.&nbsp; The line of communication was snapped
on the second day.&nbsp; Not a survivor came back to tell what
had happened.&nbsp; It had been swallowed up in China&rsquo;s
cavernous maw, that was all.</p>
<p>In the five years that followed, China&rsquo;s expansion, in
all land directions, went on apace.&nbsp; Siam was made part of
the Empire, and, in spite of all that England could do, Burma and
the Malay Peninsula were overrun; while all along the long south
boundary of Siberia, Russia was pressed severely by China&rsquo;s
advancing hordes.&nbsp; The process was simple.&nbsp; First came
the Chinese immigration (or, rather, it was already there, having
come there slowly and insidiously during the previous
years).&nbsp; Next came the clash of arms and the brushing away
of all opposition by a monster army of militia-soldiers, followed
by their families and household baggage.&nbsp; And finally came
their settling down as colonists in the conquered
territory.&nbsp; Never was there so strange and effective a
method of world conquest.</p>
<p>Napal and Bhutan were overrun, and the whole northern boundary
of India pressed against by this fearful tide of life.&nbsp; To
the west, Bokhara, and, even to the south and west, Afghanistan,
were swallowed up.&nbsp; Persia, Turkestan, and all Central Asia
felt the pressure of the flood.&nbsp; It was at this time that
Burchaldter revised his figures.&nbsp; He had been
mistaken.&nbsp; China&rsquo;s population must be seven hundred
millions, eight hundred millions, nobody knew how many millions,
but at any rate it would soon be a billion.&nbsp; There were two
Chinese for every white-skinned human in the world, Burchaldter
announced, and the world trembled.&nbsp; China&rsquo;s increase
must have begun immediately, in 1904.&nbsp; It was remembered
that since that date there had not been a single famine.&nbsp; At
5,000,000 a year increase, her total increase in the intervening
seventy years must be 350,000,000.&nbsp; But who was to
know?&nbsp; It might be more.&nbsp; Who was to know anything of
this strange new menace of the twentieth century&mdash;China, old
China, rejuvenescent, fruitful, and militant!</p>
<p>The Convention of 1975 was called at Philadelphia.&nbsp; All
the Western nations, and some few of the Eastern, were
represented.&nbsp; Nothing was accomplished.&nbsp; There was talk
of all countries putting bounties on children to increase the
birth rate, but it was laughed to scorn by the arithmeticians,
who pointed out that China was too far in the lead in that
direction.&nbsp; No feasible way of coping with China was
suggested.&nbsp; China was appealed to and threatened by the
United Powers, and that was all the Convention of Philadelphia
came to; and the Convention and the Powers were laughed at by
China.&nbsp; Li Tang Fwung, the power behind the Dragon Throne,
deigned to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does China care for the comity of nations?&rdquo;
said Li Tang Fwung.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are the most ancient,
honourable, and royal of races.&nbsp; We have our own destiny to
accomplish.&nbsp; It is unpleasant that our destiny does not
tally with the destiny of the rest of the world, but what would
you?&nbsp; You have talked windily about the royal races and the
heritage of the earth, and we can only reply that that remains to
be seen.&nbsp; You cannot invade us.&nbsp; Never mind about your
navies.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t shout.&nbsp; We know our navy is
small.&nbsp; You see we use it for police purposes.&nbsp; We do
not care for the sea.&nbsp; Our strength is in our population,
which will soon be a billion.&nbsp; Thanks to you, we are
equipped with all modern war-machinery.&nbsp; Send your
navies.&nbsp; We will not notice them.&nbsp; Send your punitive
expeditions, but first remember France.&nbsp; To land half a
million soldiers on our shores would strain the resources of any
of you.&nbsp; And our thousand millions would swallow them down
in a mouthful.&nbsp; Send a million; send five millions, and we
will swallow them down just as readily.&nbsp; Pouf!&nbsp; A mere
nothing, a meagre morsel.&nbsp; Destroy, as you have threatened,
you United States, the ten million coolies we have forced upon
your shores&mdash;why, the amount scarcely equals half of our
excess birth rate for a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spoke Li Tang Fwung.&nbsp; The world was nonplussed,
helpless, terrified.&nbsp; Truly had he spoken.&nbsp; There was
no combating China&rsquo;s amazing birth rate.&nbsp; If her
population was a billion, and was increasing twenty millions a
year, in twenty-five years it would be a billion and a
half&mdash;equal to the total population of the world in
1904.&nbsp; And nothing could be done.&nbsp; There was no way to
dam up the over-spilling monstrous flood of life.&nbsp; War was
futile.&nbsp; China laughed at a blockade of her coasts.&nbsp;
She welcomed invasion.&nbsp; In her capacious maw was room for
all the hosts of earth that could be hurled at her.&nbsp; And in
the meantime her flood of yellow life poured out and on over
Asia.&nbsp; China laughed and read in their magazines the learned
lucubrations of the distracted Western scholars.</p>
<p>But there was one scholar China failed to reckon
on&mdash;Jacobus Laningdale.&nbsp; Not that he was a scholar,
except in the widest sense.&nbsp; Primarily, Jacobus Laningdale
was a scientist, and, up to that time, a very obscure scientist,
a professor employed in the laboratories of the Health Office of
New York City.&nbsp; Jacobus Laningdale&rsquo;s head was very
like any other head, but in that head was evolved an idea.&nbsp;
Also, in that head was the wisdom to keep that idea secret.&nbsp;
He did not write an article for the magazines.&nbsp; Instead, he
asked for a vacation.&nbsp; On September 19, 1975, he arrived in
Washington.&nbsp; It was evening, but he proceeded straight to
the White House, for he had already arranged an audience with the
President.&nbsp; He was closeted with President Moyer for three
hours.&nbsp; What passed between them was not learned by the rest
of the world until long after; in fact, at that time the world
was not interested in Jacobus Laningdale.&nbsp; Next day the
President called in his Cabinet.&nbsp; Jacobus Laningdale was
present.&nbsp; The proceedings were kept secret.&nbsp; But that
very afternoon Rufus Cowdery, Secretary of State, left
Washington, and early the following morning sailed for
England.&nbsp; The secret that he carried began to spread, but it
spread only among the heads of Governments.&nbsp; Possibly
half-a-dozen men in a nation were entrusted with the idea that
had formed in Jacobus Laningdale&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Following
the spread of the secret, sprang up great activity in all the
dockyards, arsenals, and navy-yards.&nbsp; The people of France
and Austria became suspicious, but so sincere were their
Governments&rsquo; calls for confidence that they acquiesced in
the unknown project that was afoot.</p>
<p>This was the time of the Great Truce.&nbsp; All countries
pledged themselves solemnly not to go to war with any other
country.&nbsp; The first definite action was the gradual
mobilization of the armies of Russia, Germany, Austria, Italy,
Greece, and Turkey.&nbsp; Then began the eastward movement.&nbsp;
All railroads into Asia were glutted with troop trains.&nbsp;
China was the objective, that was all that was known.&nbsp; A
little later began the great sea movement.&nbsp; Expeditions of
warships were launched from all countries.&nbsp; Fleet followed
fleet, and all proceeded to the coast of China.&nbsp; The nations
cleaned out their navy-yards.&nbsp; They sent their revenue
cutters and dispatch boats and lighthouse tenders, and they sent
their last antiquated cruisers and battleships.&nbsp; Not content
with this, they impressed the merchant marine.&nbsp; The
statistics show that 58,640 merchant steamers, equipped with
searchlights and rapid-fire guns, were despatched by the various
nations to China.</p>
<p>And China smiled and waited.&nbsp; On her land side, along her
boundaries, were millions of the warriors of Europe.&nbsp; She
mobilized five times as many millions of her militia and awaited
the invasion.&nbsp; On her sea coasts she did the same.&nbsp; But
China was puzzled.&nbsp; After all this enormous preparation,
there was no invasion.&nbsp; She could not understand.&nbsp;
Along the great Siberian frontier all was quiet.&nbsp; Along her
coasts the towns and villages were not even shelled.&nbsp; Never,
in the history of the world, had there been so mighty a gathering
of war fleets.&nbsp; The fleets of all the world were there, and
day and night millions of tons of battleships ploughed the brine
of her coasts, and nothing happened.&nbsp; Nothing was
attempted.&nbsp; Did they think to make her emerge from her
shell?&nbsp; China smiled.&nbsp; Did they think to tire her out,
or starve her out?&nbsp; China smiled again.</p>
<p>But on May 1, 1976, had the reader been in the imperial city
of Peking, with its then population of eleven millions, he would
have witnessed a curious sight.&nbsp; He would have seen the
streets filled with the chattering yellow populace, every queued
head tilted back, every slant eye turned skyward.&nbsp; And high
up in the blue he would have beheld a tiny dot of black, which,
because of its orderly evolutions, he would have identified as an
airship.&nbsp; From this airship, as it curved its flight back
and forth over the city, fell missiles&mdash;strange, harmless
missiles, tubes of fragile glass that shattered into thousands of
fragments on the streets and house-tops.&nbsp; But there was
nothing deadly about these tubes of glass.&nbsp; Nothing
happened.&nbsp; There were no explosions.&nbsp; It is true, three
Chinese were killed by the tubes dropping on their heads from so
enormous a height; but what were three Chinese against an excess
birth rate of twenty millions?&nbsp; One tube struck
perpendicularly in a fish-pond in a garden and was not
broken.&nbsp; It was dragged ashore by the master of the
house.&nbsp; He did not dare to open it, but, accompanied by his
friends, and surrounded by an ever-increasing crowd, he carried
the mysterious tube to the magistrate of the district.&nbsp; The
latter was a brave man.&nbsp; With all eyes upon him, he
shattered the tube with a blow from his brass-bowled pipe.&nbsp;
Nothing happened.&nbsp; Of those who were very near, one or two
thought they saw some mosquitoes fly out.&nbsp; That was
all.&nbsp; The crowd set up a great laugh and dispersed.</p>
<p>As Peking was bombarded by glass tubes, so was all
China.&nbsp; The tiny airships, dispatched from the warships,
contained but two men each, and over all cities, towns, and
villages they wheeled and curved, one man directing the ship, the
other man throwing over the glass tubes.</p>
<p>Had the reader again been in Peking, six weeks later, he would
have looked in vain for the eleven million inhabitants.&nbsp;
Some few of them he would have found, a few hundred thousand,
perhaps, their carcasses festering in the houses and in the
deserted streets, and piled high on the abandoned
death-waggons.&nbsp; But for the rest he would have had to seek
along the highways and byways of the Empire.&nbsp; And not all
would he have found fleeing from plague-stricken Peking, for
behind them, by hundreds of thousands of unburied corpses by the
wayside, he could have marked their flight.&nbsp; And as it was
with Peking, so it was with all the cities, towns, and villages
of the Empire.&nbsp; The plague smote them all.&nbsp; Nor was it
one plague, nor two plagues; it was a score of plagues.&nbsp;
Every virulent form of infectious death stalked through the
land.&nbsp; Too late the Chinese government apprehended the
meaning of the colossal preparations, the marshalling of the
world-hosts, the flights of the tin airships, and the rain of the
tubes of glass.&nbsp; The proclamations of the government were
vain.&nbsp; They could not stop the eleven million
plague-stricken wretches, fleeing from the one city of Peking to
spread disease through all the land.&nbsp; The physicians and
health officers died at their posts; and death, the
all-conqueror, rode over the decrees of the Emperor and Li Tang
Fwung.&nbsp; It rode over them as well, for Li Tang Fwung died in
the second week, and the Emperor, hidden away in the Summer
Palace, died in the fourth week.</p>
<p>Had there been one plague, China might have coped with
it.&nbsp; But from a score of plagues no creature was
immune.&nbsp; The man who escaped smallpox went down before
scarlet fever.&nbsp; The man who was immune to yellow fever was
carried away by cholera; and if he were immune to that, too, the
Black Death, which was the bubonic plague, swept him away.&nbsp;
For it was these bacteria, and germs, and microbes, and bacilli,
cultured in the laboratories of the West, that had come down upon
China in the rain of glass.</p>
<p>All organization vanished.&nbsp; The government crumbled
away.&nbsp; Decrees and proclamations were useless when the men
who made them and signed them one moment were dead the
next.&nbsp; Nor could the maddened millions, spurred on to flight
by death, pause to heed anything.&nbsp; They fled from the cities
to infect the country, and wherever they fled they carried the
plagues with them.&nbsp; The hot summer was on&mdash;Jacobus
Laningdale had selected the time shrewdly&mdash;and the plague
festered everywhere.&nbsp; Much is conjectured of what occurred,
and much has been learned from the stories of the few
survivors.&nbsp; The wretched creatures stormed across the Empire
in many-millioned flight.&nbsp; The vast armies China had
collected on her frontiers melted away.&nbsp; The farms were
ravaged for food, and no more crops were planted, while the crops
already in were left unattended and never came to harvest.&nbsp;
The most remarkable thing, perhaps, was the flights.&nbsp; Many
millions engaged in them, charging to the bounds of the Empire to
be met and turned back by the gigantic armies of the West.&nbsp;
The slaughter of the mad hosts on the boundaries was
stupendous.&nbsp; Time and again the guarding line was drawn back
twenty or thirty miles to escape the contagion of the
multitudinous dead.</p>
<p>Once the plague broke through and seized upon the German and
Austrian soldiers who were guarding the borders of
Turkestan.&nbsp; Preparations had been made for such a happening,
and though sixty thousand soldiers of Europe were carried off,
the international corps of physicians isolated the contagion and
dammed it back.&nbsp; It was during this struggle that it was
suggested that a new plague-germ had originated, that in some way
or other a sort of hybridization between plague-germs had taken
place, producing a new and frightfully virulent germ.&nbsp; First
suspected by Vomberg, who became infected with it and died, it
was later isolated and studied by Stevens, Hazenfelt, Norman, and
Landers.</p>
<p>Such was the unparalleled invasion of China.&nbsp; For that
billion of people there was no hope.&nbsp; Pent in their vast and
festering charnel-house, all organization and cohesion lost, they
could do naught but die.&nbsp; They could not escape.&nbsp; As
they were flung back from their land frontiers, so were they
flung back from the sea.&nbsp; Seventy-five thousand vessels
patrolled the coasts.&nbsp; By day their smoking funnels dimmed
the sea-rim, and by night their flashing searchlights ploughed
the dark and harrowed it for the tiniest escaping junk.&nbsp; The
attempts of the immense fleets of junks were pitiful.&nbsp; Not
one ever got by the guarding sea-hounds.&nbsp; Modern
war-machinery held back the disorganized mass of China, while the
plagues did the work.</p>
<p>But old War was made a thing of laughter.&nbsp; Naught
remained to him but patrol duty.&nbsp; China had laughed at war,
and war she was getting, but it was ultra-modern war, twentieth
century war, the war of the scientist and the laboratory, the war
of Jacobus Laningdale.&nbsp; Hundred-ton guns were toys compared
with the micro-organic projectiles hurled from the laboratories,
the messengers of death, the destroying angels that stalked
through the empire of a billion souls.</p>
<p>During all the summer and fall of 1976 China was an
inferno.&nbsp; There was no eluding the microscopic projectiles
that sought out the remotest hiding-places.&nbsp; The hundreds of
millions of dead remained unburied and the germs multiplied
themselves, and, toward the last, millions died daily of
starvation.&nbsp; Besides, starvation weakened the victims and
destroyed their natural defences against the plagues.&nbsp;
Cannibalism, murder, and madness reigned.&nbsp; And so perished
China.</p>
<p>Not until the following February, in the coldest weather, were
the first expeditions made.&nbsp; These expeditions were small,
composed of scientists and bodies of troops; but they entered
China from every side.&nbsp; In spite of the most elaborate
precautions against infection, numbers of soldiers and a few of
the physicians were stricken.&nbsp; But the exploration went
bravely on.&nbsp; They found China devastated, a howling
wilderness through which wandered bands of wild dogs and
desperate bandits who had survived.&nbsp; All survivors were put
to death wherever found.&nbsp; And then began the great task, the
sanitation of China.&nbsp; Five years and hundreds of millions of
treasure were consumed, and then the world moved in&mdash;not in
zones, as was the idea of Baron Albrecht, but heterogeneously,
according to the democratic American programme.&nbsp; It was a
vast and happy intermingling of nationalities that settled down
in China in 1982 and the years that followed&mdash;a tremendous
and successful experiment in cross-fertilization.&nbsp; We know
to-day the splendid mechanical, intellectual, and art output that
followed.</p>
<p>It was in 1987, the Great Truce having been dissolved, that
the ancient quarrel between France and Germany over
Alsace-Lorraine recrudesced.&nbsp; The war-cloud grew dark and
threatening in April, and on April 17 the Convention of
Copenhagen was called.&nbsp; The representatives of the nations
of the world, being present, all nations solemnly pledged
themselves never to use against one another the laboratory
methods of warfare they had employed in the invasion of
China.</p>
<p>&mdash;Excerpt from Walt Mervin&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Certain
Essays in History</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>THE
ENEMY OF ALL THE WORLD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Silas Bannerman who finally
ran down that scientific wizard and arch-enemy of mankind, Emil
Gluck.&nbsp; Gluck&rsquo;s confession, before he went to the
electric chair, threw much light upon the series of mysterious
events, many apparently unrelated, that so perturbed the world
between the years 1933 and 1941.&nbsp; It was not until that
remarkable document was made public that the world dreamed of
there being any connection between the assassination of the King
and Queen of Portugal and the murders of the New York City police
officers.&nbsp; While the deeds of Emil Gluck were all that was
abominable, we cannot but feel, to a certain extent, pity for the
unfortunate, malformed, and maltreated genius.&nbsp; This side of
his story has never been told before, and from his confession and
from the great mass of evidence and the documents and records of
the time we are able to construct a fairly accurate portrait of
him, and to discern the factors and pressures that moulded him
into the human monster he became and that drove him onward and
downward along the fearful path he trod.</p>
<p>Emil Gluck was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1895.&nbsp; His
father, Josephus Gluck, was a special policeman and night
watchman, who, in the year 1900, died suddenly of
pneumonia.&nbsp; The mother, a pretty, fragile creature, who,
before her marriage, had been a milliner, grieved herself to
death over the loss of her husband.&nbsp; This sensitiveness of
the mother was the heritage that in the boy became morbid and
horrible.</p>
<p>In 1901, the boy, Emil, then six years of age, went to live
with his aunt, Mrs. Ann Bartell.&nbsp; She was his mother&rsquo;s
sister, but in her breast was no kindly feeling for the
sensitive, shrinking boy.&nbsp; Ann Bartell was a vain, shallow,
and heartless woman.&nbsp; Also, she was cursed with poverty and
burdened with a husband who was a lazy, erratic
ne&rsquo;er-do-well.&nbsp; Young Emil Gluck was not wanted, and
Ann Bartell could be trusted to impress this fact sufficiently
upon him.&nbsp; As an illustration of the treatment he received
in that early, formative period, the following instance is
given.</p>
<p>When he had been living in the Bartell home a little more than
a year, he broke his leg.&nbsp; He sustained the injury through
playing on the forbidden roof&mdash;as all boys have done and
will continue to do to the end of time.&nbsp; The leg was broken
in two places between the knee and thigh.&nbsp; Emil, helped by
his frightened playmates, managed to drag himself to the front
sidewalk, where he fainted.&nbsp; The children of the
neighbourhood were afraid of the hard-featured shrew who presided
over the Bartell house; but, summoning their resolution, they
rang the bell and told Ann Bartell of the accident.&nbsp; She did
not even look at the little lad who lay stricken on the sidewalk,
but slammed the door and went back to her wash-tub.&nbsp; The
time passed.&nbsp; A drizzle came on, and Emil Gluck, out of his
faint, lay sobbing in the rain.&nbsp; The leg should have been
set immediately.&nbsp; As it was, the inflammation rose rapidly
and made a nasty case of it.&nbsp; At the end of two hours, the
indignant women of the neighbourhood protested to Ann
Bartell.&nbsp; This time she came out and looked at the
lad.&nbsp; Also she kicked him in the side as he lay helpless at
her feet, and she hysterically disowned him.&nbsp; He was not her
child, she said, and recommended that the ambulance be called to
take him to the city receiving hospital.&nbsp; Then she went back
into the house.</p>
<p>It was a woman, Elizabeth Shepstone, who came along, learned
the situation, and had the boy placed on a shutter.&nbsp; It was
she who called the doctor, and who, brushing aside Ann Bartell,
had the boy carried into the house.&nbsp; When the doctor
arrived, Ann Bartell promptly warned him that she would not pay
him for his services.&nbsp; For two months the little Emil lay in
bed, the first month on his back without once being turned over;
and he lay neglected and alone, save for the occasional visits of
the unremunerated and over-worked physician.&nbsp; He had no
toys, nothing with which to beguile the long and tedious
hours.&nbsp; No kind word was spoken to him, no soothing hand
laid upon his brow, no single touch or act of loving
tenderness&mdash;naught but the reproaches and harshness of Ann
Bartell, and the continually reiterated information that he was
not wanted.&nbsp; And it can well be understood, in such
environment, how there was generated in the lonely, neglected boy
much of the bitterness and hostility for his kind that later was
to express itself in deeds so frightful as to terrify the
world.</p>
<p>It would seem strange that, from the hands of Ann Bartell,
Emil Gluck should have received a college education; but the
explanation is simple.&nbsp; Her ne&rsquo;er-do-well husband,
deserting her, made a strike in the Nevada goldfields, and
returned to her a many-times millionaire.&nbsp; Ann Bartell hated
the boy, and immediately she sent him to the Farristown Academy,
a hundred miles away.&nbsp; Shy and sensitive, a lonely and
misunderstood little soul, he was more lonely than ever at
Farristown.&nbsp; He never came home, at vacation, and holidays,
as the other boys did.&nbsp; Instead, he wandered about the
deserted buildings and grounds, befriended and misunderstood by
the servants and gardeners, reading much, it is remembered,
spending his days in the fields or before the fire-place with his
nose poked always in the pages of some book.&nbsp; It was at this
time that he over-used his eyes and was compelled to take up the
wearing of glasses, which same were so prominent in the
photographs of him published in the newspapers in 1941.</p>
<p>He was a remarkable student.&nbsp; Application such as his
would have taken him far; but he did not need application.&nbsp;
A glance at a text meant mastery for him.&nbsp; The result was
that he did an immense amount of collateral reading and acquired
more in half a year than did the average student in half-a-dozen
years.&nbsp; In 1909, barely fourteen years of age, he was
ready&mdash;&ldquo;more than ready&rdquo; the headmaster of the
academy said&mdash;to enter Yale or Harvard.&nbsp; His juvenility
prevented him from entering those universities, and so, in 1909,
we find him a freshman at historic Bowdoin College.&nbsp; In 1913
he graduated with highest honours, and immediately afterward
followed Professor Bradlough to Berkeley, California.&nbsp; The
one friend that Emil Gluck discovered in all his life was
Professor Bradlough.&nbsp; The latter&rsquo;s weak lungs had led
him to exchange Maine for California, the removal being
facilitated by the offer of a professorship in the State
University.&nbsp; Throughout the year 1914, Emil Gluck resided in
Berkeley and took special scientific courses.&nbsp; Toward the
end of that year two deaths changed his prospects and his
relations with life.&nbsp; The death of Professor Bradlough took
from him the one friend he was ever to know, and the death of Ann
Bartell left him penniless.&nbsp; Hating the unfortunate lad to
the last, she cut him off with one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>The following year, at twenty years of age, Emil Gluck was
enrolled as an instructor of chemistry in the University of
California.&nbsp; Here the years passed quietly; he faithfully
performed the drudgery that brought him his salary, and, a
student always, he took half-a-dozen degrees.&nbsp; He was, among
other things, a Doctor of Sociology, of Philosophy, and of
Science, though he was known to the world, in later days, only as
Professor Gluck.</p>
<p>He was twenty-seven years old when he first sprang into
prominence in the newspapers through the publication of his book,
<i>Sex and Progress</i>.&nbsp; The book remains to-day a
milestone in the history and philosophy of marriage.&nbsp; It is
a heavy tome of over seven hundred pages, painfully careful and
accurate, and startlingly original.&nbsp; It was a book for
scientists, and not one calculated to make a stir.&nbsp; But
Gluck, in the last chapter, using barely three lines for it,
mentioned the hypothetical desirability of trial marriages.&nbsp;
At once the newspapers seized these three lines, &ldquo;played
them up yellow,&rdquo; as the slang was in those days, and set
the whole world laughing at Emil Gluck, the bespectacled young
professor of twenty-seven.&nbsp; Photographers snapped him, he
was besieged by reporters, women&rsquo;s clubs throughout the
land passed resolutions condemning him and his immoral theories;
and on the floor of the California Assembly, while discussing the
state appropriation to the University, a motion demanding the
expulsion of Gluck was made under threat of withholding the
appropriation&mdash;of course, none of his persecutors had read
the book; the twisted newspaper version of only three lines of it
was enough for them.&nbsp; Here began Emil Gluck&rsquo;s hatred
for newspaper men.&nbsp; By them his serious and intrinsically
valuable work of six years had been made a laughing-stock and a
notoriety.&nbsp; To his dying day, and to their everlasting
regret, he never forgave them.</p>
<p>It was the newspapers that were responsible for the next
disaster that befell him.&nbsp; For the five years following the
publication of his book he had remained silent, and silence for a
lonely man is not good.&nbsp; One can conjecture sympathetically
the awful solitude of Emil Gluck in that populous University; for
he was without friends and without sympathy.&nbsp; His only
recourse was books, and he went on reading and studying
enormously.&nbsp; But in 1927 he accepted an invitation to appear
before the Human Interest Society of Emeryville.&nbsp; He did not
trust himself to speak, and as we write we have before us a copy
of his learned paper.&nbsp; It is sober, scholarly, and
scientific, and, it must also be added, conservative.&nbsp; But
in one place he dealt with, and I quote his words, &ldquo;the
industrial and social revolution that is taking place in
society.&rdquo;&nbsp; A reporter present seized upon the word
&ldquo;revolution,&rdquo; divorced it from the text, and wrote a
garbled account that made Emil Gluck appear an anarchist.&nbsp;
At once, &ldquo;Professor Gluck, anarchist,&rdquo; flamed over
the wires and was appropriately &ldquo;featured&rdquo; in all the
newspapers in the land.</p>
<p>He had attempted to reply to the previous newspaper attack,
but now he remained silent.&nbsp; Bitterness had already corroded
his soul.&nbsp; The University faculty appealed to him to defend
himself, but he sullenly declined, even refusing to enter in
defence a copy of his paper to save himself from expulsion.&nbsp;
He refused to resign, and was discharged from the University
faculty.&nbsp; It must be added that political pressure had been
put upon the University Regents and the President.</p>
<p>Persecuted, maligned, and misunderstood, the forlorn and
lonely man made no attempt at retaliation.&nbsp; All his life he
had been sinned against, and all his life he had sinned against
no one.&nbsp; But his cup of bitterness was not yet full to
overflowing.&nbsp; Having lost his position, and being without
any income, he had to find work.&nbsp; His first place was at the
Union Iron Works, in San Francisco, where he proved a most able
draughtsman.&nbsp; It was here that he obtained his firsthand
knowledge of battleships and their construction.&nbsp; But the
reporters discovered him and featured him in his new
vocation.&nbsp; He immediately resigned and found another place;
but after the reporters had driven him away from half-a-dozen
positions, he steeled himself to brazen out the newspaper
persecution.&nbsp; This occurred when he started his
electroplating establishment&mdash;in Oakland, on Telegraph
Avenue.&nbsp; It was a small shop, employing three men and two
boys.&nbsp; Gluck himself worked long hours.&nbsp; Night after
night, as Policeman Carew testified on the stand, he did not
leave the shop till one and two in the morning.&nbsp; It was
during this period that he perfected the improved ignition device
for gas-engines, the royalties from which ultimately made him
wealthy.</p>
<p>He started his electroplating establishment early in the
spring of 1928, and it was in the same year that he formed the
disastrous love attachment for Irene Tackley.&nbsp; Now it is not
to be imagined that an extraordinary creature such as Emil Gluck
could be any other than an extraordinary lover.&nbsp; In addition
to his genius, his loneliness, and his morbidness, it must be
taken into consideration that he knew nothing about women.&nbsp;
Whatever tides of desire flooded his being, he was unschooled in
the conventional expression of them; while his excessive timidity
was bound to make his love-making unusual.&nbsp; Irene Tackley
was a rather pretty young woman, but shallow and
light-headed.&nbsp; At the time she worked in a small candy store
across the street from Gluck&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; He used to come
in and drink ice-cream sodas and lemon-squashes, and stare at
her.&nbsp; It seems the girl did not care for him, and merely
played with him.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;queer,&rdquo; she said; and
at another time she called him a crank when describing how he sat
at the counter and peered at her through his spectacles, blushing
and stammering when she took notice of him, and often leaving the
shop in precipitate confusion.</p>
<p>Gluck made her the most amazing presents&mdash;a silver
tea-service, a diamond ring, a set of furs, opera-glasses, a
ponderous <i>History of the World</i> in many volumes, and a
motor-cycle all silver-plated in his own shop.&nbsp; Enters now
the girl&rsquo;s lover, putting his foot down, showing great
anger, compelling her to return Gluck&rsquo;s strange assortment
of presents.&nbsp; This man, William Sherbourne, was a gross and
stolid creature, a heavy-jawed man of the working class who had
become a successful building-contractor in a small way.&nbsp;
Gluck did not understand.&nbsp; He tried to get an explanation,
attempting to speak with the girl when she went home from work in
the evening.&nbsp; She complained to Sherbourne, and one night he
gave Gluck a beating.&nbsp; It was a very severe beating, for it
is on the records of the Red Cross Emergency Hospital that Gluck
was treated there that night and was unable to leave the hospital
for a week.</p>
<p>Still Gluck did not understand.&nbsp; He continued to seek an
explanation from the girl.&nbsp; In fear of Sherbourne, he
applied to the Chief of Police for permission to carry a
revolver, which permission was refused, the newspapers as usual
playing it up sensationally.&nbsp; Then came the murder of Irene
Tackley, six days before her contemplated marriage with
Sherbourne.&nbsp; It was on a Saturday night.&nbsp; She had
worked late in the candy store, departing after eleven
o&rsquo;clock with her week&rsquo;s wages in her purse.&nbsp; She
rode on a San Pablo Avenue surface car to Thirty-fourth Street,
where she alighted and started to walk the three blocks to her
home.&nbsp; That was the last seen of her alive.&nbsp; Next
morning she was found, strangled, in a vacant lot.</p>
<p>Emil Gluck was immediately arrested.&nbsp; Nothing that he
could do could save him.&nbsp; He was convicted, not merely on
circumstantial evidence, but on evidence &ldquo;cooked up&rdquo;
by the Oakland police.&nbsp; There is no discussion but that a
large portion of the evidence was manufactured.&nbsp; The
testimony of Captain Shehan was the sheerest perjury, it being
proved long afterward that on the night in question he had not
only not been in the vicinity of the murder, but that he had been
out of the city in a resort on the San Leandro Road.&nbsp; The
unfortunate Gluck received life imprisonment in San Quentin,
while the newspapers and the public held that it was a
miscarriage of justice&mdash;that the death penalty should have
been visited upon him.</p>
<p>Gluck entered San Quentin prison on April 17, 1929.&nbsp; He
was then thirty-four years of age.&nbsp; And for three years and
a half, much of the time in solitary confinement, he was left to
meditate upon the injustice of man.&nbsp; It was during that
period that his bitterness corroded home and he became a hater of
all his kind.&nbsp; Three other things he did during the same
period: he wrote his famous treatise, <i>Human Morals</i>, his
remarkable brochure, <i>The Criminal Sane</i>, and he worked out
his awful and monstrous scheme of revenge.&nbsp; It was an
episode that had occurred in his electroplating establishment
that suggested to him his unique weapon of revenge.&nbsp; As
stated in his confession, he worked every detail out
theoretically during his imprisonment, and was able, on his
release, immediately to embark on his career of vengeance.</p>
<p>His release was sensational.&nbsp; Also it was miserably and
criminally delayed by the soulless legal red tape then in
vogue.&nbsp; On the night of February 1, 1932, Tim Haswell, a
hold-up man, was shot during an attempted robbery by a citizen of
Piedmont Heights.&nbsp; Tim Haswell lingered three days, during
which time he not only confessed to the murder of Irene Tackley,
but furnished conclusive proofs of the same.&nbsp; Bert Danniker,
a convict dying of consumption in Folsom Prison, was implicated
as accessory, and his confession followed.&nbsp; It is
inconceivable to us of to-day&mdash;the bungling, dilatory
processes of justice a generation ago.&nbsp; Emil Gluck was
proved in February to be an innocent man, yet he was not released
until the following October.&nbsp; For eight months, a greatly
wronged man, he was compelled to undergo his unmerited
punishment.&nbsp; This was not conducive to sweetness and light,
and we can well imagine how he ate his soul with bitterness
during those dreary eight months.</p>
<p>He came back to the world in the fall of 1932, as usual a
&ldquo;feature&rdquo; topic in all the newspapers.&nbsp; The
papers, instead of expressing heartfelt regret, continued their
old sensational persecution.&nbsp; One paper did more&mdash;the
<i>San Francisco Intelligencer</i>.&nbsp; John Hartwell, its
editor, elaborated an ingenious theory that got around the
confessions of the two criminals and went to show that Gluck was
responsible, after all, for the murder of Irene Tackley.&nbsp;
Hartwell died.&nbsp; And Sherbourne died too, while Policeman
Phillipps was shot in the leg and discharged from the Oakland
police force.</p>
<p>The murder of Hartwell was long a mystery.&nbsp; He was alone
in his editorial office at the time.&nbsp; The reports of the
revolver were heard by the office boy, who rushed in to find
Hartwell expiring in his chair.&nbsp; What puzzled the police was
the fact, not merely that he had been shot with his own revolver,
but that the revolver had been exploded in the drawer of his
desk.&nbsp; The bullets had torn through the front of the drawer
and entered his body.&nbsp; The police scouted the theory of
suicide, murder was dismissed as absurd, and the blame was thrown
upon the Eureka Smokeless Cartridge Company.&nbsp; Spontaneous
explosion was the police explanation, and the chemists of the
cartridge company were well bullied at the inquest.&nbsp; But
what the police did not know was that across the street, in the
Mercer Building, Room 633, rented by Emil Gluck, had been
occupied by Emil Gluck at the very moment Hartwell&rsquo;s
revolver so mysteriously exploded.</p>
<p>At the time, no connection was made between Hartwell&rsquo;s
death and the death of William Sherbourne.&nbsp; Sherbourne had
continued to live in the home he had built for Irene Tackley, and
one morning in January, 1933, he was found dead.&nbsp; Suicide
was the verdict of the coroner&rsquo;s inquest, for he had been
shot by his own revolver.&nbsp; The curious thing that happened
that night was the shooting of Policeman Phillipps on the
sidewalk in front of Sherbourne&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The
policeman crawled to a police telephone on the corner and rang up
for an ambulance.&nbsp; He claimed that some one had shot him
from behind in the leg.&nbsp; The leg in question was so badly
shattered by three &rsquo;38 calibre bullets that amputation was
necessary.&nbsp; But when the police discovered that the damage
had been done by his own revolver, a great laugh went up, and he
was charged with having been drunk.&nbsp; In spite of his denial
of having touched a drop, and of his persistent assertion that
the revolver had been in his hip pocket and that he had not laid
a finger to it, he was discharged from the force.&nbsp; Emil
Gluck&rsquo;s confession, six years later, cleared the
unfortunate policeman of disgrace, and he is alive to-day and in
good health, the recipient of a handsome pension from the
city.</p>
<p>Emil Gluck, having disposed of his immediate enemies, now
sought a wider field, though his enmity for newspaper men and for
the police remained always active.&nbsp; The royalties on his
ignition device for gasolene-engines had mounted up while he lay
in prison, and year by year the earning power of his invention
increased.&nbsp; He was independent, able to travel wherever he
willed over the earth and to glut his monstrous appetite for
revenge.&nbsp; He had become a monomaniac and an
anarchist&mdash;not a philosophic anarchist, merely, but a
violent anarchist.&nbsp; Perhaps the word is misused, and he is
better described as a nihilist, or an annihilist.&nbsp; It is
known that he affiliated with none of the groups of
terrorists.&nbsp; He operated wholly alone, but he created a
thousandfold more terror and achieved a thousandfold more
destruction than all the terrorist groups added together.</p>
<p>He signalized his departure from California by blowing up Fort
Mason.&nbsp; In his confession he spoke of it as a little
experiment&mdash;he was merely trying his hand.&nbsp; For eight
years he wandered over the earth, a mysterious terror, destroying
property to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, and
destroying countless lives.&nbsp; One good result of his awful
deeds was the destruction he wrought among the terrorists
themselves.&nbsp; Every time he did anything the terrorists in
the vicinity were gathered in by the police dragnet, and many of
them were executed.&nbsp; Seventeen were executed at Rome alone,
following the assassination of the Italian King.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most world-amazing achievement of his was the
assassination of the King and Queen of Portugal.&nbsp; It was
their wedding day.&nbsp; All possible precautions had been taken
against the terrorists, and the way from the cathedral, through
Lisbon&rsquo;s streets, was double-banked with troops, while a
squad of two hundred mounted troopers surrounded the
carriage.&nbsp; Suddenly the amazing thing happened.&nbsp; The
automatic rifles of the troopers began to go off, as well as the
rifles, in the immediate vicinity, of the double-banked
infantry.&nbsp; In the excitement the muzzles of the exploding
rifles were turned in all directions.&nbsp; The slaughter was
terrible&mdash;horses, troops, spectators, and the King and
Queen, were riddled with bullets.&nbsp; To complicate the affair,
in different parts of the crowd behind the foot-soldiers, two
terrorists had bombs explode on their persons.&nbsp; These bombs
they had intended to throw if they got the opportunity.&nbsp; But
who was to know this?&nbsp; The frightful havoc wrought by the
bursting bombs but added to the confusion; it was considered part
of the general attack.</p>
<p>One puzzling thing that could not be explained away was the
conduct of the troopers with their exploding rifles.&nbsp; It
seemed impossible that they should be in the plot, yet there were
the hundreds their flying bullets had slain, including the King
and Queen.&nbsp; On the other hand, more baffling than ever was
the fact that seventy per cent. of the troopers themselves had
been killed or wounded.&nbsp; Some explained this on the ground
that the loyal foot-soldiers, witnessing the attack on the royal
carriage, had opened fire on the traitors.&nbsp; Yet not one bit
of evidence to verify this could be drawn from the survivors,
though many were put to the torture.&nbsp; They contended
stubbornly that they had not discharged their rifles at all, but
that their rifles had discharged themselves.&nbsp; They were
laughed at by the chemists, who held that, while it was just
barely probable that a single cartridge, charged with the new
smokeless powder, might spontaneously explode, it was beyond all
probability and possibility for all the cartridges in a given
area, so charged, spontaneously to explode.&nbsp; And so, in the
end, no explanation of the amazing occurrence was reached.&nbsp;
The general opinion of the rest of the world was that the whole
affair was a blind panic of the feverish Latins, precipitated, it
was true, by the bursting of two terrorist bombs; and in this
connection was recalled the laughable encounter of long years
before between the Russian fleet and the English fishing
boats.</p>
<p>And Emil Gluck chuckled and went his way.&nbsp; He knew.&nbsp;
But how was the world to know?&nbsp; He had stumbled upon the
secret in his old electroplating shop on Telegraph Avenue in the
city of Oakland.&nbsp; It happened, at that time, that a wireless
telegraph station was established by the Thurston Power Company
close to his shop.&nbsp; In a short time his electroplating vat
was put out of order.&nbsp; The vat-wiring had many bad joints,
and, on investigation, Gluck discovered minute welds at the
joints in the wiring.&nbsp; These, by lowering the resistance,
had caused an excessive current to pass through the solution,
&ldquo;boiling&rdquo; it and spoiling the work.&nbsp; But what
had caused the welds? was the question in Gluck&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; His reasoning was simple.&nbsp; Before the
establishment of the wireless station, the vat had worked
well.&nbsp; Not until after the establishment of the wireless
station had the vat been ruined.&nbsp; Therefore the wireless
station had been the cause.&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; He quickly
answered the question.&nbsp; If an electric discharge was capable
of operating a coherer across three thousand miles of ocean,
then, certainly, the electric discharges from the wireless
station four hundred feet away could produce coherer effects on
the bad joints in the vat-wiring.</p>
<p>Gluck thought no more about it at the time.&nbsp; He merely
re-wired his vat and went on electroplating.&nbsp; But
afterwards, in prison, he remembered the incident, and like a
flash there came into his mind the full significance of it.&nbsp;
He saw in it the silent, secret weapon with which to revenge
himself on the world.&nbsp; His great discovery, which died with
him, was control over the direction and scope of the electric
discharge.&nbsp; At the time, this was the unsolved problem of
wireless telegraphy&mdash;as it still is to-day&mdash;but Emil
Gluck, in his prison cell, mastered it.&nbsp; And, when he was
released, he applied it.&nbsp; It was fairly simple, given the
directing power that was his, to introduce a spark into the
powder-magazines of a fort, a battleship, or a revolver.&nbsp;
And not alone could he thus explode powder at a distance, but he
could ignite conflagrations.&nbsp; The great Boston fire was
started by him&mdash;quite by accident, however, as he stated in
his confession, adding that it was a pleasing accident and that
he had never had any reason to regret it.</p>
<p>It was Emil Gluck that caused the terrible German-American
War, with the loss of 800,000 lives and the consumption of almost
incalculable treasure.&nbsp; It will be remembered that in 1939,
because of the Pickard incident, strained relations existed
between the two countries.&nbsp; Germany, though aggrieved, was
not anxious for war, and, as a peace token, sent the Crown Prince
and seven battleships on a friendly visit to the United
States.&nbsp; On the night of February 15, the seven warships lay
at anchor in the Hudson opposite New York City.&nbsp; And on that
night Emil Gluck, alone, with all his apparatus on board, was out
in a launch.&nbsp; This launch, it was afterwards proved, was
bought by him from the Ross Turner Company, while much of the
apparatus he used that night had been purchased from the Columbia
Electric Works.&nbsp; But this was not known at the time.&nbsp;
All that was known was that the seven battleships blew up, one
after another, at regular four-minute intervals.&nbsp; Ninety per
cent. of the crews and officers, along with the Crown Prince,
perished.&nbsp; Many years before, the American battleship
<i>Maine</i> had been blown up in the harbour of Havana, and war
with Spain had immediately followed&mdash;though there has always
existed a reasonable doubt as to whether the explosion was due to
conspiracy or accident.&nbsp; But accident could not explain the
blowing up of the seven battleships on the Hudson at four-minute
intervals.&nbsp; Germany believed that it had been done by a
submarine, and immediately declared war.&nbsp; It was six months
after Gluck&rsquo;s confession that she returned the Philippines
and Hawaii to the United States.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Emil Gluck, the malevolent wizard and
arch-hater, travelled his whirlwind path of destruction.&nbsp; He
left no traces.&nbsp; Scientifically thorough, he always cleaned
up after himself.&nbsp; His method was to rent a room or a house,
and secretly to install his apparatus&mdash;which apparatus, by
the way, he so perfected and simplified that it occupied little
space.&nbsp; After he had accomplished his purpose he carefully
removed the apparatus.&nbsp; He bade fair to live out a long life
of horrible crime.</p>
<p>The epidemic of shooting of New York City policemen was a
remarkable affair.&nbsp; It became one of the horror mysteries of
the time.&nbsp; In two short weeks over a hundred policemen were
shot in the legs by their own revolvers.&nbsp; Inspector Jones
did not solve the mystery, but it was his idea that finally
outwitted Gluck.&nbsp; On his recommendation the policemen ceased
carrying revolvers, and no more accidental shootings
occurred.</p>
<p>It was in the early spring of 1940 that Gluck destroyed the
Mare Island navy-yard.&nbsp; From a room in Vallejo he sent his
electric discharges across the Vallejo Straits to Mare
Island.&nbsp; He first played his flashes on the battleship
<i>Maryland</i>.&nbsp; She lay at the dock of one of the
mine-magazines.&nbsp; On her forward deck, on a huge temporary
platform of timbers, were disposed over a hundred mines.&nbsp;
These mines were for the defence of the Golden Gate.&nbsp; Any
one of these mines was capable of destroying a dozen battleships,
and there were over a hundred mines.&nbsp; The destruction was
terrific, but it was only Gluck&rsquo;s overture.&nbsp; He played
his flashes down the Mare Island shore, blowing up five torpedo
boats, the torpedo station, and the great magazine at the eastern
end of the island.&nbsp; Returning westward again, and scooping
in occasional isolated magazines on the high ground back from the
shore, he blew up three cruisers and the battleships
<i>Oregon</i>, <i>Delaware</i>, <i>New Hampshire</i>, and
<i>Florida</i>&mdash;the latter had just gone into dry-dock, and
the magnificent dry-dock was destroyed along with her.</p>
<p>It was a frightful catastrophe, and a shiver of horror passed
through the land.&nbsp; But it was nothing to what was to
follow.&nbsp; In the late fall of that year Emil Gluck made a
clean sweep of the Atlantic seaboard from Maine to Florida.&nbsp;
Nothing escaped.&nbsp; Forts, mines, coast defences of all sorts,
torpedo stations, magazines&mdash;everything went up.&nbsp; Three
months afterward, in midwinter, he smote the north shore of the
Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Greece in the same stupefying
manner.&nbsp; A wail went up from the nations.&nbsp; It was clear
that human agency was behind all this destruction, and it was
equally clear, through Emil Gluck&rsquo;s impartiality, that the
destruction was not the work of any particular nation.&nbsp; One
thing was patent, namely, that whoever was the human behind it
all, that human was a menace to the world.&nbsp; No nation was
safe.&nbsp; There was no defence against this unknown and
all-powerful foe.&nbsp; Warfare was futile&mdash;nay, not merely
futile but itself the very essence of the peril.&nbsp; For a
twelve-month the manufacture of powder ceased, and all soldiers
and sailors were withdrawn from all fortifications and war
vessels.&nbsp; And even a world-disarmament was seriously
considered at the Convention of the Powers, held at The Hague at
that time.</p>
<p>And then Silas Bannerman, a secret service agent of the United
States, leaped into world-fame by arresting Emil Gluck.&nbsp; At
first Bannerman was laughed at, but he had prepared his case
well, and in a few weeks the most sceptical were convinced of
Emil Gluck&rsquo;s guilt.&nbsp; The one thing, however, that
Silas Bannerman never succeeded in explaining, even to his own
satisfaction, was how first he came to connect Gluck with the
atrocious crimes.&nbsp; It is true, Bannerman was in Vallejo, on
secret government business, at the time of the destruction of
Mare Island; and it is true that on the streets of Vallejo Emil
Gluck was pointed out to him as a queer crank; but no impression
was made at the time.&nbsp; It was not until afterward, when on a
vacation in the Rocky Mountains and when reading the first
published reports of the destruction along the Atlantic Coast,
that suddenly Bannerman thought of Emil Gluck.&nbsp; And on the
instant there flashed into his mind the connection between Gluck
and the destruction.&nbsp; It was only an hypothesis, but it was
sufficient.&nbsp; The great thing was the conception of the
hypothesis, in itself an act of unconscious cerebration&mdash;a
thing as unaccountable as the flashing, for instance, into
Newton&rsquo;s mind of the principle of gravitation.</p>
<p>The rest was easy.&nbsp; Where was Gluck at the time of the
destruction along the Atlantic sea-board? was the question that
formed in Bannerman&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; By his own request he was
put upon the case.&nbsp; In no time he ascertained that Gluck had
himself been up and down the Atlantic Coast in the late fall of
1940.&nbsp; Also he ascertained that Gluck had been in New York
City during the epidemic of the shooting of police
officers.&nbsp; Where was Gluck now? was Bannerman&rsquo;s next
query.&nbsp; And, as if in answer, came the wholesale destruction
along the Mediterranean.&nbsp; Gluck had sailed for Europe a
month before&mdash;Bannerman knew that.&nbsp; It was not
necessary for Bannerman to go to Europe.&nbsp; By means of cable
messages and the co-operation of the European secret services, he
traced Gluck&rsquo;s course along the Mediterranean and found
that in every instance it coincided with the blowing up of coast
defences and ships.&nbsp; Also, he learned that Gluck had just
sailed on the Green Star liner <i>Plutonic</i> for the United
States.</p>
<p>The case was complete in Bannerman&rsquo;s mind, though in the
interval of waiting he worked up the details.&nbsp; In this he
was ably assisted by George Brown, an operator employed by the
Wood&rsquo;s System of Wireless Telegraphy.&nbsp; When the
<i>Plutonic</i> arrived off Sandy Hook she was boarded by
Bannerman from a Government tug, and Emil Gluck was made a
prisoner.&nbsp; The trial and the confession followed.&nbsp; In
the confession Gluck professed regret only for one thing, namely,
that he had taken his time.&nbsp; As he said, had he dreamed that
he was ever to be discovered he would have worked more rapidly
and accomplished a thousand times the destruction he did.&nbsp;
His secret died with him, though it is now known that the French
Government managed to get access to him and offered him a billion
francs for his invention wherewith he was able to direct and
closely to confine electric discharges.&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
was Gluck&rsquo;s reply&mdash;&ldquo;to sell to you that which
would enable you to enslave and maltreat suffering
Humanity?&rdquo;&nbsp; And though the war departments of the
nations have continued to experiment in their secret
laboratories, they have so far failed to light upon the slightest
trace of the secret.&nbsp; Emil Gluck was executed on December 4,
1941, and so died, at the age of forty-six, one of the
world&rsquo;s most unfortunate geniuses, a man of tremendous
intellect, but whose mighty powers, instead of making toward
good, were so twisted and warped that he became the most amazing
of criminals.</p>

<h2><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>THE
DREAM OF DEBS</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">awoke</span> fully an hour before my
customary time.&nbsp; This in itself was remarkable, and I lay
very wide awake, pondering over it.&nbsp; Something was the
matter, something was wrong&mdash;I knew not what.&nbsp; I was
oppressed by a premonition of something terrible that had
happened or was about to happen.&nbsp; But what was it?&nbsp; I
strove to orient myself.&nbsp; I remembered that at the time of
the Great Earthquake of 1906 many claimed they awakened some
moments before the first shock and that during these moments they
experienced strange feelings of dread.&nbsp; Was San Francisco
again to be visited by earthquake?</p>
<p>I lay for a full minute, numbly expectant, but there occurred
no reeling of walls nor shock and grind of falling masonry.&nbsp;
All was quiet.&nbsp; That was it!&nbsp; The silence!&nbsp; No
wonder I had been perturbed.&nbsp; The hum of the great live city
was strangely absent.&nbsp; The surface cars passed along my
street, at that time of day, on an average of one every three
minutes; but in the ten succeeding minutes not a car
passed.&nbsp; Perhaps it was a street-railway strike, was my
thought; or perhaps there had been an accident and the power was
shut off.&nbsp; But no, the silence was too profound.&nbsp; I
heard no jar and rattle of waggon wheels, nor stamp of iron-shod
hoofs straining up the steep cobble-stones.</p>
<p>Pressing the push-button beside my bed, I strove to hear the
sound of the bell, though I well knew it was impossible for the
sound to rise three stories to me even if the bell did
ring.&nbsp; It rang all right, for a few minutes later Brown
entered with the tray and morning paper.&nbsp; Though his
features were impassive as ever, I noted a startled, apprehensive
light in his eyes.&nbsp; I noted, also, that there was no cream
on the tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Creamery did not deliver this morning,&rdquo; he
explained; &ldquo;nor did the bakery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced again at the tray.&nbsp; There were no fresh French
rolls&mdash;only slices of stale graham bread from yesterday, the
most detestable of bread so far as I was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing was delivered this morning, sir,&rdquo; Brown
started to explain apologetically; but I interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it was delivered, but it was the only thing,
and it is the last time, too.&nbsp; There won&rsquo;t be any
paper to-morrow.&nbsp; The paper says so.&nbsp; Can I send out
and get you some condensed milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head, accepted the coffee black, and spread open
the paper.&nbsp; The headlines explained
everything&mdash;explained too much, in fact, for the lengths of
pessimism to which the journal went were ridiculous.&nbsp; A
general strike, it said, had been called all over the United
States; and most foreboding anxieties were expressed concerning
the provisioning of the great cities.</p>
<p>I read on hastily, skimming much and remembering much of
labour troubles in the past.&nbsp; For a generation the general
strike had been the dream of organized labour, which dream had
arisen originally in the mind of Debs, one of the great labour
leaders of thirty years before.&nbsp; I recollected that in my
young college-settlement days I had even written an article on
the subject for one of the magazines and that I had entitled it
&ldquo;The Dream of Debs.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I must confess that I
had treated the idea very cavalierly and academically as a dream
and nothing more.&nbsp; Time and the world had rolled on, Gompers
was gone, the American Federation of Labour was gone, and gone
was Debs with all his wild revolutionary ideas; but the dream had
persisted, and here it was at last realized in fact.&nbsp; But I
laughed, as I read, at the journal&rsquo;s gloomy outlook.&nbsp;
I knew better.&nbsp; I had seen organized labour worsted in too
many conflicts.&nbsp; It would be a matter only of days when the
thing would be settled.&nbsp; This was a national strike, and it
wouldn&rsquo;t take the Government long to break it.</p>
<p>I threw the paper down and proceeded to dress.&nbsp; It would
certainly be interesting to be out in the streets of San
Francisco when not a wheel was turning and the whole city was
taking an enforced vacation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; Brown said, as he handed
me my cigar-case, &ldquo;but Mr. Harmmed has asked to see you
before you go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him in right away,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>Harmmed was the butler.&nbsp; When he entered I could see he
was labouring under controlled excitement.&nbsp; He came at once
to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do, sir?&nbsp; There will be needed
provisions, and the delivery drivers are on strike.&nbsp; And the
electricity is shut off&mdash;I guess they&rsquo;re on strike,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the shops open?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the small ones, sir.&nbsp; The retail clerks are
out, and the big ones can&rsquo;t open; but the owners and their
families are running the little ones themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take the machine,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and go the
rounds and make your purchases.&nbsp; Buy plenty of everything
you need or may need.&nbsp; Get a box of candles&mdash;no, get
half-a-dozen boxes.&nbsp; And, when you&rsquo;re done, tell
Harrison to bring the machine around to the club for me&mdash;not
later than eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harmmed shook his head gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Harrison has
struck along with the Chauffeurs&rsquo; Union, and I don&rsquo;t
know how to run the machine myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho, he has, has he?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
when next Mister Harrison happens around you tell him that he can
look elsewhere for a position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to belong to a Butlers&rsquo;
Union, do you, Harmmed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;And even
if I did I&rsquo;d not desert my employer in a crisis like
this.&nbsp; No, sir, I would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, thank you,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
you get ready to accompany me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run the machine
myself, and we&rsquo;ll lay in a stock of provisions to stand a
siege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a beautiful first of May, even as May days go.&nbsp;
The sky was cloudless, there was no wind, and the air was
warm&mdash;almost balmy.&nbsp; Many autos were out, but the
owners were driving them themselves.&nbsp; The streets were
crowded but quiet.&nbsp; The working class, dressed in its Sunday
best, was out taking the air and observing the effects of the
strike.&nbsp; It was all so unusual, and withal so peaceful, that
I found myself enjoying it.&nbsp; My nerves were tingling with
mild excitement.&nbsp; It was a sort of placid adventure.&nbsp; I
passed Miss Chickering.&nbsp; She was at the helm of her little
runabout.&nbsp; She swung around and came after me, catching me
at the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Corf!&rdquo;&rsquo; she hailed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you know where I can buy candles?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been to a
dozen shops, and they&rsquo;re all sold out.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
dreadfully awful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her sparkling eyes gave the lie to her words.&nbsp; Like
the rest of us, she was enjoying it hugely.&nbsp; Quite an
adventure it was, getting those candles.&nbsp; It was not until
we went across the city and down into the working-class quarter
south of Market Street that we found small corner groceries that
had not yet sold out.&nbsp; Miss Chickering thought one box was
sufficient, but I persuaded her into taking four.&nbsp; My car
was large, and I laid in a dozen boxes.&nbsp; There was no
telling what delays might arise in the settlement of the
strike.&nbsp; Also, I filled the car with sacks of flour,
baking-powder, tinned goods, and all the ordinary necessaries of
life suggested by Harmmed, who fussed around and clucked over the
purchases like an anxious old hen.</p>
<p>The remarkable thing, that first day of the strike, was that
no one really apprehended anything serious.&nbsp; The
announcement of organized labour in the morning papers that it
was prepared to stay out a month or three months was laughed
at.&nbsp; And yet that very first day we might have guessed as
much from the fact that the working class took practically no
part in the great rush to buy provisions.&nbsp; Of course
not.&nbsp; For weeks and months, craftily and secretly, the whole
working class had been laying in private stocks of
provisions.&nbsp; That was why we were permitted to go down and
buy out the little groceries in the working-class
neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>It was not until I arrived at the club that afternoon that I
began to feel the first alarm.&nbsp; Everything was in
confusion.&nbsp; There were no olives for the cocktails, and the
service was by hitches and jerks.&nbsp; Most of the men were
angry, and all were worried.&nbsp; A babel of voices greeted me
as I entered.&nbsp; General Folsom, nursing his capacious paunch
in a window-seat in the smoking-room was defending himself
against half-a-dozen excited gentlemen who were demanding that he
should do something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do more than I have done?&rdquo; he was
saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are no orders from Washington.&nbsp;
If you gentlemen will get a wire through I&rsquo;ll do anything I
am commanded to do.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see what can be
done.&nbsp; The first thing I did this morning, as soon as I
learned of the strike, was to order in the troops from the
Presidio&mdash;three thousand of them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
guarding the banks, the Mint, the post office, and all the public
buildings.&nbsp; There is no disorder whatever.&nbsp; The
strikers are keeping the peace perfectly.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
expect me to shoot them down as they walk along the streets with
wives and children all in their best bib and tucker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what&rsquo;s happening on Wall
Street,&rdquo; I heard Jimmy Wombold say as I passed along.&nbsp;
I could imagine his anxiety, for I knew that he was deep in the
big Consolidated-Western deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Corf,&rdquo; Atkinson bustled up to me, &ldquo;is
your machine running?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the
matter with your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken down, and the garages are all closed.&nbsp; And
my wife&rsquo;s somewhere around Truckee, I think, stalled on the
overland.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t get a wire to her for love or
money.&nbsp; She should have arrived this evening.&nbsp; She may
be starving.&nbsp; Lend me your machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get it across the bay,&rdquo; Halstead
spoke up.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ferries aren&rsquo;t running.&nbsp;
But I tell you what you can do.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
Rollinson&mdash;oh, Rollinson, come here a moment.&nbsp; Atkinson
wants to get a machine across the bay.&nbsp; His wife is stuck on
the overland at Truckee.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you bring the
<i>Lurlette</i> across from Tiburon and carry the machine over
for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Lurlette</i> was a two-hundred-ton, ocean-going
schooner-yacht.</p>
<p>Rollinson shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get
a longshoreman to land the machine on board, even if I could get
the <i>Lurlette</i> over, which I can&rsquo;t, for the crew are
members of the Coast Seamen&rsquo;s Union, and they&rsquo;re on
strike along with the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my wife may be starving,&rdquo; I could hear
Atkinson wailing as I moved on.</p>
<p>At the other end of the smoking-room I ran into a group of men
bunched excitedly and angrily around Bertie Messener.&nbsp; And
Bertie was stirring them up and prodding them in his cool,
cynical way.&nbsp; Bertie didn&rsquo;t care about the
strike.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t care much about anything.&nbsp; He
was blas&eacute;&mdash;at least in all the clean things of life;
the nasty things had no attraction for him.&nbsp; He was worth
twenty millions, all of it in safe investments, and he had never
done a tap of productive work in his life&mdash;inherited it all
from his father and two uncles.&nbsp; He had been everywhere,
seen everything, and done everything but get married, and this
last in the face of the grim and determined attack of a few
hundred ambitious mammas.&nbsp; For years he had been the
greatest catch, and as yet he had avoided being caught.&nbsp; He
was disgracefully eligible.&nbsp; On top of his wealth he was
young, handsome, and, as I said before, clean.&nbsp; He was a
great athlete, a young blond god that did everything perfectly
and admirably with the solitary exception of matrimony.&nbsp; And
he didn&rsquo;t care about anything, had no ambitions, no
passions, no desire to do the very things he did so much better
than other men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is sedition!&rdquo; one man in the group was
crying.&nbsp; Another called it revolt and revolution, and
another called it anarchy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; Bertie said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have been out in the streets all morning.&nbsp; Perfect
order reigns.&nbsp; I never saw a more law-abiding
populace.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no use calling it names.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not any of those things.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just what it
claims to be, a general strike, and it&rsquo;s your turn to play,
gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll play all right!&rdquo; cried Garfield,
one of the traction millionaires.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show
this dirt where its place is&mdash;the beasts!&nbsp; Wait till
the Government takes a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the Government?&rdquo; Bertie
interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It might as well be at the bottom of the
sea so far as you&rsquo;re concerned.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s happening at Washington.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know
whether you&rsquo;ve got a Government or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that,&rdquo; Garfield
blurted out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you I&rsquo;m not worrying,&rdquo; Bertie
smiled languidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it seems to me it&rsquo;s what
you fellows are doing.&nbsp; Look in the glass,
Garfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garfield did not look, but had he looked he would have seen a
very excited gentleman with rumpled, iron-grey hair, a flushed
face, mouth sullen and vindictive, and eyes wildly gleaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right, I tell you,&rdquo; little Hanover
said; and from his tone I was sure that he had already said it a
number of times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s going too far, Hanover,&rdquo; Bertie
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You fellows make me tired.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re all open-shop men.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve eroded my
eardrums with your endless gabble for the open shop and the right
of a man to work.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve harangued along those lines
for years.&nbsp; Labour is doing nothing wrong in going out on
this general strike.&nbsp; It is violating no law of God nor
man.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you talk, Hanover.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been
ringing the changes too long on the God-given right to work . . .
or not to work; you can&rsquo;t escape the corollary.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a dirty little sordid scrap, that&rsquo;s all the
whole thing is.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got labour down and gouged it,
and now labour&rsquo;s got you down and is gouging you,
that&rsquo;s all, and you&rsquo;re squealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every man in the group broke out in indignant denials that
labour had ever been gouged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; Garfield was shouting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done the best for labour.&nbsp; Instead of
gouging it, we&rsquo;ve given it a chance to live.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve made work for it.&nbsp; Where would labour be if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole lot better off,&rdquo; Bertie sneered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got labour down and gouged it every time you
got a chance, and you went out of your way to make
chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; No!&rdquo; were the cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was the teamsters&rsquo; strike, right here in
San Francisco,&rdquo; Bertie went on imperturbably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Employers&rsquo; Association precipitated that
strike.&nbsp; You know that.&nbsp; And you know I know it, too,
for I&rsquo;ve sat in these very rooms and heard the inside talk
and news of the fight.&nbsp; First you precipitated the strike,
then you bought the Mayor and the Chief of Police and broke the
strike.&nbsp; A pretty spectacle, you philanthropists getting the
teamsters down and gouging them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, I&rsquo;m not through with you.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s only last year that the labour ticket of Colorado
elected a governor.&nbsp; He was never seated.&nbsp; You know
why.&nbsp; You know how your brother philanthropists and
capitalists of Colorado worked it.&nbsp; It was a case of getting
labour down and gouging it.&nbsp; You kept the president of the
South-western Amalgamated Association of Miners in jail for three
years on trumped-up murder charges, and with him out of the way
you broke up the association.&nbsp; That was gouging labour,
you&rsquo;ll admit.&nbsp; The third time the graduated income tax
was declared unconstitutional was a gouge.&nbsp; So was the
eight-hour Bill you killed in the last Congress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of all unmitigated immoral gouges, your destruction
of the closed-shop principle was the limit.&nbsp; You know how it
was done. You bought out Farburg, the last president of the old
American Federation of Labour.&nbsp; He was your
creature&mdash;or the creature of all the trusts and
employers&rsquo; associations, which is the same thing.&nbsp; You
precipitated the big closed-shop strike.&nbsp; Farburg betrayed
that strike.&nbsp; You won, and the old American Federation of
Labour crumbled to pieces.&nbsp; You fellows destroyed it, and by
so doing undid yourselves; for right on top of it began the
organization of the I.L.W.&mdash;the biggest and solidest
organization of labour the United States has ever seen, and you
are responsible for its existence and for the present general
strike.&nbsp; You smashed all the old federations and drove
labour into the I.L.W., and the I.L.W. called the general
strike&mdash;still fighting for the closed shop.&nbsp; And then
you have the effrontery to stand here face to face and tell me
that you never got labour down and gouged it.&nbsp;
Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time there were no denials.&nbsp; Garfield broke out in
self-defence&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done nothing we were not compelled to do,
if we were to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying anything about that,&rdquo; Bertie
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I am complaining about is your
squealing now that you&rsquo;re getting a taste of your own
medicine.&nbsp; How many strikes have you won by starving labour
into submission?&nbsp; Well, labour&rsquo;s worked out a scheme
whereby to starve you into submission.&nbsp; It wants the closed
shop, and, if it can get it by starving you, why, starve you
shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice that you have profited in the past by those
very labour gouges you mention,&rdquo; insinuated Brentwood, one
of the wiliest and most astute of our corporation lawyers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The receiver is as bad as the thief,&rdquo; he
sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had no hand in the gouging, but you
took your whack out of the gouge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite beside the question, Brentwood,&rdquo;
Bertie drawled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bad as Hanover,
intruding the moral element.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t said that
anything is right or wrong.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all a rotten game, I
know; and my sole kick is that you fellows are squealing now that
you&rsquo;re down and labour&rsquo;s taking a gouge out of
you.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;ve taken the profits from the
gouging and, thanks to you, gentlemen, without having personally
to do the dirty work.&nbsp; You did that for me&mdash;oh, believe
me, not because I am more virtuous than you, but because my good
father and his various brothers left me a lot of money with which
to pay for the dirty work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean to insinuate&mdash;&rdquo; Brentwood began
hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, don&rsquo;t get all-ruffled up,&rdquo; Bertie
interposed insolently.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in
playing hypocrites in this thieves&rsquo; den.&nbsp; The high and
lofty is all right for the newspapers, boys&rsquo; clubs, and
Sunday schools&mdash;that&rsquo;s part of the game; but for
heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s play it on one
another.&nbsp; You know, and you know that I know just what
jobbery was done in the building trades&rsquo; strike last fall,
who put up the money, who did the work, and who profited by
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Brentwood flushed darkly.)&nbsp; &ldquo;But we
are all tarred with the same brush, and the best thing for us to
do is to leave morality out of it.&nbsp; Again I repeat, play the
game, play it to the last finish, but for goodness&rsquo; sake
don&rsquo;t squeal when you get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I left the group Bertie was off on a new tack tormenting
them with the more serious aspects of the situation, pointing out
the shortage of supplies that was already making itself felt, and
asking them what they were going to do about it.&nbsp; A little
later I met him in the cloak-room, leaving, and gave him a lift
home in my machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great stroke, this general strike,&rdquo;
he said, as we bowled along through the crowded but orderly
streets.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a smashing body-blow.&nbsp;
Labour caught us napping and struck at our weakest place, the
stomach.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to get out of San Francisco,
Corf.&nbsp; Take my advice and get out, too.&nbsp; Head for the
country, anywhere.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have more chance.&nbsp; Buy
up a stock of supplies and get into a tent or a cabin
somewhere.&nbsp; Soon there&rsquo;ll be nothing but starvation in
this city for such as we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How correct Bertie Messener was I never dreamed.&nbsp; I
decided that he was an alarmist.&nbsp; As for myself, I was
content to remain and watch the fun.&nbsp; After I dropped him,
instead of going directly home, I went on in a hunt for more
food.&nbsp; To my surprise, I learned that the small groceries
where I had bought in the morning were sold out.&nbsp; I extended
my search to the Potrero, and by good luck managed to pick up
another box of candles, two sacks of wheat flour, ten pounds of
graham flour (which would do for the servants), a case of tinned
corn, and two cases of tinned tomatoes.&nbsp; It did look as
though there was going to be at least a temporary food shortage,
and I hugged myself over the goodly stock of provisions I had
laid in.</p>
<p>The next morning I had my coffee in bed as usual, and, more
than the cream, I missed the daily paper.&nbsp; It was this
absence of knowledge of what was going on in the world that I
found the chief hardship.&nbsp; Down at the club there was little
news.&nbsp; Rider had crossed from Oakland in his launch, and
Halstead had been down to San Jose and back in his machine.&nbsp;
They reported the same conditions in those places as in San
Francisco.&nbsp; Everything was tied up by the strike.&nbsp; All
grocery stocks had been bought out by the upper classes.&nbsp;
And perfect order reigned.&nbsp; But what was happening over the
rest of the country&mdash;in Chicago?&nbsp; New York?&nbsp;
Washington?&nbsp; Most probably the same things that were
happening with us, we concluded; but the fact that we did not
know with absolute surety was irritating.</p>
<p>General Folsom had a bit of news.&nbsp; An attempt had been
made to place army telegraphers in the telegraph offices, but the
wires had been cut in every direction.&nbsp; This was, so far,
the one unlawful act committed by labour, and that it was a
concerted act he was fully convinced.&nbsp; He had communicated
by wireless with the army post at Benicia, the telegraph lines
were even then being patrolled by soldiers all the way to
Sacramento.&nbsp; Once, for one short instant, they had got the
Sacramento call, then the wires, somewhere, were cut again.&nbsp;
General Folsom reasoned that similar attempts to open
communication were being made by the authorities all the way
across the continent, but he was non-committal as to whether or
not he thought the attempt would succeed.&nbsp; What worried him
was the wire-cutting; he could not but believe that it was an
important part of the deep-laid labour conspiracy.&nbsp; Also, he
regretted that the Government had not long since established its
projected chain of wireless stations.</p>
<p>The days came and went, and for a while it was a humdrum
time.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp; The edge of excitement had
become blunted.&nbsp; The streets were not so crowded.&nbsp; The
working class did not come uptown any more to see how we were
taking the strike.&nbsp; And there were not so many automobiles
running around.&nbsp; The repair-shops and garages were closed,
and whenever a machine broke down it went out of
commission.&nbsp; The clutch on mine broke, and neither love nor
money could get it repaired.&nbsp; Like the rest, I was now
walking.&nbsp; San Francisco lay dead, and we did not know what
was happening over the rest of the country.&nbsp; But from the
very fact that we did not know we could conclude only that the
rest of the country lay as dead as San Francisco.&nbsp; From time
to time the city was placarded with the proclamations of
organized labour&mdash;these had been printed months before, and
evidenced how thoroughly the I.L.W. had prepared for the
strike.&nbsp; Every detail had been worked out long in
advance.&nbsp; No violence had occurred as yet, with the
exception of the shooting of a few wire-cutters by the soldiers,
but the people of the slums were starving and growing ominously
restless.</p>
<p>The business men, the millionaires, and the professional class
held meetings and passed resolutions, but there was no way of
making the proclamations public.&nbsp; They could not even get
them printed.&nbsp; One result of these meetings, however, was
that General Folsom was persuaded into taking military possession
of the wholesale houses and of all the flour, grain, and food
warehouses.&nbsp; It was high time, for suffering was becoming
acute in the homes of the rich, and bread-lines were
necessary.&nbsp; I knew that my servants were beginning to draw
long faces, and it was amazing&mdash;the hole they made in my
stock of provisions.&nbsp; In fact, as I afterward surmised, each
servant was stealing from me and secreting a private stock of
provisions for himself.</p>
<p>But with the formation of the bread-lines came new
troubles.&nbsp; There was only so much of a food reserve in San
Francisco, and at the best it could not last long.&nbsp;
Organized labour, we knew, had its private supplies;
nevertheless, the whole working class joined the
bread-lines.&nbsp; As a result, the provisions General Folsom had
taken possession of diminished with perilous rapidity.&nbsp; How
were the soldiers to distinguish between a shabby middle-class
man, a member of the I.L.W., or a slum dweller?&nbsp; The first
and the last had to be fed, but the soldiers did not know all the
I.L.W. men in the city, much less the wives and sons and
daughters of the I.L.W. men.&nbsp; The employers helping, a few
of the known union men were flung out of the bread-lines; but
that amounted to nothing.&nbsp; To make matters worse, the
Government tugs that had been hauling food from the army depots
on Mare Island to Angel Island found no more food to haul.&nbsp;
The soldiers now received their rations from the confiscated
provisions, and they received them first.</p>
<p>The beginning of the end was in sight.&nbsp; Violence was
beginning to show its face.&nbsp; Law and order were passing
away, and passing away, I must confess, among the slum people and
the upper classes.&nbsp; Organized labour still maintained
perfect order.&nbsp; It could well afford to&mdash;it had plenty
to eat.&nbsp; I remember the afternoon at the club when I caught
Halstead and Brentwood whispering in a corner.&nbsp; They took me
in on the venture.&nbsp; Brentwood&rsquo;s machine was still in
running order, and they were going out cow-stealing.&nbsp;
Halstead had a long butcher knife and a cleaver.&nbsp; We went
out to the outskirts of the city.&nbsp; Here and there were cows
grazing, but always they were guarded by their owners.&nbsp; We
pursued our quest, following along the fringe of the city to the
east, and on the hills near Hunter&rsquo;s Point we came upon a
cow guarded by a little girl.&nbsp; There was also a young calf
with the cow.&nbsp; We wasted no time on preliminaries.&nbsp; The
little girl ran away screaming, while we slaughtered the
cow.&nbsp; I omit the details, for they are not nice&mdash;we
were unaccustomed to such work, and we bungled it.</p>
<p>But in the midst of it, working with the haste of fear, we
heard cries, and we saw a number of men running toward us.&nbsp;
We abandoned the spoils and took to our heels.&nbsp; To our
surprise we were not pursued.&nbsp; Looking back, we saw the men
hurriedly cutting up the cow.&nbsp; They had been on the same lay
as ourselves.&nbsp; We argued that there was plenty for all, and
ran back.&nbsp; The scene that followed beggars
description.&nbsp; We fought and squabbled over the division like
savages.&nbsp; Brentwood, I remember, was a perfect brute,
snarling and snapping and threatening that murder would be done
if we did not get our proper share.</p>
<p>And we were getting our share when there occurred a new
irruption on the scene.&nbsp; This time it was the dreaded peace
officers of the I.L.W.&nbsp; The little girl had brought
them.&nbsp; They were armed with whips and clubs, and there were
a score of them.&nbsp; The little girl danced up and down in
anger, the tears streaming down her cheeks, crying: &ldquo;Give
it to &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Give it to &rsquo;em!&nbsp; That guy with
the specs&mdash;he did it!&nbsp; Mash his face for him!&nbsp;
Mash his face!&rdquo;&nbsp; That guy with the specs was I, and I
got my face mashed, too, though I had the presence of mind to
take off my glasses at the first.&nbsp; My! but we did receive a
trouncing as we scattered in all directions.&nbsp; Brentwood,
Halstead, and I fled away for the machine.&nbsp;
Brentwood&rsquo;s nose was bleeding, while Halstead&rsquo;s cheek
was cut across with the scarlet slash of a black-snake whip.</p>
<p>And, lo, when the pursuit ceased and we had gained the
machine, there, hiding behind it, was the frightened calf.&nbsp;
Brentwood warned us to be cautious, and crept up on it like a
wolf or tiger.&nbsp; Knife and cleaver had been left behind, but
Brentwood still had his hands, and over and over on the ground he
rolled with the poor little calf as he throttled it.&nbsp; We
threw the carcass into the machine, covered it over with a robe,
and started for home.&nbsp; But our misfortunes had only
begun.&nbsp; We blew out a tyre.&nbsp; There was no way of fixing
it, and twilight was coming on.&nbsp; We abandoned the machine,
Brentwood pulling and staggering along in advance, the calf,
covered by the robe, slung across his shoulders.&nbsp; We took
turn about carrying that calf, and it nearly killed us.&nbsp;
Also, we lost our way.&nbsp; And then, after hours of wandering
and toil, we encountered a gang of hoodlums.&nbsp; They were not
I.L.W. men, and I guess they were as hungry as we.&nbsp; At any
rate, they got the calf and we got the thrashing.&nbsp; Brentwood
raged like a madman the rest of the way home, and he looked like
one, with his torn clothes, swollen nose, and blackened eyes.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t any more cow-stealing after that.&nbsp;
General Folsom sent his troopers out and confiscated all the
cows, and his troopers, aided by the militia, ate most of the
meat.&nbsp; General Folsom was not to be blamed; it was his duty
to maintain law and order, and he maintained it by means of the
soldiers, wherefore he was compelled to feed them first of
all.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the great panic occurred.&nbsp;
The wealthy classes precipitated the flight, and then the slum
people caught the contagion and stampeded wildly out of the
city.&nbsp; General Folsom was pleased.&nbsp; It was estimated
that at least 200,000 had deserted San Francisco, and by that
much was his food problem solved.&nbsp; Well do I remember that
day.&nbsp; In the morning I had eaten a crust of bread.&nbsp;
Half of the afternoon I had stood in the bread-line; and after
dark I returned home, tired and miserable, carrying a quart of
rice and a slice of bacon.&nbsp; Brown met me at the door.&nbsp;
His face was worn and terrified.&nbsp; All the servants had fled,
he informed me.&nbsp; He alone remained.&nbsp; I was touched by
his faithfulness and, when I learned that he had eaten nothing
all day, I divided my food with him.&nbsp; We cooked half the
rice and half the bacon, sharing it equally and reserving the
other half for morning.&nbsp; I went to bed with my hunger, and
tossed restlessly all night.&nbsp; In the morning I found Brown
had deserted me, and, greater misfortune still, he had stolen
what remained of the rice and bacon.</p>
<p>It was a gloomy handful of men that came together at the club
that morning.&nbsp; There was no service at all.&nbsp; The last
servant was gone.&nbsp; I noticed, too, that the silver was gone,
and I learned where it had gone.&nbsp; The servants had not taken
it, for the reason, I presume, that the club members got to it
first.&nbsp; Their method of disposing of it was simple.&nbsp;
Down south of Market Street, in the dwellings of the I.L.W., the
housewives had given square meals in exchange for it.&nbsp; I
went back to my house.&nbsp; Yes, my silver was gone&mdash;all
but a massive pitcher.&nbsp; This I wrapped up and carried down
south of Market Street.</p>
<p>I felt better after the meal, and returned to the club to
learn if there was anything new in the situation.&nbsp; Hanover,
Collins, and Dakon were just leaving.&nbsp; There was no one
inside, they told me, and they invited me to come along with
them.&nbsp; They were leaving the city, they said, on
Dakon&rsquo;s horses, and there was a spare one for me. Dakon had
four magnificent carriage horses that he wanted to save, and
General Folsom had given him the tip that next morning all the
horses that remained in the city were to be confiscated for
food.&nbsp; There were not many horses left, for tens of
thousands of them had been turned loose into the country when the
hay and grain gave out during the first days.&nbsp; Birdall, I
remember, who had great draying interests, had turned loose three
hundred dray horses.&nbsp; At an average value of five hundred
dollars, this had amounted to $150,000.&nbsp; He had hoped, at
first, to recover most of the horses after the strike was over,
but in the end he never recovered one of them.&nbsp; They were
all eaten by the people that fled from San Francisco.&nbsp; For
that matter, the killing of the army mules and horses for food
had already begun.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Dakon, he had had a plentiful supply of hay
and grain stored in his stable.&nbsp; We managed to raise four
saddles, and we found the animals in good condition and spirited,
withal unused to being ridden.&nbsp; I remembered the San
Francisco of the great earthquake as we rode through the streets,
but this San Francisco was vastly more pitiable.&nbsp; No
cataclysm of nature had caused this, but, rather, the tyranny of
the labour unions.&nbsp; We rode down past Union Square and
through the theatre, hotel, and shopping districts.&nbsp; The
streets were deserted.&nbsp; Here and there stood automobiles,
abandoned where they had broken down or when the gasolene had
given out.&nbsp; There was no sign of life, save for the
occasional policemen and the soldiers guarding the banks and
public buildings.&nbsp; Once we came upon an I.L.W. man pasting
up the latest proclamation.&nbsp; We stopped to read.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We have maintained an orderly strike,&rdquo; it ran;
&ldquo;and we shall maintain order to the end.&nbsp; The end will
come when our demands are satisfied, and our demands will be
satisfied when we have starved our employers into submission, as
we ourselves in the past have often been starved into
submission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messener&rsquo;s very words,&rdquo; Collins said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I, for one, am ready to submit, only they won&rsquo;t
give me a chance to submit.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t had a full meal
in an age.&nbsp; I wonder what horse-meat tastes like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stopped to read another proclamation: &ldquo;When we think
our employers are ready to submit we shall open up the telegraphs
and place the employers&rsquo; associations of the United States
in communication.&nbsp; But only messages relating to peace terms
shall be permitted over the wires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rode on, crossed Market Street, and a little later were
passing through the working-class district.&nbsp; Here the
streets were not deserted.&nbsp; Leaning over the gates or
standing in groups were the I.L.W. men.&nbsp; Happy, well-fed
children were playing games, and stout housewives sat on the
front steps gossiping.&nbsp; One and all cast amused glances at
us.&nbsp; Little children ran after us, crying: &ldquo;Hey,
mister, ain&rsquo;t you hungry?&rdquo;&nbsp; And one woman,
nursing a child at her breast, called to Dakon: &ldquo;Say,
Fatty, I&rsquo;ll give you a meal for your skate&mdash;ham and
potatoes, currant jelly, white bread, canned butter, and two cups
of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you noticed, the last few days,&rdquo; Hanover
remarked to me, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s not been a stray dog in
the streets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had noticed, but I had not thought about it before.&nbsp; It
was high time to leave the unfortunate city.&nbsp; We at last
managed to connect with the San Bruno Road, along which we headed
south.&nbsp; I had a country place near Menlo, and it was our
objective.&nbsp; But soon we began to discover that the country
was worse off and far more dangerous than the city.&nbsp; There
the soldiers and the I.L.W. kept order; but the country had been
turned over to anarchy.&nbsp; Two hundred thousand people had
fled from San Francisco, and we had countless evidences that
their flight had been like that of an army of locusts.</p>
<p>They had swept everything clean.&nbsp; There had been robbery
and fighting.&nbsp; Here and there we passed bodies by the
roadside and saw the blackened ruins of farm-houses.&nbsp; The
fences were down, and the crops had been trampled by the feet of
a multitude.&nbsp; All the vegetable patches had been rooted up
by the famished hordes.&nbsp; All the chickens and farm animals
had been slaughtered.&nbsp; This was true of all the main roads
that led out of San Francisco.&nbsp; Here and there, away from
the roads, farmers had held their own with shotguns and
revolvers, and were still holding their own.&nbsp; They warned us
away and refused to parley with us.&nbsp; And all the destruction
and violence had been done by the slum-dwellers and the upper
classes.&nbsp; The I.L.W. men, with plentiful food supplies,
remained quietly in their homes in the cities.</p>
<p>Early in the ride we received concrete proof of how desperate
was the situation.&nbsp; To the right of us we heard cries and
rifle-shots.&nbsp; Bullets whistled dangerously near.&nbsp; There
was a crashing in the underbrush; then a magnificent black
truck-horse broke across the road in front of us and was
gone.&nbsp; We had barely time to notice that he was bleeding and
lame.&nbsp; He was followed by three soldiers.&nbsp; The chase
went on among the trees on the left.&nbsp; We could hear the
soldiers calling to one another.&nbsp; A fourth soldier limped
out upon the road from the right, sat down on a boulder, and
mopped the sweat from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Militia,&rdquo; Dakon whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Deserters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man grinned up at us and asked for a match.&nbsp; In reply
to Dakon&rsquo;s &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo; he informed
us that the militiamen were deserting.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
grub,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
feedin&rsquo; it all to the regulars.&rdquo;&nbsp; We also
learned from him that the military prisoners had been released
from Alcatraz Island because they could no longer be fed.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the next sight we encountered.&nbsp; We
came upon it abruptly around a turn of the road.&nbsp; Overhead
arched the trees.&nbsp; The sunshine was filtering down through
the branches.&nbsp; Butterflies were fluttering by, and from the
fields came the song of larks.&nbsp; And there it stood, a
powerful touring car.&nbsp; About it and in it lay a number of
corpses.&nbsp; It told its own tale.&nbsp; Its occupants, fleeing
from the city, had been attacked and dragged down by a gang of
slum dwellers&mdash;hoodlums.&nbsp; The thing had occurred within
twenty-four hours.&nbsp; Freshly opened meat and fruit tins
explained the reason for the attack.&nbsp; Dakon examined the
bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; he reported.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ridden in that car.&nbsp; It was
Perriton&mdash;the whole family.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to watch
out for ourselves from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have no food with which to invite attack,&rdquo;
I objected.</p>
<p>Dakon pointed to the horse I rode, and I understood.</p>
<p>Early in the day Dakon&rsquo;s horse had cast a shoe.&nbsp;
The delicate hoof had split, and by noon the animal was
limping.&nbsp; Dakon refused to ride it farther, and refused to
desert it.&nbsp; So, on his solicitation, we went on.&nbsp; He
would lead the horse and join us at my place.&nbsp; That was the
last we saw of him; nor did we ever learn his end.</p>
<p>By one o&rsquo;clock we arrived at the town of Menlo, or,
rather, at the site of Menlo, for it was in ruins.&nbsp; Corpses
lay everywhere.&nbsp; The business part of the town, as well as
part of the residences, had been gutted by fire.&nbsp; Here and
there a residence still held out; but there was no getting near
them.&nbsp; When we approached too closely we were fired
upon.&nbsp; We met a woman who was poking about in the smoking
ruins of her cottage.&nbsp; The first attack, she told us had
been on the stores, and as she talked we could picture that
raging, roaring, hungry mob flinging itself on the handful of
townspeople.&nbsp; Millionaires and paupers had fought side by
side for the food, and then fought with one another after they
got it.&nbsp; The town of Palo Alto and Stanford University had
been sacked in similar fashion, we learned.&nbsp; Ahead of us lay
a desolate, wasted land; and we thought we were wise in turning
off to my place.&nbsp; It lay three miles to the west, snuggling
among the first rolling swells of the foothills.</p>
<p>But as we rode along we saw that the devastation was not
confined to the main roads.&nbsp; The van of the flight had kept
to the roads, sacking the small towns as it went; while those
that followed had scattered out and swept the whole countryside
like a great broom.&nbsp; My place was built of concrete,
masonry, and tiles, and so had escaped being burned, but it was
gutted clean.&nbsp; We found the gardener&rsquo;s body in the
windmill, littered around with empty shot-gun shells.&nbsp; He
had put up a good fight.&nbsp; But no trace could we find of the
two Italian labourers, nor of the house-keeper and her
husband.&nbsp; Not a live thing remained.&nbsp; The calves, the
colts, all the fancy poultry and thoroughbred stock, everything,
was gone.&nbsp; The kitchen and the fireplaces, where the mob had
cooked, were a mess, while many camp-fires outside bore witness
to the large number that had fed and spent the night.&nbsp; What
they had not eaten they had carried away.&nbsp; There was not a
bite for us.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the night vainly waiting for Dakon, and
in the morning, with our revolvers, fought off half-a-dozen
marauders.&nbsp; Then we killed one of Dakon&rsquo;s horses,
hiding for the future what meat we did not immediately eat.&nbsp;
In the afternoon Collins went out for a walk, but failed to
return.&nbsp; This was the last straw to Hanover.&nbsp; He was
for flight there and then, and I had great difficulty in
persuading him to wait for daylight.&nbsp; As for myself, I was
convinced that the end of the general strike was near, and I was
resolved to return to San Francisco.&nbsp; So, in the morning, we
parted company, Hanover heading south, fifty pounds of horse-meat
strapped to his saddle, while I, similarly loaded, headed
north.&nbsp; Little Hanover pulled through all right, and to the
end of his life he will persist, I know, in boring everybody with
the narrative of his subsequent adventures.</p>
<p>I got as far as Belmont, on the main road back, when I was
robbed of my horse-meat by three militiamen.&nbsp; There was no
change in the situation, they said, except that it was going from
bad to worse.&nbsp; The I.L.W. had plenty of provisions hidden
away and could last out for months.&nbsp; I managed to get as far
as Baden, when my horse was taken away from me by a dozen
men.&nbsp; Two of them were San Francisco policemen, and the
remainder were regular soldiers.&nbsp; This was ominous.&nbsp;
The situation was certainly extreme when the regulars were
beginning to desert.&nbsp; When I continued my way on foot, they
already had the fire started, and the last of Dakon&rsquo;s
horses lay slaughtered on the ground.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, I sprained my ankle, and succeeded in
getting no farther than South San Francisco.&nbsp; I lay there
that night in an out-house, shivering with the cold and at the
same time burning with fever.&nbsp; Two days I lay there, too
sick to move, and on the third, reeling and giddy, supporting
myself on an extemporized crutch, I tottered on toward San
Francisco.&nbsp; I was weak as well, for it was the third day
since food had passed my lips.&nbsp; It was a day of nightmare
and torment.&nbsp; As in a dream I passed hundreds of regular
soldiers drifting along in the opposite direction, and many
policemen, with their families, organized in large groups for
mutual protection.</p>
<p>As I entered the city I remembered the workman&rsquo;s house
at which I had traded the silver pitcher, and in that direction
my hunger drove me.&nbsp; Twilight was falling when I came to the
place.&nbsp; I passed around by the alleyway and crawled up the
black steps, on which I collapsed.&nbsp; I managed to reach out
with the crutch and knock on the door.&nbsp; Then I must have
fainted, for I came to in the kitchen, my face wet with water,
and whisky being poured down my throat.&nbsp; I choked and
spluttered and tried to talk.&nbsp; I began saying something
about not having any more silver pitchers, but that I would make
it up to them afterward if they would only give me something to
eat.&nbsp; But the housewife interrupted me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you poor man,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you heard?&nbsp; The strike was called off
this afternoon.&nbsp; Of course we&rsquo;ll give you something to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bustled around, opening a tin of breakfast bacon and
preparing to fry it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have some now, please,&rdquo; I begged; and I
ate the raw bacon on a slice of bread, while her husband
explained that the demands of the I.L.W. had been granted.&nbsp;
The wires had been opened up in the early afternoon, and
everywhere the employers&rsquo; associations had given in.&nbsp;
There hadn&rsquo;t been any employers left in San Francisco, but
General Folsom had spoken for them.&nbsp; The trains and steamers
would start running in the morning, and so would everything else
just as soon as system could be established.</p>
<p>And that was the end of the general strike.&nbsp; I never want
to see another one.&nbsp; It was worse than a war.&nbsp; A
general strike is a cruel and immoral thing, and the brain of man
should be capable of running industry in a more rational
way.&nbsp; Harrison is still my chauffeur.&nbsp; It was part of
the conditions of the I.L.W. that all of its members should be
reinstated in their old positions.&nbsp; Brown never came back,
but the rest of the servants are with me.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t
the heart to discharge them&mdash;poor creatures, they were
pretty hard-pressed when they deserted with the food and
silver.&nbsp; And now I can&rsquo;t discharge them.&nbsp; They
have all been unionized by the I.L.W.&nbsp; The tyranny of
organized labour is getting beyond human endurance.&nbsp;
Something must be done.</p>
<h2><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>THE
SEA-FARMER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">That</span> wull be the
doctor&rsquo;s launch,&rdquo; said Captain MacElrath.</p>
<p>The pilot grunted, while the skipper swept on with his glass
from the launch to the strip of beach and to Kingston beyond, and
then slowly across the entrance to Howth Head on the northern
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tide&rsquo;s right, and we&rsquo;ll have you docked
in two hours,&rdquo; the pilot vouchsafed, with an effort at
cheeriness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ring&rsquo;s End Basin, is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time the skipper grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dirty Dublin day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the skipper grunted.&nbsp; He was weary with the night
of wind in the Irish Channel behind him, the unbroken hours of
which he had spent on the bridge.&nbsp; And he was weary with all
the voyage behind him&mdash;two years and four months between
home port and home port, eight hundred and fifty days by his
log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proper wunter weather,&rdquo; he answered, after a
silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;The town is undistinct.&nbsp; Ut wull be
rainun&rsquo; guid an&rsquo; hearty for the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain MacElrath was a small man, just comfortably able to
peep over the canvas dodger of the bridge.&nbsp; The pilot and
third officer loomed above him, as did the man at the wheel, a
bulky German, deserted from a warship, whom he had signed on in
Rangoon.&nbsp; But his lack of inches made Captain MacElrath a no
less able man.&nbsp; At least so the Company reckoned, and so
would he have reckoned could he have had access to the carefully
and minutely compiled record of him filed away in the office
archives.&nbsp; But the Company had never given him a hint of its
faith in him.&nbsp; It was not the way of the Company, for the
Company went on the principle of never allowing an employee to
think himself indispensable or even exceedingly useful;
wherefore, while quick to censure, it never praised.&nbsp; What
was Captain MacElrath, anyway, save a skipper, one skipper of the
eighty-odd skippers that commanded the Company&rsquo;s eighty-odd
freighters on all the highways and byways of the sea?</p>
<p>Beneath them, on the main deck, two Chinese stokers were
carrying breakfast for&rsquo;ard across the rusty iron plates
that told their own grim story of weight and wash of sea.&nbsp; A
sailor was taking down the life-line that stretched from the
forecastle, past the hatches and cargo-winches, to the
bridge-deck ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rough voyage,&rdquo; suggested the pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, she was fair smokin&rsquo; ot times, but not thot
I minded thot so much as the lossin&rsquo; of time.&nbsp; I hate
like onythun&rsquo; tull loss time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Captain MacElrath turned and glanced aft, aloft and
alow, and the pilot, following his gaze, saw the mute but
convincing explanation of that loss of time.&nbsp; The
smoke-stack, buff-coloured underneath, was white with salt, while
the whistle-pipe glittered crystalline in the random sunlight
that broke for the instant through a cloud-rift.&nbsp; The port
lifeboat was missing, its iron davits, twisted and wrenched,
testifying to the mightiness of the blow that had been struck the
old <i>Tryapsic</i>.&nbsp; The starboard davits were also
empty.&nbsp; The shattered wreck of the lifeboat they had held
lay on the fiddley beside the smashed engine-room skylight, which
was covered by a tarpaulin.&nbsp; Below, to star-board, on the
bridge deck, the pilot saw the crushed mess-room door, roughly
bulkheaded against the pounding seas.&nbsp; Abreast of it, on the
smokestack guys, and being taken down by the bos&rsquo;n and a
sailor, hung the huge square of rope netting which had failed to
break those seas of their force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice afore I mentioned thot door tull the
owners,&rdquo; said Captain MacElrath.&nbsp; &ldquo;But they said
ut would do.&nbsp; There was bug seas thot time.&nbsp; They was
uncreditable bug.&nbsp; And thot buggest one dud the
domage.&nbsp; Ut fair carried away the door an&rsquo; laid ut
flat on the mess table an&rsquo; smashed out the chief&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; He was a but sore about ut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been a big un,&rdquo; the pilot
remarked sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, ut was thot.&nbsp; Thungs was lively for a
but.&nbsp; Ut finished the mate.&nbsp; He was on the brudge wuth
me, an&rsquo; I told hum tull take a look tull the wedges
o&rsquo; number one hatch.&nbsp; She was takin&rsquo; watter
freely an&rsquo; I was no sure o&rsquo; number one.&nbsp; I dudna
like the look o&rsquo; ut, an&rsquo; I was fuggerin&rsquo; maybe
tull heave to tull the marn, when she took ut over abaft the
brudge.&nbsp; My word, she was a bug one.&nbsp; We got a but of
ut ourselves on the brudge.&nbsp; I dudna miss the mate ot the
first, what o&rsquo; routin&rsquo; out Chips an&rsquo;
bulkheadun&rsquo; thot door an&rsquo; stretchun&rsquo; the
tarpaulin over the sky-light.&nbsp; Then he was nowhere to be
found.&nbsp; The men ot the wheel said as he seen hum goin&rsquo;
down the lodder just afore she hut us.&nbsp; We looked
for&rsquo;ard, we looked tull hus room, aye looked tull the
engine-room, an&rsquo; we looked along aft on the lower deck, and
there he was, on both sides the cover to the steam-pipe
runnun&rsquo; tull the after-wunches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilot ejaculated an oath of amazement and horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; the skipper went on wearily,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; on both sides the steam-pipe uz well.&nbsp; I
tell ye he was in two pieces, splut clean uz a
herrin&rsquo;.&nbsp; The sea must a-caught hum on the upper
brudge deck, carried hum clean across the fiddley, an&rsquo;
banged hum head-on tull the pipe cover.&nbsp; It sheered through
hum like so much butter, down atween the eyes, an&rsquo; along
the middle of hum, so that one leg an&rsquo; arm was fast tull
the one piece of hum, an&rsquo; one leg an&rsquo; arm fast tull
the other piece of hum.&nbsp; I tull ye ut was fair
grewsome.&nbsp; We putt hum together an&rsquo; rolled hum in
canvas uz we pulled hum out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilot swore again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ut wasna onythun&rsquo; tull greet about,&rdquo;
Captain MacElrath assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a guid
ruddance.&nbsp; He was no a sailor, thot mate-fellow.&nbsp; He
was only fut for a pugsty, an&rsquo; a dom puir apology for thot
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that there are three kinds of Irish&mdash;Catholic,
Protestant, and North-of-Ireland&mdash;and that the
North-of-Ireland Irishman is a transplanted Scotchman.&nbsp;
Captain MacElrath was a North-of-Ireland man, and, talking for
much of the world like a Scotchman, nothing aroused his ire
quicker than being mistaken for a Scotchman.&nbsp; Irish he
stoutly was, and Irish he stoutly abided, though it was with a
faint lip-lift of scorn that he mentioned mere South-of-Ireland
men, or even Orange-men.&nbsp; Himself he was Presbyterian, while
in his own community five men were all that ever mustered at a
meeting in the Orange Men&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; His community was
the Island McGill, where seven thousand of his kind lived in such
amity and sobriety that in the whole island there was but one
policeman and never a public-house at all.</p>
<p>Captain MacElrath did not like the sea, and had never liked
it.&nbsp; He wrung his livelihood from it, and that was all the
sea was, the place where he worked, as the mill, the shop, and
the counting-house were the places where other men worked.&nbsp;
Romance never sang to him her siren song, and Adventure had never
shouted in his sluggish blood.&nbsp; He lacked imagination.&nbsp;
The wonders of the deep were without significance to him.&nbsp;
Tornadoes, hurricanes, waterspouts, and tidal waves were so many
obstacles to the way of a ship on the sea and of a master on the
bridge&mdash;they were that to him, and nothing more.&nbsp; He
had seen, and yet not seen, the many marvels and wonders of far
lands.&nbsp; Under his eyelids burned the brazen glories of the
tropic seas, or ached the bitter gales of the North Atlantic or
far South Pacific; but his memory of them was of mess-room doors
stove in, of decks awash and hatches threatened, of undue coal
consumption, of long passages, and of fresh paint-work spoiled by
unexpected squalls of rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know my buzz&rsquo;ness,&rdquo; was the way he often
put it, and beyond his business was all that he did not know, all
that he had seen with the mortal eyes of him and yet that he
never dreamed existed.&nbsp; That he knew his business his owners
were convinced, or at forty he would not have held command of the
<i>Tryapsic</i>, three thousand tons net register, with a cargo
capacity of nine thousand tons and valued at fifty-thousand
pounds.</p>
<p>He had taken up seafaring through no love of it, but because
it had been his destiny, because he had been the second son of
his father instead of the first.&nbsp; Island McGill was only so
large, and the land could support but a certain definite
proportion of those that dwelt upon it.&nbsp; The balance, and a
large balance it was, was driven to the sea to seek its
bread.&nbsp; It had been so for generations.&nbsp; The eldest
sons took the farms from their fathers; to the other sons
remained the sea and its salt-ploughing.&nbsp; So it was that
Donald MacElrath, farmer&rsquo;s son and farm-boy himself, had
shifted from the soil he loved to the sea he hated and which it
was his destiny to farm.&nbsp; And farmed it he had, for twenty
years, shrewd, cool-headed, sober, industrious, and thrifty,
rising from ship&rsquo;s boy and forecastle hand to mate and
master of sailing-ships and thence into steam, second officer,
first, and master, from small command to larger, and at last to
the bridge of the old <i>Tryapsic</i>&mdash;old, to be sure, but
worth her fifty thousand pounds and still able to bear up in all
seas, and weather her nine thousand tons of freight.</p>
<p>From the bridge of the <i>Tryapsic</i>, the high place he had
gained in the competition of men, he stared at Dublin harbour
opening out, at the town obscured by the dark sky of the dreary
wind-driven day, and at the tangled tracery of spars and rigging
of the harbour shipping.&nbsp; Back from twice around the world
he was, and from interminable junketings up and down on far
stretches, home-coming to the wife he had not seen in
eight-and-twenty months, and to the child he had never seen and
that was already walking and talking.&nbsp; He saw the watch
below of stokers and trimmers bobbing out of the forecastle doors
like rabbits from a warren and making their way aft over the
rusty deck to the mustering of the port doctor.&nbsp; They were
Chinese, with expressionless, Sphinx-like faces, and they walked
in peculiar shambling fashion, dragging their feet as if the
clumsy brogans were too heavy for their lean shanks.</p>
<p>He saw them and he did not see them, as he passed his hand
beneath his visored cap and scratched reflectively his mop of
sandy hair.&nbsp; For the scene before him was but the background
in his brain for the vision of peace that was his&mdash;a vision
that was his often during long nights on the bridge when the old
<i>Tryapsic</i> wallowed on the vexed ocean floor, her decks
awash, her rigging thrumming in the gale gusts or snow squalls or
driving tropic rain.&nbsp; And the vision he saw was of farm and
farm-house and straw-thatched outbuildings, of children playing
in the sun, and the good wife at the door, of lowing kine, and
clucking fowls, and the stamp of horses in the stable, of his
father&rsquo;s farm next to him, with, beyond, the woodless,
rolling land and the hedged fields, neat and orderly, extending
to the crest of the smooth, soft hills.&nbsp; It was his vision
and his dream, his Romance and Adventure, the goal of all his
effort, the high reward for the salt-ploughing and the long, long
furrows he ran up and down the whole world around in his farming
of the sea.</p>
<p>In simple taste and homely inclination this much-travelled man
was more simple and homely than the veriest yokel.&nbsp;
Seventy-one years his father was, and had never slept a night out
of his own bed in his own house on Island McGill.&nbsp; That was
the life ideal, so Captain MacElrath considered, and he was prone
to marvel that any man, not under compulsion, should leave a farm
to go to sea.&nbsp; To this much-travelled man the whole world
was as familiar as the village to the cobbler sitting in his
shop.&nbsp; To Captain MacElrath the world was a village.&nbsp;
In his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw its streets a thousand leagues
long, aye, and longer; turnings that doubled earth&rsquo;s
stormiest headlands or were the way to quiet inland ponds;
cross-roads, taken one way, that led to flower-lands and summer
seas, and that led the other way to bitter, ceaseless gales and
the perilous bergs of the great west wind drift.&nbsp; And the
cities, bright with lights, were as shops on these long
streets&mdash;shops where business was transacted, where bunkers
were replenished, cargoes taken or shifted, and orders received
from the owners in London town to go elsewhere and beyond, ever
along the long sea-lanes, seeking new cargoes here, carrying new
cargoes there, running freights wherever shillings and pence
beckoned and underwriters did not forbid.&nbsp; But it was all a
weariness to contemplate, and, save that he wrung from it his
bread, it was without profit under the sun.</p>
<p>The last good-bye to the wife had been at Cardiff,
twenty-eight months before, when he sailed for Valparaiso with
coals&mdash;nine thousand tons and down to his marks.&nbsp; From
Valparaiso he had gone to Australia, light, a matter of six
thousand miles on end with a stormy passage and running short of
bunker coal.&nbsp; Coals again to Oregon, seven thousand miles,
and nigh as many more with general cargo for Japan and
China.&nbsp; Thence to Java, loading sugar for Marseilles, and
back along the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, and on to
Baltimore, down to her marks with crome ore, buffeted by
hurricanes, short again of bunker coal and calling at Bermuda to
replenish.&nbsp; Then a time charter, Norfolk, Virginia, loading
mysterious contraband coal and sailing for South Africa under
orders of the mysterious German supercargo put on board by the
charterers.&nbsp; On to Madagascar, steaming four knots by the
supercargo&rsquo;s orders, and the suspicion forming that the
Russian fleet might want the coal.&nbsp; Confusion and delays,
long waits at sea, international complications, the whole world
excited over the old <i>Tryapsic</i> and her cargo of contraband,
and then on to Japan and the naval port of Sassebo.&nbsp; Back to
Australia, another time charter and general merchandise picked up
at Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and carried on to Mauritius,
Louren&ccedil;o Marques, Durban, Algoa Bay, and Cape Town.&nbsp;
To Ceylon for orders, and from Ceylon to Rangoon to load rice for
Rio Janeiro.&nbsp; Thence to Buenos Aires and loading maize for
the United Kingdom or the Continent, stopping at St. Vincent, to
receive orders to proceed to Dublin.&nbsp; Two years and four
months, eight hundred and fifty days by the log, steaming up and
down the thousand-league-long sea-lanes and back again to Dublin
town.&nbsp; And he was well aweary.</p>
<p>A little tug had laid hold of the <i>Tryapsic</i>, and with
clang and clatter and shouted command, with engines half-ahead,
slow-speed, or half-astern, the battered old sea-tramp was nudged
and nosed and shouldered through the dock-gates into Ring&rsquo;s
End Basin.&nbsp; Lines were flung ashore, fore and aft, and a
&rsquo;midship spring got out.&nbsp; Already a small group of the
happy shore-staying folk had clustered on the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring off,&rdquo; Captain MacElrath commanded in his
slow thick voice; and the third officer worked the lever of the
engine-room telegraph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gangway out!&rdquo; called the second officer; and when
this was accomplished, &ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the last task of all, gangway out.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
will do&rdquo; was the dismissal.&nbsp; The voyage was ended, and
the crew shambled eagerly forward across the rusty decks to where
their sea-bags were packed and ready for the shore.&nbsp; The
taste of the land was strong in the men&rsquo;s mouths, and
strong it was in the skipper&rsquo;s mouth as he muttered a gruff
good day to the departing pilot, and himself went down to his
cabin.&nbsp; Up the gangway were trooping the customs officers,
the surveyor, the agent&rsquo;s clerk, and the stevedores.&nbsp;
Quick work disposed of these and cleared his cabin, the agent
waiting to take him to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dud ye send word tull the wife?&rdquo; had been his
greeting to the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a telegram, as soon as you were
reported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll likely be comin&rsquo; down on the
marnin&rsquo; train,&rdquo; the skipper had soliloquized, and
gone inside to change his clothes and wash.</p>
<p>He took a last glance about the room and at two photographs on
the wall, one of the wife the other of an infant&mdash;the child
he had never seen.&nbsp; He stepped out into the cabin, with its
panelled walls of cedar and maple, and with its long table that
seated ten, and at which he had eaten by himself through all the
weary time.&nbsp; No laughter and clatter and wordy argument of
the mess-room had been his.&nbsp; He had eaten silently, almost
morosely, his silence emulated by the noiseless Asiatic who had
served him.&nbsp; It came to him suddenly, the overwhelming
realization of the loneliness of those two years and more.&nbsp;
All his vexations and anxieties had been his own.&nbsp; He had
shared them with no one.&nbsp; His two young officers were too
young and flighty, the mate too stupid.&nbsp; There was no
consulting with them.&nbsp; One tenant had shared the cabin with
him, that tenant his responsibility.&nbsp; They had dined and
supped together, walked the bridge together, and together they
had bedded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och!&rdquo; he muttered to that grim companion,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quit of you, an&rsquo; wull quit . . . for a
wee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashore he passed the last of the seamen with their bags, and,
at the agent&rsquo;s, with the usual delays, put through his ship
business.&nbsp; When asked out by them to drink he took milk and
soda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no teetotaler,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;but for
the life o&rsquo; me I canna bide beer or whusky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early afternoon, when he finished paying off his crew,
he hurried to the private office where he had been told his wife
was waiting.</p>
<p>His eyes were for her first, though the temptation was great
to have more than a hurried glimpse of the child in the chair
beside her.&nbsp; He held her off from him after the long
embrace, and looked into her face long and steadily, drinking in
every feature of it and wondering that he could mark no changes
of time.&nbsp; A warm man, his wife thought him, though had the
opinion of his officers been asked it would have been: a harsh
man and a bitter one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull, Annie, how is ut wi&rsquo; ye?&rdquo; he queried,
and drew her to him again.</p>
<p>And again he held her away from him, this wife of ten years
and of whom he knew so little.&nbsp; She was almost a
stranger&mdash;more a stranger than his Chinese steward, and
certainly far more a stranger than his own officers whom he had
seen every day, day and day, for eight hundred and fifty
days.&nbsp; Married ten years, and in that time he had been with
her nine weeks&mdash;scarcely a honeymoon.&nbsp; Each time home
had been a getting acquainted again with her.&nbsp; It was the
fate of the men who went out to the salt-ploughing.&nbsp; Little
they knew of their wives and less of their children.&nbsp; There
was his chief engineer&mdash;old, near-sighted
MacPherson&mdash;who told the story of returning home to be
locked out of his house by his four-year kiddie that never had
laid eyes on him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; thus &rsquo;ull be the loddie,&rdquo; the
skipper said, reaching out a hesitant hand to the child&rsquo;s
cheek.</p>
<p>But the boy drew away from him, sheltering against the
mother&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and he doesna know his
own father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I hum.&nbsp; Heaven knows I could no a-picked hum
out of a crowd, though he&rsquo;ll be havin&rsquo; your nose
I&rsquo;m thunkun&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; your own eyes, Donald.&nbsp; Look ut
them.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s your own father, laddie.&nbsp; Kiss hum
like the little mon ye are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the child drew closer to her, his expression of fear and
distrust growing stronger, and when the father attempted to take
him in his arms he threatened to cry.</p>
<p>The skipper straightened up, and to conceal the pang at his
heart he drew out his watch and looked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ut&rsquo;s time to go, Annie,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thot train &rsquo;ull be startun&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent on the train at first, divided between watching
the wife with the child going to sleep in her arms and looking
out of the window at the tilled fields and green unforested hills
vague and indistinct in the driving drizzle that had set
in.&nbsp; They had the compartment to themselves.&nbsp; When the
boy slept she laid him out on the seat and wrapped him
warmly.&nbsp; And when the health of relatives and friends had
been inquired after, and the gossip of Island McGill narrated,
along with the weather and the price of land and crops, there was
little left to talk about save themselves, and Captain MacElrath
took up the tale brought home for the good wife from all his
world&rsquo;s-end wandering.&nbsp; But it was not a tale of
marvels he told, nor of beautiful flower-lands nor mysterious
Eastern cities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What like is Java?&rdquo; she asked once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full o&rsquo; fever.&nbsp; Half the crew down wuth ut
an&rsquo; luttle work.&nbsp; Ut was quinine an&rsquo; quinine the
whole blessed time.&nbsp; Each marnun&rsquo; &rsquo;twas quinine
an&rsquo; gin for all hands on an empty stomach.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
they who was no sick made ut out to be hovun&rsquo; ut bad uz the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another time she asked about Newcastle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coals an&rsquo; coal-dust&mdash;thot&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
No a nice sutty.&nbsp; I lost two Chinks there, stokers the both
of them.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the owners paid a fine tull the
Government of a hundred pounds each for them.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
regret tull note,&rsquo; they wrut me&mdash;I got the letter tull
Oregon&mdash;&lsquo;We regret tull note the loss o&rsquo; two
Chinese members o&rsquo; yer crew ot Newcastle, an&rsquo; we
recommend greater carefulness un the future.&rsquo;&nbsp; Greater
carefulness!&nbsp; And I could no a-been more careful.&nbsp; The
Chinks hod forty-five pounds each comun&rsquo; tull them in
wages, an&rsquo; I was no a-thunkun&rsquo; they &rsquo;ud
run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thot&rsquo;s their way&mdash;&lsquo;we regret tull

Domned cargo tank!&nbsp; An&rsquo; they would thunk I could drive
her like a <i>Lucania</i>, an&rsquo; wi&rsquo;out burnun&rsquo;

guid while for ut.&nbsp; The old one was iron, thuck on the
edges, an&rsquo; we couldna make our speed.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the

&lsquo;We regret tull note your long passage from Voloparaiso

an&rsquo; &lsquo;We are lookun&rsquo; for better results from

from Voloparaiso tull Sydney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; when I come un tull Auckland short o&rsquo;

Auckland&mdash;of course, Captun, you was never un

<p>&ldquo;But dud they say a word tull me for the fufteen pounds

<p>&ldquo;Dudna I cable them from Newcastle, tellun&rsquo; them

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; there was the motter o&rsquo; them fire-bars

<p>He communed with himself for a moment, and then muttered
indignantly: &ldquo;Tull error on fire-bars, sux
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hov ye heard of Jamie?&rdquo; his wife asked in the
pause.</p>
<p>Captain MacElrath shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was washed off the poop wuth three
seamen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off the Horn.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas on the
<i>Thornsby</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would be runnun&rsquo; homeward bound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;We only got the
word three days gone.&nbsp; His wife is greetin&rsquo; like tull

<p>&ldquo;A good lod, Jamie,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;but a
stiff one ot carryun&rsquo; on.&nbsp; I mind me when we was mates
together un the <i>Albion</i>.&nbsp; An&rsquo; so Jamie&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again a pause fell, to be broken by the wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; ye will no a-heard o&rsquo; the
<i>Bankshire</i>?&nbsp; MacDougall lost her in Magellan
Straits.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas only yesterday ut was in the
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cruel place, them Magellan Straits,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dudna thot domned mate-fellow nigh putt me

&lsquo;Funny,&rsquo; says thot mate-fellow, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m no

&lsquo;Putt your wheel hard a-starboard,&rsquo; tull the mon ot

After forty hours on the brudge, what was four hours more? I
thought.&nbsp; An&rsquo; for them four hours wull ye be

says to myself.&nbsp; An&rsquo; wuth thot I got up, hod a wash

Askthar Light.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas nor&rsquo;west-by-west, and the
old <i>Tryapsic</i> down on the shoals.&nbsp; He was a eediot,
thot mate-fellow.&nbsp; Ye could look overside an&rsquo; see the
duscoloration of the watter.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a close call for
the old <i>Tryapsic</i> I&rsquo;m tellun&rsquo; ye.&nbsp; Twice
un thirty hours he&rsquo;d a-hod her ashore uf ut hod no been for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain MacElrath fell to gazing at the sleeping child with
mild wonder in his small blue eyes, and his wife sought to divert
him from his woes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye remember Jummy MacCaul?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye went tull school wuth hus two boys.&nbsp; Old Jummy
MacCaul thot hoz the farm beyond Doctor Haythorn&rsquo;s
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aye, an&rsquo; what o&rsquo; hum?&nbsp; Uz he
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he was after askun&rsquo; your father, when he
sailed last time for Voloparaiso, uf ye&rsquo;d been there
afore.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when your father says no, then Jummy says,
&lsquo;An&rsquo; how wull he be knowun a&rsquo; tull find hus
way?&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; with thot your father says:
&lsquo;Verry sumple ut uz, Jummy.&nbsp; Supposun&rsquo; you was
goin&rsquo; tull the mainland tull a mon who luved un
Belfast.&nbsp; Belfast uz a bug sutty, Jummy, an&rsquo; how would
ye be findun&rsquo; your way?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;By way o&rsquo;
me tongue,&rsquo; says Jummy; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d be askun&rsquo;
the folk I met.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I told ye ut was
sumple,&rsquo; says your father.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ut&rsquo;s the very
same way my Donald finds the road tull Voloparaiso.&nbsp; He asks
every shup he meets upon the sea tull ot last he meets wuth a
shup thot&rsquo;s been tull Voloparaiso, an&rsquo; the captun
o&rsquo; thot shup tells hum the way.&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo;
Jummy scratches hus head an&rsquo; says he understands an&rsquo;
thot ut&rsquo;s a very sumple motter after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper chuckled at the joke, and his tired blue eyes were
merry for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a thun chap, thot mate-fellow, oz thun oz you
an&rsquo; me putt together,&rdquo; he remarked after a time, a
slight twinkle in his eye of appreciation of the bull.&nbsp; But
the twinkle quickly disappeared and the blue eyes took on a bleak
and wintry look.&nbsp; &ldquo;What dud he do ot Voloparaiso but
land sux hundred fathom o&rsquo; chain cable an&rsquo; take never
a receipt from the lighter-mon.&nbsp; I was gettun&rsquo; my
clearance ot the time.&nbsp; When we got tull sea, I found he hod
no receipt for the cable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; ye no took a receipt for ut?&rsquo;
says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wasna ut

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How long ha&rsquo; ye been goin&rsquo; tull

What&rsquo;s tull stop the lighter-mon from stealun&rsquo; a few
lengths o&rsquo; ut?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; ut come out uz I said.&nbsp; Sux hundred
went over the side, but four hundred an&rsquo;
ninety-five was all the agents received.&nbsp; The lighter-mon
swore ut was all he received from the mate&mdash;four hundred
an&rsquo; ninety-five fathom.&nbsp; I got a letter from the
owners ot Portland.&nbsp; They no blamed the mate for ut, but me,
an&rsquo; me ashore ot the time on shup&rsquo;s
buzz&rsquo;ness.&nbsp; I could no be in the two places ot the one
time.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the letters from the owners an&rsquo; the
agents uz still comun&rsquo; tull me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thot mate-fellow was no a proper sailor, an&rsquo; no a
mon tull work for owners.&nbsp; Dudna he want tull break me wuth
the Board of Trade for bein&rsquo; below my marks?&nbsp; He said
as much tull the bos&rsquo;n.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he told me tull my
face homeward bound thot I&rsquo;d been half an inch under my

mate-fellow untendun&rsquo; tull report me tull the Board
o&rsquo; Trade, only for thot he saw fut tull be sliced un two
pieces on the steam-pipe cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a fool.&nbsp; After loadun&rsquo; ot Portland I
hod tull take on suxty tons o&rsquo; coal tull last me tull
Comox.&nbsp; The charges for lighterun&rsquo; was heavy,
an&rsquo; no room ot the coal dock.&nbsp; A French barque was
lyin&rsquo; alongside the dock an&rsquo; I spoke tull the captun,
askun&rsquo; hum what he would charge when work for the day was
done, tull haul clear for a couple o&rsquo; hours an&rsquo; let

savun&rsquo; money on lighters tull the owner, an&rsquo; I gave
ut tull hum.&nbsp; An&rsquo; thot night, after dark, I hauled un
an&rsquo; took on the coal.&nbsp; Then I started tull go out un
the stream an&rsquo; drop anchor&mdash;under me own steam, of

<p>&ldquo;We hod tull go out stern first, an&rsquo;
somethun&rsquo; went wrong wuth the reversun&rsquo; gear.&nbsp;
Old MacPherson said he could work ut by hond, but very slow ot
thot.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I said &lsquo;All right.&rsquo;&nbsp; We
started.&nbsp; The pilot was on board.&nbsp; The tide was
ebbun&rsquo; stuffly, an&rsquo; right abreast an&rsquo; a but
below was a shup lyin&rsquo; wuth a lighter on each side.&nbsp; I
saw the shup&rsquo;s ridun&rsquo; lights, but never a light on
the lighters.&nbsp; Ut was close quarters to shuft a bug vessel
onder steam, wuth MacPherson workun&rsquo; the reversun&rsquo;

I could go ahead an&rsquo; clear o&rsquo; the shups on the
dock-ends.&nbsp; An&rsquo; we struck the lighter stern-on, just
uz I rung tull MacPherson half ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What was thot?&rsquo; says the pilot, when we
struck the lighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I dunna know,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m wonderun&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pilot was no keen, ye see, tull hus job.&nbsp; I

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What lighter?&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thot lighter alongside the shup,&rsquo; says the
mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I dudna see no lighter,&rsquo; says I, and wuth

<p>&ldquo;After the pilot was gone I says tull the mate:

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But ye dud smash thot lighter, dudn&rsquo;t

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Uf we dud,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;ut&rsquo;s no

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; next marnun&rsquo;, just uz I&rsquo;m after

<p>&ldquo;He was the owner of the lighter, an&rsquo; when he hod

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, mon?&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;No see a

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was goin&rsquo; by the shup&rsquo;s

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But ye dud touch the lighter,&rsquo; says

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, muster,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;when

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The mate says&mdash;&rsquo; he beguns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Domn the mate,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dud

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, ut dud not,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;but ut

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; thot was the end o&rsquo; ut.&nbsp; But ut

blessun&rsquo; for all masters thot he was sliced un two on thot
steam-pipe cover.&nbsp; He had a pull un the office an&rsquo;
thot was the why he was kept on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wekley farm wull soon be for sale, so the agents be
tellun&rsquo; me,&rdquo; his wife remarked, slyly watching what
effect her announcement would have upon him.</p>
<p>His eyes flashed eagerly on the instant, and he straightened
up as might a man about to engage in some agreeable task.&nbsp;
It was the farm of his vision, adjoining his father&rsquo;s, and
her own people farmed not a mile away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wull be buyun&rsquo; ut,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;though we wull be no tellun&rsquo; a soul of ut ontul
ut&rsquo;s bought an&rsquo; the money paid down.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
savun&rsquo; consuderable these days, though pickun&rsquo;s uz no

by.&nbsp; I wull see the father an&rsquo; hove the money ready
tull hus hond, so uf I&rsquo;m ot sea he can buy whenever the
land offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rubbed the frosted moisture from the inside of the window
and peered out at the pouring rain, through which he could
discern nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a young men I used tull be afeard thot the
owners would guv me the sack.&nbsp; Stull afeard I am of the
sack.&nbsp; But once thot farm is mine I wull no be afeard ony
longer.&nbsp; Ut&rsquo;s a puir job thus sea-farmun&rsquo;.&nbsp;

thousand pounds, half a million dollars uz the Yankees say,
an&rsquo; me wuth all the responsubility gettun&rsquo; a screw
o&rsquo; twenty pounds a month.&nbsp; What mon ashore,
managin&rsquo; a buz&rsquo;ness worth a hundred thousand pounds

An&rsquo; wuth such masters uz a captun serves&mdash;the owners,

passages an&rsquo; caution always meanun&rsquo; delay.&nbsp;
Three dufferent masters, an&rsquo; all three able an&rsquo;
wullun&rsquo; to break ye uf ye don&rsquo;t serve their dufferent
wushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt the train slackening speed, and peered again through
the misty window.&nbsp; He stood up, buttoned his overcoat,
turned up the collar, and awkwardly gathered the child, still
asleep, in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wull see the father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
hov the money ready tull hus hond so uf I&rsquo;m ot sea when the
land offers he wull no muss the chance tull buy.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
then the owners can guv me the sack uz soon uz they like.&nbsp;
Ut will be all night un, an&rsquo; I wull be wuth you, Annie,
an&rsquo; the sea can go tull hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happiness was in both their faces at the prospect, and for a
moment both saw the same vision of peace.&nbsp; Annie leaned
toward him, and as the train stopped they kissed each other
across the sleeping child.</p>

161</span>SAMUEL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Margaret Henan</span> would have been a
striking figure under any circumstances, but never more so than
when I first chanced upon her, a sack of grain of fully a
hundredweight on her shoulder, as she walked with sure though
tottering stride from the cart-tail to the stable, pausing for an
instant to gather strength at the foot of the steep steps that
led to the grain-bin.&nbsp; There were four of these steps, and
she went up them, a step at a time, slowly, unwaveringly, and
with so dogged certitude that it never entered my mind that her
strength could fail her and let that hundred-weight sack fall
from the lean and withered frame that wellnigh doubled under
it.&nbsp; For she was patently an old woman, and it was her age
that made me linger by the cart and watch.</p>
<p>Six times she went between the cart and the stable, each time
with a full sack on her back, and beyond passing the time of day
with me she took no notice of my presence.&nbsp; Then, the cart
empty, she fumbled for matches and lighted a short clay pipe,
pressing down the burning surface of the tobacco with a calloused
and apparently nerveless thumb.&nbsp; The hands were
noteworthy.&nbsp; They were large-knuckled, sinewy and malformed
by labour, rimed with callouses, the nails blunt and broken, and
with here and there cuts and bruises, healed and healing, such as
are common to the hands of hard-working men.&nbsp; On the back
were huge, upstanding veins, eloquent of age and toil.&nbsp;
Looking at them, it was hard to believe that they were the hands
of the woman who had once been the belle of Island McGill.&nbsp;
This last, of course, I learned later.&nbsp; At the time I knew
neither her history nor her identity.</p>
<p>She wore heavy man&rsquo;s brogans.&nbsp; Her legs were
stockingless, and I had noticed when she walked that her bare
feet were thrust into the crinkly, iron-like shoes that sloshed
about her lean ankles at every step.&nbsp; Her figure, shapeless
and waistless, was garbed in a rough man&rsquo;s shirt and in a
ragged flannel petticoat that had once been red.&nbsp; But it was
her face, wrinkled, withered and weather-beaten, surrounded by an
aureole of unkempt and straggling wisps of greyish hair, that
caught and held me.&nbsp; Neither drifted hair nor serried
wrinkles could hide the splendid dome of a forehead, high and
broad without verging in the slightest on the abnormal.</p>
<p>The sunken cheeks and pinched nose told little of the quality
of the life that flickered behind those clear blue eyes of
hers.&nbsp; Despite the minuti&aelig; of wrinkle-work that
somehow failed to weazen them, her eyes were clear as a
girl&rsquo;s&mdash;clear, out-looking, and far-seeing, and with
an open and unblinking steadfastness of gaze that was
disconcerting.&nbsp; The remarkable thing was the distance
between them.&nbsp; It is a lucky man or woman who has the width
of an eye between, but with Margaret Henan the width between her
eyes was fully that of an eye and a half.&nbsp; Yet so
symmetrically moulded was her face that this remarkable feature
produced no uncanny effect, and, for that matter, would have
escaped the casual observer&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; The mouth,
shapeless and toothless, with down-turned corners and lips dry
and parchment-like, nevertheless lacked the muscular slackness so
usual with age.&nbsp; The lips might have been those of a mummy,
save for that impression of rigid firmness they gave.&nbsp; Not
that they were atrophied.&nbsp; On the contrary, they seemed
tense and set with a muscular and spiritual determination.&nbsp;
There, and in the eyes, was the secret of the certitude with
which she carried the heavy sacks up the steep steps, with never
a false step or overbalance, and emptied them in the
grain-bin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an old woman to be working like this,&rdquo; I
ventured.</p>
<p>She looked at me with that strange, unblinking gaze, and she
thought and spoke with the slow deliberateness that characterized
everything about her, as if well aware of an eternity that was
hers and in which there was no need for haste.&nbsp; Again I was
impressed by the enormous certitude of her.&nbsp; In this
eternity that seemed so indubitably hers, there was time and to
spare for safe-footing and stable equilibrium&mdash;for
certitude, in short.&nbsp; No more in her spiritual life than in
carrying the hundredweights of grain was there a possibility of a
misstep or an overbalancing.&nbsp; The feeling produced in me was
uncanny.&nbsp; Here was a human soul that, save for the most
glimmering of contacts, was beyond the humanness of me.&nbsp; And
the more I learned of Margaret Henan in the weeks that followed
the more mysteriously remote she became.&nbsp; She was as alien
as a far-journeyer from some other star, and no hint could she
nor all the countryside give me of what forms of living, what
heats of feeling, or rules of philosophic contemplation actuated
her in all that she had been and was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wull be suvunty-two come Guid Friday a
fortnight,&rdquo; she said in reply to my question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are an old woman to be doing this man&rsquo;s
work, and a strong man&rsquo;s work at that,&rdquo; I
insisted.</p>
<p>Again she seemed to immerse herself in that atmosphere of
contemplative eternity, and so strangely did it affect me that I
should not have been surprised to have awaked a century or so
later and found her just beginning to enunciate her
reply&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work hoz tull be done, an&rsquo; I am beholden tull
no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you no children, no family,
relations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aye, a-plenty o&rsquo; them, but they no see fut
tull be helpun&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew out her pipe for a moment, then added, with a nod of
her head toward the house, &ldquo;I luv&rsquo; wuth
meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the house, straw-thatched and commodious, at the
large stable, and at the large array of fields I knew must belong
with the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a big bit of land for you to farm by
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aye, a bug but, suvunty acres.&nbsp; Ut kept me old
mon buzzy, along wuth a son an&rsquo; a hired mon, tull say
naught o&rsquo; extra honds un the harvest an&rsquo; a
maid-servant un the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clambered into the cart, gathered the reins in her hands,
and quizzed me with her keen, shrewd eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belike ye hail from over the watter&mdash;Ameruky,
I&rsquo;m meanun&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a Yankee,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye wull no be findun&rsquo; mony Island McGill folk
stoppun&rsquo; un Ameruky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t remember ever meeting one, in the
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are home-luvun&rsquo; bodies, though I wull no be
sayin&rsquo; they are no fair-travelled.&nbsp; Yet they come home
ot the last, them oz are no lost ot sea or kult by fevers
an&rsquo; such-like un foreign parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your sons will have gone to sea and come home
again?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aye, all savun&rsquo; Samuel oz was
drownded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of Samuel I could have sworn to a strange light
in her eyes, and it seemed to me, as by some telepathic flash,
that I divined in her a tremendous wistfulness, an immense
yearning.&nbsp; It seemed to me that here was the key to her
inscrutableness, the clue that if followed properly would make
all her strangeness plain.&nbsp; It came to me that here was a
contact and that for the moment I was glimpsing into the soul of
her.&nbsp; The question was tickling on my tongue, but she
forestalled me.</p>
<p>She <i>tchk&rsquo;d</i> to the horse, and with a &ldquo;Guid
day tull you, sir,&rdquo; drove off.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A simple, homely people are the folk of Island McGill, and I
doubt if a more sober, thrifty, and industrious folk is to be
found in all the world.&nbsp; Meeting them abroad&mdash;and to
meet them abroad one must meet them on the sea, for a hybrid
seafaring and farmer breed are they&mdash;one would never take
them to be Irish.&nbsp; Irish they claim to be, speaking of the
North of Ireland with pride and sneering at their Scottish
brothers; yet Scotch they undoubtedly are, transplanted Scotch of
long ago, it is true, but none the less Scotch, with a thousand
traits, to say nothing of their tricks of speech and woolly
utterance, which nothing less than their Scotch clannishness
could have preserved to this late day.</p>
<p>A narrow loch, scarcely half a mile wide, separates Island
McGill from the mainland of Ireland; and, once across this loch,
one finds himself in an entirely different country.&nbsp; The
Scotch impression is strong, and the people, to commence with,
are Presbyterians.&nbsp; When it is considered that there is no
public-house in all the island and that seven thousand souls
dwell therein, some idea may be gained of the temperateness of
the community.&nbsp; Wedded to old ways, public opinion and the
ministers are powerful influences, while fathers and mothers are
revered and obeyed as in few other places in this modern
world.&nbsp; Courting lasts never later than ten at night, and no
girl walks out with her young man without her parents&rsquo;
knowledge and consent.</p>
<p>The young men go down to the sea and sow their wild oats in
the wicked ports, returning periodically, between voyages, to
live the old intensive morality, to court till ten o&rsquo;clock,
to sit under the minister each Sunday, and to listen at home to
the same stern precepts that the elders preached to them from the
time they were laddies.&nbsp; Much they learned of women in the
ends of the earth, these seafaring sons, yet a canny wisdom was
theirs and they never brought wives home with them.&nbsp; The one
solitary exception to this had been the schoolmaster, who had
been guilty of bringing a wife from half a mile the other side of
the loch.&nbsp; For this he had never been forgiven, and he
rested under a cloud for the remainder of his days.&nbsp; At his
death the wife went back across the loch to her own people, and
the blot on the escutcheon of Island McGill was erased.&nbsp; In
the end the sailor-men married girls of their own homeland and
settled down to become exemplars of all the virtues for which the
island was noted.</p>
<p>Island McGill was without a history.&nbsp; She boasted none of
the events that go to make history.&nbsp; There had never been
any wearing of the green, any Fenian conspiracies, any land
disturbances.&nbsp; There had been but one eviction, and that
purely technical&mdash;a test case, and on advice of the
tenant&rsquo;s lawyer.&nbsp; So Island McGill was without
annals.&nbsp; History had passed her by.&nbsp;&nbsp; She paid her
taxes, acknowledged her crowned rulers, and left the world alone;
all she asked in return was that the world should leave her
alone.&nbsp; The world was composed of two parts&mdash;Island
McGill and the rest of it.&nbsp; And whatever was not Island
McGill was outlandish and barbarian; and well she knew, for did
not her seafaring sons bring home report of that world and its
ungodly ways?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was from the skipper of a Glasgow tramp, as passenger from
Colombo to Rangoon, that I had first learned of the existence of
Island McGill; and it was from him that I had carried the letter
that gave me entrance to the house of Mrs. Ross, widow of a
master mariner, with a daughter living with her and with two
sons, master mariners themselves and out upon the sea.&nbsp; Mrs.
Ross did not take in boarders, and it was Captain Ross&rsquo;s
letter alone that had enabled me to get from her bed and
board.&nbsp; In the evening, after my encounter with Margaret
Henan, I questioned Mrs. Ross, and I knew on the instant that I
had in truth stumbled upon mystery.</p>
<p>Like all Island McGill folk, as I was soon to discover, Mrs.
Ross was at first averse to discussing Margaret Henan at
all.&nbsp; Yet it was from her I learned that evening that
Margaret Henan had once been one of the island belles.&nbsp;
Herself the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, she had married
Thomas Henan, equally well-to-do.&nbsp; Beyond the usual
housewife&rsquo;s tasks she had never been accustomed to
work.&nbsp; Unlike many of the island women, she had never lent a
hand in the fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of her children?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two o&rsquo; the sons, Jamie an&rsquo; Timothy uz
married an&rsquo; be goun&rsquo; tull sea.&nbsp; Thot bug house
close tull the post office uz Jamie&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The daughters
thot ha&rsquo; no married be luvun&rsquo; wuth them as dud
marry.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the rest be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Samuels,&rdquo; Clara interpolated, with what I
suspected was a giggle.</p>
<p>She was Mrs. Ross&rsquo;s daughter, a strapping young woman
with handsome features and remarkably handsome black eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tuz naught to be smuckerun&rsquo; ot,&rdquo; her
mother reproved her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Samuels?&rdquo; I intervened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her four sons thot died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were they all named Samuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; I commented in the lagging silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very strange,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross affirmed, proceeding
stolidly with the knitting of the woollen singlet on her
knees&mdash;one of the countless under-garments that she
interminably knitted for her skipper sons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was only the Samuels that died?&rdquo; I
queried, in further attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others luved,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
fine fomuly&mdash;no finer on the island.&nbsp; No better lods
ever sailed out of Island McGill.&nbsp; The munuster held them up
oz models tull pottern after.&nbsp; Nor was ever a whusper
breathed again&rsquo; the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why is she left alone now in her old age?&rdquo; I
persisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t her own flesh and blood
look after her?&nbsp; Why does she live alone?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
they ever go to see her or care for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a one un twenty years an&rsquo; more now.&nbsp;
She fetched ut on tull herself.&nbsp; She drove them from the
house just oz she drove old Tom Henan, thot was her husband, tull
hus death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink?&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ross shook her head scornfully, as if drink was a
weakness beneath the weakest of Island McGill.</p>
<p>A long pause followed, during which Mrs. Ross knitted stolidly
on, only nodding permission when Clara&rsquo;s young man, mate on
one of the Shire Line sailing ships, came to walk out with
her.&nbsp; I studied the half-dozen ostrich eggs, hanging in the
corner against the wall like a cluster of some monstrous
fruit.&nbsp; On each shell were painted precipitous and
impossible seas through which full-rigged ships foamed with a
lack of perspective only equalled by their sharp technical
perfection.&nbsp; On the mantelpiece stood two large pearl
shells, obviously a pair, intricately carved by the patient hands
of New Caledonian convicts.&nbsp; In the centre of the mantel was
a stuffed bird-of-paradise, while about the room were scattered
gorgeous shells from the southern seas, delicate sprays of coral
sprouting from barnacled <i>pi-pi</i> shells and cased in glass,
assegais from South Africa, stone axes from New Guinea, huge
Alaskan tobacco-pouches beaded with heraldic totem designs, a
boomerang from Australia, divers ships in glass bottles, a
cannibal <i>kai-kai</i> bowl from the Marquesas, and fragile
cabinets from China and the Indies and inlaid with
mother-of-pearl and precious woods.</p>
<p>I gazed at this varied trove brought home by sailor sons, and
pondered the mystery of Margaret Henan, who had driven her
husband to his death and been forsaken by all her kin.&nbsp; It
was not the drink.&nbsp; Then what was it?&mdash;some shocking
cruelty? some amazing infidelity? or some fearful, old-world
peasant-crime?</p>
<p>I broached my theories, but to all Mrs. Ross shook her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ut was no thot,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Margaret
was a guid wife an&rsquo; a guid mother, an&rsquo; I doubt she
would harm a fly.&nbsp; She brought up her fomuly
God-fearin&rsquo; an&rsquo; decent-minded.&nbsp; Her trouble was
thot she took lunatic&mdash;turned eediot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ross tapped significantly on her forehead to indicate a
state of addlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I talked with her this afternoon,&rdquo; I
objected, &ldquo;and I found her a sensible
woman&mdash;remarkably bright for one of her years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m grantun&rsquo; all thot you
say,&rdquo; she went on calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I am no
referrun&rsquo; tull thot.&nbsp; I am referrun&rsquo; tull her
wucked-headed an&rsquo; vucious stubbornness.&nbsp; No more
stubborn woman ever luv&rsquo;d than Margaret Henan.&nbsp; Ut was
all on account o&rsquo; Samuel, which was the name o&rsquo; her
youngest an&rsquo; they do say her favourut brother&mdash;hum oz
died by hus own hond all through the munuster&rsquo;s mustake un
no registerun&rsquo; the new church ot Dublin.&nbsp; Ut was a
lesson thot the name was musfortunate, but she would no take ut,
an&rsquo; there was talk when she called her first child
Samuel&mdash;hum thot died o&rsquo; the croup.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
wuth thot what does she do but call the next one Samuel,
an&rsquo; hum only three when he fell un tull the tub o&rsquo;
hot watter an&rsquo; was plain cooked tull death.&nbsp; Ut all
come, I tell you, o&rsquo; her wucked-headed an&rsquo; foolush
stubbornness.&nbsp; For a Samuel she must hov; an&rsquo; ut was
the death of the four of her sons.&nbsp; After the first, dudna
her own mother go down un the dirt tull her feet, a-beggun&rsquo;
an&rsquo; pleadun&rsquo; wuth her no tull name her next one
Samuel?&nbsp; But she was no tull be turned from her
purpose.&nbsp; Margaret Henan was always set on her ways,
an&rsquo; never more so thon on thot name Samuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was fair lunatuc on Samuel.&nbsp; Dudna her
neighbours&rsquo; an&rsquo; all kuth an&rsquo; kun savun&rsquo;
them thot luv&rsquo;d un the house wuth her, get up an&rsquo;
walk out ot the christenun&rsquo; of the second&mdash;hum thot
was cooked?&nbsp; Thot they dud, an&rsquo; ot the very moment the
munuster asked what would the bairn&rsquo;s name be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Samuel,&rsquo; says she; an&rsquo; wuth thot they got up
an&rsquo; walked out an&rsquo; left the house.&nbsp; An&rsquo; ot
the door dudna her Aunt Fannie, her mother&rsquo;s suster, turn
an&rsquo; say loud for all tull hear: &lsquo;What for wull she be
wantun&rsquo; tull murder the wee thing?&rsquo;&nbsp; The
munuster heard fine, an&rsquo; dudna like ut, but, oz he told my
Larry afterward, what could he do?&nbsp; Ut was the woman&rsquo;s
wush, an&rsquo; there was no law again&rsquo; a mother
callun&rsquo; her child accordun&rsquo; tull her wush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; then was there no the third Samuel?&nbsp;
An&rsquo; when he was lost ot sea off the Cape, dudna she break
all laws o&rsquo; nature tull hov a fourth?&nbsp; She was
forty-seven, I&rsquo;m tellun&rsquo; ye, an&rsquo; she hod a
child ot forty-seven.&nbsp; Thunk on ut!&nbsp; Ot
forty-seven!&nbsp; Ut was fair scand&rsquo;lous.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From Clara, next morning, I got the tale of Margaret
Henan&rsquo;s favourite brother; and from here and there, in the
week that followed, I pieced together the tragedy of Margaret
Henan.&nbsp; Samuel Dundee had been the youngest of
Margaret&rsquo;s four brothers, and, as Clara told me, she had
well-nigh worshipped him.&nbsp; He was going to sea at the time,
skipper of one of the sailing ships of the Bank Line, when he
married Agnes Hewitt.&nbsp; She was described as a slender wisp
of a girl, delicately featured and with a nervous organization of
the supersensitive order.&nbsp; Theirs had been the first
marriage in the &ldquo;new&rdquo; church, and after a
two-weeks&rsquo; honeymoon Samuel had kissed his bride good-bye
and sailed in command of the <i>Loughbank</i>, a big four-masted
barque.</p>
<p>And it was because of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; church that the
minister&rsquo;s blunder occurred.&nbsp; Nor was it the blunder
of the minister alone, as one of the elders later explained; for
it was equally the blunder of the whole Presbytery of Coughleen,
which included fifteen churches on Island McGill and the
mainland.&nbsp; The old church, beyond repair, had been torn down
and the new one built on the original foundation.&nbsp; Looking
upon the foundation-stones as similar to a ship&rsquo;s keel, it
never entered the minister&rsquo;s nor the Presbytery&rsquo;s
head that the new church was legally any other than the old
church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; three couples was married the first week un
the new church,&rdquo; Clara said.&nbsp; &ldquo;First of all,
Samuel Dundee an&rsquo; Agnes Hewitt; the next day Albert Mahan
an&rsquo; Minnie Duncan; an&rsquo; by the week-end Eddie Troy and
Flo Mackintosh&mdash;all sailor-men, an&rsquo; un sux
weeks&rsquo; time the last of them back tull their ships
an&rsquo; awa&rsquo;, an&rsquo; no one o&rsquo; them
dreamin&rsquo; of the wuckedness they&rsquo;d been ot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Imp of the Perverse must have chuckled at the
situation.&nbsp; All things favoured.&nbsp; The marriages had
taken place in the first week of May, and it was not till three
months later that the minister, as required by law, made his
quarterly report to the civil authorities in Dublin.&nbsp;
Promptly came back the announcement that his church had no legal
existence, not being registered according to the law&rsquo;s
demands.&nbsp; This was overcome by prompt registration; but the
marriages were not to be so easily remedied.&nbsp; The three
sailor husbands were away, and their wives, in short, were not
their wives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the munuster was no for alarmin&rsquo; the
bodies,&rdquo; said Clara.&nbsp; &ldquo;He kept hus council
an&rsquo; bided hus time, waitun&rsquo; for the lods tull be back
from sea.&nbsp; Oz luck would have ut, he was away across the
island tull a christenun&rsquo; when Albert Mahan arrives home
onexpected, hus shup just docked ot Dublin.&nbsp; Ut&rsquo;s nine
o&rsquo;clock ot night when the munuster, un hus sluppers
an&rsquo; dressun&rsquo;-gown, gets the news.&nbsp; Up he jumps
an&rsquo; calls for horse an&rsquo; saddle, an&rsquo; awa&rsquo;
he goes like the wund for Albert Mahan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Albert uz
just goun&rsquo; tull bed an&rsquo; hoz one shoe off when the
munuster arrives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come wuth me, the pair o&rsquo; ye,&rsquo; says
he, breathless-like.&nbsp; &lsquo;What for, an&rsquo; me dead
weary an&rsquo; goun&rsquo; tull bed?&rsquo; says Albert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yull be lawful married,&rsquo; says the munuster.&nbsp;
Albert looks black an&rsquo; says, &lsquo;Now, munuster, ye wull
be jokun&rsquo;,&rsquo; but tull humself, oz I&rsquo;ve heard hum
tell mony a time, he uz wonderun&rsquo; thot the munuster should
a-took tull whusky ot hus time o&rsquo; life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;We be no married?&rsquo; says Minnie.&nbsp; He
shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;An&rsquo; I om no Mussus
Mahan?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;ye are no
Mussus Mahan.&nbsp; Ye are plain Muss Duncan.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;But ye married &rsquo;us yoursel&rsquo;,&rsquo; says
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dud an&rsquo; I dudna,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; wuth thot he tells them the whole upshot, an&rsquo;
Albert puts on hus shoe, an&rsquo; they go wuth the munuster
an&rsquo; are married proper an&rsquo; lawful, an&rsquo; oz
Albert Mahan says afterward mony&rsquo;s the time,
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tus no every mon thot hoz two weddun&rsquo; nights
on Island McGill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six months later Eddie Troy came home and was promptly
remarried.&nbsp; But Samuel Dundee was away on a
three-years&rsquo; voyage and his ship fell overdue.&nbsp;
Further to complicate the situation, a baby boy, past two years
old, was waiting for him in the arms of his wife.&nbsp; The
months passed, and the wife grew thin with worrying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ut&rsquo;s no meself I&rsquo;m thunkun&rsquo; on,&rdquo;
she is reported to have said many times, &ldquo;but ut&rsquo;s
the puir fatherless bairn.&nbsp; Uf aught happened tull Samuel
where wull the bairn stond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lloyd&rsquo;s posted the <i>Loughbank</i> as missing, and the
owners ceased the monthly remittance of Samuel&rsquo;s half-pay
to his wife.&nbsp; It was the question of the child&rsquo;s
legitimacy that preyed on her mind, and, when all hope of
Samuel&rsquo;s return was abandoned, she drowned herself and the
child in the loch.&nbsp; And here enters the greater
tragedy.&nbsp; The <i>Loughbank</i> was not lost.&nbsp; By a
series of sea disasters and delays too interminable to relate,
she had made one of those long, unsighted passages such as occur
once or twice in half a century.&nbsp; How the Imp must have held
both his sides!&nbsp; Back from the sea came Samuel, and when
they broke the news to him something else broke somewhere in his
heart or head.&nbsp; Next morning they found him where he had
tried to kill himself across the grave of his wife and
child.&nbsp; Never in the history of Island McGill was there so
fearful a death-bed.&nbsp; He spat in the minister&rsquo;s face
and reviled him, and died blaspheming so terribly that those that
tended on him did so with averted gaze and trembling hands.</p>
<p>And, in the face of all this, Margaret Henan named her first
child Samuel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>How account for the woman&rsquo;s stubbornness?&nbsp; Or was
it a morbid obsession that demanded a child of hers should be
named Samuel?&nbsp; Her third child was a girl, named after
herself, and the fourth was a boy again.&nbsp; Despite the
strokes of fate that had already bereft her, and despite the loss
of friends and relatives, she persisted in her resolve to name
the child after her brother.&nbsp; She was shunned at church by
those who had grown up with her.&nbsp; Her mother, after a final
appeal, left her house with the warning that if the child were so
named she would never speak to her again.&nbsp; And though the
old lady lived thirty-odd years longer she kept her word.&nbsp;
The minister agreed to christen the child any name but Samuel,
and every other minister on Island McGill refused to christen it
by the name she had chosen.&nbsp; There was talk on the part of
Margaret Henan of going to law at the time, but in the end she
carried the child to Belfast and there had it christened
Samuel.</p>
<p>And then nothing happened.&nbsp; The whole island was
confuted.&nbsp; The boy grew and prospered.&nbsp; The
schoolmaster never ceased averring that it was the brightest lad
he had ever seen.&nbsp; Samuel had a splendid constitution, a
tremendous grip on life.&nbsp; To everybody&rsquo;s amazement he
escaped the usual run of childish afflictions.&nbsp; Measles,
whooping-cough and mumps knew him not.&nbsp; He was armour-clad
against germs, immune to all disease.&nbsp; Headaches and
earaches were things unknown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never so much oz a
boil or a pumple,&rdquo; as one of the old bodies told me, ever
marred his healthy skin.&nbsp; He broke school records in
scholarship and athletics, and whipped every boy of his size or
years on Island McGill.</p>
<p>It was a triumph for Margaret Henan.&nbsp; This paragon was
hers, and it bore the cherished name.&nbsp; With the one
exception of her mother, friends and relatives drifted back and
acknowledged that they had been mistaken; though there were old
crones who still abided by their opinion and who shook their
heads ominously over their cups of tea.&nbsp; The boy was too
wonderful to last.&nbsp; There was no escaping the curse of the
name his mother had wickedly laid upon him.&nbsp; The young
generation joined Margaret Henan in laughing at them, but the old
crones continued to shake their heads.</p>
<p>Other children followed.&nbsp; Margaret Henan&rsquo;s fifth
was a boy, whom she called Jamie, and in rapid succession
followed three girls, Alice, Sara, and Nora, the boy Timothy, and
two more girls, Florence and Katie.&nbsp; Katie was the last and
eleventh, and Margaret Henan, at thirty-five, ceased from her
exertions.&nbsp; She had done well by Island McGill and the
Queen.&nbsp; Nine healthy children were hers.&nbsp; All
prospered.&nbsp; It seemed her ill-luck had shot its bolt with
the deaths of her first two.&nbsp; Nine lived, and one of them
was named Samuel.</p>
<p>Jamie elected to follow the sea, though it was not so much a
matter of election as compulsion, for the eldest sons on Island
McGill remained on the land, while all other sons went to the
salt-ploughing.&nbsp; Timothy followed Jamie, and by the time the
latter had got his first command, a steamer in the Bay trade out
of Cardiff, Timothy was mate of a big sailing ship.&nbsp; Samuel,
however, did not take kindly to the soil.&nbsp; The
farmer&rsquo;s life had no attraction for him.&nbsp; His brothers
went to sea, not out of desire, but because it was the only way
for them to gain their bread; and he, who had no need to go,
envied them when, returned from far voyages, they sat by the
kitchen fire, and told their bold tales of the wonderlands beyond
the sea-rim.</p>
<p>Samuel became a teacher, much to his father&rsquo;s disgust,
and even took extra certificates, going to Belfast for his
examinations.&nbsp; When the old master retired, Samuel took over
his school.&nbsp; Secretly, however, he studied navigation, and
it was Margaret&rsquo;s delight when he sat by the kitchen fire,
and, despite their master&rsquo;s tickets, tangled up his
brothers in the theoretics of their profession.&nbsp; Tom Henan
alone was outraged when Samuel, school teacher, gentleman, and
heir to the Henan farm, shipped to sea before the mast.&nbsp;
Margaret had an abiding faith in her son&rsquo;s star, and
whatever he did she was sure was for the best.&nbsp; Like
everything else connected with his glorious personality, there
had never been known so swift a rise as in the case of
Samuel.&nbsp; Barely with two years&rsquo; sea experience before
the mast, he was taken from the forecastle and made a provisional
second mate.&nbsp; This occurred in a fever port on the West
Coast, and the committee of skippers that examined him agreed
that he knew more of the science of navigation than they had
remembered or forgotten.&nbsp; Two years later he sailed from
Liverpool, mate of the <i>Starry Grace</i>, with both
master&rsquo;s and extra-master&rsquo;s tickets in his
possession.&nbsp; And then it happened&mdash;the thing the old
crones had been shaking their heads over for years.</p>
<p>It was told me by Gavin McNab, bos&rsquo;n of the <i>Starry
Grace</i> at the time, himself an Island McGill man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull do I remember ut,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
was runnin&rsquo; our Eastun&rsquo; down, an&rsquo; makun&rsquo;
heavy weather of ut.&nbsp; Oz fine a sailor-mon oz ever walked
was Samuel Henan.&nbsp; I remember the look of hum wull thot last
marnun&rsquo;, a-watch-un&rsquo; them bug seas curlun&rsquo; up
astern, an&rsquo; a-watchun&rsquo; the old girl an&rsquo;
seeun&rsquo; how she took them&mdash;the skupper down below
an&rsquo; drunkun&rsquo; for days.&nbsp; Ut was ot seven thot
Henan brought her up on tull the wund, not darun&rsquo; tull run
longer on thot fearful sea.&nbsp; Ot eight, after havun&rsquo;
breakfast, he turns un, an&rsquo; a half hour after up comes the
skupper, bleary-eyed an&rsquo; shaky an&rsquo; holdun&rsquo; on
tull the companion.&nbsp; Ut was fair smokun&rsquo;, I om
tellun&rsquo; ye, an&rsquo; there he stood, blunkun&rsquo;
an&rsquo; noddun&rsquo; an&rsquo; talkun&rsquo; tull
humsel&rsquo;.&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep off,&rsquo; says he ot last tull
the mon ot the wheel.&nbsp; &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; says the second
mate, standun&rsquo; beside hum.&nbsp; The skupper never looks
tull hum ot all, but keeps on mutterun&rdquo; an&rsquo;
jabberun&rsquo; tull humsel&rsquo;.&nbsp; All of a suddent-like
he straightens up an&rsquo; throws hus head back, an&rsquo; says:
&lsquo;Put your wheel over, me mon&mdash;now domn ye!&nbsp; Are
ye deef thot ye&rsquo;ll no be hearun&rsquo; me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ut was a drunken mon&rsquo;s luck, for the <i>Starry
Grace</i> wore off afore thot God-Almighty gale wuthout
shuppun&rsquo; a bucket o&rsquo; watter, the second mate
shoutun&rsquo; orders an&rsquo; the crew jumpun&rsquo; like
mod.&nbsp; An&rsquo; wuth thot the skupper nods contented-like
tull humself an&rsquo; goes below after more whusky.&nbsp; Ut was
plain murder o&rsquo; the lives o&rsquo; all of us, for ut was no
the time for the buggest shup afloat tull be runnun&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Run?&nbsp; Never hov I seen the like!&nbsp; Ut was beyond all
thunkun&rsquo;, an&rsquo; me goun&rsquo; tull sea, boy an&rsquo;
men, for forty year.&nbsp; I tell you ut was fair awesome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The face o&rsquo; the second mate was white oz death,
an&rsquo; he stood ut alone for half an hour, when ut was too
much for hum an&rsquo; he went below an&rsquo; called Samuel
an&rsquo; the third.&nbsp; Aye, a fine sailor-mon thot Samuel,
but ut was too much for hum.&nbsp; He looked an&rsquo; studied,
and looked an&rsquo; studied, but he could no see hus way.&nbsp;
He durst na heave tull.&nbsp; She would ha&rsquo; been sweeput
o&rsquo; all honds an&rsquo; stucks an&rsquo; everythung afore
she could a-fetched up.&nbsp; There was naught tull do but keep
on runnun&rsquo;.&nbsp; An&rsquo; uf ut worsened we were lost ony
way, for soon or late that overtakun&rsquo; sea was sure tull
sweep us clear over poop an&rsquo; all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dud I say ut was a God-Almighty gale?&nbsp; Ut was
worse nor thot.&nbsp; The devil himself must ha&rsquo; hod a hond
un the brewun&rsquo; o&rsquo; ut, ut was thot fearsome.&nbsp; I
ha&rsquo; looked on some sights, but I om no carun&rsquo; tull
look on the like o&rsquo; thot again.&nbsp; No mon dared tull be

of us stood on top the house an&rsquo; held on an&rsquo;
watched.&nbsp; The three mates was on the poop, with two men ot
the wheel, an&rsquo; the only mon below was thot whusky-blighted
captain snorun&rsquo; drunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; then I see ut comun&rsquo;, a mile away,
risun&rsquo; above all the waves like an island un the
sea&mdash;the buggest wave ever I looked upon.&nbsp; The three
mates stood tulgether an&rsquo; watched ut comun&rsquo;,
a-prayun&rsquo; like we thot she would no break un passun&rsquo;
us.&nbsp; But ut was no tull be.&nbsp; Ot the last, when she rose
up like a mountain, curlun&rsquo; above the stern an&rsquo;
blottun&rsquo; out the sky, the mates scattered, the second
an&rsquo; third runnun&rsquo; for the mizzen-shrouds an&rsquo;
climbun&rsquo; up, but the first runnun&rsquo; tull the wheel
tull lend a hond.&nbsp; He was a brave men, thot Samuel
Henan.&nbsp; He run straight un tull the face o&rsquo; thot
father o&rsquo; all waves, no thunkun&rsquo; on humself but
thunkun&rsquo; only o&rsquo; the shup.&nbsp; The two men was
lashed tull the wheel, but he would be ready tull hond un the
case they was kult.&nbsp; An&rsquo; then she took ut.&nbsp; We on
the house could no see the poop for the thousand tons o&rsquo;
watter thot hod hut ut.&nbsp; Thot wave cleaned them out, took
everythung along wuth ut&mdash;the two mates, climbun&rsquo; up
the mizzen-ruggun&rsquo;, Samuel Henan runnun&rsquo; tull the

utself.&nbsp; We never saw aught o&rsquo; them, for she broached
tull what o&rsquo; the wheel goun&rsquo;, an&rsquo; two men
o&rsquo; us was drownded off the house, no tull mention the
carpenter thot we pucked up ot the break o&rsquo; the poop wuth
every bone o&rsquo; hus body broke tull he was like so much
jelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here enters the marvel of it, the miraculous wonder of
that woman&rsquo;s heroic spirit.&nbsp; Margaret Henan was
forty-seven when the news came home of the loss of Samuel; and it
was not long after that the unbelievable rumour went around
Island McGill.&nbsp; I say unbelievable.&nbsp; Island McGill
would not believe.&nbsp; Doctor Hall pooh-pooh&rsquo;d it.&nbsp;
Everybody laughed at it as a good joke.&nbsp; They traced back
the gossip to Sara Dack, servant to the Henans&rsquo;, and who
alone lived with Margaret and her husband.&nbsp; But Sara Dack
persisted in her assertion and was called a low-mouthed
liar.&nbsp; One or two dared question Tom Henan himself, but
beyond black looks and curses for their presumption they elicited
nothing from him.</p>
<p>The rumour died down, and the island fell to discussing in all
its ramifications the loss of the <i>Grenoble</i> in the China
seas, with all her officers and half her crew born and married on
Island McGill.&nbsp; But the rumour would not stay down.&nbsp;
Sara Dack was louder in her assertions, the looks Tom Henan cast
about him were blacker than ever, and Dr. Hall, after a visit to
the Henan house, no longer pooh-pooh&rsquo;d.&nbsp; Then Island
McGill sat up, and there was a tremendous wagging of
tongues.&nbsp; It was unnatural and ungodly.&nbsp; The like had
never been heard.&nbsp; And when, as time passed, the truth of
Sara Dack&rsquo;s utterances was manifest, the island folk
decided, like the bos&rsquo;n of the <i>Starry Grace</i>, that
only the devil could have had a hand in so untoward a
happening.&nbsp; And the infatuated woman, so Sara Dack reported,
insisted that it would be a boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eleven bairns
ha&rsquo; I borne,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;sux o&rsquo; them
lossies an&rsquo; five o&rsquo; them loddies.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
sunce there be balance un all thungs, so wull there be balance
wuth me.&nbsp; Sux o&rsquo; one an&rsquo; half a dozen o&rsquo;
the other&mdash;there uz the balance, an&rsquo; oz sure oz the
sun rises un the marnun&rsquo;, thot sure wull ut be a
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And boy it was, and a prodigy.&nbsp; Dr. Hall raved about its
unblemished perfection and massive strength, and wrote a brochure
on it for the Dublin Medical Society as the most interesting case
of the sort in his long career.&nbsp; When Sara Dack gave the
babe&rsquo;s unbelievable weight, Island McGill refused to
believe and once again called her liar.&nbsp; But when Doctor
Hall attested that he had himself weighed it and seen it tip that
very notch, Island McGill held its breath and accepted whatever
report Sara Dack made of the infant&rsquo;s progress or
appetite.&nbsp; And once again Margaret Henan carried a babe to
Belfast and had it christened Samuel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oz good oz gold ut was,&rdquo; said Sara Dack to
me.</p>
<p>Sara, at the time I met her, was a buxom, phlegmatic spinster
of sixty, equipped with an experience so tragic and unusual that
though her tongue ran on for decades its output would still be of
imperishable interest to her cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oz good oz good,&rdquo; said Sara Dack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ut
never fretted.&nbsp; Sut ut down un the sun by the hour an&rsquo;
never a sound ut would make oz long oz ut was no hungered!&nbsp;
An&rsquo; thot strong!&nbsp; The grup o&rsquo; uts honds was like
a mon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I mind me, when ut was but hours old, ut
grupped me so mighty thot I fetched a scream I was thot
frightened.&nbsp; Ut was the punk o&rsquo; health.&nbsp; Ut slept
an&rsquo; ate, an&rsquo; grew.&nbsp; Ut never bothered.&nbsp;
Never a night&rsquo;s sleep ut lost tull no one, nor ever a
munut&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; thot wuth cuttin&rsquo; uts teeth
an&rsquo; all.&nbsp; An&rsquo; Margaret would dandle ut on her
knee an&rsquo; ask was there ever so fine a loddie un the three
Kungdoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way ut grew!&nbsp; Ut was un keepun&rsquo; wuth the
way ut ate.&nbsp; Ot a year ut was the size o&rsquo; a bairn of
two.&nbsp; Ut was slow tull walk an&rsquo; talk.&nbsp;
Exceptun&rsquo; for gurgly noises un uts throat an&rsquo; for
creepun&rsquo; on all fours, ut dudna monage much un the
walkun&rsquo; an&rsquo; talkun&rsquo; line.&nbsp; But thot was
tull be expected from the way ut grew.&nbsp; Ut all went tull
growun&rsquo; strong an&rsquo; healthy.&nbsp; An&rsquo; even old
Tom Henan cheered up ot the might of ut an&rsquo; said was there
ever the like o&rsquo; ut un the three Kungdoms.&nbsp; Ut was
Doctor Hall thot first suspicioned, I mind me well, though ut was
luttle I dreamt what he was up tull ot the time.&nbsp; I seehum
holdun&rsquo; thungs&rsquo; un fronto&rsquo; luttle Sammy&rsquo;s
eyes, an&rsquo; a-makun&rsquo; noises, loud an&rsquo; soft,
an&rsquo; far an&rsquo; near, un luttle Sammy&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; then I see Doctor Hall go away, wrunklun&rsquo; hus
eyebrows an&rsquo; shakun&rsquo; hus head like the bairn was
ailun&rsquo;.&nbsp; But he was no ailun&rsquo;, oz I could swear
tull, me a-seeun&rsquo; hum eat an&rsquo; grow.&nbsp; But Doctor
Hall no said a word tull Margaret an&rsquo; I was no for
guessun&rsquo; the why he was sore puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind me when luttle Sammy first spoke.&nbsp; He was
two years old an&rsquo; the size of a child o five, though he
could no monage the walkun&rsquo; yet but went around on all
fours, happy an&rsquo; contented-like an&rsquo; makun&rsquo; no
trouble oz long oz he was fed promptly, which was onusual
often.&nbsp; I was hangun&rsquo; the wash on the line ot the time
when out he comes, on all fours, hus bug head waggun&rsquo; tull
an&rsquo; fro an&rsquo; blunkun&rsquo; un the sun.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; then, suddent, he talked.&nbsp; I was thot took a-back
I near died o&rsquo; fright, an&rsquo; fine I knew ut then, the
shakun&rsquo; o&rsquo; Doctor Hall&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
Talked?&nbsp; Never a bairn on Island McGill talked so loud
an&rsquo; tull such purpose.&nbsp; There was no mustakun&rsquo;
ut.&nbsp; I stood there all tremblun&rsquo; an&rsquo;
shakun&rsquo;.&nbsp; Little Sammy was brayun&rsquo;.&nbsp; I tell
you, sir, he was brayun&rsquo; like an ass&mdash;just like
thot,&mdash;loud an&rsquo; long an&rsquo; cheerful tull ut seemed
hus lungs ud crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a eediot&mdash;a great, awful, monster
eediot.&nbsp; Ut was after he talked thot Doctor Hall told
Margaret, but she would no believe.&nbsp; Ut would all come
right, she said.&nbsp; Ut was growun&rsquo; too fast for aught
else.&nbsp; Guv ut time, said she, an&rsquo; we would see.&nbsp;
But old Tom Henan knew, an&rsquo; he never held up hus head
again.&nbsp; He could no abide the thung, an&rsquo; would no
brung humsel&rsquo; tull touch ut, though I om no denyun&rsquo;
he was fair fascinated by ut.&nbsp; Mony the time, I see hum
watchun&rsquo; of ut around a corner, lookun&rsquo; ot ut tull
hus eyes fair bulged wuth the horror; an&rsquo; when ut brayed
old Tom ud stuck hus fungers tull hus ears an&rsquo; look thot
miserable I could a-puttied hum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; bray ut could!&nbsp; Ut was the only thung ut
could do besides eat an&rsquo; grow.&nbsp; Whenever ut was hungry
ut brayed, an&rsquo; there was no stoppun&rsquo; ut save wuth
food.&nbsp; An&rsquo; always of a marnun&rsquo;, when first ut
crawled tull the kutchen-door an&rsquo; blunked out ot the sun,
ut brayed.&nbsp; An&rsquo; ut was brayun&rsquo; that brought
about uts end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind me well.&nbsp; Ut was three years old an&rsquo;
oz bug oz a led o&rsquo; ten.&nbsp; Old Tom hed been goun&rsquo;
from bed tull worse, ploughun&rsquo; up an&rsquo; down the fields
an&rsquo; talkun&rsquo; an&rsquo; mutterun&rsquo; tull
humself.&nbsp; On the marnun&rsquo; o&rsquo; the day I mind me,
he was suttun&rsquo; on the bench outside the kutchen,
a-futtun&rsquo; the handle tull a puck-axe.&nbsp; Unbeknown, the
monster eediot crawled tull the door an&rsquo; brayed after hus
fashion ot the sun.&nbsp; I see old Tom start up an&rsquo;
look.&nbsp; An&rsquo; there was the monster eediot, waggun&rsquo;
uts bug head an&rsquo; blunkun&rsquo; an&rsquo; brayun&rsquo;
like the great bug ass ut was.&nbsp; Ut was too much for
Tom.&nbsp; Somethun&rsquo; went wrong wuth hum
suddent-like.&nbsp; He jumped tull hus feet an&rsquo; fetched the
puck-handle down on the monster eediot&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; he hut ut again an&rsquo; again like ut was a mod dog
an&rsquo; hum afeard o&rsquo; ut.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he went
straight tull the stable an&rsquo; hung humsel&rsquo; tull a
rafter.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I was no for stoppun&rsquo; on after
such-like, an&rsquo; I went tull stay along wuth me suster thot
was married tull John Martin an&rsquo;
comfortable-off.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I sat on the bench by the kitchen door and regarded Margaret
Henan, while with her callous thumb she pressed down the live
fire of her pipe and gazed out across the twilight-sombred
fields.&nbsp; It was the very bench Tom Henan had sat upon that
last sanguinary day of life.&nbsp; And Margaret sat in the
doorway where the monster, blinking at the sun, had so often
wagged its head and brayed.&nbsp; We had been talking for an
hour, she with that slow certitude of eternity that so befitted
her; and, for the life of me, I could lay no finger on the
motives that ran through the tangled warp and woof of her.&nbsp;
Was she a martyr to Truth?&nbsp; Did she have it in her to
worship at so abstract a shrine?&nbsp; Had she conceived Abstract
Truth to be the one high goal of human endeavour on that day of
long ago when she named her first-born Samuel?&nbsp; Or was hers
the stubborn obstinacy of the ox? the fixity of purpose of the
balky horse? the stolidity of the self-willed peasant-mind?&nbsp;
Was it whim or fancy?&mdash;the one streak of lunacy in what was
otherwise an eminently rational mind?&nbsp; Or, reverting, was
hers the spirit of a Bruno?&nbsp; Was she convinced of the
intellectual rightness of the stand she had taken?&nbsp; Was hers
a steady, enlightened opposition to superstition? or&mdash;and a
subtler thought&mdash;was she mastered by some vaster, profounder
superstition, a fetish-worship of which the Alpha and the Omega
was the cryptic <i>Samuel</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wull ye be tellun&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;thot uf the second Samuel hod been named Larry thot he
would no hov fell un the hot watter an&rsquo; drownded?&nbsp;
Atween you an&rsquo; me, sir, an&rsquo; ye are
untellugent-lookun&rsquo; tull the eye, would the name hov made
ut onyways dufferent?&nbsp; Would the washun&rsquo; no be done
thot day uf he hod been Larry or Michael?&nbsp; Would hot watter
no be hot, an&rsquo; would hot watter no burn uf he hod hod ony
other name but Samuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acknowledged the justice of her contention, and she went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do a wee but of a name change the plans o&rsquo;
God?&nbsp; Do the world run by hut or muss, an&rsquo; be God a
weak, shully-shallyun&rsquo; creature thot ud alter the fate
an&rsquo; destiny o&rsquo; thungs because the worm Margaret Henan
seen fut tull name her bairn Samuel?&nbsp; There be my son
Jamie.&nbsp; He wull no sign a Rooshan-Funn un hus crew because

Hus head from on high tull lussen tull the word o&rsquo; a greasy
Rooshan-Funn un some dirty shup&rsquo;s
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said no, certainly not; but she was not to be set aside from
pressing home the point of her argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wull you be thunkun&rsquo; thot God thot directs
the stars un their courses, an&rsquo; tull whose mighty foot the
world uz but a footstool, wull you be thunkun&rsquo; thot He wull
take a spite again&rsquo; Margaret Henan an&rsquo; send a bug
wave off the Cape tull wash her son un tull eternity, all because
she was for namun&rsquo; hum Samuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why Samuel?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; thot I dinna know.&nbsp; I wantud ut
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>why</i> did you want it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; uz ut me thot would be answerun&rsquo; a
such-like question?&nbsp; Be there ony mon luvun&rsquo; or dead
thot can answer?&nbsp; Who can tell the <i>why</i> o&rsquo;

<p>The twilight deepened, and in the silence I gazed upon that
splendid dome of a forehead which time could not mar, at the
width between the eyes, and at the eyes themselves&mdash;clear,
out-looking, and wide-seeing.&nbsp; She rose to her feet with an
air of dismissing me, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ut wull be a dark walk home, an&rsquo; there wull be

<p>&ldquo;Have you any regrets, Margaret Henan?&rdquo; I asked,
suddenly and without forethought.</p>
<p>She studied me a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, thot I no ha&rsquo; borne another son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would . . .?&rdquo; I faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, thot I would,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ut

<p>I went down the dark road between the hawthorn hedges puzzling
over the why of like, repeating <i>Samuel</i> to myself and aloud
and listening to the rolling wonder in its sound that had charmed
her soul and led her life in tragic places.&nbsp;
<i>Samuel</i>!&nbsp; There was a rolling wonder in the
sound.&nbsp; Aye, there was!</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
