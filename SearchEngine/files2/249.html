<h3>
THE VANISHING LADY
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you will kindly give
me your attention for a few moments I will be
happy to introduce to your favorable notice an
entertainer of world-wide fame who will, I am sure,
not only mystify you but, at the same time, interest
you. You have witnessed the death-defying dives
of the Demon Discobolus; you have laughed with
the comical clowns; you have thrilled with the hurrying
horses; and you have gasped at the ponderous
pachyderms. Now you are to be shown a trick
which has baffled the most profound minds of this
or any other city&mdash;aye, I may say, of the world!"
</p>
<p>
Jim Tracy, ringmaster and, in this instance, stage
manager of Sampson Brothers' Circus, paused in his
announcement and with a wave of his hand indicated
a youth attired in a spotless, tight-fitting suit
of white silk. The youth, who stood in the center
of a stage erected in the big tent, bowed as the
manager waited to allow time for the applause to
die away.
</p>
<p>
"You have all seen ordinary magicians at work
making eggs disappear up their sleeves," went on
the stage manager. "You have, I doubt not, witnessed
some of them producing live rabbits from
silk hats. But Professor Joe Strong, who will
shortly have the pleasure of entertaining you, not
only makes eggs disappear, but what is far more
difficult, he causes a lady to vanish into thin air.
</p>
<p>
"You will see a beautiful lady seated in full view
of you. A moment later, by the practice of his
magical art, Professor Strong will cause the same
lady to disappear utterly, and he will defy any of
you to tell how it is done. Now, Professor, if you
are ready&mdash;" and with a nod and a wave of his
hand toward the youth in the white silk tights, Jim
Tracy stepped off the elevated stage and hurried to
the other end of the circus tent where he had to see
to it that another feature of the entertainment was
in readiness.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Joe, I'm actually nervous! Do you think I
can do it all right?" asked a pretty girl, attired in
a dress of black silk, which was in striking contrast
to Joe Strong's white, sheeny costume.
</p>
<p>
"Do it, Helen? Of course you can!" exclaimed
the "magician," as he had been termed by the ringmaster.
"Do just as you did in the rehearsals and
you'll be all right."
</p>
<p>
"But suppose something should go wrong?" she
asked in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
"Don't be in the least excited. I'll get you out
of any predicament you may get into. Tricks do,
sometimes, go wrong, but I'm used to that. I'll
cover it up, somehow. However, I don't anticipate
anything going wrong. Now take your place while
I give them a little patter."
</p>
<p>
This talk had taken place in low voices and with
a rapidity which did not keep the expectant audience
waiting. Joe Strong, while he was reassuring
Helen Morton, his partner in the trick and also the
girl to whom he was engaged to be married, was
rapidly getting the stage ready for the illusion.
</p>
<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen," said Joe, as he advanced
to the edge of the stage, "I am afraid our
genial manager has rather overstated my powers.
What I am about to do, to be perfectly frank with
you, is a trick. I lay no claim to supernatural powers.
But if I can do a trick and you can't tell how
it is done, then you must admit that, for the moment,
I am smarter than you. In other words, I
am going to deceive you. But the point is&mdash;how do
I do it? With this introduction, I will now state
what I am about to do.
</p>
<p>
"Mademoiselle Mortonti will seat herself on a
stage in a chair in full view of you all. I will cover
her, for a moment only, with a silken veil. This,
if I were a real necromancer, I should say was to
prevent your seeing her dissolve into a spirit as she
disappears. But to tell you the truth, it is to conceal
the manner in which I do the trick. You'd
guess that, anyhow, if I didn't tell you," he added.
</p>
<p>
There was a good-natured laugh at this admission.
</p>
<p>
"As soon as I remove the silken veil," went on
Joe, "you will see that the lady will have disappeared
before your very eyes. What's that?
Through a hole in the stage did some one say?"
questioned Joe, appearing to catch a protesting
voice.
</p>
<p>
"Well, that's what I hear everywhere I go," he
went on with easy calmness. "Every time I do the
vanishing lady trick some one thinks she disappears
through a hole in the stage. Now, in order
to convince you to the contrary, I am going to put
a newspaper over that part of the stage where the
chair is placed. I will show you the paper before
and after the trick. And if there is not a hole or
a tear in the paper, either before or after the lady
has disappeared, I think you will admit that the
lady did not go through a hole in the stage floor.
Won't you?" asked Joe Strong. "Yes, I thought
you would," he added, as he pretended to hear a
"yes" from somewhere in the audience.
</p>
<p>
"All ready now, Helen," he said in a low voice
to the girl, and an attendant brought forward an
ordinary looking chair and a newspaper.
</p>
<p>
Joe, who had done the trick many times before,
but not often with Helen, was perfectly at ease.
Helen was very frankly nervous. She had not done
the trick for some time, and Joe had introduced
into it some novel features since last presenting it.
Helen was afraid she would cause some hitch in the
performance.
</p>
<p>
"You'll be all right," Joe said to her in a low
voice. "Just act as though you had done this every
day for a year."
</p>
<p>
Placing the chair in the center of the stage and
handing Joe the newspaper, the attendant stepped
back. Joe addressed the audience.
</p>
<p>
"You here see the paper," said the "magician,"
as he held it up. "You see that there is no hole in it.
I'll now spread it down on the stage. If the lady
disappears down through the stage she will have
to tear the paper. You shall see if she does."
</p>
<p>
Joe next placed the chair directly over the square
of paper and motioned to Helen. Her plain black
dress, of soft, clinging silk, swayed about her as she
took her place.
</p>
<p>
"I might add," said Joe, pausing a moment after
Helen had taken her seat, "that in order to prevent
any shock to Mademoiselle Mortonti I am going to
mesmerize her. She will then be unconscious. I
do this for two reasons. In totally disappearing
there is sometimes a shock to a person's mentality
that is unpleasant. To avoid indicting that on
Mademoiselle Mortonti I will hypnotize her.
</p>
<p>
"The other reason I do that is that she may not
know how or when she disappears. Thus she will
not be able to see how I do the trick, and so cannot
give away my secret."
</p>
<p>
Of course this was all "bunk" or "patter," to
use names given to it by the performers. It
kept the attention of the audience and so enabled
Joe to do certain things without attracting too
much attention to them. As a matter of fact he
did not mesmerize Helen, and she knew perfectly
well how the trick was done. Those who have read
previous books of this series are also in the secret.
</p>
<p>
Joe waved his hands in front of Helen's face.
She swayed slightly in her chair. Then her eyes
closed as though against her will, and she seemed
to sleep.
</p>
<p>
"She is now in the proper condition for the trick,"
said Joe. "I must beg of you not to make any
sudden or unnecessary noise. You might suddenly
awaken her from the mesmeric slumber, and this
might be very serious."
</p>
<p>
As Joe said this with every indication of meaning
it, there was a quick hush among the audience.
Even though many knew it was only a trick, they
could not help being impressed by the solemn note
in Joe's voice. Such is the psychology of an audience,
and the power over it of a single person.
</p>
<p>
"She now sleeps!" said Joe in a low voice. As
a matter of fact, Helen was wide awake, and as Joe
stood between her and the circus crowd she slowly
opened one eye and winked at him. He was glad to
see this, as it showed her nervousness had left her.
</p>
<p>
"Now for the mystic veil!" cried Joe, as he took
from his helper a thin clinging piece of black silk
gauze. He tossed this over Helen and the chair,
completely covering both from sight. He brought
the veil around behind Helen's head, fastening it
there with a pin.
</p>
<p>
"To make sure that Mademoiselle Mortonti
sleeps, I will now make the few remaining mesmeric
passes," said Joe. "I must be positive that she
slumbers."
</p>
<p>
He waved his hands slowly over the black robed
figure. A great hush had fallen over the big crowd.
Every eye was on the black figure in the center of
the raised stage in the middle of the big circus tent.
All the other acts had temporarily stopped, to make
that of Joe Strong, the boy magician, more spectacular.
</p>
<p>
As Joe continued to wave one hand with an undulating
motion over the silent black-covered figure
in the chair, he touched, here and there, the drapery
over Helen. He seemed very solicitous that it
should hang perfectly right, covering the figure of
the girl and the chair completely from sight in every
direction all around the stage.
</p>
<p>
The music, which had been playing softly, suddenly
stopped at a wave of Joe's hand. He stood
for a moment motionless before the veiled figure.
</p>
<p>
"Her spirit is dissolving into thin air!" he said in
a low voice, which, nevertheless, carried to every
one in the crowd.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Joe took hold of the veil in the center
and directly over the outlined head of the figure in
the chair. Quickly the young magician raised the
soft, black silk gauze, whisking it quickly to one
side.
</p>
<p>
The audience gasped.
</p>
<p>
The chair, in which but a moment before Helen
Morton had been seated, was empty! The girl had
disappeared&mdash;vanished! Joe stooped and raised
from the stage the newspaper. It showed not a
sign of break or tear.
</p>
<p>
Then, before the applause could begin, the girl
appeared, walking out from one of the improvised
wings of the circus stage. She smiled and bowed.
The act had been a great success. Now the silent
admiration of the throng gave place to a wave of
hand clapping and feet stamping.
</p>
<p>
"Was it all right, Joe?" asked Helen, as he
held her hand and they both bowed their appreciation
of the applause.
</p>
<p>
"Couldn't have been better!" he said. "We'll do
this trick regularly now. It takes even better than
my ten thousand dollar box mystery. You were
great!"
</p>
<p>
"I'm so glad!"
</p>
<p>
The two performers were bowing themselves off
the stage when suddenly there came the unmistakable
roar of a wild beast from the direction of the
animal tent. It seemed to shake the very ground.
At the same time a voice cried:
</p>
<p>
"A tiger is loose! One of the tigers is out of his
cage!"
</p>

	CHAPTER II
</h2>

<h3>
A DANGEROUS SWING
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
There is no cry which so startles the average circus
audience as that which is raised when one of
the wild animals is said to be at large. Not even
the alarm that the big tent is falling or is about to
be blown over will cause such a panic as the shout:
</p>
<p>
"A tiger is loose!"
</p>
<p>
There is something instinctive, and perfectly
natural, in the fear of the wild jungle beasts. Let
it be said that a tiger or a lion is loose, and it causes
greater fear, even, than when it is stated that an
elephant is on a rampage. An elephant seems a big,
but good-natured, creature; though often they turn
ugly. But a lion or a tiger is always feared when
loose.
</p>
<p>
But the chances are not one in a hundred that a
circus lion or a tiger, getting out of its cage, would
attack any one. The creature is so surprised at getting
loose, and so frightened at the hue and cry at
once raised, that all it wants to do is to slink off and
hide, and the only harm it might do would be to
some one who tried to stop it from running away.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong, Jim Tracy, and the other circus
executives and employees knew this as soon as they
heard the cry: "A tiger is loose." Who raised the
cry and which of the several tigers in the Sampson
show was out of its cage, neither Joe nor any of
those in the big tent near him knew. But they realized
the emergency, and knew what to do.
</p>
<p>
"Keep your seats! Don't rush!" cried Joe, as he
released Helen's hand and hurried to the front of
the platform. "There is no danger! The animal
men will catch the tiger, if one is really loose. Stay
where you are! Keep your seats! Don't rush!"
</p>
<p>
It is the panic and rush that circus men are afraid
of&mdash;the pushing and "milling" of the crowd and the
trampling under foot of helpless women and children.
</p>
<p>
There was some commotion near the junction of
the animal tent and that in which the main performance
took place. What it was, Joe did not
concern himself about just then. He felt it to be his
task to prevent a panic. And to this he lent himself,
aided by Helen, Jim Tracy, and others who
realized the danger.
</p>
<p>
And while this is going on and while the expert
animal men are preparing to get back into its cage
the tiger which, it was learned afterward, had got
out through an imperfectly fastened door, time will
be taken to tell new readers something about Joe
Strong and the series of books in which he is the
central character.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong seemed destined for a circus life and
for entertaining audiences with sleight-of-hand and
other mystery matters. His father, Alexander
Strong, known professionally as Professor Morretti,
was a stage magician of talents, and Joe's
mother, who was born in England, had been a
rider of trick horses.
</p>
<p>
His parents died when Joe was young. He did
not have a very happy boyhood, and one day he
ran away from the man with whom he was living
and joined a traveling magician, who called himself
Professor Rosello. With him Joe, who had a
natural aptitude for the business, learned to become
a sleight-of-hand performer.
</p>
<p>
In the first book of the series, entitled "Joe
Strong, the Boy Wizard; Or, the Mysteries of
Magic Exposed," is told how Joe got on in life
after his first start. Joe was not only a stage magician,
but he had inherited strength, skill and daring,
and he liked nothing better than climbing to
great heights or walking in lofty and dizzy places
where the footing was perilous. So it was perhaps
natural that he should join the Sampson Brothers'
Show. And in the second book is related, under the
title, "Joe Strong on the Trapeze; Or, the Daring
Feats of a Young Circus Performer," what happened
to our hero under canvas.
</p>
<p>
Joe loved the circus life, even though he made
some enemies. But he had many friends. There
was Helen Morton. Then there was Benny Turton,
who did a "tank act," and was billed as a "human
fish." Jim Tracy, the ringmaster, Bill Watson, the
veteran clown, and his wife, the circus "mother,"
Tom Layton, the elephant man who taught the big
creatures many tricks, were only a few of Joe's
friends.
</p>
<p>
Among others might be mentioned Se&ntilde;or Bogardi,
the lion tamer, Mrs. Talfo, the professional
"fat lady," Se&ntilde;orita Tanzalo, the pretty snake
charmer, and Tom Jefferson, the "strong man."
Joe loved them all. The circus was like one big
family, with, as might be expected, a "black sheep"
here and there.
</p>
<p>
Joe became an expert on the trapeze, and, later,
when Benny Turton was temporarily in a hospital,
Joe "took on" the tank trick. In the third
volume some of his under-water feats are related,
while in the fourth book Joe's acts on a motor
cycle on the high wire are dealt with.
</p>
<p>
With his "Wings of Steel," Joe caused a sensation,
and after an absence from the circus for a time
he joined it again, bringing this act to it.
</p>
<p>
Eventually Joe was made one of the circus owners,
and now controlled a majority of the stock.
He had also inherited considerable money from his
mother's relatives in England, so that now the youth
was financially well off for one who had started so
humbly.
</p>
<p>
The book immediately preceding this one is called
"Joe Strong and His Box of Mystery; Or, the Ten
Thousand Dollar Prize Trick." In that volume is
related how Joe constructed a trick box, out of
which he made his way after it was locked and
corded about with ropes. Helen Morton helped him
in this trick, which was very successful.
</p>
<p>
The circus management offered a prize of ten
thousand dollars to whomsoever could fathom how
the trick was done. Bill Carfax, an enemy of Joe's
and a former circus employee, tried to solve the
problem but failed.
</p>
<p>
The box trick was a great attraction for the circus,
and Joe was in higher favor than before.
</p>
<p>
He had been on the road with the show for
some time when the events detailed in the first
chapter of this book took place.
</p>
<p>
By dint of much shouting and urging the people
to retain their seats and not rush into danger, Joe
Strong and the others succeeded in calming the
circus crowd. Meanwhile there was much suppressed
excitement.
</p>
<p>
"Is the tiger caught? Is he back in his cage?"
was asked on every side.
</p>
<p>
While Joe and his fellow showmen were calming
the crowd, the animal men were having their own
troubles. Burma, one of the largest of the tigers,
had got loose, having taken advantage of the open
door of his cage. He rushed out with a snarl of
delight at his freedom. His jungle cry was echoed
by the roar of a lion in the next cage, and this was
followed by the cries and snarls of all the wild
jungle beasts in the tent.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the animal tent was deserted by all
save the keepers, the audience having filed into the
tent where the main show was going on.
</p>
<p>
"Head him off now! Head him off!" cried Tom
Layton, the elephant man, as he saw the tiger dart
out of its cage&mdash;a flash of yellow and black. "Head
him off! Don't let him get in the main top!"
</p>
<p>
"That's right! Head him off!" cried Se&ntilde;or Bogardi,
the lion tamer. "He won't hurt any one&mdash;he's
too scared!"
</p>
<p>
This was true, but it was difficult to believe, and
some of the people seated in the "main top," or big
tent, who were nearest the animal tent, hearing the
cries and learning what had occurred, spread the
alarm.
</p>
<p>
Burma, the tiger, slunk around in behind the
cages of the other animals. All about him were
men with clubs and pointed goads, with whips and
pistols. The circus men had had to cope with situations
like this before. They surrounded the tiger,
advancing on him in an ever-narrowing circle, and
in a short time they drove him into an emergency
cage which was pushed forward with the open door
toward him. Burma had no choice but to enter, to
get away from the cracking whips and the prodding
goads. And, after all, he was glad to be barred in
again.
</p>
<p>
So, without causing any harm except for badly
frightening a number of people in the audience, the
tiger was caged again, and the circus performance
went on.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong did his Box of Mystery trick. The
usual announcement of a reward of ten thousand
dollars to whomsoever could solve it was made, and
there was great applause when Joe managed to get
out of the big box without disturbing the six padlocks
or the binding ropes.
</p>
<p>
"I'm glad Bill Carfax isn't here to make trouble,
trying to show how much he knows about this
trick," said Joe to the ringmaster, as he stepped
off the stage at the conclusion of the trick.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, you put several spokes in Bill's wheels
when you turned the laugh on him that time," said
Jim Tracy. "I don't believe he'll ever show up
around our circus again."
</p>
<p>
But they little knew Bill Carfax. Those who
have read the book just before this will recall him
and remember how unscrupulous he was. But his
plans came to naught then. Any one who wishes
to learn how the wonderful box trick was worked
will find a full explanation in the previous volume.
</p>
<p>
Helen Morton received much applause at the
conclusion of her act with her trick horse, Rosebud.
Joe Strong's promised wife was an accomplished
bareback rider, as well as one of her fianc&eacute;'s
helpers in his mystery tricks.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'm glad to-day is over," said Helen to
Joe that night, as they went to the train that was to
take them to the next city where the circus performance
would be given. "What with doing the
vanishing lady act for the first time in a long while
and the tiger getting loose, we have had quite
a bit of excitement."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," agreed Joe. "But everything came out all
right. I'm going to put on a new stunt next week."
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" asked Helen. "Something in
the mystery line?"
</p>
<p>
"No. I'm going back to some of my high trapeze
work. You know, since we lost Wogand there
hasn't been any of the big swing work done."
</p>
<p>
"That's so," agreed Helen. "But I've been so
busy practicing the vanishing lady act with you on
top of my other work that I hadn't given it a
thought. But you aren't going to do that dangerous
trick, are you?"
</p>
<p>
"I think I am," Joe answered. "It's sensational,
and we need sensational acts now to draw the
crowds. I used to do it, and I can again, I think,
with a little practice. I'm going to start in and train
to-morrow."
</p>
<p>
"I wish you wouldn't," said Helen, in a low voice,
but Joe did not seem to hear her.
</p>
<p>
The big swing was a trapeze act performed on
the highest of the circus apparatus. Part of this
apparatus consisted of two platforms fastened to
two of the opposite main poles, and up under the
very roof of the big top.
</p>
<p>
Midway between the platforms, which were just
large enough for a man to stand on, was a trapeze
with long ropes, capable of being swung from one
resting place to the other. It was, in reality, a "big
swing."
</p>
<p>
Joe's act, which he had often done, but which of
late had been performed by a man billed as "Wogand,"
was to stand on one platform, have the long
trapeze started in a long, pendulumlike swing by
an attendant, and then to leap down, catch hold of
the bar with his hands, and swing up to the other
platform. If he missed catching the bar it meant
a dangerous fall; a fall into a net, it is true, but dangerous
none the less. Its danger can be judged
when it is said that Wogand had died as an indirect
result of a fall into the net. He missed the
trapeze, toppled into the net, and, by some chance,
did not land properly. His back was injured, his
spine became affected, and he died.
</p>
<p>
When circus performers on the high trapezes fall
or jump into the safety nets, they do not usually do
it haphazardly. If they did many would be killed.
There is a certain knack and trick of landing in a
net.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong, ever having the interest of the circus
at heart, had decided to do this dangerous swing.
He was an acrobat, as well as a stage magician, and
he had decided to take up some of his earlier acts
which had been so successful.
</p>
<p>
"But I wish he wouldn't," said Helen to herself.
"I have a premonition that something will happen."
Helen was very superstitious in certain ways.
</p>
<p>
But to all she said, Joe only laughed.
</p>
<p>
"I'm going to do the big swing," he replied simply.

	CHAPTER III

<h3>
TOO MANY PEOPLE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Hundreds of men toiling and sweating over stiff
canvas and stiffer ropes. The thud of big wooden
sledge hammers driving in the tent stakes. The
rumble of heavy wagons, and a cloud of dust where
they were being shoved into place by the busy elephants.
</p>
<p>
On one edge of the big, vacant lot were wisps of
smoke from the fires in the stove wagons, and from
these same wagons came appetizing odors.
</p>
<p>
Here and there men and women darted, carrying
portions of their costumes in their hands. Clowns,
partly made up, looked from their dressing tents
to smile or shout at some acquaintance who chanced
to be passing by.
</p>
<p>
All this was the Sampson Brothers' Circus in
preparation for a day's performance.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong, having had a good breakfast, without
which no circus man or woman starts the day,
strolled over to where Helen Morton was just finishing
her morning meal.
</p>
<p>
"Feeling all right?" he asked her.
</p>
<p>
"Well, yes, pretty well," she answered.
</p>
<p>
"What's the matter?" asked Joe quickly, as he
detected an under note of anxiety in the girl's voice.
"Is your star horse, Rosebud, lame or off his
feed?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no," she answered. "It's just&mdash;Oh,
here comes Mother Watson, and I promised to help
her mend a skirt," said Helen quickly, as she turned
to greet the veteran clown's wife. "See you later,
Joe!" she called to him over her shoulder as she
started away.
</p>
<p>
The young magician moved away toward his
own private quarters.
</p>
<p>
"I wonder what's the matter with Helen," he
said. "She doesn't act naturally. If that Bill Carfax
has been around again, annoying her, I'll put
him out of business for all time. But if he had
been around I'd have heard of it. I don't believe
it can be that."
</p>
<p>
Nor was it. Helen's anxiety had to do with
something other than Bill Carfax, the unprincipled
circus man who had so annoyed her before Joe discharged
him. And, as Joe had said, the man had
not been seen publicly since the fiasco of his attempt
to expose Joe's mystery box trick.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I suppose she won't tell me what it is until
she gets good and ready," mused Joe. "Now I'll
go in and have a little practice at the big swing
before the parade."
</p>
<p>
Joe did not take part in the street pageant, though
Helen did, riding her beautiful horse to the admiration,
not only of the small boys and their sisters, but
the grown-up throng in the highways as well. Helen
made a striking picture on her spirited, but gentle,
steed.
</p>
<p>
It was not that Joe Strong felt above appearing
in the parade. That was not his reason for not
taking part. He had done so on more than one occasion,
and with his Wings of Steel had created
more than one sensation.
</p>
<p>
But now that he did a trapeze act, as well as
working the sleight-of-hand mysteries, his time was
pretty well occupied. He had not, as yet, done the
big swing in public since that act was abandoned
on the death of the man who had been injured while
doing it. But Joe had been perfecting himself in
it. He had had a new set of trapezes made, and had
ornamented them and the two platforms in a very
striking manner. In other words, the trick had a
new "dress," and Joe, as one of the circus proprietors,
hoped it would go well and attract attention.
</p>
<p>
This was from a business standpoint, and not
only because Joe was himself the performer. Of
course it was natural that he should like applause&mdash;all
do, more or less. But Joe was one of the
owners of the circus&mdash;the chief owner, in fact&mdash;and
he wanted to make a financial success of it.
Nor was this a purely selfish reason. Many persons
owned stock in the enterprise, and Joe felt it was
only fair to them to see that they received a good
return for their investment. Any trick he could
do to draw crowds he was willing to attempt.
</p>
<p>
So, while the parade was being gotten ready, Joe
went inside the main top, which by this time was
erected, to see about having his platforms and
trapeze put in place. In this he was always very
careful, as is every aerial performer. The least
slip of a rope may cause disaster, and no matter
how careful the attendants are, the performers
themselves always give at least a casual look to their
apparatus.
</p>
<p>
"All right, Harry?" asked Joe of one of the riggers
who had charge of putting up the platforms
and the big swing.
</p>
<p>
"Sure, it's all right, Mr. Strong!" was the answer.
"I should say so! I don't make no mistakes
when I'm putting up trapezes. You'll find
everything shipshape and proper. Going to have
a big crowd to-day, I guess."
</p>
<p>
Joe looked at Harry Loper closely. The young
man had never talked so much before, being, on
the whole, rather close-mouthed. As the man
passed Joe, after giving a pull on the last rope,
the young magician became aware that Harry had
been drinking&mdash;and something stronger than pink
lemonade.
</p>
<p>
"I'm sorry about that!" mused Joe, as the rope
rigger passed on. "If there's any place a man ought
not to drink it's in a circus, and especially when he
has to rig up high flying apparatus for others. It
was drink that put Bill Carfax out of business. I
didn't know Harry was that kind, I never noticed
it before. I'm sorry. And I'll take extra precautions
that my ropes won't slip. You can't trust a
man who drinks."
</p>
<p>
Joe shook his head a bit sadly. He was thinking
of Bill Carfax, and of the fact that he had had to
discharge the man because, while under the influence
of liquor, he had insulted Helen. Then Bill
had tried to get revenge on Joe.
</p>
<p>
"I hope it doesn't turn out this way with Harry
Loper," mused Joe, as he began climbing up a rope
ladder that led to one of the high platforms. And
as Harry had to do with the placing of this ladder,
Joe tested it carefully before ascending.
</p>
<p>
"I don't want to fall and be laid up in the middle
of the circus season," mused the young circus man,
with a frown.
</p>
<p>
However, the ladder appeared to be perfectly
secure, and as Joe went up, finally reaching the
high platform, he felt a sense of exhilaration.
Heights always affected him this way. He liked,
more than anything else, to soar aloft on his Wings
of Steel. And he liked the sensation when he
leaped from one platform toward the swinging
trapeze bar, aiming to grasp it in his hands and
swing in a great arc to the other little elevated place,
close under the top of the tent.
</p>
<p>
There was a thrill about it&mdash;a thrill not only to
the performer but to the audience as well&mdash;and Joe
could hear the gasps that went up from thousands
of throats as he made his big swing.
</p>
<p>
But, for the time being, he gave his whole attention
to the platform and its fastenings. The platforms
were not very likely to slip, being caught on
to the main tent poles, which themselves were well
braced.
</p>
<p>
The real danger was in the long trapeze. Not
only must the thin wire ropes of this be strong
enough to hold Joe's weight, but an added pressure,
caused by the momentum of his jump. And not
only must the cables be strong, but there must be
no defect in the wooden bar and in the place where
the upper ends of the ropes were fastened to the top
of the tent.
</p>
<p>
"Well, this platform is all right," remarked Joe,
as he looked it over. "Now for the other and the
trapeze."
</p>
<p>
He went down the rope ladder and climbed up
another to the second platform. The show would
not start for several hours yet, and the tent was
filled with men putting in place the stage for Joe's
magic tricks and other apparatus for various performers.
The parade was just forming to proceed
down town.
</p>
<p>
Joe found that Harry Loper had done his work
well, at least as far as the platforms were concerned.
They were firmly fastened. The one to
which Joe leaped after his swing needed to be
considerably stronger than the one from which he
"took off."
</p>
<p>
The next act of the young circus performer was
to climb up to the very top of the tent, and there
to examine the fastenings of the trapeze ropes. He
spent some time at this, having reached his high
perch by a third rope ladder.
</p>
<p>
"I guess everything is all right," mused Joe.
"Perhaps I did Harry an injustice. He might have
taken some stimulant for a cold&mdash;they all got wet
through the other night. But still he ought to be
careful. He was a little too talkative for a man to
give his whole attention to fastening a trapeze. But
this seems to be all right. I'll do the big swing this
afternoon and to-night, in addition to the box trick
and the vanishing lady. Helen works exceedingly
well in that."
</p>
<p>
Having seen that his aerial apparatus was all
right, Joe next went to his tent where his magical
appliances were kept. Many stage tricks depend
for their success on special pieces of apparatus, and
Joe's acts were no exception.
</p>
<p>
Joe saw that everything was in readiness for
his sleight-of-hand work, and then examined his
Box of Mystery. As this was a very special piece
of apparatus, he was very careful about it. His
ability to get out of it, once he was locked and
roped in, depended on a delicate bit of mechanism,
and the least hitch in this meant failure.
</p>
<p>
But a test showed that it was all right, and as by
this time it was nearly the hour for the parade to
come back and the preliminaries to begin, Joe went
over to the circus office to see if any matters there
needed his attention.
</p>
<p>
As he crossed the lot to where the "office" was set
up in a small tent, the first horses of the returning
parade came back on the circus grounds. Following
was a mob of delighted small boys and not a
few men.
</p>
<p>
"Looks as if we'd have a big crowd," said Joe
to himself. "And it's a fine day for the show. We'll
make money!"
</p>
<p>
He attended to some routine matters, and then
the first of the afternoon audience began to arrive.
As Joe had predicted, the crowd was a big
one.
</p>
<p>
The young performer was in his dressing room,
getting ready for the big swing, which he would
perform before his mystery tricks, when Mr.
Moyne, the circus treasurer, entered. There was
a queer look on Mr. Moyne's face, and Joe could not
help but notice it.
</p>
<p>
"What's worrying you?" asked Joe. "Doesn't
this weather suit you, or isn't there a big enough
crowd?"
</p>
<p>
"That's just it, Joe," was the unexpected answer.
"There's too big a crowd. We have too many people
at this show, and that's what is worrying me a
whole lot!"
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong looked in surprise at the treasurer.
What could Mr. Moyne mean?
</p>

<h3>
THE RUSTED WIRE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"Yes," went on the circus treasurer, as he rubbed
his chin reflectively, "it's a curious state of affairs,
and as you're so vitally interested I came to you at
once. There's going to be trouble!"
</p>
<p>
"Trouble!" cried Joe with a laugh. "I can't
see that, Mr. Moyne. You say there's a big crowd
of people at our circus&mdash;too much of a crowd, in
fact. I can't see anything wrong in that. It's
just what we're always wanting&mdash;a big audience.
Let 'em fill the tent, I say, and put out the 'Straw
Seats Only' sign. Trouble! Why, I should say
this was good luck!" and Joe hastened his preparations,
for he wanted to go on with the big swing.
</p>
<p>
"Ordinarily," said Mr. Moyne, in the slow, precise
way he had of speaking, brought about, perhaps,
by his need of being exact in money matters,
"a big crowd would be the very thing we should
want. But this time we don't&mdash;not this kind of a
crowd."
</p>
<p>
"What do you mean?" asked Joe, beginning to
feel that it was more than a mere notion on the
part of the treasurer that something was wrong.
"Is it a rough crowd? Will there be a 'hey rube!'
cry raised&mdash;a fight between our men and the mill
hands?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no, nothing like that!" the treasurer hastened
to assure Joe. "The whole thing is just this.
There are a great many more people in the main
top now than there are admission prices in the
treasurer's cash box. The books don't balance, as
it were."
</p>
<p>
"More people in the tent than have paid their
way?" asked Joe. "Well, that always happens at
a circus. Small boys will crawl in under the canvas
in spite of clubs."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, it isn't a question of the small boys&mdash;I never
worry about them," returned Mr. Moyne. "But
there are about a thousand more persons at the
performance which will soon begin than we have
admission prices for. In other words there are a
thousand persons occupying fifty cent seats that
haven't paid their half dollar. It isn't the reserve
chairs that are affected. We're all right there.
But fully a thousand persons have come into the
show, and we're short five hundred dollars in our
cash."
</p>
<p>
"You don't tell me!" cried Joe. He saw that
Mr. Moyne was very much in earnest. "Have the
ticket men and the entrance attendants been working
a flim-flam game on us?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no, it isn't that," said the treasurer. "I
could understand that. But the men are perfectly
willing to have their accounts gone over and their
tickets checked up. They're straight!"
</p>
<p>
"Then what is it?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"That's what we've got to find out," went on Mr.
Moyne. "In some way the thousand people have
come in without paying the circus anything. And
they didn't sneak in, either. A few might do that,
but a thousand couldn't. They've come in by the
regular entrance."
</p>
<p>
"Did they force themselves past without tickets?"
</p>
<p>
"No, each one had the proper coupon."
</p>
<p>
"Has there been a theft of our tickets?" demanded
the young magician and acrobat.
</p>
<p>
"No, our ticket account is all right, except there
are a thousand extra entrance coupons in the box&mdash;coupons
taken in by the entrance attendants. It's
a puzzle to me," confessed the treasurer. "There
is some game being played on us, and we're out to
the tune of five hundred dollars by it already."
</p>
<p>
"Is there any way of finding out who these persons
are who have come in without paying us and
having them ejected?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"I don't see how," admitted Mr. Moyne. "If
they were in reserved seats it could be done, but not
in the ordinary un-numbered fifty cent section. The
whole situation is that we have a thousand persons
too many at the show."
</p>
<p>
"Well, we'll have a meeting of the executive
body and take it up after the performance," said
Joe, as he quickly prepared to get into his aerial
costume. "We'll have to go on with the performance
now; it's getting late. If we're swamped by
people coming along who hold our regular tickets
we'll have to sit 'em anywhere we can. If we lose
five hundred dollars we'll make it up by having
a smashing crowd, which is always a good advertisement.
I'll see you directly after the show, Mr.
Moyne."
</p>
<p>
"I wish you would," said the harassed treasurer.
"Something must be done about it. If this happens
very often we'll be in a financial hole at the
end of the season."
</p>
<p>
He departed, looking at some figures he had jotted
down on the back of an envelope.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong was puzzled. Nothing like this had
ever come up before. True, there had been swindlers
who tried to mulct the circus of money, and
there were always small boys, and grown men, too,
who tried to crawl in under the tent. But such a
wholesale game as this Joe had never before known.
</p>
<p>
"Well, five hundred dollars, for once, won't
break us," he said grimly, as he fastened on a
brightly spangled belt, "but I wouldn't want it to
happen very often. Now I wonder what luck I'll
have in my big swing. I haven't done it in public
for some time, but it went all right in practice."
</p>
<p>
Joe looked from his dressing room. He was all
ready for his act now, but the time had not yet
come for him to go on. He saw Helen hastening
past on her way to enter the ring with her horse,
Rosebud, which a groom held at the entrance for
her.
</p>
<p>
"Good luck!" called Joe, waving his hand and
smiling.
</p>
<p>
"The same to you," answered Helen. "You'll
need it more than I. Oh, Joe," she went on earnestly,
"won't you give up this big swing? Stick to
your box trick, and let me act with you in the disappearing
lady stunt. Don't go on with this high
trapeze act!" she pleaded.
</p>
<p>
"Why, Helen! anybody would think you'd been
bitten by the jinx bug!" laughed Joe. "I thought
you were all over that."
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps I am foolish," she said. "But it's because&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
She blushed and looked away.
</p>
<p>
"I suppose I should take it as a compliment that
you are so interested in my welfare," said Joe, with
a smile. "And, believe me, I am. But, Helen, I
can't back out of this act now. It's been advertised
big. I've got to go on!"
</p>
<p>
"Then do be careful, won't you?" she begged.
"Oh, do be careful! Somehow, I have a feeling
that&mdash;Oh, well, I won't set you to worrying
by telling you," she said quickly, with a laugh, in
which, however, there was no mirth. She smiled
again, trying to make it a bright one; but Joe saw
that she was under a strain.
</p>
<p>
"I'll be careful," he promised. "Really, there's
no danger. I've done the stunt a score of times, and
I can judge my distance perfectly. Besides there's
the safety net."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I know, but there was poor&mdash;Oh, well,
I won't talk about it! Good luck!" and she hurried
on, for it was time for her act&mdash;the whistle of the
ringmaster having blown.
</p>
<p>
Joe looked after the girl he loved. He smiled,
and then a rather serious look settled over his face.
Like a flash there had come to him the memory of
the too loquacious Harry Loper, who had fitted up
his aerial apparatus.
</p>
<p>
"There can be nothing wrong with that," mused
Joe. "I went over every inch of it. I guess Helen
is just nervous. Well, there goes my cue!"
</p>
<p>
He hurried toward the entrance, and then he
began to ponder over the curious fact of there being
a thousand persons too many at the performance.
</p>
<p>
"We'll have to straighten out that ticket tangle
after the show," mused Joe. "It's likely to get serious.
I wonder&mdash;" he went on, struck by a new
thought. "I wonder if&mdash;Oh, no! It couldn't be!
He hasn't been around in a long while."
</p>
<p>
Out into the tent, filled with a record-breaking
crowd, went Joe to the place where his high trapeze
was waiting for him. The band was playing lively
airs, on one platform some trained seals were juggling
big balls of colored rubber, and on another a
bear was going about on roller skates. In one end
ring Helen was performing with Rosebud, while in
another a troupe of Japanese acrobats were doing
wonderful things with their supple bodies.
</p>
<p>
Joe waved his hand to Helen in passing, and then
he began to ascend to his high platform. When he
reached it and stood poised ready for his act, there
came a shrill whistle from Jim Tracy, the ringmaster,
who wore his usual immaculate shirt front
and black evening clothes&mdash;rather incongruous in
the daytime.
</p>
<p>
The whistle was the signal for the other acts to
cease, that the attention of all might be centered
on Joe. This is always done in a circus in the case
of "stars," and Joe was certainly a star of the first
magnitude.
</p>
<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen!" cried Jim Tracy, with
the accented drawl that carried his voice to the very
ends of the big tent. "Calling your attention to
one of the most marvelous high trapeze acts ever
performed in any circus!"
</p>
<p>
He pointed dramatically to Joe, who stood up
straight, ready to do his act.
</p>
<p>
"Are you ready?" asked the man who was to
release the trapeze, which was caught up at one
side of the platform opposite Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Ready," answered the young acrobat.
</p>
<p>
The man pulled a rope which released a catch,
letting the trapeze start on its long swaying swing.
The man pulled it by means of a long, thin cord,
until it was making big arcs, like some gigantic
pendulum.
</p>
<p>
Joe watched it carefully, judging it to the fraction
of an inch. He stood poised and tense on the
gayly decorated platform, himself a fine picture of
physical young manhood. The band was blaring
out the latest Jazz melody.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, from his perch, the young acrobat
gave a cry, and Jim Tracy, on the ground below,
hearing it, held up his white-gloved hand as a
signal for the music to cease.
</p>
<p>
Then Joe leaped. Full and fair he leaped out
toward the swinging bar of the big trapeze, the
snare drum throbbing out as he jumped. He was
dimly conscious of thousands of eyes watching him&mdash;eyes
that looked curiously and apprehensively up.
And he realized that Helen was also watching him.
</p>
<p>
As true as a die, Joe's hands caught and gripped
the bar of the swinging trapeze. So far he was
safe. The momentum of his jump carried him in
a long swing, and he at once began to undulate himself
to increase his swing. He must do this in order
to get to the second platform.
</p>
<p>
As the young performer began to do this, he
looked up at the wire ropes of his trapeze.
</p>
<p>
It was a look given instinctively and for no
particular purpose, as Joe's eyes must rest, most of
all, on the second platform where he needed to
land, to save himself from a bad fall.
</p>
<p>
As his eyes glanced along the steel cables on
which his life depended, he saw, to his horror, a
spot of rust on one. And at the spot of rust several
of the thin strands of twisted wire were loose
and frayed.
</p>
<p>
The cable seemed about to give way!
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="CH5"><!-- CH5 --></a>
<h2>
	CHAPTER V
</h2>

<h3>
A FIRE SENSATION
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Joe Strong had to think quickly. Every acrobat,
every person who does "stunts" in a circus,
must; for something is always happening, or on the
verge of taking place. And when Joe looked up
and saw the rusted wire and noted the fraying
strands, several thoughts shot through his mind at
once.
</p>
<p>
"That rust spot wasn't there this morning when,
I looked at the trapeze," he mused. "And it hasn't
rained since. How did it get there?"
</p>
<p>
He thought of the too talkative Harry Loper,
and an ugly suspicion associated itself with him.
But Joe had no time for such thoughts then. What
was vital for him to know was whether or not the
thin wire cable would remain unbroken long enough
for him to reach the maximum of his swing, and
land on the platform. Or would he fall, spoiling
the act and also endangering himself?
</p>
<p>
True he might land in the net in such a way as
to come to no harm, as he had done many times,
and as many performers before him had done. But
the danger was that in a sudden and unexpected
drop downward he might not be able to get his
limbs in the proper landing position.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong had nerve. If he had lacked it he
would never have been so successful. And at once
he decided on a courageous proceeding.
</p>
<p>
"I'll bring all my weight suddenly on that left
hand cable," he mused, as he swung to and fro,
from side to side of the big tent. "If it's going to
break it will do so then. And I'll be ready for it.
I'll then keep hold of the trapeze bar, which will
be straight up and down instead of crosswise, and
swing by that. The other cable seems all right."
This was a fact which Joe ascertained by a quick
inspection.
</p>
<p>
There was no time for further thought. As he
swung, Joe suddenly shifted his weight, bringing
it all on the frayed and strangely rusted cable. As
he half expected, it gave way, and he dropped in
an instant, but not far.
</p>
<p>
The watching crowd gasped. It looked like an
accident. And it was, in a way, but Joe had purposely
caused it. As the wire broke Joe held tightly
to the wooden bar, which was now upright in
his hands instead of being horizontal. And though
it slipped through his fingers, perhaps for the
width of his palm, at last he gripped it in a firm hold
and kept on with his swing.
</p>
<p>
And then the applause broke forth, for the audience
thought it all a part of the trick&mdash;they thought
that Joe had purposely caused the cable to break
to make the act more effective.
</p>
<p>
To and fro swung Joe, nearer and nearer to the
second platform, and then, reaching the height of
the long arc, he turned his body and stepped full
and fair on the little square of velvet-covered boards.
</p>
<p>
With a lithe contortion, Joe squirmed to an upright
position, recovering his balance with a great
effort, for he had been put out in his calculations of
distance, and then, turning, he bowed to the crowds,
revolving on the platform to take in every one.
</p>
<p>
Again the applause broke forth, to be drowned in
the boom and ruffle of the drums as the band began
to play. There is little time in a circus, where act
follows act so quickly, for long acknowledgments.
</p>
<p>
The other performers came into the rings or on
to the raised platforms, and Joe descended by
means of the rope ladder. Helen met him, and they
walked toward the dressing rooms.
</p>
<p>
"That was a wonderful trick, Joe," she said.
"But I didn't see you practice that drop."
</p>
<p>
"I didn't practice it," he remarked dryly. "I
did it on the spur of the moment."
</p>
<p>
"Joe Strong! wasn't it dangerous?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, a little."
</p>
<p>
"What made you do it?"
</p>
<p>
"I couldn't help it."
</p>
<p>
"You couldn't help it? Joe&mdash;do you mean&mdash;?"
She sensed that something was wrong, but walking
around the circus arena, with performers coming
and going, was not the place to speak of it. Joe
saw that she understood.
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you later," he said. "We have to get
ready for the trick box and the vanishing lady stunt
now."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Joe! were you in much danger?" she asked
in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, not much," he answered, and he tried to
speak lightly. Yet he did not like to think of that
one moment when he saw the rusted and broken
wire.
</p>
<p>
While Joe and Helen are preparing for the box
act, which has been treated fully in the previous
volume, the explanation of how the vanishing lady
trick was accomplished will be given, though that,
too, has been explained in an earlier volume.
</p>
<p>
A large newspaper is put on the stage and the
chair set on the paper, thus, seemingly, precluding
the possibility of a trap door being cut in the stage
through which the lady in the chair might slip.
The word "seemingly" is used with a due sense
of what it means. The newspaper was not a perfect
one. On one of its sides which was not exhibited
to the audience, there was cut an opening,
or trap, that exactly corresponded in size with a
trap door on the stage. The paper, as explained
in the previous book, is strengthened with cardboard,
and the trap is a double one, being cut in the center,
the flaps being easily moved either way.
</p>
<p>
The audience thinks it sees a perfect newspaper.
But there is a square hole in it, but concealed as is
a secret trap door.
</p>
<p>
When Joe laid the paper on the stage he placed
it so that the square, double flap in it was exactly
over the trap in the stage floor. He then drew the
page of the paper that he had held out to the
audience toward himself, exposing the trap for
use, but because it was so carefully made, and the
cut was so fine, it was not visible from the front.
</p>
<p>
Helen took her place in the chair, which, of
course, was a trick one. It was fitted with a concealed
rod and a cap, and it was over this cap,
brought out at the proper moment, that Joe carefully
placed the black veil, when he was pretending
to mesmerize Helen. There was a cross rod, also
concealed in the chair, and on either end of this,
something like the epaulettes of a soldier, so that
when these ends were under the veil and the cap
was in place it looked as though some one sat in the
chair, when, really, no one did.
</p>
<p>
Helen was in the chair at the start. But as soon
as she was covered by the veil she began to get out
The seat of the chair was hinged within its frame
As Helen sat on it, and after she had been covered
with the veil, she rested her weight on her hands,
which were placed on the extreme outer edges of
this seat frame. She pulled a catch which caused
the seat to drop, and at the same time the trap beneath
her, including the prepared newspaper, was
opened by an attendant. The black veil all about
the chair prevented the audience seeing this.
</p>
<p>
Helen lowered herself down through the dropped
seat of the chair, through the trap, and under the
stage. And while she was doing this it still looked
as if she were in the chair, for the false cap and
the extended cross rod made outlines as if of a
human form beneath the black veil.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Helen was out of the chair and beneath
the stage an attendant closed the newspaper
and wooden floor traps. Joe then suddenly raised
the veil, taking in its folds the false cap and the
cross piece which had represented Helen's shoulders.
They were thin and light&mdash;these pieces of trick apparatus&mdash;and
no one suspected they were in the
veil. The hinged seat of the chair snapped back in
place by means of a spring, and when Joe stepped
aside, holding the veil, there was the empty chair;
and the newspaper, which he picked up, seemed to
preclude the possibility of there having been a trap
in the stage. But Joe was careful how he exhibited
this paper to his audience.
</p>
<p>
And so it was that the lady "vanished."
</p>
<p>
"And now, Joe, tell me all about it!" demanded
Helen, when the circus was over for the afternoon,
and the box and vanishing tricks had been successfully
performed. "What happened to your
trapeze?"
</p>
<p>
"Some one spilled acid on one of the wire ropes,
and it ate into the metal, corroding it and separating
a number of the strands so that a little extra
weight broke them," said Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Acid on the cable?" cried Helen. "How did you
find out?"
</p>
<p>
"I just examined the wire. I knew it couldn't
have rusted naturally in such a short time. There
was a peculiar smell about the wire, and I know
enough of chemistry to make a simple acid test!
What kind of acid was used I don't know, but it
was strong enough to eat the steel."
</p>
<p>
"Who could have put it on?"
</p>
<p>
"That I've got to find out!"
</p>
<p>
"Was it Harry Loper?"
</p>
<p>
"I taxed him with it, but he swears he knew
nothing of it," said Joe. "I'm inclined to believe
him, too. I charged him with drinking, and he
could not deny that. But he said he met some old
friends and they induced him to have a little convivial
time with them. No, I don't believe he'd do
it. He's weak and foolish, but he had no reason to
try to injure me."
</p>
<p>
"Who would, Joe? Of course there's Bill Carfax,
but he hasn't been seen near the circus of
late."
</p>
<p>
"No, I don't believe it could have been Bill. I'll
have to be on my guard."
</p>
<p>
"Do, Joe!" urged Helen. "Oh, I can't bear to
think of it!"
</p>
<p>
"Don't then!" laughed Joe, trying to make light
of it. "Let's go down town and I'll buy you some
ice cream."
</p>
<p>
"But you're not going to give up trying to find
out who put acid on the trapeze, are you?"
</p>
<p>
"No, indeed!" declared the young performer. "I
have two problems on my hands now&mdash;that and
trying to learn how too many persons came to the
circus this afternoon," and he told Helen about the
extra tickets.
</p>
<p>
"That's queer!" she exclaimed. "Some jinx bug
must be after us!"
</p>
<p>
"Don't get superstitious!" warned Joe. "Now
we'll forget our troubles. They may not amount
to anything after all."
</p>
<p>
But, though he spoke lightly, Joe was worried,
and he was not going to let Helen know that. They
went into an ice-cream parlor and "relaxed," as
Helen called it.
</p>
<p>
The two were on their way back to the circus lot,
intending to go to supper and prepare for the evening
entertainment, when there was a sudden alarm
down the street, and, in an instant, the fire engines
and other apparatus dashed past.
</p>
<p>
"A fire!" cried Joe. "Come on, Helen! It's just
down the street!"
</p>
<p>
They could see smoke pouring from a small
building and a crowd rushing toward it. Thither,
also, the fire apparatus was dashing. Joe and Helen
were among the early arrivals.
</p>
<p>
"What is it?" asked Joe of an officer. "I mean
what sort of place is that?" and he pointed to the
building, which was now obscured by smoke.
</p>
<p>
"Dime museum," was the answer. "Lot of
fakes. I sent in the alarm. A fire-eater was trying
some new stunt and he set the place ablaze, so the
boss yelled to me. Come now, youse all have to git
back!" and he motioned to the crowd, which was
constantly increasing, to get beyond the fire lines.

<h3>
SOMETHING NEW
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What with the clanging of the gongs on the
engines and on the red runabouts that brought two
battalion chiefs to the fire; the pall of smoke, with,
here and there, the suggestion of a red blaze; the
swaying excitement of the crowd; the yells of harassed
policemen; the scene at the blaze of the dime
museum was one long to be remembered by Joe
Strong and Helen Morton&mdash;particularly in the light
of what happened afterward.
</p>
<p>
"Joe, did you hear what he said?" asked Helen,
as she moved back with the young acrobat in conformity
with the officer's order.
</p>
<p>
"You mean that we've got to slide?"
</p>
<p>
"No, that a fire-eater started the blaze. Does he
mean a professional 'fire bug,' as I have heard them
called?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, not at all!" exclaimed Joe. "A fire-eater
is a chap who does such stunts in a museum,
theater, or even in a circus. Sampson Brothers used
to have one, I understand, from looking over the
old books. But it wasn't much of an act. Golly,
this is going to be some blaze!"
</p>
<p>
That was very evident from the increased smoke
that rolled out and the crackle of fire that now
could be heard above the puffing of the engines and
the shouts of the mob.
</p>
<p>
"A regular tinder box!" muttered the officer who
had told Joe the origin of the blaze. "Place ought
to have been pulled down long ago. Git back there
youse!" he yelled to some venturesome lads. "Want
to git mushed up?"
</p>
<p>
The blaze was a big one, considerable damage
was done, and several persons were injured. But
quick work by an efficient department prevented the
flames from spreading to the buildings on either
side of the one where it had started.
</p>
<p>
Joe and Helen stayed long enough to see the
menace gotten under control, and then they departed
just as the ambulance rolled away with the last of
the victims.
</p>
<p>
"That's the fire-eater they're taking to the hospital
now," said the policeman who had first spoken
to the young circus performers. "They took him
into a drug store to wrap him in oil and cotton
batting."
</p>
<p>
"Will he live?" asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
"Just a chance," was the answer. "Say, if I had
to get my living eating fire I'd starve," confided the
policeman. "It must be some stunt! I always
thought it was a fake, but this fire burned real
enough."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, it isn't all fake," said Joe, "though of course
there's a trick about it."
</p>
<p>
"You seem to know," said the policeman, and he
smiled at Joe and Helen. His chief troubles were
about over with the departure of the ambulance
and the knowledge that filtered through the crowd
that the most of the excitement was over.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I'm in the circus business," confessed Joe.
"I never ate fire," he went on, "but&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I know you now!" cried the officer. "I
was on duty out at the circus grounds this afternoon,
and I went into the tent when you did that
box act. Say, that's some stunt! Do they really pay
ten thousand dollars to the fellow who tells how it's
done?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, we've never paid out the money yet," said
Joe, with a smile. "But it's there, waiting for
some one to claim it."
</p>
<p>
"Then I'm coming to-night to watch you," said
the officer, who appeared delighted that he had recognized
one of the "profesh."
</p>
<p>
"Come along," replied Joe. "Here, wait a minute!
There are a couple of passes. Come and
bring a friend. If you tell how I do the trick you'll
get the ten thousand. Only you'll have to post a
hundred dollars as a forfeit to the Red Cross in
case you don't guess right. That's included in the
offer."
</p>
<p>
"Oh!" The officer did not seem quite so pleased.
"Well, I'll come anyhow," he went on, accepting the
passes Joe handed him. The policeman had allowed
Joe and Helen to stay in an advantageous place
where they could watch the fire.
</p>
<p>
"Where are they taking the man who did the
dangerous trick that caused all the trouble?" asked
Helen, as she prepared to walk on with Joe.
</p>
<p>
"To the City Hospital, Miss. He's a bad case, I
understand."
</p>
<p>
"Poor fellow," murmured Helen. "Do you think
we could go to see him, and do something for him,
Joe?" she asked solicitously. "He's in almost the
same line of business as ourselves."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I don't know," was the slow answer.
</p>
<p>
"I can fix it up if you want to see him&mdash;that is,
if the doctors and nurses will let you," said the
policeman. "I know the hospital superintendent.
You just tell him that Casey sent you and it will
be all right."
</p>
<p>
"Thanks; perhaps we will," said Joe.
</p>
<p>
There was a little time after supper before the
performers had to go on with their acts, and Helen
prevailed on Joe to take her to the hospital whither
the injured fire-eater had been removed. They
found him swathed in bandages, no objection being
made to their seeing him after the magic name of
"Casey" had been mentioned to the superintendent.
</p>
<p>
"We came in to see if you needed any help," said
Joe to the pathetic figure in the bed. "We're in
the same line of business, in a way."
</p>
<p>
"Are you a fire-eater?" slowly asked the man.
</p>
<p>
"No," Joe told him. "But I'm in the circus&mdash;Sampson Brothers'."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes, I've heard about it. A partner of mine
was with 'em for years. Gascoyne was his name."
</p>
<p>
"That was before my time," said Joe. "But how
are you getting on? Can we be of any help to you?
We professionals must help one another."
</p>
<p>
"That's right. We get knocked often enough,"
was the reply. "Well, I'm doing as well as can
be expected, the doctor says. And I'm not really
in need of anything. The museum folks were pretty
good to me. Thank you, just the same."
</p>
<p>
"How did it happen?" asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, just my carelessness," said the man. "We
get careless after playing with fire a bit. I put too
much alcohol on the tow, and there was a draft
from an open door, some draperies caught, and it
was all going before I knew it. I tried to put it out&mdash;that's
how I got burned."
</p>
<p>
"Then you really didn't eat fire?" asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
Joe and the man swathed in bandages looked at
one another and a semblance of a wink passed between
them.
</p>
<p>
"Nobody can eat fire, lady," said the museum
performer. "It's all a trick, same as some your husband
does in the circus."
</p>
<p>
Joe blushed almost as much as did Helen.
</p>
<p>
"We're not married yet, but we're going to be,"
explained Joe, smiling.
</p>
<p>
"Lucky guy!" murmured the man. "Well, as
I was saying, it's all a trick," he went on. "Strong
alum solution in your mouth, just a dash of alcohol
to make a blaze that flares up but goes out quickly
if you smother it right. You know the game,"
and he looked at Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Well, not exactly," was the reply. "I've read
something of it. But, somehow, it never appealed
to me."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, it makes a good act, friend!" said the man
earnestly. "I've done a lot of museum and circus
stunts, and this always goes big. There's no danger
if you handle it right. I'll be more careful next
time."
</p>
<p>
"You don't mean to say you'll go back to it, do
you?" asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
"Sure, lady! I've got to earn my living! And
this is the best thing I know. I'll be out in a
week. I didn't swallow any, thank goodness! Oh,
sure I'll go at it again."
</p>
<p>
Joe and Helen cheered the sufferer up as much
as they could, and then departed. Joe privately
left a bill of substantial denomination with the
superintendent to be used for anything extra the
patient might need.
</p>
<p>
On the way back to the circus, where they were
soon to give their evening performance, Joe was
unusually quiet.
</p>
<p>
"What's the matter?" asked Helen. "Are you
thinking of that accident on the trapeze?"
</p>
<p>
"No," was the answer. "It's something different.
I've got to get up a new act for the show.
That trapeze act, even the way I had to do it this
afternoon, isn't sensational enough. I've got to have
something new, and I've about decided on it."
</p>
<p>
"What?" asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
"I'm going to become a fire-eater!" was the unexpected,
reply.

<h3>
THE PAPER EXPERT
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For a moment Helen Morton stared at Joe
Strong as though not quite sure whether or not he
was in his proper mind. Then, seeing plainly that
he was in earnest, she seemed to shrink away from
him, as he had noticed her shrink away, for a moment,
from the burned man suffering there in the
hospital.
</p>
<p>
"What's the matter, Helen?" asked Joe, trying
to speak lightly. "Don't you want to see some more
sensational acts in the show?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, but not that kind," she answered with a
shudder she could not conceal. "Oh, Joe, if you
were to&mdash;" She could not go on. Her breast
heaved painfully.
</p>
<p>
"Now look here, Helen!" he exclaimed with
good-natured roughness, "that isn't any way to look
at matters; especially when we both depend on sensations
for making our living.
</p>
<p>
"You know, as well as I do, that in this business
we have to take risks. That's what makes our acts
go. You take a risk every time you perform with
Rosebud. You might slip, the horse might slip, and
you'd be hurt. Now is this new act I am thinking
of perfor&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I may take risks, Joe!" interrupted Helen.
"But they are perfectly natural risks, and I have
more than an even chance. You might just as well
say you take a risk walking along the street, and
so you do. An elevated train might fall on you or
an auto run up on the sidewalk. The risks I take
in the act with Rosebud are only natural ones, and
really shouldn't be counted. But if you start to
become a fire-eater&mdash;Oh, Joe, think of that
poor fellow in the hospital!"
</p>
<p>
"He didn't get that way from eating fire&mdash;or
pretending to eat it&mdash;for the amusement of the public.
He might just as easily have been burned the
way he is by lighting the kitchen stove for his wife
to get breakfast. His accident was entirely outside
of his act, you might say. Why, I use lighted
candles in some of my tricks. Now, if some one
knocked over a candle, and it caused a fire on the
stage and I was burned, would you want me to
give up being a magician?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no, I suppose not," said Helen slowly. "But
fire is so dangerous. And to think of putting it in
your mouth! How can you do it, Joe? Oh, it can't
be done!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, there's a trick about it. I haven't mastered
all the details yet, so as to give a smooth performance,
but I can make an attempt at it."
</p>
<p>
"Joe Strong! do you mean to say you know how
to eat fire?" demanded Helen, and now her eyes
showed her astonishment.
</p>
<p>
"Well, not exactly eat it, though that is the term
used. But I do know how to do it. I learned, in a
rudimentary way, when I was with Professor
Rosello&mdash;the first man who taught me sleight-of-hand.
He had one fire-eating act, but it didn't
amount to much. He told me the secret of it, such
as it was.
</p>
<p>
"But if I put on that stunt I'm going to make it
different. I'm going to dress it up, make it sensational
so that it will be the talk of the country
where circuses are exhibited."
</p>
<p>
"And won't you run any danger?" questioned the
girl quickly.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I suppose so; just as I do when I work on
the high trapeze or ride my motor cycle along the
high wire. But it's all in the day's work. And now
let's talk about something pleasant&mdash;I mean let's
get off the shop."
</p>
<p>
Helen sighed. She was plainly disturbed, but
she did not want to burden Joe with her worries.
She knew he must have calm nerves and an untroubled
mind to do his various acts in the circus
that night.
</p>
<p>
After supper and before the evening performance
Joe made a careful examination of his trapeze apparatus.
Beyond the place where the acid had eaten
into the wire strands, causing them to become weakened
so that they parted, the appliances did not appear
to have been tampered with. Nor were there
any clews which might show who had done the deed.
That it could have happened by accident was out
of the question. The acid could have gotten on the
wire rope in one way only. Some one must have
climbed up the rope ladder to the platform and applied
the stuff.
</p>
<p>
"But who did it?" asked Jim Tracy, when Joe
had told him of the discovery of the acid-eaten
cable.
</p>
<p>
"Some enemy. Perhaps the same one who was
responsible for our loss in tickets this afternoon,"
answered the young magician.
</p>
<p>
"Carfax?" asked the ringmaster.
</p>
<p>
"It might be, and yet he isn't the only man who's
been discharged or who has a grudge against me.
There was Gianni with whom I had a fight."
</p>
<p>
"You mean the Italian? Yes, he was an ugly
customer. But I haven't heard of him for years.
I don't believe he's even in this part of the country."
</p>
<p>
"And we haven't any reason to suppose that Carfax
is, either, after his fiasco in trying to expose
my Box of Mystery trick. But we've got to be on
our guard."
</p>
<p>
"I should say so!" exclaimed the ringmaster.
"And now about your trapeze act, Joe! Are you
going to put it on again to-night?"
</p>
<p>
"Of course. It's billed."
</p>
<p>
"Then you'll have to hustle to rig up a new
rope."
</p>
<p>
"I'm not going to put on a new rope," declared
Joe. "The act went so well when I seemed about
to fall, that I'm going to keep that feature in. I'll
rig up a catch on the severed cable. At the proper
time I'll snap it loose, seem to fall, swing by the
dangling bar as I did before, and land on the platform
that way. It will be more effective than if I
did it in the regular way."
</p>
<p>
"But won't it be risky?"
</p>
<p>
Joe shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
"No more so than any trapeze act. Now that
I'm ready for the sudden drop I'll be on my guard.
No, I can work it all right. And now about these
extra admissions? What are we going to do about
them?"
</p>
<p>
"Well," said the ringmaster, "maybe we'd better
talk to Moyne about them. If they ring an extra
thousand persons in on us again to-night the thing
will be getting serious."
</p>
<p>
The treasurer was called in consultation with Joe
and Tracy and other circus officials, and it was decided
to keep a special watch on the ticket wagon
and the ticket takers that night.
</p>
<p>
Joe quickly made the change in his trapeze and
tested it, finding that he could work it perfectly.
Then he began to think of his new fire-eating act.
He was determined to make that as great a success
as was his now well advertised ten thousand dollar
mystery box act.
</p>
<p>
The evening performance had not long been under
way, and Joe had done his big swing successfully,
when he was sought out by Mr. Moyne.
</p>
<p>
"The same thing has happened again," said the
treasurer.
</p>
<p>
"You mean more people coming in than we have
sold tickets for?"
</p>
<p>
"That's it."
</p>
<p>
"Well, where do the extra admissions come
from? I mean where do the people get their admission
slips from&mdash;the extra people?"
</p>
<p>
"That's what we can't find out," the treasurer
aid. "As far as the ticket takers can tell only one
kind of admission slip for the fifty cent seats is being
handed them. But the number, as tallied by the
automatic gates, does not jibe with the number of
ordinary admissions sold at the ticket office. To-night
there is a difference of about eight hundred
and seventy-five."
</p>
<p>
"Do you mean," asked Joe, "that that number of
persons came in on tickets that were never sold at
the ticket wagon?"
</p>
<p>
"That's just what I mean. There is an extra
source from which the ordinary admission tickets
come. As I told you this afternoon, we are having
no trouble with our reserved seats. There have
been no duplicates there. But there is a duplication
in the fifty cent seats, where one may take his
pick as to where he wants to sit."
</p>
<p>
"Don't we have tickets on sale in some of the
downtown stores?" Joe asked.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes, several of the stores sell tickets up to
a certain hour. Then they send the balance up here
for us to dispose of."
</p>
<p>
"How about their accounts? Have you had them
gone over carefully?"
</p>
<p>
"They tally to a penny."
</p>
<p>
"How about the unsold tickets these agents send
back to us? Isn't there a chance on the way up for
some one to slip out some of the pasteboards, Mr.
Moyne?"
</p>
<p>
"There is a chance, yes, but it hasn't been done.
I have checked up the accounts of the stores, and
there is the cash or the unsold tickets to balance
every time. But somehow, and from some place,
an extra number of the ordinary admission tickets
are being sold, and we are not getting the money for
them."
</p>
<p>
"It is queer," said Joe. "I have an idea that I
want to try out the first chance I get. Save me a
bunch of these ordinary admission tickets. Take
them from the boxes at random and let me have
them."
</p>
<p>
"I will," promised the treasurer. "There is nothing
we can do to-night to stop the fraud, is there?"
he asked. Mr. Moyne was a very conscientious
treasurer. It disturbed him greatly to see the circus
lose money.
</p>
<p>
"I don't see what we can do," said Joe. "If we
start an inquiry it may cause a fight. Let it go.
We'll have to charge it to profit and loss. And don't
forget to let me have some of those tickets. I want
to examine them."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Moyne promised to attend to the matter. Joe
then had to go on in his Box of Mystery trick, and
when this was finished, amid much applause, he
caused Helen to "vanish" in the manner already
described.
</p>
<p>
The circus made considerable money in this town,
even with the bogus admissions, and as the weather
was fine and as the show would exhibit the next
day in a big city for a two days' stand, every one
was in good humor. Staying over night in the same
city where they exhibited during the day was always
a rest for the performers. They got more
sleep and were in better trim for work.
</p>
<p>
The last act was finished, the chariot races had
taken place, and the audience was surging out. The
animal tent had already been taken down and the
animals themselves were being loaded on the railroad
train.
</p>
<p>
As Joe, Helen, and the other performers started
for their berths, to begin the trip to the next town,
the "main top" began coming down. The circus
was on the move.
</p>
<p>
Soon after breakfast the next morning, having
seen that all his apparatus had safely arrived, Joe
visited Mr. Moyne in the latter's office.
</p>
<p>
"Have you a bunch of tickets for me?" asked the
young magician.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, here they are&mdash;several hundred picked at
random from the boxes at the entrance. I can't
see anything wrong. If you're looking for counterfeit
tickets I don't believe you'll find them," added
Mr. Moyne.
</p>
<p>
"I don't know that I am looking for counterfeits,"
said Joe. "That may be the explanation, or
it may be there is a leak somewhere in the ticket
wagon."
</p>
<p>
"I'm almost sure there isn't," declared the treasurer.
"But of course no one is infallible. I hope
you get to the bottom of the mystery."
</p>
<p>
"I hope so myself," replied Joe, with a smile,
as he put the tickets in a valise.
</p>
<p>
A little later he was on his way downtown. He
had several hours before he would have to go "on,"
as he did not take part in the parade, and he had
several matters to attend to.
</p>
<p>
Joe made his way toward a large office building,
carrying the valise with the circus tickets. A little
later he might have been seen entering an office, the
door of which bore the name of "Herbert Waldon,
Consulting Chemist."
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Strong," said Joe to the boy who came forward
to inquire his errand. "Mr. Waldon is expecting
me, I believe."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes," said the boy. "You're to come right
in."
</p>
<p>
Joe was ushered into a room which was filled
with strange appliances, from test tubes and retorts
to electrical furnaces and X-ray apparatus. A
little man in a rather soiled linen coat came forward,
smiling.
</p>
<p>
"I won't shake hands with you, Mr. Strong," he
said, "for I've been dabbling in some vile-smelling
stuff. But if you wait until I wash I'll be right with
you."
</p>
<p>
"All right," assented Joe. And then, as he caught
sight of what seemed to be a number of canceled
bank checks on a table, he smilingly asked: "Have
you been paying your income tax?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no," answered the chemist with a laugh.
"Those are just some samples of paper sent in for
me to test. An inventor is trying to get up an acid-proof
ink. I'm a sort of paper expert, among my
other chemical activities, and I'm putting these
samples through a series of tests. But you'll not be
interested in them."
</p>
<p>
"I don't know but what I shall be," returned Joe,
with sudden energy. "Since you are a paper expert
I may be able to set you another task besides
that of showing me the latest thing in fire-resisting
liquids. Yes, I may want your services in both
lines."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'm here to do business," said Mr. Waldon,
smiling.

<h3>
JOE EATS FIRE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The chemist led the way into a little office. This
opened off from the room in which was the apparatus,
and where, as Joe had become more and
more keenly aware, there was a most unpleasant
odor.
</p>
<p>
"I'll open the window, close the laboratory door,
and you won't notice it in a little while," said Mr.
Waldon, as he observed Joe's nose twitching. "I'm
so used to it I don't mind, but you, coming in from
the fresh air&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"It isn't exactly perfume," interrupted Joe, with
a laugh. "But don't be uneasy on my account. I
can stand it."
</p>
<p>
However, he was glad when the fresh air came
in through the window. The chemist washed his
hands and then sat down at a desk, inviting Joe
to draw up his chair.
</p>
<p>
"Now, what can I do for you?" asked Mr. Waldon.
"Is it fire or paper?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, since I know pretty well what I want to
ask you in the matter of fire," replied Joe, "and
since I've got a puzzling paper problem here, suppose
we tackle the hardest first, and come to the
known, and easier, trick later."
</p>
<p>
"Just as you say," assented Mr. Waldon. "What's
your paper problem?"
</p>
<p>
Joe's answer was to take from the valise several
hundreds of the circus tickets. They were the kind
sold for fifty cents, or perhaps more in these days
of the war tax. They entitle the holder to a seat
on what, at a baseball game, would be called the
"bleachers." In other words they were not reserved-seat
coupons.
</p>
<p>
However, these tickets were not the one-time
blue or red pieces of stiff pasteboard, bearing the
name of the circus and the words "ADMIT ONE,"
which were formerly sold at the gilded wagon.
These were handed in at the main entrance, and
the tickets were used over and over again. Sometimes
the blue ones sold for fifty cents, and a kind
selling for seventy-five cents entitled the purchaser
to a seat with a folding back to it, though it was not
reserved.
</p>
<p>
But Joe had instituted some changes when he became
one of the circus proprietors, and one was in
the matter of the general admission tickets. He
had them printed on a thin but tough quality of
paper, and each ticket was numbered. In this way
it needed but a glance at the last ticket in the rack
and a look at the memorandum of the last number
previously sold at the former performance, to tell
exactly how many general admissions had been disposed
of.
</p>
<p>
These numbered tickets were not used over again,
but were destroyed after the day's accounts had
been made up. At first Joe and some others of the
officials had had an idea that the man who was
charged with the work of destroying the tickets,
instead of doing so, had kept some out and sold
them at a reduced price. But an investigation
proved that this was not the case.
</p>
<p>
"Some one is ringing in extra tickets on us,"
stated Joe to the chemist. "We want to find out
who it is and how the trick is worked. So far, we
haven't been able to find this out. As a matter of
fact, we don't know whether there are bogus tickets
in our boxes or not. We haven't been able to detect
two kinds. They all seem the same."
</p>
<p>
"Some numbers must be duplicated," said Mr.
Waldon, as he picked up a handful of the slips Joe
had brought. "That's very obvious. The numbers
must be duplicated in some instances."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, we have discovered that," returned Joe.
"But the queer part is, taking even two tickets with
the same number, we don't know which was sold at
our ticket wagon and which is the bogus one. Here's
a case in point."
</p>
<p>
He picked up two of the coupons. As far as eye
or touch could tell they were identical, and they
bore the same red number, one up in the hundred
thousands.
</p>
<p>
"Now," continued Joe, "can you tell which of
these two is the official circus ticket and which is
the bogus one?"
</p>
<p>
The chemist thought for a moment.
</p>
<p>
"Have you a ticket&mdash;say one issued some time
ago&mdash;which you are positive is genuine?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"I'm ready for you there," answered Joe.
"Here's a coupon that happened to escape destruction.
It was one sold several weeks ago at our
ticket wagon, before we noticed this trouble. I
bought the ticket myself, so I know. I happened
to be passing the wagon, and a boy was trying to
reach up to buy a fifty cent seat. He wasn't quite
tall enough, so I reached for him.
</p>
<p>
"Then, when I looked at him, I saw that fifty
cents meant a lot to him. I gave him back his half
dollar out of my own pocket, and passed him
in to a reserved seat. But I forgot to turn the
ticket in to the wagon, and it's been in my pocket
ever since. Now I'm glad I saved it, for it will
serve as a tester."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," admitted the chemist, "it will. It's a good
thing you have this. But, Mr. Strong, this is going
to take some time. I'll have to compare all
these tickets with the admittedly genuine one, and
I'll have to make some intricate tests."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I hoped you might be able to tell me right
off the reel which of these coupons were good and
which bad," said Joe. "But I can appreciate that
it isn't easy. We certainly have been puzzled. So
I'll leave them with you, and you can write to me
when you have any results. I'll leave you a list of
the towns where we'll be showing for the next two
weeks. And now suppose we get at the fire-eating
business."
</p>
<p>
"All right," was the reply of the chemist. "But
with the understanding that you do all the eating.
I haven't any appetite that way myself."
</p>
<p>
They both laughed, and then, for some hours,
Joe Strong was closeted with the chemist.
</p>
<p>
When Joe emerged from the office of Mr. Waldon
there was a look of satisfaction on the face of
the young magician.
</p>
<p>
"I think I can make quite an act, after what
you've told me," he said. "As soon as I get it perfected
I'll send you word and you can come to see
me."
</p>
<p>
"I will, if you aren't too far away," promised the
chemist.
</p>
<p>
That night, following the closing of the performance,
Joe invited Helen, Jim Tracy, and a few
of his more intimate friends and associates into his
private dressing tent.
</p>
<p>
"I have the nucleus of a new act," he said, when
they were seated in chairs before a small table, on
which were several pieces of apparatus. "Just give
me your opinion of this."
</p>
<p>
Joe lighted a candle, picked up on a fork what
seemed to be a piece of bread, and touched it to the
candle flame. In an instant the object that was on
the fork burst into a blaze, and, before the eyes
of his friends, Joe calmly put the flaming portion
into his mouth.
</p>
<p>
He closed his lips, seemed to be chewing something,
opened his mouth, and showed it empty.
</p>
<p>
"A little light lunch!" he remarked, but his smile
faded as Helen screamed in horror.

<h3>
THE CHEMIST'S LETTER
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"Oh, Joe, you'll surely burn yourself!" exclaimed
the startled bareback rider.
</p>
<p>
"Did you get burned?" questioned Mrs. Watson.
</p>
<p>
"Some trick!" declared the snake charmer.
</p>
<p>
For the moment there was some excitement, for
this was a new act for the circus people.
</p>
<p>
Helen soon recovered her customary composure,
and then she explained the cause of her excitement
and the startled cry she had given. She had, of
course, expected some trick with fire when Joe had
summoned her and the others to his own private
part of the dressing tents. But she had not expected
to see him actually put the blazing material in his
mouth.
</p>
<p>
"I thought there was some sleight-of-hand performance
about it," she said. "I had an idea that
you only pretended to put the blazing stuff in your
mouth, Joe. And when I saw it I was afraid you'd
breathe in the flames and&mdash;and&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
She did not need to go on, they all understood
what she meant, for every one in the circus knew
that Helen and Joe were engaged.
</p>
<p>
"I once saw a little boy burned at a bonfire at
which he was playing," went on Helen. "He died.
Since then the sight of fire near a human being has
always a bad effect on me. But I suppose I can
get over it, if I know there is no danger," she said
with a slight smile at Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I can assure you there isn't the slightest
danger," he declared. "If there was, I should be
the first to give it up. I am as fond of living as
any one."
</p>
<p>
"You don't show it, young man, in some of the
tricks you do," commented Mrs. Watson, with the
freedom befitting a "circus mother," and the privilege
of an old friend. "You must remember that
you don't live only for yourself," and she looked
significantly at Helen.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I'll be careful!" promised Joe. "And now
I'll do the trick again for you, and let you see that
it's absolutely harmless. Any of you could do it&mdash;if
you knew how."
</p>
<p>
"Excuse me!" exclaimed Jim Tracy. "Not for
mine!"
</p>
<p>
However they all watched Joe eagerly and interestedly,
even Helen. He did not seem to make
any unusual preparations. He merely took a drink
of what seemed to be water. Then he ignited something
in the flame of the candle and placed the
burning stuff in his mouth, seeming to chew it with
gusto.
</p>
<p>
"Oh!" exclaimed Helen. But beyond that and a
momentary placing of one hand over her heart, she
did not give way to emotion. Then, as Joe did
the fire-eating trick again, Helen forced herself to
watch him closely. As he had said, he took no harm
from the act.
</p>
<p>
"Tell us how you do it," begged Bill Watson.
"When I get over being funny&mdash;or getting audiences
to think I am&mdash;I may want to live on something
hot. How do you work it?"
</p>
<p>
"Well," said Joe, "if it's all the same to you, I'd
rather not tell. It isn't that I'm afraid of any of
my friends giving the trick away, and so spoiling
the mystery of it for the crowds. It's just as it
was in my box act. If any of you are asked how
I do this fire trick you can truly say you don't know,
for none of you will know by my telling, not even
Helen, though she is in on the box secret. I'll only
say that I protect my face and mouth, as well as
hands, in a certain way, and that I do, actually,
put the blazing material into my mouth. I am not
burned. So if any one asks you about the act you
may tell them that much with absolute truth. Now
the question is&mdash;how is it going to go with the audiences?
We need something&mdash;or, at least, I do&mdash;to
create a sensation. Will this answer?"
</p>
<p>
"I should say so!" exclaimed Jim Tracy. "That
ought to go big when it's dressed up."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, this is only the ground work," said Joe.
"I'm going to elaborate this fire act and make it
the sensation of the season. I've only begun on it.
I got from a chemist the materials I want with
which to protect myself, and I have shown, to my
own and your satisfaction, that I can eat fire without
getting harmed. So far all is well. Now I'm
going to work the act up into something really
worth while."
</p>
<p>
"But you'll still be careful, won't you, Joe?"
asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
"Indeed I will," he assured her.
</p>
<p>
"Do the trick once more, Joe," suggested Bill
Watson. "I'm coming as close as you'll let me,
and I want to criticize it from the standpoint of
a man in the audience."
</p>
<p>
"That's what I'm after," said Joe. "If there
are any flaws in the act, now is the time to find it
out."
</p>
<p>
Once more he set the material ablaze and put it
into his mouth. Bill Watson watched closely, and,
at the end, the old clown shook his head.
</p>
<p>
"I saw you actually put the fire in your mouth,"
he testified. "No one can do more than that. It
takes nerve!"
</p>
<p>
Of course, no one can actually swallow fire and
live. The slightest breath of flame on the lungs
or on the mucous membrane of the throat and passages
is fatal. So when the terms "fire-eating" or
"fire-eater" are used it will be in the sense of its
being a theatrical act. There is a trick about it,
and the trick is this:
</p>
<p>
In the first place, the flame itself is produced by
blazing alcohol. This produces a blaze, and a hot
one, too, but there is no smoke. In other words,
the combustion is almost perfect, there being no
residue of carbon to remain hot after the actual
flame is extinguished.
</p>
<p>
And now as to the actual putting into one's mouth
something that is blazing hot: It all depends on
a very simple principle.
</p>
<p>
If the hand be thoroughly wet in water it may
be safely thrust for a fraction of a second into a
flaming gas jet. But mark this&mdash;for the <i>fraction
of a second only</i>. The water forms a protecting
film for the skin, and before it is evaporated the
hand must be taken out of danger. In other words,
there is needed an appreciable time for the fire to
beat the skin to the burning point.
</p>
<p>
This immunity from burns, to which the professional
fire-eaters owe their success, comes from this
film of moisture on their skin. They do not always
use water&mdash;in fact, this is only serviceable for a
momentary contact with flame, and, at that, on the
hands or face. In case a longer contact is desired,
a fire-resisting chemical liquid is used.
</p>
<p>
It is about the contact of flame with the tender
mucous membrane surfaces of the mouth and throat
that Joe, as a fire-eater, was most concerned.
</p>
<p>
In the first place, there is a constant film of the
secretion called saliva always flowing in the mouth.
It comes from glands in the throat and mouth, and
is very necessary to good digestion.
</p>
<p>
Now, for a very brief period this saliva, which is
just the same as a film of water on the hand, resists
the fire. But professional fire-eaters do not
depend on saliva alone. They use a chemical solution,
and this is what Joe did when he drank
something from a glass.
</p>
<p>
What that chemical solution was, Joe kept as a
closely guarded professional secret. He feared, too,
that some boy might make it, rinse his mouth out
with it, and then, getting an audience of his chums
together, might try to eat some blazing coals. He
might, and very likely would, be severely burned,
and his parents or those in charge of him would
blame Joe for allowing such dangerous information
to leak out.
</p>
<p>
So, though he guarded all his secrets of magic,
he was particularly careful to keep this one to himself.
</p>
<p>
But Joe protected his mouth and throat with a
fire-resisting liquid, the formula for which was
given him by the chemist to whom he submitted the
circus tickets.
</p>
<p>
The success of Joe and others of his kind depends
also in this on a well known natural law.
It is that there can be no combustion in the ordinary
sense where there is no oxygen. As a candle
will surely go out if enclosed in an air-tight receptacle&mdash;that
is, it will go out as soon as it has burned
up all the oxygen&mdash;just so surely will flame of any
kind go out when a person closes his mouth on it.
And as there is scarcely any air in the closed
mouth&mdash;all of it going down the bronchial tubes
into the lungs&mdash;it follows that the flame dies out
almost instantly. That fact being considered, and
the mouth and throat having been previously treated
with the secret chemical, there is really not so much
danger as appears.
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, a person inadvertently swallowing
hot tea or coffee will burn or scald his
mouth or tongue much more painfully than will
a professional fire-eater. Most people know how
painful a burned tongue is.
</p>
<p>
Joe told something of the history of fire-eating
"champions" to his audience of friends, for it appeared
that he had been reading up on the subject
and was well informed. Then he announced that
the private rehearsal was over.
</p>
<p>
"But I'm going to work this fire-eating up into
something that will cause a sensation," he said. And
he made good his promise.
</p>
<p>
It was about a week after this, and the circus had
been traveling about, playing to good business, when
Joe received a letter. In the upper left-hand corner
was the imprint of Herbert Waldon, Chemist.
</p>
<p>
"I hope he has some news about the circus tickets!"
exclaimed Joe. For the show had been losing
money steadily by means of the bogus coupons; not
as much as at first, but enough to make it necessary
to discover the fraud. And, so far, Mr. Moyne
had not been successful.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps this explains the mystery," mused Joe
as he opened the letter.
</p>

	CHAPTER X
</h2>

<h3>
THE PET CAT
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The typewritten sheet of the letter from Mr.
Waldon enclosed two of the engraved circus coupons.
They fluttered to the floor of Joe's private
tent as he tore open the envelope.
</p>
<p>
"Well, either he has discovered something, or he
has sent them back and given up," mused the young
magician. "Let's see what he says."
</p>
<p>
Joe quickly took in the contents of the letter. In
effect it stated that Mr. Waldon had discovered
which were the bogus and which were the real circus
tickets. He first gave an explanation of the
chemical tests he used. Joe read this hastily, but
carefully, then passed to the conclusions arrived at
by the expert, who was an authority on various
kinds of paper, as well as chemicals.
</p>
<p>
"The ticket I have marked No. 1 is a genuine
coupon, issued by your circus corporation," said Mr.
Waldon in his letter. "The slip marked by me as
No. 2 is a counterfeit. You will observe that they
both bear the red ink serial number 356,891.
</p>
<p>
"If you were a paper expert you would observe
that the paper used in the two tickets is different.
There is not a very great difference, and I am inclined
to think that both the genuine and the counterfeit
tickets were made on paper from the same
mill, but of a different 'run.' That is, it was made
at a different time.
</p>
<p>
"The printer who manufactured your tickets
bought his paper from a certain mill making a specialty
of this particular kind. Then some one, who
must know something of your financial and business
interests, had the bogus tickets made, and on
the same kind of paper. But there is a slight difference,
which I was able to detect by means of
chemical reactions. The coloring matter used varied
slightly, though the texture of the two kinds
of paper is almost exactly similar.
</p>
<p>
"Now, having settled that point, the solution of
the remaining equations of the problem rests with
you. I can not tell who had the bogus tickets printed.
You will have to go to the mill making the
paper and find out to whom they sold this kind. In
that way you will learn the names of all printers,
using it, and by a process of elimination you will
get at the one who printed the counterfeits.
</p>
<p>
"This printer may be an innocent party, or he
may be guilty. That is for you and the detectives
to determine. I hope I have started you on the right
track. I shall be interested to hear, my dear Mr.
Strong, how you make out in your fire-eating act."
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell him as soon as I try it on a real audience,"
said Joe, with a smile, as he folded the letter.
"And so counterfeit tickets have been rung
in on us! Well, I suspected that, since our own
men were thoroughly to be trusted. Now to get at
the guilty ones. And I shouldn't be surprised if
I could name one of the men involved. But I'll
call a meeting, and lay this before the directors."
</p>
<p>
The Sampson Brothers' Show was incorporated
and was run strictly on business lines. There was a
board of directors who looked after all business
matters, and Joe was soon in consultation with
them, laying before them Mr. Waldon's letter and
the two marked tickets.
</p>
<p>
"It would take an expert to tell them apart,"
said Mr. Moyne, as he examined the coupons closely.
"Well, what are we to do?"
</p>
<p>
"In the first place," declared Joe, "we must
change our form of general admission tickets at
once. That will stop the fraud, graft, or whatever
you want to call it. Then we must do as Mr. Waldon
says&mdash;look for the guilty parties. We'll have
to hire some detectives, I think."
</p>
<p>
This plan was voted a good one, and steps were
at once taken to change the form and style of the
general admission tickets. Joe also wired for a
man from a well known detective agency to meet
the show at the next town. Then the printing shop
which made the circus tickets was communicated
with.
</p>
<p>
That was all that could be done at present, and
Joe gave his attention to perfecting his new fire-eating
act.
</p>
<p>
He did not give up his mystery box trick, and
he still presented the vanishing lady illusion, Helen
assisting in both of these. Joe also did the big
swing, which always caused a thrill on account of
the danger involved. Careful watch was kept over
the trapeze and other apparatus so that no more
dangerous tampering could he attempted, and Joe
always looked over everything with sharp eyes before
trusting himself high in the air.
</p>
<p>
"Some one evidently has a grudge against me
as well as against the circus in general," he said to
Jim Tracy.
</p>
<p>
"Maybe it's the same person," suggested the ringmaster.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps. Well, as soon as we get some word
from the detectives we can start on the trail."
</p>
<p>
The circus had arrived at a large city, where it
was to show three days and nights, and preparations
were made for big crowds, as the city was
the center of a large number of industries, where
many thousands of men were employed at good
wages.
</p>
<p>
"We'll play to 'Straw Room Only' at every performance,"
said Mr. Moyne, rubbing his hands with
glee as he thought of the dollars that would be taken
in. "And I'm glad we discovered the bogus tickets
in time. We'd be out a lot of money if the counterfeits
were to be used here."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," agreed Joe. "But we aren't out of the
woods yet. The same man who imitated the light
green tickets may have the bright blue ones which
we now use for general admission duplicated and
sell them."
</p>
<p>
"We'll have to take that chance," said the treasurer.
"But I'll instruct the ticket takers to be unusually
careful."
</p>
<p>
That was all that could be done. The detective
had reported that he was making an examination,
starting at the paper mill, and was endeavoring to
learn where the bogus tickets had been made.
</p>
<p>
The circus parade had been held and witnessed
by enthusiastic crowds lining the streets. Then
was every prospect of big business, and it was borne
out.
</p>
<p>
Joe wished he had prepared his fire act earlier
but it could not be helped.
</p>
<p>
"I'll have it ready for to-morrow, though," he
said to Jim Tracy, at the conclusion of the first
afternoon in the big city where they were to stay
three days.
</p>
<p>
"Then I'm going to have it advertised," said the
ringmaster, who also sometimes acted as assistant
general manager. "We'll bill it big. You're sure
of yourself, are you?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes," answered Joe with a laugh. "I'll
give 'em their money's worth all right, but it won't
be the big sensation I'm planning for later on. That
will take time."
</p>
<p>
"Well, as long as it's a fire act it will be new
and novel, and it will draw," declared Jim Tracy.
</p>
<p>
It was later in the afternoon, when the circus
performance was over, that Joe and Helen strolled
downtown, as was their custom. Some convention
was being held in the city, and across one of the
principal streets was stretched a big banner of the
kind used in political campaigns.
</p>
<p>
It was hung from a heavy, slack wire from the
brick walls of two opposite buildings, and the banner
attracted considerable attention because of a
novel picture on it.
</p>
<p>
Joe and Helen were standing in the street, looking
up at the swaying creation of canvas and netting,
when a woman's cry came to their ears.
</p>
<p>
"Look! Look! The cat! The cat is walking
the wire!" she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
Joe and Helen turned first to see who it was that
had cried out. It was a woman in the street, and
with her parasol she pointed upward.
</p>
<p>
There, surely enough, half way out on the thick,
slack wire, and high above the middle of the street
was a large white cat. It was walking the wire
as one's pet might walk the back fence. But this
cat seemed to have lost its nerve. It had got half
way across, but was afraid to go farther and could
not turn around and go back.
</p>
<p>
As Joe and Helen looked, a woman appeared at
the window of one of the buildings from the front
walls of which the banner was suspended, and,
pointing at the cat, cried:
</p>
<p>
"A hundred dollars to whoever saves my cat!
A hundred dollars reward!"
</p>

<h3>
THE RESCUE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The tumult which had arisen in the street beneath
the banner when the crowd caught sight of the
cat was hushed for a moment after the woman's
frantic cry. Before that there had been some laughter,
and not a few cat-calls and exaggerated
"miaows" from boys in the street. But now every
one, even the mischievous urchins, seemed to sense
that something unusual was about to take place.
</p>
<p>
"Come back, Peter! Come back!" cried the
woman, stretching out her arms to the cat from
the window out of which she leaned. "Come back
to me!"
</p>
<p>
The white cat on the wire heard the voice of
the woman and seemed to want to return to its
mistress. But either the cat was not an adept at
turning on such a narrow support, or it was afraid
to try.
</p>
<p>
And, likewise, it was afraid to go forward. There
it stood, about in the middle of the wire, high above
the street, and it clung to its perch by its claws.
</p>
<p>
The banner was hung from the cross wire by
means of several loops of rope, and it was in some
of these loops that the cat had stuck its claws, and
so hung on.
</p>
<p>
As the cat remained there, suspended, the crowd
in the street below increased in size. But from the
time the woman had so frantically called there had
been no more of the cries from the crowd that
might be expected to frighten the animal.
</p>
<p>
"Will some one get my cat?" cried the woman
in a shrill voice, which could easily be heard by
Joe, Helen, and nearly every one else. "I'll give
one hundred dollars in cash to whoever saves him!"
she went on. "Come back, Peter! Come back!"
she appealed.
</p>
<p>
There was a thoughtless laugh from some one
at the woman's anxiety, and some one cried:
</p>
<p>
"There's lots of cats! Let Peter go!"
</p>
<p>
"The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals ought to get after whoever that was," said
Helen indignantly, and there was an approving murmur
from some of those near her.
</p>
<p>
"Does any one know that lady?" asked Joe, pointing
at the figure in the window. A pathetic figure
it was, too, of an old woman clad in black, as though
she had lost all her friends.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, she's a queer character," said some one
who seemed to know. "Lives up there all alone
in the old house that, except for the upper part
where she is now, has been turned into offices.
</p>
<p>
"She's rich, they say. Owns that building and
a lot of others on this street. But she lives all
alone in a few rooms, and has a lot of pet cats. I
guess that's one which got away."
</p>
<p>
"It got away all right," said another man. "And
I don't believe she'll ever get it back. The cat's
scared to death."
</p>
<p>
"Why doesn't it jump?" asked some one. "I
heard that cats always land on their feet, no matter
how far they fall."
</p>
<p>
"A fall from there would kill any cat," said Joe,
as he handed Helen a small package he had been
carrying&mdash;a purchase he had made at one of the
stores.
</p>
<p>
"What are you going to do?" she asked, sensing
that Joe Strong had some object in mind.
</p>
<p>
"I'm going to get that cat," he said in a low voice.
"I can't bear to see it harmed, and it can't cling
there much longer. Night's coming on, too, and if
it isn't rescued soon it won't be until morning. I
know what it is to have a pet suffer. I'm going
to get that cat!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, mister, you can't!" cried a small girl who
was standing near by and overheard this remark.
</p>
<p>
"I should say not!" exclaimed the man who had
given a little personal sketch of the woman in black.
"The longest ladder in the fire department won't
reach up to that wire, and they can't use extension
ones, or scaling ones as they could on a building.
You can't get that cat, sir, though I wish some one
could. I don't like to see dumb brutes suffer. But
you can't get it!"
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps I can!" said Joe modestly.
</p>
<p>
He started toward the street entrance of the old
building, from the upper window of which leaned
the pathetic figure of the woman calling to her cat
out on the swaying wire.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Joe," Helen began, "are you really going
to&mdash;" and then she stopped.
</p>
<p>
"I am!" he answered, for he knew she understood.
"Wait here for me. I won't be long."
</p>
<p>
Only a few in the crowd had heard what Joe
said, or understood his intentions as he made his
way through the press of people. The woman at
the window was unaware of the fact that some one
had heard her and was about to heed her appeal.
</p>
<p>
"A hundred dollars to whoever saves my cat!"
she cried again.
</p>
<p>
This time no one laughed.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong, acrobat, athlete, magician, and possessed
of many other muscular accomplishments
started up the stairs. The lower part of the office
building was deserted at this hour, but he made
his way to the place where he judged the woman
lived alone. He was confirmed in this belief by
hearing from behind a closed door the barking and
whining of dogs.
</p>
<p>
"She must keep a regular menagerie," mused
Joe. "Probably these are all the friends she has,
poor old lady!"
</p>
<p>
He knocked on a door that seemed to be the entrance
to the living apartments. There was a cessation
of the barking and whining, and a moment
later a querulous voice asked:
</p>
<p>
"Who is there? What do you want?"
</p>
<p>
"Is that your cat out on the wire?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Yes! Oh, yes! That's Peter! My favorite
cat! Oh, have you saved him? Have you got him
down? No, you can't have! He's out on that wire
yet!" she cried. And then she opened the door.
</p>
<p>
Joe was confronted by the same woman he had
observed leaning from the window. Her face was
pale, and she was quite elderly. But there was a
kind and pathetic look about her eyes. Once, she
must have been beautiful.
</p>
<p>
Joe had no time to speculate on what might have
been the romantic history of the woman. She looked
eagerly at him.
</p>
<p>
"What do you want?" she demanded. "I never
see any one. I live here alone. I must beg you
to excuse me. I have to see if some one will not,
save my cat."
</p>
<p>
"That is just what I came up for," said Joe, smiling.
"I am a lover of animals myself. I'd like to
save your pet."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, if you will, I'll pay you the hundred dollars!"
cried the woman. "I have it!" she went on
eagerly. "It's in here," and she motioned to the
rooms. They were tastefully, but not lavishly, furnished.
</p>
<p>
"We'll talk about that later," said Joe, with a
smile. "The point is let me get the cat first."
</p>
<p>
"But you can't get him from here&mdash;from these
rooms!" the woman in black exclaimed. "He's out
on the wire! You'll have to climb up in some way!
Oh, I don't know how you can do it!" There were
tears in her eyes and she clasped her hands imploringly.
</p>
<p>
"I can't get your cat from the street," said Joe.
"That's why I came up here. I must walk out on
the wire from your window. Have you a pair of
slippers? The older and softer the better&mdash;slippers
with thin, worn soles."
</p>
<p>
"Why, yes, I have. But you&mdash;you can't walk out
on the wire! It is too small, almost, for my cat!
You can't do it! It is impossible!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no," answered Joe gently, "it isn't impossible.
I have done it before. If you'll let me get
to a window near which the wire is stretched, and
if you will let me take a pair of old slippers."
</p>
<p>
"Come in!" interrupted the eccentric old woman,
opening wide the door. "I don't in the least know
what you intend to do, but something seems to tell
me I can trust you. And if only you can save
Peter&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"I'll try," said Joe simply.
</p>
<p>
The woman began to search frantically in a closet,
throwing out shoes, dresses, and other feminine
wearing apparel. As she delved among the things,
a shout arose from the street, the noise of the voices
floating in through the open window. Joe looked
out.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, has Peter fallen?" cried the woman.
</p>
<p>
That, too, had been Joe's thought.
</p>
<p>
"No," he answered, as he took an observation.
"Your cat has only changed his position a little.
I suppose the crowd thought it was going to fall,
but it's all right. I'll soon have it back to you. Is
it a vicious cat?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no indeed. He's as gentle as can be. But
perhaps he might be so scared now that he wouldn't
know what he was doing. I see what you mean.
Here, I'll give you an old pair of gloves for your
hands."
</p>
<p>
"That's what I want," said Joe. "I can't afford
to have my hands scratched, as I do some legerdemain
tricks. But I need some soft-soled slippers
more than I need gloves."
</p>
<p>
"Here is a pair," said the woman. "They're
mine. I wear large ones, for I like to be comfortable."
</p>
<p>
"They'll fit me," decided Joe, after an inspection.
"Just what I want, too!"
</p>
<p>
He began to take off his shoes.
</p>
<p>
"Do you really mean you are going to walk out
on that wire and get my cat?" asked the woman,
comprehending his intention as she saw Joe putting
on the slippers and drawing on the old gloves she
had given him. They were a man's size, and he
judged she must have used them in rough work
about the house.
</p>
<p>
"I'm going out on the wire to get your cat," he
said.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, but I ought not to let you! You may fall
and be killed! When I said I'd give a hundred dollars
to whoever would save Peter, I did not mean
that any one should risk his life. Much as I love
my cat, I couldn't allow that."
</p>
<p>
"I'll be all right," said Joe easily. "Walking
wires is part of my business. Now don't worry.
And please don't scream if you are going to watch
me."
</p>
<p>
She looked at him curiously.
</p>
<p>
"I am not in the habit of screaming," she said
quietly.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I thought it best to mention it," said Joe.
</p>
<p>
He was now ready for his most novel form of
walking the wire. He moved toward the window
from which the woman had leaned. It was the
same casement whence the cat had started on its
perilous journey. Joe felt sure of himself. The
slippers were just what he needed, with soft, pliable
soles, worn thin. They were the best substitute
he could have found for his circus shoes.
</p>
<p>
The wire from which the banner was suspended
was fast to an eye-bolt set in the brick wall of the
building a little below the sill of the window. It
had been easy for the cat to step out and get on
the cable.
</p>
<p>
Joe appeared at the window. He had taken off
his coat and, in his white shirt, blue tie, and black
trousers, he made a striking figure in the brilliant
sunset light.
</p>
<p>
Instantly the crowd in the street saw him and
divined his intention. Joe doubted not that Helen
was looking up at him.
</p>
<p>
It was an easy step for him from the window
sill to the wire from which was suspended the banner.
He knew it would support his weight in addition
to the big net affair. The size of the cable
and the manner in which it was fastened told him
that. Still he cautiously tried it with one foot before
trusting all his weight to it. The spring of
the wire told him all he needed to know.
</p>
<p>
Pausing a moment to make sure of himself, Joe
Strong started to walk across the wire toward the
clinging cat. The crowd gave one roar of welcome
and approval, and then became hushed. This
was what Joe wanted.
</p>
<p>
Now it was just as if he were doing the act in
the circus. Only there was this difference&mdash;there
was no safety net below him. But it was not the
first time Joe had taken this risk. True, beneath
him were the hard stones of the street, but a fall
from the height at which he now was would be
fatal, no matter what the character of ground under
him. He dismissed all such thoughts from his
mind.
</p>
<p>
Slowly, and with the caution he always used, Joe
started on his journey across the wire. The cat
felt his coming, and turned its head, as it crouched
down, and looked at him. But it did not move.
The creature was literally "scared stiff."
</p>
<p>
Foot by foot Joe progressed. Below him the
crowd watched breathlessly. Joe knew Helen was
there, praying for him, though he could not see her.
In the window stood the figure in black, a silent,
hopeful but much worried woman. She kept her
promise not to scream, but Joe realized that the crucial
moment was yet to come.
</p>
<p>
On and on he went nearer and nearer to the
crouching cat. If only the animal would have sense
enough to lie still and not make a fuss when he
picked it up, Joe felt that all would be well.
</p>
<p>
But would Peter behave? That was the question.
</p>
<p>
Joe was now almost over the middle of the street.
Far below him was the crowd&mdash;a sea of upturned
faces, reddened by the reflected rays of the setting
sun. The throng was silent. Joe was glad of that.
</p>
<p>
"Keep still now, Peter, I'm coming for you!"
said Joe in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
"That's right, Peter!" added the woman. "Be
a good cat now. You are going to be saved! Keep
still and don't scratch!"
</p>
<p>
Whether the cat heard and understood it is hard
to say. But it uttered a pitiful:
</p>
<p>
"Mew!"
</p>
<p>
Inch by inch, foot by foot Joe advanced. He was
quite sure of himself now. He felt that he could
easily have walked across the wire from building
to building, with the street chasm below him, and
even could have made the return trip. But picking
up the cat and carrying it back was another thing.
It would have been easier for Joe to have carried
a man across on his back. He could direct the
motions of the man. Could he those of the cat?
</p>
<p>
Still he was going to try.
</p>
<p>
On and on he went. The woman in black was
leaning from the window, holding out her arms as
though to catch Joe should he fall.
</p>
<p>
But he did not think of falling.
</p>
<p>
In another few seconds he was standing right
over the cat. He could see the animal's claws tensely
clinging to the rope strands that held the banner.
Now came ticklish work.
</p>
<p>
"Easy, Peter! Go easy now!" said Joe soothingly.
</p>
<p>
He slowly and carefully stooped down. It was
a trick he had often performed in the circus on the
high wire. But never under circumstances like this.
</p>
<p>
Joe's hands came in contact with the fur of the
cat's back. He gently stroked the animal, murmuring:
</p>
<p>
"Come on now, Peter! Let go! Loosen your
claws! I'm not going to hurt you. Let me pick
you up!"
</p>
<p>
Again it is hard to say that the cat knew what
Joe was saying, but it certainly made its body less
tense. The claws were loosed. Joe straightened up,
holding the cat in his arms. He could feel its heart
beating like some overworked motor.
</p>
<p>
A roar arose from the crowd, but it was instantly
hushed. The throng seemed to realize that the return
journey was infinitely more perilous than the
outward one had been.
</p>
<p>
Joe could not turn. He must walk backward
to the window, carrying the cat, which at any moment
might become wild and scramble from his
arms, upsetting his balance.
</p>
<p>
Yet Joe Strong never faltered.
</p>

<h3>
THE FIRE ACT
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Realizing that he must use every caution, Joe
Strong had two things to think of. One was himself,
and the other the cat. He could not carry
the creature in his arms, as he needed to extend
them to balance himself. He had walked short
distances along slack wires without doing this, but
in those cases he had been able to run, and his
speed made up for the lack of balancing power of
the extended arms. Now, however, he needed to
observe this precaution.
</p>
<p>
What could he do with the cat?
</p>
<p>
In that moment of peril a boyhood scene arose
to Joe's mind. He recalled that on the farm where
he had lived there was a pet cat which liked to crawl
up his back and curl on his shoulders, stretching
out completely across them and snuggling against
the back of his head.
</p>
<p>
"If I can get this cat to do that I'll be all right,"
thought Joe. "I'll try it."
</p>
<p>
Balancing himself, he changed the cat's position
and put it up on his shoulder. Even if it rested
on only one it would leave his hands free and he
could extend his arms and balance himself. But
Peter seemed to know just what was wanted of him.
With a little "mew," the animal took the very position
Joe wanted it to&mdash;extended along his back,
close to his head.
</p>
<p>
And not until then did Joe begin to step backward.
Breathlessly the crowd watched him. Step
by step he went, feeling for the wire on which he
placed his feet. And each step made him more
confident.
</p>
<p>
The crowd was silently watching. It was reserving
its wild applause.
</p>
<p>
Step by step Joe walked backward until he heard
the low voice of the woman at the open window.
</p>
<p>
"Shall I take Peter now?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Can you reach him?" asked Joe. He knew he
was close to the building.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," she answered.
</p>
<p>
"Then do," said Joe. "He may try to spring off
when he sees himself so close to you. Take him.
I'll stand still a moment."
</p>
<p>
He felt the cat stirring. The next instant he
was relieved of Peter's weight, and then, with a
quick turning motion, Joe himself was half way
within the window and sitting on the sill.
</p>
<p>
He had walked out on the wire, stretched a hundred
feet above the street, and rescued the cat. The
pet was now in the arms of the woman in black.
</p>
<p>
And then such a roar as went up in the crowd!
Men thumped one another on the back, and then
shook hands, wondering at their foolishness and
why there was such a queer lump in their throats.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! Oh!" gasped the woman, as she hugged
Peter to her. "I can never thank you enough&mdash;not
in all my life. It may be foolish to care so
much for a cat. But I can't help it. It isn't all
that. I couldn't have borne it to have seen him fall
and be killed."
</p>
<p>
"He's all right now&mdash;after he gets over being
scared," said Joe, as he stroked the cat in the arms
of the woman in black.
</p>
<p>
"And now will you let me know to whom I am
indebted?" she asked. "Please come in, and I'll
pay you the reward."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'll come in and put on my shoes," said
Joe, with a smile. "I didn't need the gloves," he
added. "Peter was very gentle."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, he's a good cat!" said his mistress. "And
now," she added, when Joe had resumed his shoes
and coat, "will you please tell me your name and
how you learned to walk wires and rescue cats?"
</p>
<p>
"I never rescued cats before," Joe returned, smiling.
"It's something new. But walking wires is
my trade&mdash;or one of 'em. I'm with the circus. I
do some tricks and&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, are you the man who gets out of the box?"
she cried. "I have read about that trick."
</p>
<p>
"It is one of mine," said Joe modestly.
</p>
<p>
"I'm so glad to know you!" exclaimed the woman.
She seemed less of a recluse than at first.
"I haven't been to a circus for years&mdash;not since I
was a child," she continued, half sadly, Joe thought.
"But I'm coming to-night!" she exclaimed. "I'll
have the janitor look after my cats and dogs, and
I'll go to the circus. I want to see you act. It will
bring back my lost youth&mdash;or part of it," she murmured.
</p>
<p>
"Allow me to make sure that you will be there,"
said Joe. "Here is a reserved ticket. I will look
for you."
</p>
<p>
"And now let me give you the reward I promised,"
begged the woman, as Joe was about to leave.
"I have the money here&mdash;in cash," she added quickly.
She went to a bureau, putting Peter down on
a cushion. The cat observed Joe intently. The
woman came back with a roll of bills.
</p>
<p>
"No, really, I couldn't take it!" protested Joe.
"I didn't save your cat for money. I was glad
enough to do it for the animal's sake."
</p>
<p>
"Please take it!" she urged. "I&mdash;I am well off,
even if I live here," she said hesitatingly. "I shall
feel better if you take it."
</p>
<p>
"And I shall feel better if you give it to the Red
Cross," said Joe. "That needs it, to help the
stricken, more than I do. I make pretty good
money myself," he added. "And I didn't do this
for a reward."
</p>
<p>
"But I promised it!"
</p>
<p>
"Well, then consider that I took it, and you, in
my name, may pass it on to the Red Cross," said
Joe. "And now, may I ask your name?"
</p>
<p>
The woman told him. It was Miss Susan Crawford.
The name meant nothing to Joe, though he
afterward learned she was a member of an old,
wealthy and aristocratic family. She had had an
unfortunate love affair, and, her family having all
died, she made for herself a little apartment in one
of her many buildings and lived there with her pets&mdash;a
recluse in the midst of a big city. It was a
pathetic story.
</p>
<p>
"I wish you would let me reward you in some
way," said Miss Crawford wistfully, as Joe left.
"You did so much, and you get nothing out of it."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes I do," returned the young acrobat. "I'll
get a lot of advertising out of this, and it will be
the best thing in the world for the circus."
</p>
<p>
And Joe was right. The next day the papers all
carried big stories of his wire-walking feat to save
the cat that had ventured out over the street and
was afraid to go back. Bigger crowds than ever
came to the circus.
</p>
<p>
As she had promised, Miss Crawford was at the
evening performance, and Joe introduced a little
novelty in one of his "magic stunts," producing a
cat instead of a rabbit from a man's pocket. As
he held it up he looked over and smiled at the old
lady in black, for he had given her a seat near his
stage. She smiled back.
</p>
<p>
Joe never saw her again. She was found dead
a few months later in her lonely rooms, with her
cats and dogs around her. But Joe always remembered
her.
</p>
<p>
The street wire-walking feat was the talk of the
city, and when, the following day, Joe announced
that he was ready to put on his fire act, which had
been well advertised, every one was on figurative
tiptoes to see what it would be.
</p>
<p>
Joe had made all his preparations, and he had
taken care to provide against danger and accidents.
He realized the risk he was running in handling
fire in a circus tent before crowds of people. But
extinguishers were provided, and one of the fire-fighting
force of the circus was constantly on hand.
</p>
<p>
After the preliminary whistle of the ringmaster
which ended the other acts and prepared for Joe's
new one, the young magician advanced to the platform
and gave a little "patter."
</p>
<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "in introducing
my new act I wish, first of all, to assure you that
there is no danger. Even though I seem to be in
the midst of fire, do not be alarmed. I shall be
safe, and no harm will come to you."
</p>
<p>
Joe did this to forestall a possible panic.
</p>
<p>
"You have all heard of the ancient salamanders,"
he went on. "It is reputed that this animal was
able to live in the midst of fire. As to the truth of
that I can not say. I never saw a salamander, that
I know of. But that fire may safely be handled by
human beings, and not at the risk of being burned,
I am about to demonstrate to you. I shall first
show you how to carry fire about in your hands,
so that if you run short of matches at any time you
will not lack means of igniting the gas, starting
your kitchen range, or enjoying your smoke. While
the stage is being made ready for my main act, I
will show you how to carry fire in your hands."

<h3>
A SENSATIONAL DIVE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Striking a match, Joe ignited two candles that
stood on a little table at one side of his stage. On
the other side his assistants were setting up the
apparatus he intended to use in his more elaborate
experiments.
</p>
<p>
"You observe that the trick has not yet begun,"
said Joe, with a laugh, as he blew out the match.
"In other words, I am lighting these candles in the
ordinary way&mdash;just as any one of you would do it,
if he needed to. In a moment I will show you how
to light the candles in case one is accidentally blown
out and you have no match."
</p>
<p>
Allowing both candles to burn up well, with clear,
bright flames, Joe suddenly blew out one.
</p>
<p>
"Now," he said, "I will show you how to carry
fire in your hands from the lighted to the unlighted
candle. Watch me closely!"
</p>
<p>
Joe cupped his hands around the lighted candle,
seeming to take the flame up in his fingers. When
he removed his hands, which he still held in cup, or
globular, shape, the second candle had been extinguished.
Both were now out.
</p>
<p>
"You will notice that I am carrying the flame in
my hands from one candle to the other," said Joe,
in a loud voice, as he walked across the stage.
</p>
<p>
For an instant he spread his hands, cup fashion,
around the candle he had first blown out. Suddenly
he withdrew his hands, holding them wide apart
and in full view of the audience, and, lo! the unlighted
candle was glowing brightly.
</p>
<p>
There was a moment of silence, and then the
applause broke forth. Joe bowed and said:
</p>
<p>
"That is how to carry fire in your hands. But
please don't any of you try it unless you get the
directions from me."
</p>
<p>
"Tell us how to do it!" piped up a small boy.
</p>
<p>
"Come and see me after the show!" laughed Joe.
</p>
<p>
And, while on this subject, it might be well to
explain how Joe did the trick. It is very simple, but
it takes practice, and an amateur may easily be fatally
burned in the attempt, simple as it is.
</p>
<p>
Joe lighted the candles in the usual way, with a
match, as already explained. There was no trick
about this, nor about blowing out one. But immediately
after that the trick started. Joe placed
a little piece of waxed paper between the first and
second fingers of his left hand as soon as he had
blown out the first candle. This paper was a slender
strip, and could not be seen by the audience.
</p>
<p>
When he cupped his hands around the remaining
lighted candle Joe ignited this waxed strip, taking
care to work it away from his palms and fingers.
It burned with a tiny flame and with scarcely any
heat in the middle of the hollow cup formed by
his hands.
</p>
<p>
As soon as he had ignited the paper Joe, by pressing
the lower edges of his palms against the blazing
wick of the candle, extinguished it. This had
the same effect as though he had "pinched" out the
flame with finger and thumb, as many country persons
put out, or "snuff," candles to-day&mdash;for candles
are still much used in some places.
</p>
<p>
Now we have Joe with a little blazing taper concealed
in his cupped hands, advancing to the candle
he first blew out. He placed his hands around this,
lighted the wick from the taper, which he at once
crushed between his fingers, and the trick was done.
</p>
<p>
The candle was lighted, the remains of the little
taper were concealed between Joe's fingers, and it
looked as though he had really carried fire in his
hands. The quickness with which he pinched out
the candle flame, and also smothered the taper after
he had used it, prevented him from being burned
in the slightest. But it is best for a boy unpracticed
and without the dexterity of a professional prestidigitator
not to undertake to play with fire.
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong believed in doing his tricks and acts
artistically and elaborately. He had watched other
performers "dress their act," and he had often improved
on what even stage veterans had done. His
apprenticeship had been a stern but good one.
</p>
<p>
And now he was going to introduce something
novel in his fire-eating tricks, but he was also going
to add to that. He had read considerable of
late about the fire-eating tricks of the old "magicians"
and had delved into many curious old books.
Now he was going to give his audience some of
this information.
</p>
<p>
"There is a trick in everything," said Joe, as he
faced his audience in readiness for the fire-eating
act. "If I told you that I actually swallowed blazing
fire, any physician would know that I was not
telling the truth. I do not really eat the fire. I
only seem to do so. But if in doing so I can deceive
you into thinking I do, and you are thrilled
and amused, you get your money's worth, I earn
mine, and we are all satisfied. So don't be alarmed
by what you see.
</p>
<p>
"The resistance of the human body to heat is
greater than many persons suppose," said Joe. "And
there is a vast difference between wet heat and dry
heat. Water, above one hundred and fifty degrees,
would be unbearable. It would really burn you
badly. Water, as you know, boils at two hundred
and twelve degrees Fahrenheit. But before this
point is reached it is capable of ending life.
</p>
<p>
"Dry heat, however, is different. Men have
frequently borne without permanent discomfort dry
heat up to three hundred degrees. This heat is
often reached in the drying rooms of oilcloth and
oiled silk factories.
</p>
<p>
"Now the fire I handle is dry heat. I would no
more think of pouring boiling water over my hands
than I would of taking poison. And yet I will
show you that I can thrust my hand into a blazing
fire and suffer no harm.
</p>
<p>
"In an old book I read that to enable one to
thrust one's hands into the fire all you had to do
was to anoint them with a mixture of <i>bol armenian</i>,
quicksilver, camphor and spirits of wine. I should
prefer to leave that mixture alone, though in the
book it is said that if one puts that mixture on his
hands he may handle boiling lead.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps some ancient magician did this, but
I think he depended more on water than on anything
else. If your hands are wet there is formed
on them a film of moisture which, for a moment,
will enable you to withstand high degrees of dry
heat.
</p>
<p>
"In another old book I read that if one prepared
himself with 'liquid stortax,' which is juice from a
certain tree growing in Italy, he could enter fire,
bathe in fire, put a burning coal on his tongue, and
even swallow fire.
</p>
<p>
"Now I am not going to let you into all my
secrets. You shall see&mdash;what you shall see!" concluded
Joe.
</p>
<p>
As intimated before, the method Joe Strong used
is not going to be printed here. You have been
given some genuine ancient formulae, safe in the
knowledge that some of the ingredients can not be
obtained. And the modern substitutes are not going
to be told. Enough to say that Joe had "prepared
himself."
</p>
<p>
The young magician looked to see that all was
in readiness. Perceiving that it was, he retired for
a moment to a cabinet set up on the stage, and when
he came out he was ready for his tricks.
</p>
<p>
Joe advanced to what seemed to be an elaborate
candelabra in which seven tapers were set. He
stood in front of this a moment, and then he announced:
</p>
<p>
"Having lived on a fire diet so long I have a bit
to spare. I will light these candles without using
a match."
</p>
<p>
He waved his hand over the candelabra. Sparks
were seen to shoot from his finger tips, and in an
instant the seven lights were glowing. That was
an electrical trick. In reality the candles were gas
jets, made to look like wax tapers, and Joe lighted
them from an electric current produced by a dry
battery he carried on his person.
</p>
<p>
He then proceeded to his main trick. He picked
up a plate. It seemed to contain pieces of bread.
Joe touched the edge of the plate to a flame of one
of the candles. In an instant the plate was ablaze,
and Joe calmly began putting the blazing stuff on
it into his mouth.
</p>
<p>
Cube after cube of the blazing "bread" he lifted
up on a fork and thrust between his lips. And
he seemed to enjoy the "eating" of it.
</p>
<p>
The audience was spellbound. Every one's eyes
were on Joe Strong doing his fire-eating trick.
</p>
<p>
The plate was empty. Joe looked about as though
for something else hot to eat. He caught up an
article from a table. Holding it to the flame of a
candle, it was at once ablaze.
</p>
<p>
And then, with a thrilling cry, Joe Strong leaped
from the stage, his two hands, held high above his
head, seeming to be enveloped in a mass of fire.
And with this fire held over him, he ran toward
the tank in which Benny Turton did his "human
fish" act.
</p>
<p>
The next instant Joe Strong, apparently ablaze
all over, dived into the tank.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="CH14"><!-- CH14 --></a>
<h2>
	CHAPTER XIV
</h2>

<h3>
HEAD FIRST
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Which was the more surprised&mdash;Benny Turton,
who had just finished his fish act in his tank, the
spellbound audience, or Jim Tracy, who was, in a
way, directing Joe's performance&mdash;it would be hard
to say. All three were thrilled by the unexpected
outcome of the fire-eating act. Joe Strong alone
seemed perfectly at his ease, and, it might be mentioned
incidentally, perfectly at home in the water.
He had, as told in a previous volume, entitled "Joe
Strong, the Boy Fish," perfected himself in this
sort of work, and could remain submerged for an
unusually long time.
</p>
<p>
Of course the fire which seemed to envelop the
young magician was instantly put out when he
leaped into the tank. He was wearing a rather
fancy suit, and as he came up, wet and bedraggled,
Jim Tracy could not help wondering what Joe meant
by his performance.
</p>
<p>
"Joe! Joe! was that part of the act or an accident?"
asked Jim in a low voice, as he ran over to
where Joe was now climbing out of the tank.
For one instant Joe hesitated. The audience was
wildly applauding now. Clearly there was but one
thought in their minds. The whole thing was a
trick&mdash;Joe had only pretended to be on fire and had
taken that sensational means of appearing to extinguish
the blaze.
</p>
<p>
But the ringmaster noted a queer look on his
friend's face. It was not the look it usually wore
when Joe had completed some hazardous or sensational
trick.
</p>
<p>
"Are you hurt, Joe&mdash;burned?" asked Jim Tracy
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
"No," was the answer. "It was all part of the
act!"
</p>
<p>
The ringmaster looked satisfied, and it was not
until some time afterward that he learned what a
narrow escape Joe had had.
</p>
<p>
"This will be part of the fire-eating stunt at every
show," said Joe to the ringmaster. "You might
make the announcement so the people won't be
scared."
</p>
<p>
"I will! Say, it's some stunt all right!" And
then Jim began with his sonorous "Ladies and gentlemen!"
He stated that the young fire-eater would
show his familiarity with, and mastery over, fire
by setting himself ablaze and leaping into the tank
to extinguish the flames. The ringmaster added
that there would be no danger to either the audience
or the performer in this feature.
</p>
<p>
Joe bowed to the applause that followed, and then
hurried to his dressing room to don dry clothes for
his mystery box trick.
</p>
<p>
"I should think, if you were going to do tank
work, you'd wear a suit better adapted to it&mdash;like
mine," said Benny Turton, whose apartment was
next to Joe's in the dressing tent.
</p>
<p>
"I'm going to," Joe announced, looking around
to make sure no one overheard. "The fact of the
matter is, Benny, I didn't count on pulling off this
stunt. It was an accident. Some of the alcohol I
use on the tow was spilled on my sleeves and caught
fire. Then more flames burst out. Luckily they
were at my back, so when I ran the flames were
fanned away from me. But I knew the tank was
the safest place to go, and in I jumped."
</p>
<p>
"But I heard you tell Jim it was all arranged."
</p>
<p>
"I did that so the crowd wouldn't get into a panic.
However I am going to work the trick at each performance
after this, only I'm going to wear a different
suit."
</p>
<p>
And Joe did. He had a garment partly made of
asbestos, though outwardly it did not resemble that
fire-resisting material any more than do the asbestos
curtains in theaters. And at the conclusion of
his fire-eating act Joe would seemingly burst into
fire and run blazing across the stage to leap into
the tank of water.
</p>
<p>
This finish to the act never failed to win great
applause. And once in the tank Joe did some of
the under-water tricks that had brought him fame.
He was careful, however, not to duplicate anything
that Benny Turton did, for he did not want to
"crab" the act of his friend.
</p>
<p>
But Joe's fire and water act was one of the big
features on the circus bill.
</p>
<p>
"Is this the sensation you were speaking of?"
asked Helen one day, when they had concluded an
afternoon's performance.
</p>
<p>
"No," answered Joe. "This only came about by
accident. I'm working on something more sensational
yet, and I am going to ask you to help me."
</p>
<p>
"I'm sure I'll do anything I can," said she.
</p>
<p>
"You won't be in any danger," the young magician
went on. "I'm beginning to understand fire
better the more I study it. I'm not getting too familiar,
either, let me tell you. Even a little scorch
is very painful."
</p>
<p>
"I glanced through one of your books the other
day," remarked Helen. "Do you really suppose
some of those old magicians actually handled fire
in the way it is stated?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, at least they pretended to," said her friend.
"There are tricks in all trades, you know."
</p>
<p>
As the circus went on its way business kept up
well, and it was seen that the season was going
to be an excellent one from a financial standpoint.
</p>
<p>
"Any more bogus tickets coming in?" asked Joe
one day of the treasurer.
</p>
<p>
"Not since we adopted the new style," was the
answer.
</p>
<p>
"Have the detectives gotten on the trail of the
man, or the men, who cheated us?" asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
"Not yet," reported Mr. Moyne. "The last report
I had from them was that they were getting
nearer and nearer to a certain person whom they
suspected. They promise an arrest soon."
</p>
<p>
"That's the usual story," remarked Joe. "However,
we don't so much care about an arrest now
if we have stopped the counterfeit tickets from being
worked off on us."
</p>
<p>
"Well, there's always a chance that the same
thing will happen again," returned Mr. Moyne.
"It's too easy money for the criminals to give up,
I'm afraid. I'm on the lookout every day for
more counterfeits."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'll leave it to you," remarked Joe. "Whenever
anything happens let me know and we'll take
some action."
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong was now kept very busy in the circus.
In fact he was what would be called a "star." He
did his mystery box trick, and, with Helen, worked
the "vanishing lady" trick so neatly that no one
guessed how it was done. The ten thousand dollars
was not claimed, successfully, though several
tried it, with the result that several local Red Cross
organizations were enriched by the hundred dollar
forfeit.
</p>
<p>
In addition to these mystery acts, and some more
ordinary sleight-of-hand tricks which he used to
fill in with, Joe did his fire-eating trick, ending that
act with the plunge into the tank. This never failed
to create a sensation.
</p>
<p>
"But it isn't the big sensation I'm after!" said
Joe, when his friends congratulated him. "Wait
until you see that!"
</p>
<p>
Another feature of Joe's performance was his
wire-walking. Since he had rescued the lady's cat
he had added this to his share of the program, and
it was a thriller enjoyed by many audiences.
</p>
<p>
"But it's a little tame," said Joe one day to Jim
Tracy. "I want to put a little more pep into it."
</p>
<p>
"How are you going to do it?" asked the ringmaster.
</p>
<p>
"I think I know a way," was the answer.
</p>
<p>
And a few days later Joe gave a demonstration.
</p>
<p>
The wire on which he performed was a high one,
stretched between two well-braced poles. On each
pole was fastened a small platform, somewhat like
those high up in the tent where the big swing was
fastened.
</p>
<p>
Joe walked across the wire from one platform to
the other, doing various "stunts" on the slender
support. One day Jim Tracy noticed that a long
to the ground between one of the rings and a wooden
platform.
</p>
<p>
"What's that, Joe?" asked the ringmaster,
"Looks like an extra guy wire for the pole."
</p>
<p>
"No, that's for my new stunt," said Joe. "I'll
show you at this show."
</p>
<p>
The audience watched him performing on the
high wire. Jim Tracy was watching, too, for he
remembered what Joe had said. Suddenly, at the
conclusion of the usual wire-walking feats, Joe
stooped, placed his head on the slanting wire, raised
himself until he was standing with his legs up and
spread apart. Then he quickly flung wide his
hands and slid on his head down the slanting win
to the ground, stopping himself just before he
reached it by grasping the wire in his gloved hands.
</p>
<p>
Jim Tracy, who was sitting on a box, leaped to
his feat.
</p>
<p>
"Head first!" he cried. "That's some stunt!"
</p>
<p>
And the audience seemed to think so, too, from
the way it applauded.
</p>

<h3>
THE SWINDLERS AGAIN
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Joe Strong, having checked his rapid, head-first
and head-on slide down the slanting wire by grasping
it in his gloved hands, gave a "flip-flop" and
stood up, bowing to the loud applause. Jim Tracy
and some of the other circus employees surrounded
the young man.
</p>
<p>
"Why didn't you tell us you were going to pull
off something like this?" demanded the ringmaster.
</p>
<p>
"Because I wasn't sure until the last minute that
I would do it," answered Joe. "I hadn't practiced
it as much as I should have liked, but when I got
up there on the platform I felt pretty sure I could
do it. I wasn't running much risk anyhow, except
that of failure. I knew I wouldn't fall, for I could
have grabbed the wire in my hands if I had started
to topple over."
</p>
<p>
"But how did you do it?" asked some one, who
came up to join the wondering throng after Joe's
feat had been performed. "I've seen you stand on
your head before, but to slide down a wire&mdash;say,
what sort of scalp have you, anyhow?"
</p>
<p>
Joe laughed and held out a close-fitting skull-cap
of leather. Fastened to the leather was a small
steel framework, and in this frame were two small
grooved wheels, like the wheels of a trolley by
means of which street cars receive the electric current
from the wire. Joe put the cap on his head
to show how it enabled him to do the trick. The
big races were on now, as the close of the performance
was close at hand, and the crowd was paying
attention to the contests and not to the group of
performers surrounding the young magician.
</p>
<p>
Once they had seen the cap with the grooved
wheels on top placed on Joe's head, his friends understood
how the trick was done. He had simply
to balance himself on his head on the wire, a feat
he had often performed before. The natural attraction
of gravitation did the rest. He simply slid
down on the wheels, his extended arms and legs
steadying him.
</p>
<p>
"It's just as if you had a roller skate on your
head," said Se&ntilde;orita Tanlozo, the snake charmer,
who had strolled into the main tent after her act
in the side show was over.
</p>
<p>
"Exactly," said Joe, with a smile. "Would you
like to try it?"
</p>
<p>
"Not while my snakes are alive!" she assured
him.
</p>
<p>
"Well, it's another drawing card for the Sampson
Brothers' Show," said Jim Tracy that night when
the receipts were being counted and preparations
being made for moving on to the next city. "How
long are you going to keep it up, Joe?"
</p>
<p>
"As to that, I can't say," was the answer. "But
I like the game, and I want to see the circus a success."
</p>
<p>
"It's a big one now, thanks in a large part to
you," observed the ringmaster. "But you'd better
take a rest now, Joe, my boy. Don't try to pull off
any more spectacular stunts."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I haven't pulled off my big one yet," replied
the young magician. "I mean the one with the fire.
I'm working on that. If it comes out the way I
think it will we'll have to give three performances a
day instead of two."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, we can't do that!" protested Mr. Moyne,
the treasurer. "It's hard enough keeping account
of the money and tickets now, with two shows a
day. If we have three&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
He paused, for it was very evident Joe was only
joking, and there were smiles on the faces of the
other circus folk.
</p>
<p>
"Don't worry!" said Joe to the treasurer. "I
don't want to act three times a day any more than
you want to count the tickets and cash. And, I
suppose, if we could, by some means, give three
performances, it would only give our swindling
ticket friends more chance to work their scheme.
By the way, there are no further signs of their
putting bogus tickets on sale, are there?"
</p>
<p>
"Not since we started the detectives at work,"
the treasurer answered. "But I'm always on the
watch, and so are the men at the entrances."
</p>
<p>
"It's about time those detectives got results, I
think," declared Jim Tracy. "I wonder what they
think we're paying them for?"
</p>
<p>
"It takes time for a thing like that to be cleaned
up," said Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I know what I'd do if I were detecting,"
half-growled the ringmaster.
</p>
<p>
"What?" inquired the treasurer.
</p>
<p>
"I'd round up and arrest a certain few worthless
men I know who used to be in the circus business&mdash;some
with this show!" declared Jim. "It's queer,
but our outfit seems to be the only one that they
pick on. That's what makes me think it was some
one who used to work for us."
</p>
<p>
"Who?" the treasurer wanted to know.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'm not mentioning any names," declared
the ringmaster, as he prepared to divest himself of
his dress suit in readiness for the trip to the circus
train. "But I have my suspicions."
</p>
<p>
"What makes you say ours is the only circus to
have lost money on bogus tickets?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Read it in <i>Paste and Paper</i>," was the answer.
That was the name of the trade journal devoted to
the interests of circus folk, tent shows, and the
like. "The last number had a piece in it about our
losing money on fake tickets," went on the ringmaster,
"and it said it was the first case of its kind
to appear in several years. There have been no
complaints of circuses in other parts of the country
being cheated that way, this article said. So I know
it's some one picking specially on us."
</p>
<p>
"Well, perhaps you're right," assented Joe. "But
as long as we have changed our style of tickets and
they haven't tried their tricks again, maybe we've
settled them."
</p>
<p>
"All the same I'm going to be on the watch," declared
the treasurer.
</p>
<p>
The city where the circus showed the following
day and night was a large one. A new automobile
industry employing many hands had located there
within the last six months. It was decided to make
a stay of two days in this place, since the advance
agent reported that many of the men worked overtime
and nights, and otherwise they could not see
the performance.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'm glad we're to be here two days," remarked
Helen, as she passed Joe's private quarters,
where he was going over some of his apparatus,
costumes, and effects.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, we'll have a good night's rest," he agreed,
though, truth to tell, the circus folk were so used
to traveling that the train journey almost every
night did not bother them. Still they always welcomed
a stay in a city over night.
</p>
<p>
"You seem busy," remarked Helen, as she sat
down on a box and watched Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I'm going to introduce a little novelty in
the slide down the slanting wire," he answered.
"I'm going to work in a fire stunt."
</p>
<p>
"A fire stunt!" exclaimed Helen. "Surely you
aren't going to&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, it won't be dangerous!" Joe assured her,
guessing her thoughts. Helen had learned that the
jump into Benny's tank the first time was due
to an accident. "It's just a bit spectacular and will
liven things up a bit, I think. If it goes well I
have an idea you can work one of the features in
your bareback act."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Joe, I never could walk a wire, nor slide
down on my head, the way you do. And I don't
see how Rosebud could, either." And Helen gave a
merry little laugh at the vision she raised.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I'm not going to have your horse walk the
tight rope nor the high wire!" laughed Joe. "It
would be a corking good stunt if we could, though.
No, this is simpler. I'll tell you about it later."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Watson, wife of the veteran clown, called
for Helen just then, asking her to go to see one of
the women performers who was ill.
</p>
<p>
"I'll see you later, Joe," Helen called out, as she
left him.
</p>
<p>
Joe was busy mixing up some chemicals in a pail
on the ground outside his tent when he was accosted
by a rather hoarse voice asking:
</p>
<p>
"Any chance for a job here, boss?"
Joe looked up to see a somewhat disreputable
figure of a man observing him. The fellow looked
like the typical tramp, perhaps not quite so ragged
and dirty, but still in that class. However, there
was something about the man that attracted Joe's
attention. As he said afterward, his visitor had
about him the air of the "profesh."
</p>
<p>
Joe's first impulse was to say that he knew of
no job, or else to refer his accoster to the head
canvas man, who hired transient help in putting
up the main top and in pulling or driving stakes.
But as Joe observed the man curiously watching
him, he had another idea. Before he could act on
it, however, the man exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
"You do a fire-eating stunt, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," Joe answered. And then it occurred to
him to wonder how the man knew. True he might
have observed Joe in some of the many performances,
but the man did not look like one who would
spend money on circus tickets. He might have
crawled under the tent, but it did not seem exactly
probable. And, of course, some of the circus employees
plight have pointed Joe out to the man as
the actor who handled fire. But, again, Joe did not
believe this. So he asked:
</p>
<p>
"How did you know?"
</p>
<p>
For answer the man pointed to the pail of chemicals
into which Joe was about to dip a suit of
tights.
</p>
<p>
"Smelled the dope," was the brief answer.
"You're using tungstate of soda, aren't you?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," answered Joe, surprised that a man, evidently
of such a class, should recognize the not
very common chemical.
</p>
<p>
"We used to use alum in the old days," the man
went on. "I guess the new dope's better, though I
never tried it."
</p>
<p>
"Are you in the business?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;I used to be," and the man
straightened himself up with an air of forgotten
pride. "I was with a circus once&mdash;used to do a
fire-eating act and jump into a fake bonfire. I doped
my clothes with alum water though. That's great
stuff for preventing the fire taking hold if you don't
stay in the blaze too long. But, as I say, they've
discovered something new."
</p>
<p>
"You used to be a fire-eater?" asked Joe curiously.
</p>
<p>
"Yes. And I was counted a pretty good one.
But I lost my nerve."
</p>
<p>
"How?"
</p>
<p>
"Well&mdash;er&mdash;not to put too fine a point on it, I
got too fond of the fire-water. Couldn't stay on the
water-wagon long enough, got careless in my act,
went down and out. Oh, it's the old story. You've
probably heard it lots of times. But I would like
a job now. I'm actually hungry, and I've seen the
time I could blow the bunch to champagne and
lobster."
</p>
<p>
Joe, on impulse, and yet, too, because he had an
object, was just going to offer the man help when
he saw Mr. Moyne coming across the lot toward
him from the ticket wagon. The afternoon performance
was about to start.
</p>
<p>
"They're here again!" cried the treasurer.
</p>
<p>
"Who?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"The ticket swindlers!"
</p>

<h3>
RINGS OF FIRE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Instantly Joe Strong lost interest in the "tramp
fire-eater," as he afterward came to call the man.
All the attention of the young magician was centered
on what the treasurer had said.
</p>
<p>
"Are you certain of this?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Positive!" was the answer. "We've been keeping
careful watch, paying special attention to the
red serial numbers, and some duplicates have been
taken in at the main entrance. The swindlers are
at work again."
</p>
<p>
"But our new tickets!" exclaimed Joe. "The new
style of paper and the precautions we have taken!
What of that?"
</p>
<p>
In answer Mr. Moyne held out two tickets, both
bearing the same serial number in red ink.
</p>
<p>
"Which is the bogus and which is the genuine?"
he asked.
</p>
<p>
Joe looked carefully at the two. He examined
them for a full minute.
</p>
<p>
"I can't tell!" he admitted.
</p>
<p>
"And no one else can, either," declared the treasurer.
"We're up against it again! Those fellows
are too clever for us. Now we'll lose a lot of
money!"
</p>
<p>
"Well, it won't break us," said Joe easily.
"Though, of course, no one likes to be cheated.
The only thing to do is to get the detectives busy.
Let them know the new turn affairs have taken,
and I'll send these two tickets to our chemist friend.
He can tell which is printed from our regular stock,
and which is the counterfeit.
</p>
<p>
"Then, too, it ought to be easier to catch the
rascals now than it was at first. You see, we didn't
know how long the old tickets had been counterfeited.
Now we're warned, first shot out of the
box, about the new ones. And since the paper mill
hasn't been supplying our printer with the new kind
of paper very long, it ought to be easy to trace
where the new and clever counterfeit supply is coming
from."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I hope they can catch the scoundrels,"
said Mr. Moyne. "I certainly hate to see money
lost."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Moyne was an ideal treasurer. He always
had the interests of the circus at heart, and one
would think that the money came out of his own
pocket to hear him talk about the counterfeit tickets.
In a way he did lose, personally, since he was
one of the owners of the show, and the less money
that came in the less his stock dividends would
amount to.
</p>
<p>
"I'll write to Mr. Waldon to-night," said Joe,
as he took the two tickets. "And we'll notify the
detectives. Now I must get ready for my act. That
can't be dropped."
</p>
<p>
"Having trouble, eh?" asked the tramp, who had
moved a little to one side.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, well, just a little," admitted Joe, who was
not altogether pleased that this talk should have been
overheard by a stranger.
</p>
<p>
"Did you say there was any chance for a job?"
asked the ragged man.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I don't know," said Joe, rather doubtfully.
"Is that straight goods, about your being a fire-eater?"
</p>
<p>
"I was once. But I'm not looking for that kind
of a job now," was the quick answer. "I lost my
nerve, I tell you. Handling stakes or driving a
wagon would be my limit."
</p>
<p>
"What sort of an act in the fire line did you
have?" asked Joe, for a certain idea was beginning
to form in his mind.
</p>
<p>
"It was a good act!" was the response, and again
the spark of pride seemed about to be fanned into
a flame. "Got any old-timers in this here circus of
yours?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," answered Joe. "There's Jim Tracy and
Bill Watson and&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Bill Watson who used to clown it?" cried the
man eagerly.
</p>
<p>
"He clowns it yet."
</p>
<p>
"Old Bill!" murmured the tramp. "Him still
making good in the business, and me a bum! Well,
it's all my own fault. If I'd stuck to the fire-eating
and not drinking fire-water I'd be somewhere to-day.
Just ask Bill Watson what sort of an act
Ham Logan had&mdash;'Coal-fire Logan!'" exclaimed
the man. "That was my title. Hamilton Logan is
my name, but I haven't told any one in&mdash;not in a
long time," he added, and he looked away. "But
ask Bill Watson about me."
</p>
<p>
"Here he comes now," said Joe, as he observed
the veteran clown approaching. "Suppose you ask
him yourself."
</p>
<p>
For an instant Ham Logan hesitated. Then he
stepped forward and confronted the old clown. The
latter paid no attention at first, evidently thinking
the man one of the many hangers-on about a circus
ground.
</p>
<p>
"Joe," began Bill Watson, "Helen sent me to ask
you if you have any ammonia in your kit&mdash;I mean
the kind they give the ladies when their hearts are
weak, or something like that. One of the girls has
some kind of a little spell, and we can't find the doctor."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I have some ammonia," said Joe. "I'll get
it."
</p>
<p>
Ham Logan looked Bill Watson in the face, and
asked:
</p>
<p>
"Don't you remember me?"
</p>
<p>
"Can't say that I do," was the somewhat cool
response of the veteran clown. "Is there any reason
why I should?"
</p>
<p>
"Do you remember Coal-fire Logan?"
</p>
<p>
Bill Watson started, looked more closely at the
man, and then slowly asked:
</p>
<p>
"Are you Ham Logan?"
</p>
<p>
"What's left of me&mdash;yes."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'll be gum swizzled!" exclaimed Bill.
"Say, did the elephant step on you or one of the
tent wagons roll over you?"
</p>
<p>
"Neither one. I'm down and out, that's all&mdash;and
it's enough, too."
</p>
<p>
"Well, that's enough, I should say," commented
the clown, as he took the bottle of stimulant Joe
handed him. "Last I heard of you you'd gone on a
theater circuit. That was just after you'd quit the
Dobling show."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I did do a theater circuit," admitted Ham
Logan. "But it didn't last. Or rather, I didn't last.
I was just asking the young man here for a job.
I said you'd remember me."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I certainly do," returned the old clown,
who was not to do his act until later in the day.
</p>
<p>
"And I'm sorry to see you in this state, Ham. You
did me a good turn once, and I haven't forgotten.
Stick around a while, and I'll see you as soon as I
play first-aid. Joe, if it isn't asking too much, will
you look after Ham for a while? He used to be a
good sort, and&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Better say too much of a 'good <i>sport</i>'" paraphrased
the man.
</p>
<p>
"I'll take care of him," promised Joe. "Did you
say you were hungry?" asked the young magician,
as the old clown turned and hurried away with the
ammonia.
</p>
<p>
"You said it! But I'm not altogether a grafter.
I can work for what I eat." And again there was
a flash of pride.
</p>
<p>
"We'll talk of that later," said Joe. "Just now
I want to get you something to eat. Here, take that
over to the dining tent," and he scribbled a few
words on one of his cards. "After you've eaten all
you want, and after the show this afternoon, look
me up."
</p>
<p>
"Do you think you can give me work?" asked
the man eagerly. "I don't mean to act," he hastened
to say. "I'm past that&mdash;down and out. But
I'm strong. I can pull on the ropes or drive
stakes."
</p>
<p>
"We'll talk of that later," replied Joe gently. "Go
and eat now."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I sure can feed my face!" exclaimed the
man. "I&mdash;I don't know how to thank you. Bill
will tell you that I wasn't a bad fellow in my day.
I just lost my nerve&mdash;that's all. False friends and
fire-water&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"See me later," said Joe, with a friendly wave
of his hand. And the man hurried toward the dining
tent, next to the cook wagons. Already he
seemed imbued with more hope and pride, something
that filled Joe with pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Joe busied himself with mixing the chemicals in
the pail. As Ham Logan had guessed, the young
fire-eater was mixing up a solution of tungstate of
soda. This chemical is a salt, made by roasting
wolfram with soda ash, and wolfram is a native
tungstate of iron and manganese. This soda preparation
is used commercially in making garments
fire-proof, and Joe had learned this from Mr. Herbert
Waldon, the chemist. He had decided to use
this instead of an alum solution, which is credited
with great fire-resisting qualities. It has them, too,
to a certain extent, but by experimenting Joe had
found the tungstate of soda best.
</p>
<p>
It was the evening of the circus in the city in
which the show was to remain two days. Ham Logan
had returned to Joe after having eaten a good
meal, and later Bill Watson formed the third member
of a trio that talked for some time in a corner of
Joe's tent.
</p>
<p>
As already said, it was the evening performance,
and as Helen finished her act on Rosebud she looked
over toward the place where Joe was preparing to
do his slide down the slanting wire.
</p>
<p>
"I wonder what he had in mind as a new act
for me," mused Helen. "I do hope it isn't anything
to do with fire. That sort of stunt creates a
sensation, but it's dangerous, in spite of what Joe
does to himself. I don't like it! Not after what
happened to Joe that day!"
</p>
<p>
She had seen that Rosebud was given in charge
of the groom who always looked after the clever
steed, and now Helen moved over where she could
watch Joe's comparatively new wire act.
</p>
<p>
As she approached this part of the circus tent
Helen was startled to see several men carrying large
hoops on long poles, take their positions on either
side of the slanting wire down which the daring performer
was soon to slide on his head, by means of
the wheeled cap.
</p>
<p>
"That's something new!" exclaimed Helen, as she
saw the men with the big hoops. "I wonder if Joe
is going to jump through them, as I jump through
the paper hoops from Rosebud's back?"
</p>
<p>
Joe was up on the little platform now, having
finished his wire act. He was adjusting to his head
the leather cap.
</p>
<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen!" began Jim Tracy in his
sonorous voice, as he pointed to Joe on his high
perch, thus calling attention to the performer.
</p>
<p>
All eyes were turned in his direction. Then, as
Joe stooped over and stood on his head, preparatory
to sliding down the wire, the hoops, which the men
held over the cable by means of long poles, suddenly
burst into flame. Held over the wire, down
which Joe would in a moment slide, was a row of
fiery circles!
</p>
<p>
Helen held her hand over her lips to stifle a
scream.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	CHAPTER XVII
</h2>

<h3>
THE BROKEN BOTTLE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
So still was it in the big circus tent after the band
stopped playing, while Joe prepared to do his head
slide, that the whirr of the steel wheels in his leather
cap could plainly be heard as he slid down the wire.
</p>
<p>
And as Helen and the others watched, the intention
of the daring young performer became evident.
</p>
<p>
He was going to coast through the blazing hoops
of fire which the men held in such a position that
Joe could slide through them without touching them.
Though they were called "hoops," in reality they
were not completely closed, there being a slight
opening to enable them to be slipped over the slanting
wire. If a gigantic letter "C" with a long pole
fastened to the lower curved part, can be imagined,
it; will give an exact idea of what is meant.
</p>
<p>
As to the fire itself, it was caused by blazing
bits of tow fastened to the circumference of the
big wire hoops. And thus through the blazing
circles Joe Strong slid down the slanting wire on
his head. At the lower end of the wire, where it
was fast to a stake in the ground, he caught hold
of the cable in his gloved hands and so slowed his
speed. Then he leaped to his feet and bowed in
acknowledgment of the applause.
</p>
<p>
"Oh!" murmured Helen, as she watched. "It
was only another of his sensational acts. When I
first saw the blazing hoops I half thought that some
one was trying to injure Joe, as they did when the
acid was used on his high trapeze. Oh, it was only
a trick!"
</p>
<p>
And so it was. Joe had planned it that day after
meeting Ham Logan. The latter, talking about the
time when he, too, had been a fire-eater, had mentioned
an act where a performer leaped through
blazing hoops, and Joe determined to use the idea,
varying it to suit his purpose. That it was effective
was evidenced by the long-continued applause.
</p>
<p>
"But, Joe," asked Helen, when the performance
was over and she and Joe had received another
ovation at the conclusion of the box mystery and
the vanishing lady trick, "wasn't there danger of
setting your clothes on fire when you went through
the blazing hoops?"
</p>
<p>
"None at all," Joe assured her. "I have been
planning a stunt like this for some time, and my
garments were fire-proofed. Of course I wouldn't
have done it otherwise. Look here!"
</p>
<p>
He took up a fancy jacket he had worn in his
wire slide. Taking a match Joe lighted it and held
it against the cloth. It did not take fire.
</p>
<p>
"There was that day&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"But I have perfected the act since then, Helen.
Of course the tungstate of soda that I soaked the
clothes in wouldn't keep them from catching fire
if I put the suit in a furnace. But the solution
will make cloth resist a blaze temporarily, as will
alum under some circumstances. I use alum on
the suit I wear when I pretend to set myself on
fire and then jump into the tank of water," went
on Joe. "But after this I'm going to use the soda.
It's more certain."
</p>
<p>
Joe worked the trick of seeming to set himself
ablaze in this way. As he said, his suit was made
as nearly fireproof as possible. Then on the back
of his jacket were placed some bunches of tow
saturated with alcohol. When this tow was set on
fire it burned quickly, but Joe knew the flame would
not last long. And the fact that the garments on
which the burning material was fastened were as
nearly fireproof as was possible to make them gave
him additional safety. He really ran little risk, as
the fire was at his back, and, as he ran toward the
tank, his speed carried the flames away from him.
</p>
<p>
Joe, and all others who do a fire-eating act, calculate
to a nicety just how long a certain fire will
burn. And they do not place the blazing material
into the mouth until the flames are almost on the
point of going out of themselves. This, added to
the fact that a chemical solution protects the tongue
and lips, makes the act comparatively safe. But
one word of caution. <i>Do not try to fire-proof the
mouth with tungstate of soda</i>. This warning cannot
be made too strong!
</p>
<p>
In fact, it is well not to try any fire-eating <i>at all</i>.
It is too risky unless one is a professional.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Joe," remarked Jim Tracy, later that night
when most of the circus folk were asleep, "if you
want to add this fellow to our show, go ahead.
You have the say, you know."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I don't want to do it in just that way,"
replied the young fire-eater. "Bill Watson says that
Ham Logan was once a good man. He is down
and out now, but he knows a lot about circus life
and this handling of fire. I believe I can work him
up into something useful&mdash;use him in a new act
I'm thinking of putting on. If we can only keep
him away from intoxicants he'll be all right, and
I'd like to give him a chance."
</p>
<p>
"Well, Joe, as I said, it's up to you. Go to it!
But remember, while he means all right, he may
not have the spunk to keep his promise not to drink."
</p>
<p>
"I think he'll keep it," said Joe. "Anyhow, I'd
like to give him a trial. He helped me with that
fire hoop stunt, and it would be an act of charity
to give him work."
</p>
<p>
"All right&mdash;you can be the charity," said the ringmaster.
"What do you say, Bill Watson?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, give him a chance," replied the old clown
good-naturedly. "We all have our troubles. He
can't do much harm, anyhow."
</p>
<p>
"I don't know about that," said Jim, with a shake
of his head. "This playing with fire by a man
who can't keep away from fire-water, is risky."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'll take the chance," said Joe. And that
was characteristic of him&mdash;taking chances.
</p>
<p>
Ham Logan was deeply grateful to Joe for what
the young performer did. That is, he hired the
former fire-eater as a sort of handy man in the
circus, Ham to be subject to Joe's direction day and
night.
</p>
<p>
"And let the fire-water alone!" demanded Joe.
"I will! I really will!" said the old circus performer.
He seemed to mean it.
</p>
<p>
Joe advanced him money enough to get some
better clothes, to have a bath and be shaved, and
it was quite a different person who appeared at the
tent the following day, ready to help Joe. As Ham
knew more about fire than any assistant Joe had
yet been able to train, the new man was given
charge of the various apparatus Joe used in his sensational
acts, including the one of sliding down the
wire on his head through the blazing hoops.
</p>
<p>
One matter bothered Joe and his friends, in spite
of the great success the circus was having, and this
was the bogus tickets. Several hundred of them
were presented at the performances in the city where
the two-day stay was made&mdash;the city already mentioned
as being the location of a big automobile
industry. And where the tickets came from remained
a mystery. They were so nearly like the
ones issued from the ticket wagon that not until
duplicate numbers had been observed could the
fraud be detected.
</p>
<p>
And as the men at the main entrances had no time
in the rush to compare serial numbers, there seemed
no way of stopping the cheating. It was impossible
to see to it that every one who came to the show
purchased admission tickets at the wagon. The
surging crowds around prevented this.
</p>
<p>
Men engaged by the circus circulated through the
throngs about the tent, seeking to learn whether any
unauthorized persons were selling bogus tickets.
But none was seen.
</p>
<p>
"It is evident," said Mr. Moyne, "that the counterfeiters
get a bunch of the fake tickets and sell
them in large lots to some men. These men, in
turn, dispose of them at reduced prices to others,
and perhaps the persons who use the tickets do not
know they are counterfeits. I believe the swindlers
go to the big factories and stores, and sell the
tickets at a slightly lower price than we ask."
</p>
<p>
"We ought to be able to put a stop to that," said
Joe.
</p>
<p>
"We'll try it!" said the treasurer. "It seems the
only way&mdash;that and having the detectives stop the
fraud at the source. You see, we can't tell which
are the counterfeit tickets until after we check up
the serial numbers&mdash;that's what makes it so hard."
</p>
<p>
And so, in spite of the success of Joe's acts and
The success of the show in general, there was this
element of annoyance. Joe wished the mystery
could be cleared up. He had received back from
the chemist the two tickets sent on last, and the
counterfeit was marked. This was sent to the paper
mill and the detectives notified. That was all that
could be done for the present.
</p>
<p>
"Well, how's Coal-fire Logan making out?" asked
Bill Watson of Joe one day, just before an afternoon
performance.
</p>
<p>
"Very good," was the answer. "He's faithful
and steady, and he's good help to me. He certainly
knows the fire-eating stunt."
</p>
<p>
"Well, as long as he doesn't do any fire-drinking
maybe he'll be all right," said the old clown.
</p>
<p>
"I haven't noticed any lapse," said Joe. "I have
great hopes of him."
</p>
<p>
But that very afternoon, during the performance,
Joe felt doubt beginning to creep over him.
He caught Ham in several mistakes&mdash;slight ones&mdash;but
enough, if not noticed in time, to have spoiled
the act.
</p>
<p>
"I wonder what the matter is with him?" mused
Joe. "He doesn't seem to have been drinking, and
yet he acts queer. I wonder if he can be using
drugs."
</p>
<p>
It was at the close of the act and the wind-up
of the circus for the afternoon that Joe told Ham
to put away some of the apparatus until evening.
Joe was called away from his dressing room for a
moment and when he came back he saw Ham hastily
throw away a dark brown bottle which struck on
a stone and broke. Immediately a queer odor filled
the air.
</p>
<p>
"I wonder if that was liquor he was taking, and
if he threw away the empty bottle," thought Joe
quickly. "I'm going to find out, I've got to stop
this thing at the start."
</p>
<p>
He hurried to the place where Ham had tossed
the bottle. The fragments lay there, and the queer
odor was more pronounced.
</p>
<p>
"Don't touch that! Let that bottle alone!" suddenly
cried Ham Logan, as he became aware of
Joe's intention. "Don't touch it!"

<h3>
A NARROW ESCAPE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Joe Strong was in two minds as he heard this
warning and observed the face of the man he was
befriending. His first thought was that Ham had
broken his promise and was indulging in intoxicants.
Naturally the man would want to conceal
this as long as possible. The other thought was
that the tramp fire-eater was up to some trick&mdash;perhaps
he was jealous of Joe's success and his own
failure and wanted to spoil some of Joe's apparatus.
Yet Joe did not recognize as any of his property
the brown bottle, which when broken emitted
such a queer smell.
</p>
<p>
Joe decided to investigate further, and so, not
heeding the warning call of the former circus star,
he walked closer to the broken flask.
</p>
<p>
"Keep away from that!" cried Ham sharply.
"Keep away!"
</p>
<p>
"Why?" asked Joe, with equal insistence.
</p>
<p>
"Because it's dangerous," was the answer. "Very
dangerous."
</p>
<p>
"Dangerous for you or me?" Joe wanted to
know. "Look here, Ham," he said earnestly, "are
you up to&mdash;any of your old tricks? You know
what I mean. Are you?"
</p>
<p>
The man flushed. Then, looking Joe straight in
the face, he said:
</p>
<p>
"You have a right to ask that, and I'll answer
you as straight. I haven't broken my promise&mdash;that
is, only the times you know about. I haven't
broken it this time. I found that bottle in among
your things, and I was mighty sure it didn't belong
there."
</p>
<p>
"What's in the bottle?" asked Joe, for, though
he had dabbled in chemistry, he did not recognize
the queer odor.
</p>
<p>
"A combination of the strongest acids ever
known!" was the answer of Ham Logan. "A drop
of it makes a terrible burn, and it will eat through
solid steel and iron. I knew that if it broke where
it was, among your trick things, a lot of them would
be ruined. And I knew you couldn't have left the
bottle there by mistake, as it wasn't there the last
time I packed away your duds. And I knew if you
knew what it was you wouldn't have left it around
in that careless way. So, taking no chances, I threw
it away, and I meant to break the bottle. That acid
is awful stuff. It's best to let it soak into the ground.
Come over and see what it does even to earth and
stones."
</p>
<p>
He led the way to where the fluid had escaped
from the broken flask, the fragments of which were
scattered about. The odor was less strong now,
as the acid was soaking into the earth. But there
was a fuming and bubbling at the spot, and the
very stones and earth seemed to be burning up in
a small area.
</p>
<p>
"Don't step in it!" warned Ham Logan. "It will
eat right through your shoes. Glass is the only
thing it won't hurt&mdash;glass and porcelain. They
mix it in porcelain retorts. I'll throw some loose
earth over this place. The effects of the acid will
soon be lost, but while it's active it's terrible stuff,
believe me!"
</p>
<p>
"And you say you found that bottle in my baggage?"
asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," answered Ham Logan. "And am I right
in saying you didn't know it was there?"
</p>
<p>
"I certainly didn't," declared Joe. "Who in the
world could have put it there?"
</p>
<p>
"Have you any enemies?" asked Ham. "I mean
some one who would like to see your circus acts
spoiled, or even see you laid up for a while?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, I guess perhaps there are some I've made
enemies of by having to discharge them, or something
like that," admitted Joe, his thoughts going
naturally to Bill Carfax. "There's one man, but
he hasn't been seen around for a good while."
</p>
<p>
"That doesn't count. He may have gotten some
one to do his trick for him," asserted Ham. "You'd
better look out, Mr. Strong."
</p>
<p>
"I will!" declared Joe. "And thank you for your
watchfulness. As you say, I didn't know that bottle
was there, and I might have broken it by accident
or have opened it and spilled some out. How
did you come to discover it?"
</p>
<p>
"Just by accident. The smell is something you
never forget. It comes up even around the glass
stopper. As soon as I began overhauling your
things, as you told me to, I smelled the stuff and
I went on a still hunt for it.
</p>
<p>
"I was careful, too. I knew what it meant to
get any of that acid on you, or on any of the things
about you. I used to work in the chemical plant
where they made the stuff&mdash;that was after I left
the circus. Well, it can't do any harm now," he
said as he got a shovel and covered with clean earth
the bits of broken glass and the still fuming drops
of add.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you," said Joe fervently.
</p>
<p>
He went into his private tent. Presently he came
out with a bit of wire cable, such as is used in making
circus trapezes. One end was blackened and
partly fused, as though it had been in the fire. Joe
held out this bit of wire rope. It was part of the
trapeze he used in his big swing.
</p>
<p>
"What would you say had eaten through these
strands?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Ham Logan looked carefully at the cable. He
sniffed it cautiously. He held it up to the light
and again smelled it.
</p>
<p>
"It was this same acid that ate those strands," he
declared. "I know how it used to eat metal out at
the chemical works, and it does so in a queer way.
This wire rope is eaten through just like that.
There isn't any odor left, though sometimes it lasts
a long time. But I'm sure the same kind of acid
was used. You don't mean to tell me you have been
experimenting with it!" and he looked in surprise
at Joe.
</p>
<p>
"No indeed!" and the young fire-eater shook his
head. "I never handle the acid. And the fact that
the cable was eaten through nearly caused an accident."
He then explained how he had discovered
the partly severed wire rope just in time.
</p>
<p>
"They must have put on a weak solution of the
acid," declared Ham. "Otherwise it would have
eaten the rope through in jig time. So that's the
game, is it? Well, they may have been trying it
on a larger scale. Did you find out who doped the
rope?"
</p>
<p>
"There was a man who might have done it," said
Joe, thinking of Harry Loper. "But I don't believe
he did."
</p>
<p>
"Is he still with the show?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes. I'll tell you all the circumstances," which
Joe did, mentioning Loper by name.
</p>
<p>
"Well, we won't say anything," declared Ham
Logan; "but I'll just keep my eyes on this Loper.
As you say, he may not have done it, but he may
know who did. I'll keep my eyes on him. Meanwhile
be careful in overhauling your things. Look
out for bottles that smell as this one did."
</p>
<p>
"I will!" promised Joe. "I guess I won't forget
that odor. I can't tell you how I thank you, Ham.
You've done me a good turn!"
</p>
<p>
"Well, you did me one," was the answer. "I
was down and out when you gave me work, and I
won't forget that in a hurry."
</p>
<p>
Joe pondered over what had happened as he performed
his circus acts the remainder of that day
and evening. He shuddered at the narrow escape
he had had, and, when he had a chance, he carefully
noted the conduct of Harry Loper. But that
young fellow did not seem at all to act like one who
had tried to do a dastardly trick. He was jolly
and good-natured, as he always was, albeit somewhat
of a weak character.
</p>
<p>
The circus performances went off well, Joe and
the other actors receiving wild applause as they did
their specialties. Joe's fire-eating was eagerly
watched, and when he slid down the rope on his
head, through the blazing hoops, the crowd went
wild, as they did when, seemingly all afire, he leaped
into the tank.
</p>
<p>
"When you going to spring that sensation you've
been talking of, Joe?" asked Jim Tracy, at the conclusion
of one afternoon show.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, pretty soon now," was the reply. "Ham
Logan and I are working on it."
</p>
<p>
"Ham Logan! Is he going to be in it with you?"
asked the ringmaster in some surprise.
</p>
<p>
"Of course!" answered Joe. "It's partly his idea.
He's an old fire-actor, you know, and he's given me
some good suggestions. Yes, he's going to help me.
I think we'll put the act on next week. We've got
to train some new performers first."
</p>
<p>
"New performers! Say, what are you going to
do, Joe, take a troupe of fire-eating actors out on
the road?"
</p>
<p>
"Something like that, yes," answered the young
magician, with a laugh. "You'll see."
</p>
<p>
Joe Strong varied his acts in the circus tent
Sometimes he would omit the "vanishing lady" act,
as Helen wanted to put through some extra work
with Rosebud, and there was not time for both.
Again he would leave out some of his acrobatic
work, or perhaps not do the trick of seeming to
catch fire and extinguishing the flames in Benny
Turton's tank. Once in a while he would omit the
ten thousand dollar mystery box trick.
</p>
<p>
But on the day when he had the above conversation
with Jim Tracy they were showing in a large
factory town. There had been good business in
the afternoon, and Joe had not done the box trick.
But just before the evening show Jim came to Joe
and said:
</p>
<p>
"There've been several requests, Joe, that you put
the box trick on to-night."
</p>
<p>
"Requests from whom?" Joe asked.
</p>
<p>
"One of the newspaper men was telling me they
received a lot of telephone calls to-day asking if the
box trick would be done and the reward paid in case
some one discovered the way it was done."
</p>
<p>
"What did you say?"
</p>
<p>
"I said I thought you'd put the trick on in that
case. Don't you think you'd better? We didn't
advertise it specially for to-night, but there might
be a lot of sore-heads if we don't pull it off."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I'll do it all right!" declared Joe. "I thought
it was getting a bit stale. But if the crowd wants
to see it I'll do it."
</p>
<p>
"I guess it will be better," said the ringmaster.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, at the proper time, Joe, in his dazzling
white suit, took his place in the silk-curtained
enclosure. Helen, in her black dress, was ready to
help him. The fireman, with his gleaming ax, ready
to chop Joe out of the box in case anything should
go wrong, was also on the stage.
</p>
<p>
As has been related in the other book, this last
was done only for effect. Joe well knew that he
could get out of the box. The manager made the
usual offer of ten thousand dollars to be paid to
any one who would disclose how the trick was done.
</p>
<p>
"You will all be given a chance to claim the reward
under the usual conditions after the trick has
been performed by Professor Strong," was the announcement
made.
</p>
<p>
As the description of the manner in which Joe
and Helen did the trick is given in all its details in
the volume preceding this, suffice it here to say that
Joe got into the box, which was locked and roped,
and, at the proper time, he appeared outside.
</p>
<p>
"Is there any one who can tell how the trick was
done, and so earn the ten thousand dollar reward?"
asked the manager. He had made this announcement
many times. Seldom, of late, had any one
come forward. But now, somewhat to the surprise
of Joe and his friends, a man's voice called from
a location near the platform:
</p>
<p>
"I can tell how it was done!"
</p>
<p>
"Will you please come forward," invited Joe, now
taking charge of the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
A fairly well-dressed man stepped across the
arena and approached the stage. Joe and Jim Tracy
and the others vitally interested looked closely at
him. He was not Bill Carfax&mdash;that was certain.
And Joe did not know the man, nor, as Jim Tracy
admitted afterward, did he.
</p>
<p>
"You say you can tell how I get out of the box?"
asked Joe, and the audience listened intently.
</p>
<p>
"Yes. I know the secret."
</p>
<p>
"Are you willing to post a hundred dollars to
be forfeited to the Red Cross in case you fail?"
went on the young magician.
</p>
<p>
"I am. Here is the money!" was the cool response.
This quick compliance with the terms of
the offer rather staggered Joe. But he had no fear
as to the outcome.
</p>
<p>
"Very well," went on the originator of the box
trick. "The ringmaster will hold your money. If
you are successful in telling how I get out of the
box the cash will be handed back to you, and you
will receive, in addition, a check for ten thousand
dollars. Now then, how do I get out of the box?
Tell the audience."
</p>
<p>
There was a moment of suspense, and then the
man, with an air of confidence, stepped close to the
big, heavy box and, pointing to a certain corner,
said:
</p>
<p>
"Right there is a secret panel. You slip it back
and get out that way!"
</p>
<p>
The man seemed so triumphantly confident and so
sure of his statement, that several in the audience
cried:
</p>
<p>
"Is that right? Is that how you do the trick? If
it is pay him the ten thousand dollars!"
</p>
<p>
Joe looked at Jim Tracy. This was the first time
any one had ever come so close to the truth. Helen,
standing at one side of the stage, began to be fearful
that, after all, Joe's secret was discovered. It
would mean an end of the box trick.
</p>
<p>
Then Joe smiled, and stepped forward. And
there was something in the smile that reassured
Helen.
</p>
<p>
"Has he guessed it?" she asked in a low voice,
as Joe passed her.
</p>
<p>
"No. But it was a narrow escape," was the answer.

<h3>
JUGGLING WITH FIRE
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Smilingly the man who had made claim to the
ten thousand dollars waited for Joe Strong. The
fellow seemed already to have the money in his
grasp.
</p>
<p>
"You say there is a sliding panel in that corner?"
asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Positive."
</p>
<p>
"And that I get out that way?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I say you are wrong, and I am going to
prove it," returned Joe easily, and also smiling.
"Now I'm going to let you, and any one you may
select from the audience, paste sheets of paper over
that corner. Then I'll do the trick over again. If
I get out of the box, and the paper you paste on
remains unbroken, you'll have to admit that I didn't
come out through the place where you say is a
sliding panel, won't you?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, if you don't break the paper, I guess I'll
have to admit you didn't get out that way," said
the man, with a grin. "But I want to see you do
it first."
</p>
<p>
"Very well. I'll send for some paste and paper,"
went on Joe. "Meanwhile call upon any of your
friends you like to help."
</p>
<p>
"Come on up here, Bill!" called out the man.
</p>
<p>
For an instant Joe, and Helen also, as she admitted
later, feared it might be Bill Carfax to whom
he referred. But an altogether different individual
shuffled up to the stage.
</p>
<p>
"We'll paste paper over this end where the trick
panel is," went on the man who had claimed the
reward. "He won't get out then!"
</p>
<p>
"Sure he won't," agreed his companion. "Do
we get the ten thousand then?"
</p>
<p>
"Naturally, if you have guessed right," said Joe.
"But that remains to be seen."
</p>
<p>
There was no trouble in getting paste and paper.
That is part of a circus, for, even though it is old-fashioned,
paper hoops are still used for the clowns
and some bareback riders to leap through.
</p>
<p>
A plentiful supply of large, white sheets and a
pail of paste with a brush were brought up to the
stage. Then the men were invited to begin their
work, which was to seal up the corner the man had
picked out as the location of the secret panel.
</p>
<p>
Before pasting on the paper the men looked closely
at the joinings of the box. They seemed rather
puzzled in spite of the cock-sureness of the first individual.
</p>
<p>
The pasting was not a work of art, but it was
effective. The corner of the box was plastered over
with sheets of white paper, in which there was no
break.
</p>
<p>
"If I get out of the box without cracking, tearing,
or disturbing the paper you have pasted on,
without moving it in any way, you'll admit that
you're wrong, won't you?" asked Joe, as he prepared
to do the trick again.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," was the answer. "I will. But I've got
you sewed up!"
</p>
<p>
"Pasted up would be a better word," returned
Joe, with a smile. "But that remains to be seen."
</p>
<p>
The box was placed in position, and Joe took
his place in it. The lid was slammed down, locked,
and the rope was knotted about it. The two men
who had done the pasting assisted in this.
</p>
<p>
Then the curtains were drawn, and Helen and the
firemen took their places. There was a period of
waiting. The tense suspense of the audience was
manifest. Even Jim Tracy and Bill Watson, veteran
circus men though they were, seemed a bit
worried. The man who had claimed the ten thousand
dollars and his companion seemed a bit ill at
ease.
</p>
<p>
Then, suddenly, the curtains parted and Joe
Strong stood in plain view, outside the box, bowing
to the applause that greeted him. When it had subsided,
he said:
</p>
<p>
"Will you two gentlemen kindly look at the paper
seals you placed on one corner of the box? If they
are unbroken and undisturbed I take it you have
lost. Kindly look and announce what you find."
</p>
<p>
The men shuffled to the case and bent down over
the corner that was covered with the pasted sheets.
Look as they did, they could find no evidences of a
break or tear in the paper. And it had not been
removed and put back again. The men admitted
that.
</p>
<p>
"Then you have to admit that I didn't get out
of the box by means of a secret panel in that corner,
don't you?" asked Joe, when the two had asserted
that the paper was intact.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I guess you win," said the first man. "But
there's some trick about it!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I admit that!" laughed Joe. "It is a trick,
and if you discover it you get ten thousand dollars.
But not to-night. Red Cross is richer by
a hundred dollars."
</p>
<p>
"Um!" grumbled the man, as he walked off, and
many in the audience laughed. Joe had won.
</p>
<p>
The circus performance went on to its usual
exciting close in the chariot races, and when preparations
were being made to travel on to the next
city, Helen had a chance to speak to Joe.
</p>
<p>
"It was a narrow escape," she said.
</p>
<p>
"Just what it was!" he replied. "If he had picked
the other corner&mdash;the left instead of the right&mdash;he
would have had me. But luck was with us."
</p>
<p>
"I'm glad," said Helen. "But how did he happen
to select any corner? Some one must know more
about your trick box than you think."
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid so," admitted Joe ruefully. "I
wouldn't be a bit surprised but what this was some
of the work of Bill Carfax."
</p>
<p>
"Has he been around again?" asked Helen, and
there was a note of annoyance in her voice.
</p>
<p>
"He hasn't been seen," said Joe. "But this man
may have been in communication with him. Bill
may have been studying the trick out since his last
failure, and I must admit that he's on the right trail&mdash;that
is, if it was Bill who put this man up to
making the claim."
</p>
<p>
"What makes you think Bill had anything to do
with it?" asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
"Well, for the reason that this is just the kind
of town where Bill would be likely to have friends&mdash;I
mean in a big manufacturing center. Bill may
have found a man who is willing to act to help pull
down the reward for him. But this time they
failed."
</p>
<p>
"He may succeed next time," remarked Helen.
</p>
<p>
"No, I'll take care of that," Joe said. "I'm going
to make a change in the box."
</p>
<p>
As the mechanism of the trick box has been
explained in the preceding volume, it will not be repeated
here. Suffice it to say that Joe's method
of getting out of the box could be changed, so
that if a person thought he had discovered the secret
panel it could be shifted to another part of the case.
</p>
<p>
It was two or three days after this, and Joe had
made a change in his box which satisfied him that
the secret would not soon be discovered, that Helen,
coming over to where he sat in his private tent, saw
him making what seemed to be torches.
</p>
<p>
"What are you doing?" she asked. "Do you
think our electric lights or gasoline flares are going
to fail?" she went on jokingly. The Sampson
Brothers' Show was a modern one, and carried a
portable electric light plant.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no, I'm not worrying about that!" answered
Joe. "But I have a new idea for my wire act, and
I want to see if it will work out."
</p>
<p>
That night, at the proper time, when Joe was
introduced as about to perform his wire act, Helen
noticed Ham Logan come out with the young fire-eater,
carrying a number of the torches Joe had
made.
</p>
<p>
Joe started across the high, slack wire, and on it
performed many of his usual feats. They were
not specially sensational, and Helen wondered what
he had planned.
</p>
<p>
But, after a daring run across the slender support,
following some risky side swinging, Helen saw Joe
lower from the high platform where he stood a flexible
wire. Standing on the ground below, Ham
Logan received it and fastened on the end several
of the metal torches Joe had made. The young magician
hauled them up to him by means of the wire.
</p>
<p>
Then, as Helen and the audience watched, Joe
set the torches ablaze. They were made of hollow
cones of sheet iron, in which were placed bits of
tow, soaked in alcohol.
</p>
<p>
With four blazing torches, two in either hand,
Joe Strong started out to cross the high, slack wire.
And then, to the wonder and amazement of the
audience, no less than that of his friends in the
show, Joe began juggling with fire.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</h2>

<h3>
THE BLAZING BANQUET
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Across the wire walked the young performer, and
as he walked he tossed into the air, catching them
as they came down, the flaming torches. When it
is remembered that the fire was of the real, blazing
sort, and hot at that, also when it is recalled that if
Joe happened to catch hold of the wrong end of any
of the whirling torches, and when it is evident that
he must "watch his step," it will be seen that he was
performing no easy feat.
</p>
<p>
Yet to watch him one would have thought that
he had been doing it right along for many performances,
instead of this being his first in public,
though he and Ham Logan had practiced in private.
</p>
<p>
Across the wire walked Joe, juggling with fire,
and when he reached the other platform he walked
backward along the swaying wire.
</p>
<p>
Then the applause broke out, loud and long. The
crowd appreciated the trick, with all its dangers.
True, Joe Strong was an expert on the wire, and
he was also a good juggler. But juggling with
torches while on a swaying cable was not
as easy as handling harmless rubber balls or Indian
clubs, and the circus throng seemed to appreciate
this.
</p>
<p>
Getting back to the platform whence he had started,
Joe dropped the still blazing torches into a tub
of water where they went out hissingly. This provided
a fitting climax to the act, as showing that
the flames were real ones.
</p>
<p>
And then Joe donned his cap of leather, with the
little grooved wheels fastened in the top, and on his
head he slid down the slanting wire through the
blazing hoops. It was a good end to a good trick;
and the crowd went wild.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Joe, you sure did put another one over
for us," said Jim Tracy, at the conclusion of the
performance. "That fire juggling was a great trick.
That's the sensation you promised us, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
"No, it isn't," was the answer. "I'm not ready
for that yet. But I'm glad you liked the trick.
No, what I have up my sleeve is something even
better, I think."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I hope you haven't any blazing torches up
your sleeve," remarked Helen, with a laugh. "You'll
need a new coat, if you have."
</p>
<p>
"No danger," laughed Joe. "I think I'll be ready
soon. By the way, any news of the bogus tickets&mdash;I
mean the detectives haven't found out anything
positive, have they?"
</p>
<p>
"Not yet," answered Mr. Moyne, who had joined
the little party. "And it's keeping all of us who
have to do with the financial end guessing as to
where the trouble will break out next."
</p>
<p>
"It is an unpleasant state of affairs," agreed Joe.
"But I don't see what we can do except to wait.
You haven't noticed any more of the counterfeit
tickets of late, have you?"
</p>
<p>
"No," answered the treasurer. "It's only when
we hit the big mill cities that they are worked in
on us. That's why I believe there is some system
to it all."
</p>
<p>
"Well, we'll have to break up the system," declared
Joe. "As soon as I get this new act of mine
perfected I'm going to take a day or two off, over
Sunday say, and visit the detective agency. They
may need stirring up."
</p>
<p>
"I wish something could be done," declared the
treasurer.
</p>
<p>
About a week after this conversation, during
which time the circus had moved from place to
place, doing good business, Mrs. Watson, meeting
Helen on the lot, said:
</p>
<p>
"Who are Joe's new friends?"
</p>
<p>
"New friends? I didn't know he had any specially
new ones," remarked the young bareback
rider. "Has he been befriending some more poor
broken-down circus men, like Ham Logan?"
</p>
<p>
"These aren't men," said the clown's wife. "They
are three pretty girls. I saw Joe coming back from
downtown with them. They seemed jolly&mdash;laughing
and talking."
</p>
<p>
"Three pretty girls!" murmured Helen. And then
she quickly added, with an air of indifference: "Oh,
I suppose they may be some cousins he hasn't seen
for a long while."
</p>
<p>
"I thought Joe said he had no relatives in this
country," went on Mrs. Watson.
</p>
<p>
"I'm sure I don't know," and Helen's voice was
very cool.
</p>
<p>
"There's something behind all this," mused Mrs.
Watson, as Helen walked away. "I hope those two
haven't quarreled. Maybe I shouldn't have said
anything."
</p>
<p>
However, it was too late now. The seeds of jealousy
seemed to have been sown, though unwittingly,
by Mrs. Watson. Helen walked on with her head
high in the air, and as the clown's wife passed Joe's
official tent a little later she heard, issuing from it,
the jolly laughter and talk of several girlish voices.
</p>
<p>
"I wonder what Joe Strong is up to," thought
Mrs. Watson. "He never acted like that before&mdash;going
off with other girls and neglecting Helen.
I'm going to speak to him. No, I won't either!"
she decided. "I'll just keep still until I know I can
help. It's better that way."
</p>
<p>
It was perhaps an hour after this that Joe, meeting
Helen, called to her:
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I say! don't you want to do me a favor?"
</p>
<p>
"What sort?" asked the rider of Rosebud, and if
Joe had not been thinking of something else he
would have noticed the danger signs about Helen's
countenance.
</p>
<p>
"The fancy jacket I use in one of my tricks is
torn," went on Joe. "Would it be asking too much
to request you to mend it?"
</p>
<p>
Helen tossed back her head and there was a snap
to her eyes as she answered:
</p>
<p>
"Why don't you get one of the three pretty girls
to do your mending? I'm afraid I'm not clever
enough!" And with that she walked on haughtily.
</p>
<p>
For an instant Joe was so surprised that he could
not speak. His face plainly showed how taken
aback he was. Then, after a moment, he managed
to stammer:
</p>
<p>
"Oh, but I say! Helen! Wait a moment! Let
me explain. I&mdash;er I&mdash;I only&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
But Helen did not pause, she did not look back,
and she did not answer. Joe stood staring after her
in blank amazement. Then he gave utterance to
a low whistle and exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
"Oh, ho! I see! Well, it will be my turn later!"
and he laughed silently.
</p>
<p>
"He's either playing a mean trick or else he's up
to some joke," declared Mrs. Watson, who, from a
distance, had watched this little scene. "And," she
added with a shake of her head, "I can't be sure
what it is. Young folks are so foolish! So foolish!"
and she sighed as she walked away.
</p>
<p>
Joe, with the torn jacket in his hand, turned back
toward his own tent, and presently there came from
it the sounds of several young persons, including
girls, in conversation and laughter.
</p>
<p>
It was later, that same afternoon, when Helen
noticed Joe in one part of the big tent. He was surrounded
by three pretty young ladies and three
good-looking young men. They were on one of the
platforms seated about a table, and Joe seemed to be
entertaining them, for there were plates, cups,
knives and forks on the board&mdash;all the outward indications
of a meal.
</p>
<p>
The time was late afternoon, following the day
performance and prior to the evening show. Helen
looked curiously over at the gay little scene, and
something tugged at her heart-strings. Then she
looked away, and Mrs. Watson, observing her from
the other side of the tent, shook her gray head.
</p>
<p>
"I can't understand Joe Strong," murmured the
clown's wife. "What has come over him?"
</p>
<p>
It was just before the opening of the evening performance
that night when Joe, meeting Helen in the
dressing tent, said:
</p>
<p>
"I shan't need you in the box trick, to-night, nor
in the vanishing lady stunt, either."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I suppose you're going to use one of the
new, pretty girls," snapped Helen.
</p>
<p>
Joe looked at her quietly.
</p>
<p>
"No," he said, "I am not. But I am not going
to put on either trick. I thought you'd like to know,
so if you want to introduce any of your extras you'll
have a chance."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you!" she said coldly, and passed on.
</p>
<p>
Joe smiled as he looked after her.
</p>
<p>
With a blare of trumpets, a boom and ruffle of
drums, the gay procession started around the circus
arena. The stately elephants, the hideous camels
and the beautiful horses went around to be looked
at, wondered at, and admired. Then, when the last
of the cavalcade had passed out, the various acts
began. Helen had a new costume for her bareback
act, and as she started it she looked over to where
Joe was busy on his stage. She saw the young men
and women around him. They wore fancy costumes
and seemed a part of the circus. Helen wondered
what act they were going to appear in, since
none including them had been announced.
</p>
<p>
She danced about on the back of Rosebud, and
thought bitterly that Joe had never noticed her new
dress. She was wearing it for the first time, too.
</p>
<p>
The whistle blew. All acts stopped and Jim Tracy
advanced toward Joe's platform.
</p>
<p>
"A most marvelous and striking act!" he cried,
not stating what it was to be.
</p>
<p>
All eyes, even those of Helen Morton, turned
in the direction of Joe Strong.
</p>
<p>
He acted quickly. With a wave of his hand he
invited the three pretty girls and the three well-appearing
young men to be seated. They took their
places around a table, with Joe acting as host. The
table appeared to be well laden, and at first the act
seemed to be only a rather elaborate meal being
served in public.
</p>
<p>
"What is it all about?" mused Helen. "I can't
see anything very wonderful in that."
</p>
<p>
But, even as she thus mused, something strange
happened. The banquet table seemed to burst into
flames. The dishes of food blazed up, and the
audience gasped.
</p>
<p>
But the young men, the young women, and Joe
Strong did not seem in the least surprised. They
kept their seats and went right on eating.
</p>
<p>
And then, with a thrill of surprise, it was noticed
that Joe Strong and his guests were devouring the
blazing food itself! The girls and young men put
portion after portion of the blazing viands into
their mouths!

<h3>
HAM IS MISSING
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Surprise and astonishment held the audience silent
and spellbound for a moment. Then a woman
screamed, and, ready for this emergency and fearing
a panic, than which nothing is more dreaded
by circus men, Jim Tracy cried:
</p>
<p>
"Sit still! Keep your seats! There is no danger!
This is all part of the show. We are merely showing
you how to eat your meals in case any of you
ever get caught in a blazing volcano. Watch the
ladies and gentlemen eat their stuff hot&mdash;right off
the fire!"
</p>
<p>
There was a laugh at this sally, and a laugh was
what the ringmaster wanted more than anything else
just then. He knew the tide of fear had been
changed to one of wondering admiration.
</p>
<p>
And so, sitting on the stage in sight of the
thrilled audience, Joe Strong and his guests, in the
shape of pretty girls and manly young fellows fancifully
attired, continued to eat the blazing food.
</p>
<p>
The very pieces of bread seemed to be on fire,
there was a dancing flame over the butter, and each
bit of meat or other food Joe and the performers
lifted on their forks was alive with leaping fire.
</p>
<p>
Then the daring feature of the act was borne home
to the audience and the applause broke forth&mdash;applause
loud and long. There were yells and whistles
from the younger and more enthusiastic portion
of the circus crowd.
</p>
<p>
And then the fires died away. The table seemed
emptied of victuals, and the young men and women,
imitating Joe's example, leaned back in their chairs
as though well satisfied with their hot meal.
</p>
<p>
"There you are, ladies and gentlemen!" declaimed
the ringmaster. "They have come to no harm from
eating living fire. If any of you are tired of cold
victuals, kindly step forward and you will be treated
to a free, hot lunch by Professor Strong."
</p>
<p>
"Not any in mine, thank you," murmured a man,
and that seemed to be the general opinion.
</p>
<p>
As Joe and his new associates arose to bow to the
renewed applause, the ringmaster made an announcement.
</p>
<p>
"A blazing banquet, such as you have just witnessed,
will take place at each and every performance,"
he declared. "Come and bring your friends!
Nothing like it ever seen before on any stage or
in any circus in the world!
</p>
<p>
"Remember, you will see the same and identical
act at each and every performance and all for the
price of one admission. Professor Strong and his
gifted salamander associates will eat fire as they
did just now, at each and every show in the big
tent. I thank you!"
</p>
<p>
"Well, Joe, it went all right!" said Jim Tracy
when the performers had left the stage and the
young fire-eater was alone on the platform. "It
went like a house afire!"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Joe, "it seemed to. I guess it went
better than if we had made a lot of preliminary
notices. The suddenness of it took them by surprise."
</p>
<p>
"But we can advertise it big now," said the ringmaster.
"We don't need to specify exactly what it
is. Of course those who have seen it will tell their
friends who are coming and who haven't seen it.
But the big majority of the audiences will be as
much surprised as this one was. It went big."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," agreed Joe, "it did. And I'm glad of it.
This is the sensation I was planning, but I didn't
want to go into details until I was sure it would
work. I had to engage my helpers in the dark, so
to speak, and I didn't even tell you what I was
planning until the last minute."
</p>
<p>
"No, you didn't," said Jim.
</p>
<p>
Helen Morton came slowly across the arena. Her
act was over, and she had seen the blazing banquet
and Joe's part in it.
</p>
<p>
Her cheeks were unusually red as she approached
holding out her hand, and there was a rather misty
look about her eyes as she said:
</p>
<p>
"Will you forgive me, Joe?"
</p>
<p>
"For what?" he asked tantalizingly.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, you know perfectly well!" she exclaimed.
"It was very silly of me, but&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"I know, Helen. I did tease you a bit," he said.
"I suppose I might have told you that the pretty
girls were those I had engaged to help in the banquet
scene, together with the young fellows. We
had only a few rehearsals in my tent, and I didn't
want to spread the news too generally, even among
the circus crowd, for fear of a leak. But I suppose
I might have told you."
</p>
<p>
"It would have saved me from acting so silly, if
you had," she murmured.
</p>
<p>
"Then it is I who should ask forgiveness," said
Joe. "But it's all right now. And may I come to
lunch with you, or would you rather that I should
go with&mdash;one of the pretty girls?"
</p>
<p>
"If you do I'll never forgive you!" declared
Helen, blushing more than ever. And so the little
quarrel ended.
</p>
<p>
As Joe had intimated, he had engaged his banquet
helpers secretly, and they had met him at the
city where the circus was to remain three days and
nights. Ham Logan had been instrumental in getting
the performers for Joe, since the old circus
man knew the best theatrical agency at which to
apply. So Joe had hired the young men and women
to act the part of guests at the "banquet." He had
guessed that Helen's actions denoted her jealousy,
but he could not forbear teasing her.
</p>
<p>
"But did they actually eat the fire?" Helen asked,
when she and Joe were together again. "Of course
I know they didn't," she went on. "It's silly of me
to ask such a question. But it was very realistic."
</p>
<p>
"I'm glad of that," said Joe. "No, they didn't
actually 'eat' the fire, any more than I eat it. And
I may say that I had quite a little trouble in getting
them to put it near enough their mouths to
make it seem as if they did.
</p>
<p>
"But the 'food' was only very thin paper of a peculiar
kind, which Ham Logan and I worked out together.
It can be made to look like almost any food,
and yet it is treated chemically so as to burn easily
and quickly. The flames go out as soon as they
come near enough our mouths to feel the effects of
certain chemicals that are on our faces. I can't tell
you all the secrets, but that is enough to show you
how we worked it.
</p>
<p>
"There was no more danger than there is when
I 'eat' fire, and the trick is done in much the same
way. Ham Logan is getting to be an invaluable
helper. I hope he stays with me. I never could
have done this trick without him."
</p>
<p>
The blazing banquet was the talk of that and other
cities. As Jim Tracy had said, the feat was shown
at each and every performance, Joe cutting out some
of his less sensational acts. The circus made a longer
stay than usual in the city where the fiery food
was first "eaten," and played to record-breaking
business.
</p>
<p>
"And the best of it is that we haven't seen a bogus
ticket!" said the treasurer, much elated.
</p>
<p>
Joe, as one of the chief owners of the circus, was
able to hire the "fire-eaters" unknown to any of his
associates until the last minute, and thus the surprise
was all the greater.
</p>
<p>
Joe's fire tricks were now the talk of the theatrical
and circus worlds, and he received many offers
to leave Sampson Brothers' Show and star by himself.
But he refused them all, saying he wanted
to build up his own show to a point never before
reached.
</p>
<p>
As he had said, Ham Logan proved a valuable
helper. The man, a fire-eater of the old school,
knew many valuable secrets, and he held himself
under such obligation to Joe that he revealed many
of them to the young magician.
</p>
<p>
"Have you learned anything more about who left
that bottle of powerful acid in among my things?"
asked Joe of Ham, one afternoon when the fire banquet
had been unusually successful.
</p>
<p>
"No, not exactly," was the answer. "But I'm on
the trail, I think I am working along the right
lines, but it is too early to make any statement."
</p>
<p>
"Well, take your time," said Joe. "Only I don't
want to get mixed up with any of the deadly stuff."
</p>
<p>
"Don't worry. I'm on the watch," declared the
old performer.
</p>
<p>
That night, when the time for Joe to prepare for
his acts, including the fire tricks, came, he did not
see Ham in the dressing tent, where the assistant
was usually to be found.
</p>
<p>
"Have you seen him?" asked Joe of Harry Loper.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, about half an hour ago," was the answer.
"He said he was going in to town."
</p>
<p>
"Going in to town&mdash;and so near performing
time?" cried Joe. "I wonder what for! He ought
to be here!"
</p>
<p>
Joe was worried, and when his signal for going
on came Ham Logan was still missing. Joe Strong
shook his head dubiously. It had been found necessary
to get another man to help with the act.
</p>
<p>
"I don't like this," he murmured. "I don't like it
for a cent!"
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	CHAPTER XXII
</h2>

<h3>
A SUDDEN WARNING
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Only the fact that he had strong nerves and that
he possessed the ability of concentrating his mind
on whatever was uppermost at the time, enabled the
young circus man to get through his various circus
acts with credit at that performance. He began
with the worry over Ham Logan's disappearance
before him. And he was actually worried&mdash;a bad
state of affairs for one whose ability to please and
deceive critical audiences depends on his snappy
acting, his quickness of hand and mind, and his
skill.
</p>
<p>
But, as has been said, Joe possessed the ability
to concentrate on the most needful matter, and that,
for the time being, was his box trick, his fire-eating,
and his slide on his head down the slanting wire
through the blazing hoops.
</p>
<p>
Then came the blazing banquet, and this created
the usual furor in the audience. Joe managed to
get through it with credit, though his rather strange
manner was noticed and commented on afterward
by the young people associated with him.
</p>
<p>
"I wonder what's bothering the boss?" asked one
of the young fire-eaters of another. "He nearly
made a slip when he was lifting up that fake fried
oyster."
</p>
<p>
"Maybe the circus is losing money and he's got
to cut out this act&mdash;let some of us go&mdash;can't pay our
salaries," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
"Don't you believe it!" declared the other. "The
circus is making more money than it ever did&mdash;more
even when the fake tickets are worked off on
it."
</p>
<p>
"Well, it's none of our affair."
</p>
<p>
"I wouldn't like my salary to be cut off."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, neither would I."
</p>
<p>
"Fake tickets? I hadn't heard of them."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes," explained the first speaker, and he
went into the details of the affair.
</p>
<p>
"But there's surely something worrying the
boss," commented still another of the young men,
and his associates, including the "pretty girls,"
agreed with him.
</p>
<p>
And what really was worrying Joe was speculation
over the fate of Ham Logan. Not since Joe
had first taken the old and broken circus actor into
his employ had Ham been away more than a few
hours at a time, and then Joe knew where he was.
This time Ham had left no word, save the uncertain
one that he was going into the city, on the
outskirts of which the circus was at the time showing.
</p>
<p>
"But don't you think he'll come back?" asked
Jim Tracy, when, after the performance, Joe had
spoken of the missing Ham.
</p>
<p>
"I wish I could think so," was the reply. "I sure
will hate to lose him. I depend a lot on him in my
fire tricks."
</p>
<p>
"What makes you think you will lose him?" asked
Tracy curiously.
</p>
<p>
"Well, his going off this way, for one," declared
Joe. "What I'm really afraid of is that he may
have gone back to his bad habits. You know how
it is. A man starts to reform, and he keeps the
pledges he makes until he meets some of his boon
companions who used to help him on the downward
road. They invite him to come along for a good
time, and he goes."
</p>
<p>
"And you think that's what's happened to Ham?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid so. I'm going down town and see
if I can get any trace of him."
</p>
<p>
And this Joe did as soon as he was relieved of
his duties in the circus. The show was to remain
in town over night, and this gave him just the
chance he wanted.
</p>
<p>
It was an unpleasant errand, but Joe went through
with it. He had to call at many places that were
distasteful to him, but in none of them did he get
a trace of Ham Logan. Joe saw in the more
brilliant parts of the city a number of the circus men,
including some of the chief performers. They were
taking advantage of the two-days' stay, and were
meeting old friends and making some new acquaintances.
</p>
<p>
Of these Joe inquired for news of Ham, but no
one had seen him. The old fire-eater had endeared
himself to more than one member of the Sampson
Brothers' Show, for he was always ready to do a
favor. So more than Joe were interested in seeing
that Ham kept on the good road along which he
had started. But all of Joe's efforts were of no
avail.
</p>
<p>
It was after midnight when he ended his search,
and, rather than go back to the sleeping car where
the other performers spent their night, Joe put up
at a hotel, sending word to Jim Tracy of what he
intended to do.
</p>
<p>
"I want to find Ham," Joe wrote in the note he
sent to the ringmaster by a messenger boy, "and I've
asked the police to be on the quiet lookout for him.
If I stay at the hotel I can help him more quickly,
in case he's found, than if I am away out at the
railroad siding where the circus train is. I'll see
you in the morning."
</p>
<p>
But Joe's night at the hotel was spent in vain,
for there was no word of Ham Logan, and the
morning which Joe put in, making inquiries, was
equally fruitless.
</p>
<p>
"I guess Ham is gone for good," sighed Joe, and
his regret was genuine, and almost as much for
the sake of the man himself as for his own loss of
a good assistant.
</p>
<p>
For Ham Logan was that and more to Joe. The
former tramp had much valuable information regarding
the old style fire-eating tricks, and though
he was not up to the task of doing them himself,
he gave Joe good advice. It was by his help and
advice that Joe had staged the blazing banquet
scene, which was such a success and which the newspapers
mentioned constantly.
</p>
<p>
True, Joe did not actually need Ham to go on
with his acts. He could break in another man to
help him, to hand him the proper article at just the
right time, to see to the mixing of the fire-resisting
chemicals and to the preparation of the viands that
seemed to be composed of fire itself.
</p>
<p>
"And that's what I'll have to do," mused Joe,
when he became convinced some days later that
Ham was not to be found.
</p>
<p>
He wished that Helen was able to act as his assistant
in the fire scenes, as she did in the box trick
and the vanishing lady act. But she could spare
no more time from her own act with Rosebud, since
she was billed as one of the "stars." Then, too,
Helen had a fear of fire, and though she had succeeded
in overcoming part of it, still she would not
have made the proper sort of assistant in those acts.
Besides, she would not have been able to mix the
chemicals Joe required to render himself immune
from such fire as he actually came in contact with,
though momentarily.
</p>
<p>
"I've got to train in a new man," decided Joe.
He mentally considered various circus employees,
rejecting one after another, and finally selected one
of the young men who acted in the blazing banquet
scene. This youth was a bright, manly fellow, and
had introduced some new "business" in the act which
made it more interesting.
</p>
<p>
"I'll train him in," decided Joe, "with the understanding
that if Ham comes back he'll get his old
place. If he comes back! I wonder if he ever will,
and if he'll be in a condition to help me."
</p>
<p>
Joe shook his head dubiously.
</p>
<p>
The circus moved on. It had played to good business,
and there was more good business in prospect.
Mr. Moyne, the treasurer, was on the anxious seat
much of the time, fearing another flood of bogus
tickets, but the efforts mentioned, on the part of the
swindlers, following the use of new paper, was all
they had to complain of so far.
</p>
<p>
"Either the detectives are too close to the trail
of the cheats to allow them to work in safety, or
they've given it up altogether," decided the treasurer.
</p>
<p>
"I hope so," said Joe. "Still it won't do to relax
our vigilance. I wrote to the detective firm, as I
said I would, jacking them up a bit. Maybe they
are ready to make an arrest, and that would stop
the swindlers."
</p>
<p>
The young man Joe had picked out to act as his
chief assistant in the fire scenes was Ted Brown.
Ted was about eighteen years old, and this was his
first position with a circus. But he was making
good, and he had not yet been afflicted with the terrible
disease known as "swelled head," something
which ruins so many performers.
</p>
<p>
Ted learned rapidly, and Joe felt that it would
be safe to trust him with some of the secrets of the
tricks&mdash;the mixing of the fire-resisting chemicals
and the like. Joe's choice seemed to be a good one,
for Ted did well, and his part in the banquet scene
was made even better by his knowledge of the inner
workings of the material used.
</p>
<p>
But though Joe did not lose materially by the
desertion of Ham, if that was what it was, since he
could now depend on Ted, the young circus man
many times found himself wondering if he would
ever see the old fire-eater again.
</p>
<p>
The circus opened one afternoon in a large city&mdash;one
in which lived many thousands of men employed
in a large ship-building plant.
</p>
<p>
"There'll be big crowds here," said Mr. Moyne,
as he walked toward the ticket wagon in preparation
for the rush. "And it's here we'll have to look
out for bogus coupons."
</p>
<p>
"Why?" asked Joe, who was getting ready for his
acts.
</p>
<p>
"Because in every other case the swindlers have
worked their game where there was a big plant
engaging many men of what you might call rough
and ready character&mdash;ready to take a chance on
scalped admission tickets, and rough enough to fight
if they were discovered. So I'm going to be on the
watch."
</p>
<p>
"It's just as well to be," decided Joe. He turned
back into the tent which was his combined dressing
room and a storage place for his various smaller
bits of apparatus and the chemicals he used in his
fire act.
</p>
<p>
Before giving his last act Joe always washed his
hands and face and rinsed his mouth out with a
chemical preparation that would, for a time, resist
the action of fire. It was a secret compound, rather
difficult to handle and make, and Joe had taught
Ted Brown how to do it.
</p>
<p>
The young fellow was handing Joe this mixture,
some of which was also used by all who took part
in the blazing banquet scene, when the flap of the
tent was suddenly pushed aside and Harry Loper
entered.
</p>
<p>
"Stop!" he cried, raising a restraining hand.
"Don't use that solution, Mr. Strong! It's doped!
Don't use it!"
</p>
<p>
Joe, who had been about to apply some of the
stuff to his hands, turned in surprise. He was
alarmed at the strange look on the face of the youth
who acted as his helper in the high wire and in
some of the trapeze acts.
</p>
<p>
"Don't use that stuff!" cried Harry. "It's doped!"
and then he sank down on a chair and, burying his
face in his hands, burst into tears.

<h3>
A STRANGE SUMMONS
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Joe Strong looked from the sobbing Harry
Loper to the amazed Ted Brown. The latter's face
showed his great surprise. For an instant Joe had
an ugly suspicion that his new assistant had played
him false&mdash;that, because of jealousy or from some
other motive, he had mixed the chemicals in some
way to make them ineffective. This would spoil
the illusion, or it might even cause injury.
</p>
<p>
"Look here, Harry! what's the matter?" cried Joe,
purposely using a rough voice, so as to stop, if possible,
the display of emotion on the part of the youth.
"Act like a man, can't you! If you've done some
mean trick tell me about it. What do you mean
when you say this mixture is doped?"
</p>
<p>
"Just that!" exclaimed Harry, looking up with
haggard face. "I can't stand it any longer. I promised
not to tell, but I've got to. I&mdash;I can't see any
harm come to you."
</p>
<p>
"Harm!" cried Joe. "Do you mean this is poison?"
</p>
<p>
"No, not that. He said it wouldn't do you any
harm&mdash;that it would only make the act turn out
wrong&mdash;that you, nor anybody, would not be hurt.
But I don't believe him. I believe he wants to
harm you, and I'm going to tell all I know. I can't
stand it any longer."
</p>
<p>
"Look here, Harry!" said Joe sternly, "are you
perfectly sober? Do you know what you're saying?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I know that, all right, Mr. Strong," whined
the lad. "I won't say I haven't been drinking, for
I have. I did it to try to forget, but it wouldn't
work. I'm plenty sober enough to know what I'm
saying."
</p>
<p>
"And you tell me this chemical preparation will
work harm to me and those who help me in the fire
acts?"
</p>
<p>
"I don't know as to that, Mr. Strong. He told
me that it wouldn't harm you. But I don't believe
him! I won't trust him any more."
</p>
<p>
"Who do you mean?" asked Joe. "Do you know
anything about this?" he demanded sternly of Ted
Brown. "You prepared this mixture, didn't you?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, Mr. Strong, I did. I made it just the way
you told me. If you think&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"No, he doesn't know anything about it," murmured
Harry, who seemed to have recovered some
of his composure, now that the worst of his confession
was over. "He didn't have a hand in it. I'm
to blame. If I hadn't let him into your tent he
couldn't have doped the stuff. Oh, I'm sorry! I
was a fool to believe him, but he promised me a lot
of money just to keep still, and I've done it up to
now. But I'm through with him!"
</p>
<p>
"Look here!" cried Joe. "How long has this
been going on? Was this mixture ever doped, as
you call it, before?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no, not that I know," was the answer. Joe
knew this much, at least, was true. The mixture
had always worked perfectly before, and if it had
been tampered with that would not have been the
case.
</p>
<p>
"Then what do you mean?" cried the young magician.
"Speak up, can't you? Be a man! If you
haven't done anything really wrong you won't be
punished. I'm after the person back of you. Speak
up! Who is he?"
</p>
<p>
He realized that Harry Loper was but a weak
tool in the hands of some one else, and many things
that had seemed strange came back to Joe with a
sudden rush now. He might be able to learn who
it was that had such enmity against him and the
circus.
</p>
<p>
"Are you going to tell me?" demanded Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Yes! Yes! I'll tell you everything!" was the
answer. "I can't stand it any longer. I can't eat
in comfort any more, and I can't sleep! First he
promised to pay me for letting him come to your tent
when you were out. Then he threatened to kill me
if I told. But I'm going to tell. I don't care what
he does!"
</p>
<p>
"But if this is the first time my chemical mixture
has been doped, what do you mean about 'him,'
whoever he is, coming to my tent at other times?"
asked Joe. "What other times were they?"
</p>
<p>
"Don't you remember when the bottle of acid was
found?" asked the abashed youth.
</p>
<p>
"Yes! Was that some of your doings too?" cried
Joe hotly.
</p>
<p>
"No, I didn't do it. He did. But I&mdash;I looked the
other way when he did it. And then there was the
time when the trapeze wire broke. It was acid that
did that. He put it on."
</p>
<p>
"Who is this mysterious person you call 'he' all
the while?" asked Joe. "I want to get after him."
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you!" promised Harry. "But you'll protect
me, won't you, Mr. Strong?"
</p>
<p>
"As far as I can with decency, yes. Now tell
me!"
</p>
<p>
But there came another interruption. A man
thrust his head into the tent and exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Tracy wants to know if you can advance
the fire scenes about ten minutes, Mr. Strong. One
of the men acrobats has sprained his wrist and
they've got to cut out his act. Can you go on ten
minutes sooner than usual?"
</p>
<p>
"Guess I'll have to," said Joe. "Quick, Ted, make
up some new solution. I'll help you. As for you,
Harry, you stay right here. I'll talk to you later.
Haven't time now. And I'm going to have some one
stay with you, to make sure you don't weaken and
run away. It is as much for your own sake as
mine. If you've decided to leave the man who got
you to help in this work I'll stand by you. But I
want to be sure your repentance is genuine. So
stay right here, and we'll talk about this later. Don't
say anything outside," he cautioned Ted.
</p>
<p>
"I won't," was the answer. "Say, I hope you
don't think I had any hand in this?"
</p>
<p>
"No," Joe answered, "I don't. I'm trusting you&mdash;that's
my best evidence."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you," said the young fellow, and he
breathed a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
Quick work was needed on the part of Joe and his
new helper to get ready for the act. New chemicals
had to be mixed, to render it safe to handle
fire. This was in the acts where Joe seemed to swallow
flames and where he and the others "dined" on
blazing food.
</p>
<p>
In the other acts, where Joe juggled on the slack
wire with the flaming torches, where he slid down
the wire through the blazing hoops, and where he
jumped into the tank of water with his garments apparently
in flames, no change was needed. In these
feats Joe's costume was fireproofed, and, as they
had been treated some time before, he knew there
was only a remote possibility that they had been
tampered with.
</p>
<p>
Still he was taking no chances, and while he was
waiting for Ted to complete the mixing of the fire-resisting
chemical mixture, Joe tested his garments
with a blazing bit of paper. They did not catch
fire, which assured him of safety during his sensational
acts.
</p>
<p>
"How about you, Joe?" asked Jim Tracy, thrusting
his head into the tent a little later. "Are you
going to be able to make it?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, sure. I'll be there!"
</p>
<p>
"Sorry to have to make the change," went on the
ringmaster. "But Baraldi is hurt, and his act had
to be cut out completely. So I had to move you up."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, that's all right," Joe assured him.
</p>
<p>
"Hello, what are you doing here&mdash;and what's the
matter with you?" cried Jim, seeing Harry Loper
sitting dejectedly in a chair. "Why aren't you out
fixing the trapezes? You know Mr. Strong goes
on them soon."
</p>
<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;he told me to stay here," Loper stammered,
indicating Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," supplemented Joe Strong, "there's something
doing, Jim. I'll tell you later. I want some
one to stay in here with Harry. Some one we can
trust," he added significantly.
</p>
<p>
"I'll send Paddy Flynn," promised the ringmaster.
As he went out he looked curiously at Harry.
</p>
<p>
"How's the stuff coming on, Ted?" asked Joe,
when the doctored mixture had been thrown away
and new made.
</p>
<p>
"All right, I guess. I'll try it."
</p>
<p>
He put some on one finger, thrust the member
into the flame of a candle, and held it there longer
than usual.
</p>
<p>
"Look out!" Joe warned him. "You can't be too
familiar with fire."
</p>
<p>
"The stuff's all right," was the answer. "It's
better than the last we used."
</p>
<p>
"Good! Well, let's get busy!"
</p>
<p>
In spite of the strain of what he had gone
through in listening to the partial confession of
Harry Loper, Joe did some of his best work in the
fire acts that day. The blazing banquet was most
effective.
</p>
<p>
Having changed to his costume for his magical
box and other tricks, and learning that Harry was
still safe under the watchful eye of Paddy Flynn,
Joe hurried out to his stage, where Mr. Tracy was
already making the ten thousand dollar offer.
</p>
<p>
As Joe hurried across the arena one of the tent
men thrust into his hand a scrap of paper.
</p>
<p>
"What is it?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"I don't know," was the reply. "A boy just
brought it and told me to give it to you."
</p>
<p>
Joe had a half minute to wait while the ringmaster
was talking. Quickly he read the note&mdash;it was
really a scrawl. But it said:
</p>
<p>
"Please forgive me and still believe in me. I am
suffering! I can't come to you in the condition I'm
in now. But I have something to tell you if you
could come to me. The boy will bring you."
</p>
<p>
The note was signed "Hamilton Logan."
</p>
<p>
"Whew!" whistled Joe. "Worse and more of it!"
</p>

<h3>
THE TRAP IS SET
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Pausing only long enough to tell the man who
had given him the note to be sure and detain the
boy who had brought it, Joe Strong hurried over
to the stage to begin his box trick. That was to be
followed by the "disappearing lady" act.
</p>
<p>
And here again Joe had to use all his reserve
nerve to enable him to go on with the performance
as smoothly as he usually did. He had to dismiss
from his mind, for the time being, all thoughts of
Ham Logan, and he steeled himself not to think of
what the strange summons might mean.
</p>
<p>
"If Ham is in trouble I'm going to help him&mdash;that's
all!" declared Joe.
</p>
<p>
Following the usual announcement by Jim Tracy,
Joe got into the box. It was locked and roped and
then Helen took her place, as did the fireman with
his gleaming ax.
</p>
<p>
Joe worked unusually quickly that night in getting
out of the box. He knew this haste would not
spoil the illusion of the trick. In fact it really
heightened it. For he was out of the heavy box
in much shorter time than it had taken the volunteer
committee to lock him in.
</p>
<p>
And Joe was glad no one came forward at this
performance to claim the ten thousand dollars. That
would have taken up time, and time, just then, was
what Joe wanted most.
</p>
<p>
"Evidently none of you know how the trick is
done," commented the ringmaster, when his offer of
ten thousand dollars was not taken advantage of.
"We will now proceed to the next illusion, that of
causing a beautiful lady to disappear and vanish
into thin air before your very eyes. There is no
reward offered for the solution of this mystery."
</p>
<p>
Helen then took her place on the trick chair over
the trap in the stage. The silk shawl was placed
over her, and, in due time, the chair was shown
empty.
</p>
<p>
The usual applause followed and Joe was glad
his acts were over for the time. Bowing to acknowledge
the fervor of the audience, Joe started
toward his dressing apartment.
</p>
<p>
"I want to see you as soon as I can," he quickly
told Helen. "But I have to go away. It's about
Ham," he added. "I've heard from him."
</p>
<p>
"Where is he?"
</p>
<p>
"I don't know. Just a scrawled note. The messenger
who brought it is going to take me to him."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Joe, I'm so glad you've heard from him. I
liked him."
</p>
<p>
"I did too. I hope I can continue to like him.
But I'm afraid, from the tone of his note, that he's
broken his pledge. However, we can't expect too
much. Don't go away for an hour or so. I'll be
back as soon as I can and I'll tell you all about it."
</p>
<p>
"I'll wait for you," promised Helen.
</p>
<p>
As Joe hurried across the arena he saw the tent
man who had given him the note.
</p>
<p>
"Where's the boy?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"I took him to your tent. Paddy Flynn is there
and Loper. Is anything the matter, Mr. Strong?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, nothing that can't be made right, I hope."
</p>
<p>
Joe found a red-haired boy sitting on the edge
of a folding chair in the dressing tent. The lad was
looking wonderingly about the place.
</p>
<p>
"Did you bring this note?" asked Joe, showing
the crumpled paper.
</p>
<p>
"Sure I did! And say, I wish I could see the
show!"
</p>
<p>
"You can to-night after you take me to Mr. Logan,"
replied Joe. "You know where he is, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
"Sure I do! Didn't he give me the note to bring
youse?"
</p>
<p>
"Where is he?"
</p>
<p>
"Down in Kelly's joint. I live next door."
</p>
<p>
"What is Kelly's joint?"
</p>
<p>
"A saloon," answered the red-haired boy. "De
name on de winders is caf&eacute;, but they don't
pronounce it that way&mdash;anyhow some of 'em don't. It
oughter be cave I guess. It sure is a joint!"
</p>
<p>
"Is Mr. Logan there?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Sure he is. Upstairs in one of de rooms. He's
been on a terrible spree he said, but he's sober now
and sick&mdash;gee, mister, but he sure was sick. Me
mudder helped take care of him."
</p>
<p>
"I'm glad of that," said Joe. "We'll go to him
at once. Where is Kelly's&mdash;er&mdash;caf&eacute;?"
</p>
<p>
"Down by de river near de shipyards," answered
the red-haired lad.
</p>
<p>
For an instant Joe hesitated, but only for an instant.
The district named, as he well knew, was a
bad one. It was also dangerous.
</p>
<p>
But it was still afternoon, though growing late.
It would not be dark for some time, however, and
Joe felt that he would be safe enough in going
alone. At night he would have taken some one
with him.
</p>
<p>
But there were two reasons why he did not want
to do this now. One was that no one whom he felt
he could trust to be discreet could be taken away
from the circus, which was not yet over, though
Joe's acts were finished. Another reason was that
he did not want the possible degradation of Logan
seen by any of his former associates. Possibly he
might come back to the show, and he would always
have a feeling of shame if he knew that those with
whom he worked had seen him recovering from a
"spree," as the red-haired lad called it.
</p>
<p>
"I've got to go away," said Joe to Paddy Flynn.
Joe and the lad had talked at one side of the tent
and in low tones, so the young circus man knew
their voices had not been overheard by Paddy and
the man he was guarding, Harry Loper. "I'll be
back as soon as I can," went on the young fire-eater.
"Meanwhile you stay here, Loper. Paddy will
take care of you, and when I come back I'll have a
talk with you."
</p>
<p>
"All right," assented the other wearily. "I feel
better now I've told you."
</p>
<p>
Joe and Micky Donlon, which the red-haired boy
said was his name, though probably Michael was
what he had been christened, were soon on their
way toward the river and the location of one of the
shipyards.
</p>
<p>
"Are youse sure I can see de show to-night?"
asked Micky eagerly, as they walked along.
</p>
<p>
"Positive," said Joe. "Here's a reserved seat
ticket now. Two, in fact, in case you want to take
some one."
</p>
<p>
"I'll take me mudder," declared the lad. "I got
a girl, but she's goin' wit another feller. He bought
two tickets, but dey wasn't reserved seats. I didn't
have the dough&mdash;dat's why she shook me, I guess.
But when I flash dese on her&mdash;say, maybe she won't
want to shine up at me again! But nothin' doin'!
I'll take me mudder. She needs a change after
waitin' on dat guy what's been on a spree."
</p>
<p>
"How long has Mr. Logan been ill?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, he's been in Kelly's joint for a week."
</p>
<p>
"He must have been waiting for the circus to arrive,"
thought Joe. "He knew we were booked for
here. Poor fellow!"
</p>
<p>
Joe was glad it was still light when he entered
the district where Kelly's caf&eacute;, or saloon, to be
more exact, was situated. For the place was most
disreputable in appearance, and the character of men
loitering about it would have made it a place to stay
away from after dark.
</p>
<p>
Suspicious eyes looked at Joe as he entered the
place with his young guide.
</p>
<p>
"He's come to see de sick guy," Micky explained
to the bartender.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I hope he's come to pay what's owin'," was
the surly comment.
</p>
<p>
"I'll settle any bills that Mr. Logan may owe for
board or lodging," said Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Board! He don't owe much for <i>board</i>!" sneered
the barkeeper. "He hasn't eaten enough to keep a
fly alive. But he does owe for his room."
</p>
<p>
"I'll pay that," offered Joe. Then he was guided
upstairs to a squalid room.
</p>
<p>
"Come in!" called a weak voice, and Joe, pushing
back the door, saw, lying on a tumbled bed, the
form of the old fire-eater. It was a great change
Ham Logan was in even worse condition than when
he had applied to Joe for work. He was utterly disreputable.
But in spite of that there was something
about his face and eyes that gave Joe hope. The
man was sober&mdash;that was one thing.
</p>
<p>
As Joe looked at him, Ham turned his face away.
</p>
<p>
"I&mdash;I'm ashamed to have you see me," he murmured.
"I fought it off as long as I could, but I just
had to see you. 'Tisn't for my own sake!" he
added quickly. "I know you're through with me.
But it's for your own&mdash;and the good of the show.
I've got something to tell you, and, when I've done
that, you can go away again and forget me. That's
all I'm fit for&mdash;to be forgotten!"
</p>
<p>
A dry sob shook his emaciated frame.
</p>
<p>
"Son, here's a quarter," said Joe to the red-haired
Micky. "You go out and get yourself an ice-cream
soda and come back in half an hour."
</p>
<p>
And after he had thus delicately removed a witness
to the sad scene Joe closed the door, and, going
over to the bed, held out both his hands to the man.
</p>
<p>
And then tears&mdash;tears to which he had long been
stranger&mdash;coursed down the sunken cheeks of
Hamilton Logan.
</p>
<p>
Just what Joe said to the man whom he had befriended
and who had gone back to his old ways and
what Ham Logan said to his young benefactor will
never be known. Neither would tell, and no one else
knew. As a matter of fact, it did not matter. Afterward,
though, following some sensational happenings
which did become known, Joe told his closest
friends enough of Ham's story to make clear the
trend of events.
</p>
<p>
Punctually on the time agreed, Micky Donlon was
back at his post. Joe was coming out of the room.
</p>
<p>
"Are you engaged for the rest of the day?" asked
the young circus performer of his guide.
</p>
<p>
"Engaged?"
</p>
<p>
"I mean have you anything to do?"
</p>
<p>
"Not so's you could notice! Me mudder's goin'
to dress up to see de show, but me&mdash;I'm all ready!"
</p>
<p>
"Good! Then you can help me. I'll pay you for
your time. Can we get an automobile in this part
of the city?"
</p>
<p>
"Gee, no, mister! Dere's jitney buses about two
blocks up, though."
</p>
<p>
"Well, perhaps they'll do for a time. I've got
a lot to do, and you can help me."
</p>
<p>
"I sure will, mister!" cried Micky. "Are youse
in de circus&mdash;I mean does youse ride a horse or
jump over de elephants?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, something like that&mdash;yes," answered Joe
with a smile. "You'll see to-night if you come."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I'll be dere! Don't forgit dat!"
</p>
<p>
Joe and his guide took a jitney to the nearest public
hack stand, where a number of automobiles were
waiting, and Joe entered one of these with Micky.
</p>
<p>
"Gee, if me girl could see me <i>now</i>!" murmured
the red-haired lad, as he sank back in the deep seat.
</p>
<p>
Joe was too preoccupied to more than smile at
the lad. There was much that remained to be done.
The circus was to remain in this city two days more,
over Saturday night, in fact, leaving on Sunday for
a distant city.
</p>
<p>
"There's time enough to trap them!" mused Joe.
"Time enough to trap them!"
</p>
<p>
And, getting back to the show lot, he dismissed
the automobile, and, taking Micky with him, sought
out Jim Tracy, Mr. Moyne, and some of the other
circus executives.
</p>
<p>
And then the trap was set.

<h3>
A BLAZE OF GLORY
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"Well," remarked Joe, after having talked rapidly
and said considerable to his friends, "what do
you think of my news?"
</p>
<p>
"Great!" declared the ringmaster. "I didn't think
things would take just that turn, but after Loper's
confession and what Ham told you, I believe it all.
That scoundrel ought to be sent away for life."
</p>
<p>
"He'll go for a long time if I have anything to
say," declared the treasurer. "Did you know we
spotted more bogus tickets to-day?" he asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
"Well, we did. I found it out just after you left.
There were only a few. The rush will come to-night."
</p>
<p>
"Unless we stop it," put in Jim Tracy.
</p>
<p>
"We'll stop it!" decided Joe. "That's why I
wanted to get things started in a hurry. The trap
is all ready to spring. The detectives will be here
at eight o'clock, just when the rush is at its height
at the ticket wagon."
</p>
<p>
"Are you going to bring Ham back?" asked Jim,
when the conference was over.
</p>
<p>
"I certainly am," was the answer. "I think he's
been on his last spree. And he wouldn't have gone
on this one only that he was tempted by some person.
Put this tempter out of the way, and it will
mean Ham's safety. Now we've got to work."
</p>
<p>
There was an exceedingly busy time at the circus
from then on, and very little of it concerned the
show itself. The performance was delayed half an
hour that night to enable the trap to be sprung.
</p>
<p>
Joe and Jim Tracy met a certain train that came
in from a large city, and saw alight from it two
quiet, unassuming men.
</p>
<p>
"There they are," said Joe. "Now things will
move!" And he and the ringmaster were soon in
conversation with the two new arrivals.
</p>
<p>
A little later the four entered Joe's dressing tent
at the circus grounds. And some time after that
four men, whose faces were black from the smudge
of machine oil and grease and whose clothes carried
like marks, left Joe's quarters.
</p>
<p>
"Down near the shipyards when the last of the
day shift comes off will be the time and place," said
one of the four smudge-faced men.
</p>
<p>
"Right!" declared another.
</p>
<p>
From the big shipyard poured hundreds of men.
As they began to emerge from the gate the four
soiled-faced individuals who had come from Joe's
dressing tent mingled with them. They heard some
one ask:
</p>
<p>
"Are you sure the tickets'll be good?"
</p>
<p>
"Sure," was the answer. "This fellow and his
pal are part of the show. He sells 'em this way so
there won't be such a crowd at the wagon, and
that's why he makes such a big discount. It sort of
guarantees a pretty big crowd, too. Oh, the tickets
are good, all right. There's the ticket guy now."
</p>
<p>
The crowd of men turned down a side street,
and the four smutty-countenanced men went with
them. One of the four said:
</p>
<p>
"Wait till he sells a few tickets and then nab
him."
</p>
<p>
"There's two of 'em," said another voice.
</p>
<p>
"Nab 'em both! They work together."
</p>
<p>
Soon the men from the shipyard surrounded the
two men, one of whom had been designated by the
sentence: "There's the ticket guy now."
</p>
<p>
Money began to change hands, and tickets were
passed around. The four men who had kept together
shoved their way through the crowd of ship
workers.
</p>
<p>
"How much are the tickets?" one asked.
</p>
<p>
"Thirty-five cents," was the answer. "They'll
cost you fifty or seventy-five at the wagon. The
only reason we sell 'em this way is to avoid the
rush. Then, too, you're really buying 'em at wholesale."
</p>
<p>
"I'll take four," said the man of the quartette.
</p>
<p>
"Here you are! Four."
</p>
<p>
There was another clink of money and a rustle
of slips of paper. Then the man who had passed
over the tickets, said:
</p>
<p>
"Here's your change. That was a five you gave
me, wasn't it? Take your change."
</p>
<p>
"And you take yours, Bill Carfax!" suddenly
cried one of the four. "It's quite a sudden change,
too!"
</p>
<p>
There was a flash of something bright, a metallic
click&mdash;two of them, in fact&mdash;and the ticket seller
tried to break away. But he was held by the handcuffs
on his wrists, one of the four grasping them
by the connecting chain.
</p>
<p>
"Get the other!" cried a sharp voice.
</p>
<p>
There was a scuffle, another flash of something
bright, two more clicks, and one of the four cried:
</p>
<p>
"That'll be about all from you, Jed Lewis, <i>alias</i>
Inky Jed."
</p>
<p>
The two handcuffed men seemed to know that the
game was up. They shrugged their shoulders,
looked at each other, and grew quiet suddenly. The
set trap had been successfully sprung.
</p>
<p>
"Hey! what's the big idea?"
</p>
<p>
"What's it all about?"
</p>
<p>
"Don't we get our tickets?"
</p>
<p>
Thus cried the men from the shipyards.
</p>
<p>
"You don't want these tickets," said Joe Strong,
for as Bill Carfax looked more closely at one of
the four he recognized him as the young circus man.
"You don't want any tickets these men could sell
you."
</p>
<p>
"Why not?" demanded a man who had bought
one.
</p>
<p>
"Because they're counterfeit," was Joe's answer.
"This man, Bill Carfax," and he nodded toward the
one first handcuffed, "used to work with the Sampson
show. He was discharged&mdash;ask him to tell you
why&mdash;and soon after that we began to be cheated
by the use of counterfeit tickets. We have been trying
ever since to find out who sold them, and now
we have."
</p>
<p>
"You think you have!" sneered the man who had
been called "Inky Jed."
</p>
<p>
"We know it," said Joe decidedly. "Ham Logan
overheard your plans discussed, and he's told everything."
</p>
<p>
"Oh!" exclaimed Bill Carfax, and there was a
world of meaning in that simple interjection.
</p>
<p>
"And who might you guys be?" asked one of the
shipyard men.
</p>
<p>
"I'm one of the circus owners," said Joe quietly,
"and this is the ringmaster," he went on, indicating
Jim Tracy. "These other two gentlemen are detectives
who have been working on the case since
we discovered the counterfeits. We disguised
ourselves in this way in order to trap these two," and
he pointed to the handcuffed men.
</p>
<p>
The ship workers nodded. One of them asked:
</p>
<p>
"And aren't they with your show, and can't they
sell tickets at reduced prices?"
</p>
<p>
"Never!" exclaimed Joe. "You might get in on
the tickets you bought from them, but it would be
illegally. The counterfeits are clever ones," he said,
holding up four he had bought for evidence. "But
we can detect the difference by means of the serial
numbers. And now, if you men really want to see
the show, go up to the lot and get your tickets from
the wagon, or buy them at one of the authorized
agencies."
</p>
<p>
There were many questions fired at Joe and his
friends by the shipyard men, but they had time to
answer only a few.
</p>
<p>
"We've got to get back to the performance," said
Joe to the detectives. "You can take them with
you," and he nodded toward Bill Carfax and his
crony. "Jim and I will see you later."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, we'll take them with us all right!" laughed
one of the detectives. "Move lively, boys!" he added
to the two prisoners. "The jig is up!"
</p>
<p>
And the two counterfeiters seemed to know it.
</p>
<p>
"What does it all mean?" asked Helen of Joe,
when he got back a little before the time to go on
with his acts. He had washed his face and changed
to his circus costume. The two prisoners had been
locked up.
</p>
<p>
"Well, it means we killed two birds with one
stone," said Joe. "We got rid of the men who have
been making us lose money my means of the counterfeit
tickets, and we have also under lock and
key Bill Carfax, who tried several times to injure
me, or at least to spoil my act, by means of acid on
the trapeze rope and by changing the fireproof
mixture."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I'm so glad!" cried Helen. "Then you were
in danger?"
</p>
<p>
"I suppose so&mdash;danger of injury, perhaps, but
hardly death. I think Carfax, desperate as he was,
would stop at that."
</p>
<p>
"How did you find out about him and the other
man?"
</p>
<p>
"I'll just have time to tell you before my first
act," said Joe. "It was Harry Loper who gave me
the first idea. When he broke down it was because
of what he had done, and on account of what Bill
Carfax wanted him to do again. It was Bill who
got into the tent once and put acid on my trapeze
wire. And it was because he bribed poor Loper
that he was able to do it. Bill pretended it was only
a trick to make me slip, because he wanted to get
even with me for discharging him. So poor, weak
Harry let him sneak into the tent, disguised so none
of our men would know him. Bill climbed up, put
acid on the wire, and the fiery stuff did the rest.
</p>
<p>
"Well, that preyed on Harry's mind, but he kept
putting it away. But finally, knowing the hold he
had on him, Bill came back and gave him a bottle
of acid to work some further harm to me or my
apparatus. But Ham discovered that in time.
</p>
<p>
"Bill was provoked over his failure, and, when
he wasn't helping Inky Jed get out the bogus tickets,
he followed the show and tried to prevail on Harry
to play another trick on me. Just what it was
Harry doesn't know. He refused to do it, and then
he came and confessed to me. So much for Harry.
He's a sorry boy, and I think he'll turn over a new
leaf.
</p>
<p>
"Now about Ham. Just as I feared, he got to
drinking again. But it was because Bill met him
when poor Ham's nerves were on edge, and Bill
induced him to take liquor. Then Ham went all to
pieces and started on a spree which lasted until
now. He managed to get from place to place, always
under Bill's eye, and at last he landed here,
very weak and ill. Mrs. Donlon looked after him.
</p>
<p>
"And it was here that Ham first heard Bill and
his crony plotting about the bogus circus tickets.
The two counterfeiters planned to make a big strike
here with the shipyard workers. Then Ham sent
the warning to me. I called on him, learned the
plans of Bill and Jed, and we sent for the detectives.
The latter, we learned, were about to make
an arrest anyhow, but it was of the men who really
printed the bogus tickets. They hadn't a clew, as
yet, to Bill and Jed, who were the real backers of
the game. The detectives came on, disguised themselves
with us, and we caught the scoundrels in the
very act. Now they're locked up."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Joe, it's wonderful!" exclaimed Helen. "I'm
so glad it's all over. And are you going to bring
Ham back to the show?"
</p>
<p>
"Just as soon as he's able to travel. Micky Donlon
wants to join too, and I may give him a chance
later. Well, our troubles seem to be over for a
time, but I suppose there'll be more."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, look on the bright side!" exclaimed Helen.
"Why be a fire-eater if you can't look on the bright
side?" she laughed.
</p>
<p>
"That's so," agreed her admirer. "Well, I've got
to get ready to eat some fire right now."
</p>
<p>
As Joe had said, everything was cleared up. Bill
Carfax was at the bottom of most of the personal
troubles of the young circus man, and his acts were
actuated by a desire for vengeance. As to the ticket
trick, Bill was only a sort of agent in that. Jed
Lewis, alias Inky Jed, was an expert counterfeiter.
He had already served time in prison for trying to
make counterfeit money, and when he fell in with
Bill, and heard the latter tell of some of his circus
experiences, the more skillful scoundrel became
impressed with the chance of making money by selling
spurious tickets.
</p>
<p>
They had some printed and worked the scheme
among crowds of men coming from factories, just
as they were doing when they were caught.
</p>
<p>
As Ham told Joe, the old fire-eater had overheard
the plots and saw his chance to do Joe a favor.
Carfax, it was surmised, hoped to get Ham
Logan under his influence through drink, so that he
might use him in order to injure Joe, after having
failed with Harry Loper.
</p>
<p>
It developed, afterward, that the paper mills had,
innocently enough, furnished the swindlers with the
paper for the counterfeit tickets. The material was
secured through a trick, and Inky Jed knew an unscrupulous
printer who did the work for him.
</p>
<p>
It was Bill Carfax who had sent the man who
so nearly exposed Joe's box trick. But fortune was
with the young circus man.
</p>
<p>
The music played, the horses trotted about,
clowns made laughter, and Helen performed graceful
feats on Rosebud. Joe did some magical tricks,
walked the wire, slid down on his head, and then
prepared for the blazing banquet.
</p>
<p>
In order to show what he could do, Ted Brown
had introduced some novelties. After Joe and the
guests had devoured the blazing food there was a
pause, and then, suddenly, from the center of the
table spouts of red fire burst out, so that the banquet
ended in a blaze of glory. Joe's new helper had
used some fireworks effectively.
</p>
<p>
In due time Bill and his crony were tried, convicted,
and sent away to prison for long terms.
Harry Loper changed his rather loose and weak
ways and became one of Joe's best friends. Ted
Brown was continued as an "assistant assistant," for
in a few weeks Ham Logan was able to rejoin the
show, and he again became Joe's chief helper.
</p>
<p>
"Well, what are you going to spring next on the
unsuspecting public as a sensation?" asked Helen,
when the show had reached a city where two days
were to be spent. "Have you other acts as good a
the fire-eating?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, perhaps I can think up some," was the
answer.
</p>
<p>
And so, with Joe Strong thinking what the future
might hold for him and the circus, we will take our
leave for a time.
</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
