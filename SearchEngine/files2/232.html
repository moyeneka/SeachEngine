<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap01"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>
The one opened the door with a latch-key and went in, followed by a young
fellow who awkwardly removed his cap. He wore rough clothes that smacked of the
sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in which he found
himself. He did not know what to do with his cap, and was stuffing it into his
coat pocket when the other took it from him. The act was done quietly and
naturally, and the awkward young fellow appreciated it. &ldquo;He
understands,&rdquo; was his thought. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see me through all
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked at the other&rsquo;s heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his
legs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and sinking
down to the heave and lunge of the sea. The wide rooms seemed too narrow for
his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders
should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric-a-brac from the low mantel.
He recoiled from side to side between the various objects and multiplied the
hazards that in reality lodged only in his mind. Between a grand piano and a
centre-table piled high with books was space for a half a dozen to walk
abreast, yet he essayed it with trepidation. His heavy arms hung loosely at his
sides. He did not know what to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his
excited vision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table,
he lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano stool. He
watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for the first time
realized that his walk was different from that of other men. He experienced a
momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly. The sweat burst
through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads, and he paused and mopped his
bronzed face with his handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on, Arthur, my boy,&rdquo; he said, attempting to mask his anxiety
with facetious utterance. &ldquo;This is too much all at once for yours truly.
Give me a chance to get my nerve. You know I didn&rsquo;t want to come,
an&rsquo; I guess your fam&rsquo;ly ain&rsquo;t hankerin&rsquo; to see me
neither.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; was the reassuring answer. &ldquo;You
mustn&rsquo;t be frightened at us. We&rsquo;re just homely people&mdash;Hello,
there&rsquo;s a letter for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stepped back to the table, tore open the envelope, and began to read, giving
the stranger an opportunity to recover himself. And the stranger understood and
appreciated. His was the gift of sympathy, understanding; and beneath his
alarmed exterior that sympathetic process went on. He mopped his forehead dry
and glanced about him with a controlled face, though in the eyes there was an
expression such as wild animals betray when they fear the trap. He was
surrounded by the unknown, apprehensive of what might happen, ignorant of what
he should do, aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly, fearful that
every attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted. He was keenly
sensitive, hopelessly self-conscious, and the amused glance that the other
stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him like a
dagger-thrust. He saw the glance, but he gave no sign, for among the things he
had learned was discipline. Also, that dagger-thrust went to his pride. He
cursed himself for having come, and at the same time resolved that, happen what
would, having come, he would carry it through. The lines of his face hardened,
and into his eyes came a fighting light. He looked about more unconcernedly,
sharply observant, every detail of the pretty interior registering itself on
his brain. His eyes were wide apart; nothing in their field of vision escaped;
and as they drank in the beauty before them the fighting light died out and a
warm glow took its place. He was responsive to beauty, and here was cause to
respond.
</p>

<p>
An oil painting caught and held him. A heavy surf thundered and burst over an
outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and, outside the line
of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over till every detail of her
deck was visible, was surging along against a stormy sunset sky. There was
beauty, and it drew him irresistibly. He forgot his awkward walk and came
closer to the painting, very close. The beauty faded out of the canvas. His
face expressed his bepuzzlement. He stared at what seemed a careless daub of
paint, then stepped away. Immediately all the beauty flashed back into the
canvas. &ldquo;A trick picture,&rdquo; was his thought, as he dismissed it,
though in the midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found
time to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to
make a trick. He did not know painting. He had been brought up on chromos and
lithographs that were always definite and sharp, near or far. He had seen oil
paintings, it was true, in the show windows of shops, but the glass of the
windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too near.
</p>

<p>
He glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on the
table. Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as promptly as the
yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight of food. An impulsive
stride, with one lurch to right and left of the shoulders, brought him to the
table, where he began affectionately handling the books. He glanced at the
titles and the authors&rsquo; names, read fragments of text, caressing the
volumes with his eyes and hands, and, once, recognized a book he had read. For
the rest, they were strange books and strange authors. He chanced upon a volume
of Swinburne and began reading steadily, forgetful of where he was, his face
glowing. Twice he closed the book on his forefinger to look at the name of the
author. Swinburne! he would remember that name. That fellow had eyes, and he
had certainly seen color and flashing light. But who was Swinburne? Was he dead
a hundred years or so, like most of the poets? Or was he alive still, and
writing? He turned to the title-page . . . yes, he had written other books;
well, he would go to the free library the first thing in the morning and try to
get hold of some of Swinburne&rsquo;s stuff. He went back to the text and lost
himself. He did not notice that a young woman had entered the room. The first
he knew was when he heard Arthur&rsquo;s voice saying:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ruth, this is Mr. Eden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The book was closed on his forefinger, and before he turned he was thrilling to
the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but of her brother&rsquo;s
words. Under that muscled body of his he was a mass of quivering sensibilities.
At the slightest impact of the outside world upon his consciousness, his
thoughts, sympathies, and emotions leapt and played like lambent flame. He was
extraordinarily receptive and responsive, while his imagination, pitched high,
was ever at work establishing relations of likeness and difference. &ldquo;Mr.
Eden,&rdquo; was what he had thrilled to&mdash;he who had been called
&ldquo;Eden,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Martin Eden,&rdquo; or just &ldquo;Martin,&rdquo;
all his life. And &ldquo;<i>Mister</i>!&rdquo; It was certainly going some, was
his internal comment. His mind seemed to turn, on the instant, into a vast
camera obscura, and he saw arrayed around his consciousness endless pictures
from his life, of stoke-holes and forecastles, camps and beaches, jails and
boozing-kens, fever-hospitals and slum streets, wherein the thread of
association was the fashion in which he had been addressed in those various
situations.
</p>

<p>
And then he turned and saw the girl. The phantasmagoria of his brain vanished
at sight of her. She was a pale, ethereal creature, with wide, spiritual blue
eyes and a wealth of golden hair. He did not know how she was dressed, except
that the dress was as wonderful as she. He likened her to a pale gold flower
upon a slender stem. No, she was a spirit, a divinity, a goddess; such
sublimated beauty was not of the earth. Or perhaps the books were right, and
there were many such as she in the upper walks of life. She might well be sung
by that chap, Swinburne. Perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he
painted that girl, Iseult, in the book there on the table. All this plethora of
sight, and feeling, and thought occurred on the instant. There was no pause of
the realities wherein he moved. He saw her hand coming out to his, and she
looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands, frankly, like a man. The
women he had known did not shake hands that way. For that matter, most of them
did not shake hands at all. A flood of associations, visions of various ways he
had made the acquaintance of women, rushed into his mind and threatened to
swamp it. But he shook them aside and looked at her. Never had he seen such a
woman. The women he had known! Immediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged
the women he had known. For an eternal second he stood in the midst of a
portrait gallery, wherein she occupied the central place, while about her were
limned many women, all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance, herself
the unit of weight and measure. He saw the weak and sickly faces of the girls
of the factories, and the simpering, boisterous girls from the south of Market.
There were women of the cattle camps, and swarthy cigarette-smoking women of
Old Mexico. These, in turn, were crowded out by Japanese women, doll-like,
stepping mincingly on wooden clogs; by Eurasians, delicate featured, stamped
with degeneracy; by full-bodied South-Sea-Island women, flower-crowned and
brown-skinned. All these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare
brood&mdash;frowsy, shuffling creatures from the pavements of Whitechapel,
gin-bloated hags of the stews, and all the vast hell&rsquo;s following of
harpies, vile-mouthed and filthy, that under the guise of monstrous female form
prey upon sailors, the scrapings of the ports, the scum and slime of the human
pit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Mr. Eden?&rdquo; the girl was saying. &ldquo;I
have been looking forward to meeting you ever since Arthur told us. It was
brave of you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at all, what
he had done, and that any fellow would have done it. She noticed that the hand
he waved was covered with fresh abrasions, in the process of healing, and a
glance at the other loose-hanging hand showed it to be in the same condition.
Also, with quick, critical eye, she noted a scar on his cheek, another that
peeped out from under the hair of the forehead, and a third that ran down and
disappeared under the starched collar. She repressed a smile at sight of the
red line that marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck. He was
evidently unused to stiff collars. Likewise her feminine eye took in the
clothes he wore, the cheap and unaesthetic cut, the wrinkling of the coat
across the shoulders, and the series of wrinkles in the sleeves that advertised
bulging biceps muscles.
</p>

<p>
While he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all, he was
obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair. He found time to admire the
ease with which she sat down, then lurched toward a chair facing her,
overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was cutting. This was a
new experience for him. All his life, up to then, he had been unaware of being
either graceful or awkward. Such thoughts of self had never entered his mind.
He sat down gingerly on the edge of the chair, greatly worried by his hands.
They were in the way wherever he put them. Arthur was leaving the room, and
Martin Eden followed his exit with longing eyes. He felt lost, alone there in
the room with that pale spirit of a woman. There was no bar-keeper upon whom to
call for drinks, no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and
by means of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have such a scar on your neck, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; the girl was saying.
&ldquo;How did it happen? I am sure it must have been some adventure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Mexican with a knife, miss,&rdquo; he answered, moistening his parched
lips and clearing his throat. &ldquo;It was just a fight. After I got the knife
away, he tried to bite off my nose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Baldly as he had stated it, in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot, starry
night at Salina Cruz, the white strip of beach, the lights of the sugar
steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors in the distance, the
jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the Mexican&rsquo;s face, the glint
of the beast-eyes in the starlight, the sting of the steel in his neck, and the
rush of blood, the crowd and the cries, the two bodies, his and the
Mexican&rsquo;s, locked together, rolling over and over and tearing up the
sand, and from away off somewhere the mellow tinkling of a guitar. Such was the
picture, and he thrilled to the memory of it, wondering if the man could paint
it who had painted the pilot-schooner on the wall. The white beach, the stars,
and the lights of the sugar steamers would look great, he thought, and midway
on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters. The knife
occupied a place in the picture, he decided, and would show well, with a sort
of gleam, in the light of the stars. But of all this no hint had crept into his
speech. &ldquo;He tried to bite off my nose,&rdquo; he concluded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed the
shock in her sensitive face.
</p>

<p>
He felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on his
sunburned cheeks, though to him it burned as hotly as when his cheeks had been
exposed to the open furnace-door in the fire-room. Such sordid things as
stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for conversation with a lady.
People in the books, in her walk of life, did not talk about such
things&mdash;perhaps they did not know about them, either.
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get started.
Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek. Even as she asked, he
realized that she was making an effort to talk his talk, and he resolved to get
away from it and talk hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was just an accident,&rdquo; he said, putting his hand to his cheek.
&ldquo;One night, in a calm, with a heavy sea running, the main-boom-lift
carried away, an&rsquo; next the tackle. The lift was wire, an&rsquo; it was
threshin&rsquo; around like a snake. The whole watch was tryin&rsquo; to grab
it, an&rsquo; I rushed in an&rsquo; got swatted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, this time with an accent of comprehension, though
secretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was wondering what a
<i>lift</i> was and what <i>swatted</i> meant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This man Swineburne,&rdquo; he began, attempting to put his plan into
execution and pronouncing the <i>i</i> long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Swineburne,&rdquo; he repeated, with the same mispronunciation.
&ldquo;The poet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Swinburne,&rdquo; she corrected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the chap,&rdquo; he stammered, his cheeks hot again.
&ldquo;How long since he died?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t heard that he was dead.&rdquo; She looked at him
curiously. &ldquo;Where did you make his acquaintance?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never clapped eyes on him,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But I read
some of his poetry out of that book there on the table just before you come in.
How do you like his poetry?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he had
suggested. He felt better, and settled back slightly from the edge of the
chair, holding tightly to its arms with his hands, as if it might get away from
him and buck him to the floor. He had succeeded in making her talk her talk,
and while she rattled on, he strove to follow her, marvelling at all the
knowledge that was stowed away in that pretty head of hers, and drinking in the
pale beauty of her face. Follow her he did, though bothered by unfamiliar words
that fell glibly from her lips and by critical phrases and thought-processes
that were foreign to his mind, but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and
set it tingling. Here was intellectual life, he thought, and here was beauty,
warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be. He forgot himself and
stared at her with hungry eyes. Here was something to live for, to win to, to
fight for&mdash;ay, and die for. The books were true. There were such women in
the world. She was one of them. She lent wings to his imagination, and great,
luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed vague, gigantic
figures of love and romance, and of heroic deeds for woman&rsquo;s
sake&mdash;for a pale woman, a flower of gold. And through the swaying,
palpitant vision, as through a fairy mirage, he stared at the real woman,
sitting there and talking of literature and art. He listened as well, but he
stared, unconscious of the fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was
essentially masculine in his nature was shining in his eyes. But she, who knew
little of the world of men, being a woman, was keenly aware of his burning
eyes. She had never had men look at her in such fashion, and it embarrassed
her. She stumbled and halted in her utterance. The thread of argument slipped
from her. He frightened her, and at the same time it was strangely pleasant to
be so looked upon. Her training warned her of peril and of wrong, subtle,
mysterious, luring; while her instincts rang clarion-voiced through her being,
impelling her to hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another
world, to this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red
caused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat, who, all too evidently, was
soiled and tainted by ungracious existence. She was clean, and her cleanness
revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning to learn the paradox of
woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As I was saying&mdash;what was I saying?&rdquo; She broke off abruptly
and laughed merrily at her predicament.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You was saying that this man Swinburne failed bein&rsquo; a great poet
because&mdash;an&rsquo; that was as far as you got, miss,&rdquo; he prompted,
while to himself he seemed suddenly hungry, and delicious little thrills
crawled up and down his spine at the sound of her laughter. Like silver, he
thought to himself, like tinkling silver bells; and on the instant, and for an
instant, he was transported to a far land, where under pink cherry blossoms, he
smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the peaked pagoda calling
straw-sandalled devotees to worship.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Swinburne fails, when all is
said, because he is, well, indelicate. There are many of his poems that should
never be read. Every line of the really great poets is filled with beautiful
truth, and calls to all that is high and noble in the human. Not a line of the
great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by that much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was great,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly, &ldquo;the little I
read. I had no idea he was such a&mdash;a scoundrel. I guess that crops out in
his other books.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are many lines that could be spared from the book you were
reading,&rdquo; she said, her voice primly firm and dogmatic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must &rsquo;a&rsquo; missed &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;What I read was the real goods. It was all lighted up an&rsquo; shining,
an&rsquo; it shun right into me an&rsquo; lighted me up inside, like the sun or
a searchlight. That&rsquo;s the way it landed on me, but I guess I ain&rsquo;t
up much on poetry, miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He broke off lamely. He was confused, painfully conscious of his
inarticulateness. He had felt the bigness and glow of life in what he had read,
but his speech was inadequate. He could not express what he felt, and to
himself he likened himself to a sailor, in a strange ship, on a dark night,
groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging. Well, he decided, it was up to
him to get acquainted in this new world. He had never seen anything that he
couldn&rsquo;t get the hang of when he wanted to and it was about time for him
to want to learn to talk the things that were inside of him so that she could
understand. <i>She</i> was bulking large on his horizon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now Longfellow&mdash;&rdquo; she was saying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve read &rsquo;m,&rdquo; he broke in impulsively, spurred
on to exhibit and make the most of his little store of book knowledge, desirous
of showing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod. &ldquo;&lsquo;The Psalm of
Life,&rsquo; &lsquo;Excelsior,&rsquo; an&rsquo; . . . I guess that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head and smiled, and he felt, somehow, that her smile was
tolerant, pitifully tolerant. He was a fool to attempt to make a pretence that
way. That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me, miss, for buttin&rsquo; in that way. I guess the real facts
is that I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; much about such things. It ain&rsquo;t
in my class. But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to make it in my class.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It sounded like a threat. His voice was determined, his eyes were flashing, the
lines of his face had grown harsh. And to her it seemed that the angle of his
jaw had changed; its pitch had become unpleasantly aggressive. At the same time
a wave of intense virility seemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you could make it in&mdash;in your class,&rdquo; she finished
with a laugh. &ldquo;You are very strong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her gaze rested for a moment on the muscular neck, heavy corded, almost
bull-like, bronzed by the sun, spilling over with rugged health and strength.
And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt drawn to him. She
was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into her mind. It seemed to her
that if she could lay her two hands upon that neck that all its strength and
vigor would flow out to her. She was shocked by this thought. It seemed to
reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature. Besides, strength to her
was a gross and brutish thing. Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been
slender gracefulness. Yet the thought still persisted. It bewildered her that
she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck. In truth, she was
far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for strength. But she
did not know it. She knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this
one had, who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I ain&rsquo;t no invalid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When it comes down
to hard-pan, I can digest scrap-iron. But just now I&rsquo;ve got dyspepsia.
Most of what you was sayin&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t digest. Never trained that way,
you see. I like books and poetry, and what time I&rsquo;ve had I&rsquo;ve read
&rsquo;em, but I&rsquo;ve never thought about &rsquo;em the way you have.
That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t talk about &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;m like a navigator
adrift on a strange sea without chart or compass. Now I want to get my
bearin&rsquo;s. Mebbe you can put me right. How did you learn all this
you&rsquo;ve ben talkin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By going to school, I fancy, and by studying,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I went to school when I was a kid,&rdquo; he began to object.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but I mean high school, and lectures, and the university.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone to the university?&rdquo; he demanded in frank
amazement. He felt that she had become remoter from him by at least a million
miles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going there now. I&rsquo;m taking special courses in
English.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not know what &ldquo;English&rdquo; meant, but he made a mental note of
that item of ignorance and passed on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long would I have to study before I could go to the
university?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
She beamed encouragement upon his desire for knowledge, and said: &ldquo;That
depends upon how much studying you have already done. You have never attended
high school? Of course not. But did you finish grammar school?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had two years to run, when I left,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But I
was always honorably promoted at school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The next moment, angry with himself for the boast, he had gripped the arms of
the chair so savagely that every finger-end was stinging. At the same moment he
became aware that a woman was entering the room. He saw the girl leave her
chair and trip swiftly across the floor to the newcomer. They kissed each
other, and, with arms around each other&rsquo;s waists, they advanced toward
him. That must be her mother, he thought. She was a tall, blond woman, slender,
and stately, and beautiful. Her gown was what he might expect in such a house.
His eyes delighted in the graceful lines of it. She and her dress together
reminded him of women on the stage. Then he remembered seeing similar grand
ladies and gowns entering the London theatres while he stood and watched and
the policemen shoved him back into the drizzle beyond the awning. Next his mind
leaped to the Grand Hotel at Yokohama, where, too, from the sidewalk, he had
seen grand ladies. Then the city and the harbor of Yokohama, in a thousand
pictures, began flashing before his eyes. But he swiftly dismissed the
kaleidoscope of memory, oppressed by the urgent need of the present. He knew
that he must stand up to be introduced, and he struggled painfully to his feet,
where he stood with trousers bagging at the knees, his arms loose-hanging and
ludicrous, his face set hard for the impending ordeal.

<h2><a name="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>
The process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him. Between
halts and stumbles, jerks and lurches, locomotion had at times seemed
impossible. But at last he had made it, and was seated alongside of Her. The
array of knives and forks frightened him. They bristled with unknown perils,
and he gazed at them, fascinated, till their dazzle became a background across
which moved a succession of forecastle pictures, wherein he and his mates sat
eating salt beef with sheath-knives and fingers, or scooping thick pea-soup out
of pannikins by means of battered iron spoons. The stench of bad beef was in
his nostrils, while in his ears, to the accompaniment of creaking timbers and
groaning bulkheads, echoed the loud mouth-noises of the eaters. He watched them
eating, and decided that they ate like pigs. Well, he would be careful here. He
would make no noise. He would keep his mind upon it all the time.
</p>

<p>
He glanced around the table. Opposite him was Arthur, and Arthur&rsquo;s
brother, Norman. They were her brothers, he reminded himself, and his heart
warmed toward them. How they loved each other, the members of this family!
There flashed into his mind the picture of her mother, of the kiss of greeting,
and of the pair of them walking toward him with arms entwined. Not in his world
were such displays of affection between parents and children made. It was a
revelation of the heights of existence that were attained in the world above.
It was the finest thing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that
world. He was moved deeply by appreciation of it, and his heart was melting
with sympathetic tenderness. He had starved for love all his life. His nature
craved love. It was an organic demand of his being. Yet he had gone without,
and hardened himself in the process. He had not known that he needed love. Nor
did he know it now. He merely saw it in operation, and thrilled to it, and
thought it fine, and high, and splendid.
</p>

<p>
He was glad that Mr. Morse was not there. It was difficult enough getting
acquainted with her, and her mother, and her brother, Norman. Arthur he already
knew somewhat. The father would have been too much for him, he felt sure. It
seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in his life. The severest toil
was child&rsquo;s play compared with this. Tiny nodules of moisture stood out
on his forehead, and his shirt was wet with sweat from the exertion of doing so
many unaccustomed things at once. He had to eat as he had never eaten before,
to handle strange tools, to glance surreptitiously about and learn how to
accomplish each new thing, to receive the flood of impressions that was pouring
in upon him and being mentally annotated and classified; to be conscious of a
yearning for her that perturbed him in the form of a dull, aching restlessness;
to feel the prod of desire to win to the walk in life whereon she trod, and to
have his mind ever and again straying off in speculation and vague plans of how
to reach to her. Also, when his secret glance went across to Norman opposite
him, or to any one else, to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in
any particular occasion, that person&rsquo;s features were seized upon by his
mind, which automatically strove to appraise them and to divine what they
were&mdash;all in relation to her. Then he had to talk, to hear what was said
to him and what was said back and forth, and to answer, when it was necessary,
with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required a constant curb. And
to add confusion to confusion, there was the servant, an unceasing menace, that
appeared noiselessly at his shoulder, a dire Sphinx that propounded puzzles and
conundrums demanding instantaneous solution. He was oppressed throughout the
meal by the thought of finger-bowls. Irrelevantly, insistently, scores of
times, he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like. He had
heard of such things, and now, sooner or later, somewhere in the next few
minutes, he would see them, sit at table with exalted beings who used
them&mdash;ay, and he would use them himself. And most important of all, far
down and yet always at the surface of his thought, was the problem of how he
should comport himself toward these persons. What should his attitude be? He
wrestled continually and anxiously with the problem. There were cowardly
suggestions that he should make believe, assume a part; and there were still
more cowardly suggestions that warned him he would fail in such course, that
his nature was not fitted to live up to it, and that he would make a fool of
himself.
</p>

<p>
It was during the first part of the dinner, struggling to decide upon his
attitude, that he was very quiet. He did not know that his quietness was giving
the lie to Arthur&rsquo;s words of the day before, when that brother of hers
had announced that he was going to bring a wild man home to dinner and for them
not to be alarmed, because they would find him an interesting wild man. Martin
Eden could not have found it in him, just then, to believe that her brother
could be guilty of such treachery&mdash;especially when he had been the means
of getting this particular brother out of an unpleasant row. So he sat at
table, perturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time charmed by all that
went on about him. For the first time he realized that eating was something
more than a utilitarian function. He was unaware of what he ate. It was merely
food. He was feasting his love of beauty at this table where eating was an
aesthetic function. It was an intellectual function, too. His mind was stirred.
He heard words spoken that were meaningless to him, and other words that he had
seen only in books and that no man or woman he had known was of large enough
mental caliber to pronounce. When he heard such words dropping carelessly from
the lips of the members of this marvellous family, her family, he thrilled with
delight. The romance, and beauty, and high vigor of the books were coming true.
He was in that rare and blissful state wherein a man sees his dreams stalk out
from the crannies of fantasy and become fact.
</p>

<p>
Never had he been at such an altitude of living, and he kept himself in the
background, listening, observing, and pleasuring, replying in reticent
monosyllables, saying, &ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, miss,&rdquo; to
her, and &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; to
her mother. He curbed the impulse, arising out of his sea-training, to say
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; to her brothers. He felt
that it would be inappropriate and a confession of inferiority on his
part&mdash;which would never do if he was to win to her. Also, it was a dictate
of his pride. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he cried to himself, once; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just as good as them, and if they do know lots that I don&rsquo;t, I could
learn &rsquo;m a few myself, all the same!&rdquo; And the next moment, when she
or her mother addressed him as &ldquo;Mr. Eden,&rdquo; his aggressive pride was
forgotten, and he was glowing and warm with delight. He was a civilized man,
that was what he was, shoulder to shoulder, at dinner, with people he had read
about in books. He was in the books himself, adventuring through the printed
pages of bound volumes.
</p>

<p>
But while he belied Arthur&rsquo;s description, and appeared a gentle lamb
rather than a wild man, he was racking his brains for a course of action. He
was no gentle lamb, and the part of second fiddle would never do for the
high-pitched dominance of his nature. He talked only when he had to, and then
his speech was like his walk to the table, filled with jerks and halts as he
groped in his polyglot vocabulary for words, debating over words he knew were
fit but which he feared he could not pronounce, rejecting other words he knew
would not be understood or would be raw and harsh. But all the time he was
oppressed by the consciousness that this carefulness of diction was making a
booby of him, preventing him from expressing what he had in him. Also, his love
of freedom chafed against the restriction in much the same way his neck chafed
against the starched fetter of a collar. Besides, he was confident that he
could not keep it up. He was by nature powerful of thought and sensibility, and
the creative spirit was restive and urgent. He was swiftly mastered by the
concept or sensation in him that struggled in birth-throes to receive
expression and form, and then he forgot himself and where he was, and the old
words&mdash;the tools of speech he knew&mdash;slipped out.
</p>

<p>
Once, he declined something from the servant who interrupted and pestered at
his shoulder, and he said, shortly and emphatically, &ldquo;Pow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant, the servant was
smugly pleased, and he was wallowing in mortification. But he recovered himself
quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Kanaka for &lsquo;finish,&rsquo;&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and it just come out naturally. It&rsquo;s spelt p-a-u.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands, and, being in
explanatory mood, he said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I just come down the Coast on one of the Pacific mail steamers. She was
behind time, an&rsquo; around the Puget Sound ports we worked like niggers,
storing cargo&mdash;mixed freight, if you know what that means. That&rsquo;s
how the skin got knocked off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; she hastened to explain, in turn.
&ldquo;Your hands seemed too small for your body.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His cheeks were hot. He took it as an exposure of another of his deficiencies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said depreciatingly. &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t big enough
to stand the strain. I can hit like a mule with my arms and shoulders. They are
too strong, an&rsquo; when I smash a man on the jaw the hands get smashed,
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was not happy at what he had said. He was filled with disgust at himself. He
had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about things that were not
nice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was brave of you to help Arthur the way you did&mdash;and you a
stranger,&rdquo; she said tactfully, aware of his discomfiture though not of
the reason for it.
</p>

<p>
He, in turn, realized what she had done, and in the consequent warm surge of
gratefulness that overwhelmed him forgot his loose-worded tongue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Any guy
&rsquo;ud do it for another. That bunch of hoodlums was lookin&rsquo; for
trouble, an&rsquo; Arthur wasn&rsquo;t botherin&rsquo; &rsquo;em none. They
butted in on &rsquo;m, an&rsquo; then I butted in on them an&rsquo; poked a
few. That&rsquo;s where some of the skin off my hands went, along with some of
the teeth of the gang. I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; missed it for anything.
When I seen&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused, open-mouthed, on the verge of the pit of his own depravity and utter
worthlessness to breathe the same air she did. And while Arthur took up the
tale, for the twentieth time, of his adventure with the drunken hoodlums on the
ferry-boat and of how Martin Eden had rushed in and rescued him, that
individual, with frowning brows, meditated upon the fool he had made of
himself, and wrestled more determinedly with the problem of how he should
conduct himself toward these people. He certainly had not succeeded so far. He
wasn&rsquo;t of their tribe, and he couldn&rsquo;t talk their lingo, was the
way he put it to himself. He couldn&rsquo;t fake being their kind. The
masquerade would fail, and besides, masquerade was foreign to his nature. There
was no room in him for sham or artifice. Whatever happened, he must be real. He
couldn&rsquo;t talk their talk just yet, though in time he would. Upon that he
was resolved. But in the meantime, talk he must, and it must be his own talk,
toned down, of course, so as to be comprehensible to them and so as not to
shock them too much. And furthermore, he wouldn&rsquo;t claim, not even by
tacit acceptance, to be familiar with anything that was unfamiliar. In
pursuance of this decision, when the two brothers, talking university shop, had
used &ldquo;trig&rdquo; several times, Martin Eden demanded:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is <i>trig</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Trignometry,&rdquo; Norman said; &ldquo;a higher form of math.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what is math?&rdquo; was the next question, which, somehow, brought
the laugh on Norman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mathematics, arithmetic,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
Martin Eden nodded. He had caught a glimpse of the apparently illimitable
vistas of knowledge. What he saw took on tangibility. His abnormal power of
vision made abstractions take on concrete form. In the alchemy of his brain,
trigonometry and mathematics and the whole field of knowledge which they
betokened were transmuted into so much landscape. The vistas he saw were vistas
of green foliage and forest glades, all softly luminous or shot through with
flashing lights. In the distance, detail was veiled and blurred by a purple
haze, but behind this purple haze, he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the
lure of romance. It was like wine to him. Here was adventure, something to do
with head and hand, a world to conquer&mdash;and straightway from the back of
his consciousness rushed the thought, <i>conquering, to win to her, that
lily-pale spirit sitting beside him</i>.
</p>

<p>
The glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by Arthur, who, all
evening, had been trying to draw his wild man out. Martin Eden remembered his
decision. For the first time he became himself, consciously and deliberately at
first, but soon lost in the joy of creating in making life as he knew it appear
before his listeners&rsquo; eyes. He had been a member of the crew of the
smuggling schooner <i>Halcyon</i> when she was captured by a revenue cutter. He
saw with wide eyes, and he could tell what he saw. He brought the pulsing sea
before them, and the men and the ships upon the sea. He communicated his power
of vision, till they saw with his eyes what he had seen. He selected from the
vast mass of detail with an artist&rsquo;s touch, drawing pictures of life that
glowed and burned with light and color, injecting movement so that his
listeners surged along with him on the flood of rough eloquence, enthusiasm,
and power. At times he shocked them with the vividness of the narrative and his
terms of speech, but beauty always followed fast upon the heels of violence,
and tragedy was relieved by humor, by interpretations of the strange twists and
quirks of sailors&rsquo; minds.
</p>

<p>
And while he talked, the girl looked at him with startled eyes. His fire warmed
her. She wondered if she had been cold all her days. She wanted to lean toward
this burning, blazing man that was like a volcano spouting forth strength,
robustness, and health. She felt that she must lean toward him, and resisted by
an effort. Then, too, there was the counter impulse to shrink away from him.
She was repelled by those lacerated hands, grimed by toil so that the very dirt
of life was ingrained in the flesh itself, by that red chafe of the collar and
those bulging muscles. His roughness frightened her; each roughness of speech
was an insult to her ear, each rough phase of his life an insult to her soul.
And ever and again would come the draw of him, till she thought he must be evil
to have such power over her. All that was most firmly established in her mind
was rocking. His romance and adventure were battering at the conventions.
Before his facile perils and ready laugh, life was no longer an affair of
serious effort and restraint, but a toy, to be played with and turned
topsy-turvy, carelessly to be lived and pleasured in, and carelessly to be
flung aside. &ldquo;Therefore, play!&rdquo; was the cry that rang through her.
&ldquo;Lean toward him, if so you will, and place your two hands upon his
neck!&rdquo; She wanted to cry out at the recklessness of the thought, and in
vain she appraised her own cleanness and culture and balanced all that she was
against what he was not. She glanced about her and saw the others gazing at him
with rapt attention; and she would have despaired had not she seen horror in
her mother&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;fascinated horror, it was true, but none the less
horror. This man from outer darkness was evil. Her mother saw it, and her
mother was right. She would trust her mother&rsquo;s judgment in this as she
had always trusted it in all things. The fire of him was no longer warm, and
the fear of him was no longer poignant.
</p>

<p>
Later, at the piano, she played for him, and at him, aggressively, with the
vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf that separated them.
Her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his head; and though it
stunned him and crushed him down, it incited him. He gazed upon her in awe. In
his mind, as in her own, the gulf widened; but faster than it widened, towered
his ambition to win across it. But he was too complicated a plexus of
sensibilities to sit staring at a gulf a whole evening, especially when there
was music. He was remarkably susceptible to music. It was like strong drink,
firing him to audacities of feeling,&mdash;a drug that laid hold of his
imagination and went cloud-soaring through the sky. It banished sordid fact,
flooded his mind with beauty, loosed romance and to its heels added wings. He
did not understand the music she played. It was different from the dance-hall
piano-banging and blatant brass bands he had heard. But he had caught hints of
such music from the books, and he accepted her playing largely on faith,
patiently waiting, at first, for the lilting measures of pronounced and simple
rhythm, puzzled because those measures were not long continued. Just as he
caught the swing of them and started, his imagination attuned in flight, always
they vanished away in a chaotic scramble of sounds that was meaningless to him,
and that dropped his imagination, an inert weight, back to earth.
</p>

<p>
Once, it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all this. He
caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the message that her hands
pronounced upon the keys. Then he dismissed the thought as unworthy and
impossible, and yielded himself more freely to the music. The old delightful
condition began to be induced. His feet were no longer clay, and his flesh
became spirit; before his eyes and behind his eyes shone a great glory; and
then the scene before him vanished and he was away, rocking over the world that
was to him a very dear world. The known and the unknown were commingled in the
dream-pageant that thronged his vision. He entered strange ports of sun-washed
lands, and trod market-places among barbaric peoples that no man had ever seen.
The scent of the spice islands was in his nostrils as he had known it on warm,
breathless nights at sea, or he beat up against the southeast trades through
long tropic days, sinking palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind
and lifting palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead. Swift as
thought the pictures came and went. One instant he was astride a broncho and
flying through the fairy-colored Painted Desert country; the next instant he
was gazing down through shimmering heat into the whited sepulchre of Death
Valley, or pulling an oar on a freezing ocean where great ice islands towered
and glistened in the sun. He lay on a coral beach where the cocoanuts grew down
to the mellow-sounding surf. The hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue
fires, in the light of which danced the <i>hula</i> dancers to the barbaric
love-calls of the singers, who chanted to tinkling <i>ukuleles</i> and rumbling
tom-toms. It was a sensuous, tropic night. In the background a volcano crater
was silhouetted against the stars. Overhead drifted a pale crescent moon, and
the Southern Cross burned low in the sky.
</p>

<p>
He was a harp; all life that he had known and that was his consciousness was
the strings; and the flood of music was a wind that poured against those
strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams. He did not merely
feel. Sensation invested itself in form and color and radiance, and what his
imagination dared, it objectified in some sublimated and magic way. Past,
present, and future mingled; and he went on oscillating across the broad, warm
world, through high adventure and noble deeds to Her&mdash;ay, and with her,
winning her, his arm about her, and carrying her on in flight through the
empery of his mind.
</p>

<p>
And she, glancing at him across her shoulder, saw something of all this in his
face. It was a transfigured face, with great shining eyes that gazed beyond the
veil of sound and saw behind it the leap and pulse of life and the gigantic
phantoms of the spirit. She was startled. The raw, stumbling lout was gone. The
ill-fitting clothes, battered hands, and sunburned face remained; but these
seemed the prison-bars through which she saw a great soul looking forth,
inarticulate and dumb because of those feeble lips that would not give it
speech. Only for a flashing moment did she see this, then she saw the lout
returned, and she laughed at the whim of her fancy. But the impression of that
fleeting glimpse lingered, and when the time came for him to beat a stumbling
retreat and go, she lent him the volume of Swinburne, and another of
Browning&mdash;she was studying Browning in one of her English courses. He
seemed such a boy, as he stood blushing and stammering his thanks, that a wave
of pity, maternal in its prompting, welled up in her. She did not remember the
lout, nor the imprisoned soul, nor the man who had stared at her in all
masculineness and delighted and frightened her. She saw before her only a boy,
who was shaking her hand with a hand so calloused that it felt like a
nutmeg-grater and rasped her skin, and who was saying jerkily:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The greatest time of my life. You see, I ain&rsquo;t used to things. . .
&rdquo; He looked about him helplessly. &ldquo;To people and houses like this.
It&rsquo;s all new to me, and I like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll call again,&rdquo; she said, as he was saying good
night to her brothers.
</p>

<p>
He pulled on his cap, lurched desperately through the doorway, and was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what do you think of him?&rdquo; Arthur demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is most interesting, a whiff of ozone,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twenty&mdash;almost twenty-one. I asked him this afternoon. I
didn&rsquo;t think he was that young.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And I am three years older, was the thought in her mind as she kissed her
brothers goodnight.

<h2><a name="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>
As Martin Eden went down the steps, his hand dropped into his coat pocket. It
came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican tobacco, which were
deftly rolled together into a cigarette. He drew the first whiff of smoke deep
into his lungs and expelled it in a long and lingering exhalation. &ldquo;By
God!&rdquo; he said aloud, in a voice of awe and wonder. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo;
he repeated. And yet again he murmured, &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; Then his hand
went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and stuffed into his
pocket. A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared his head to it and unbuttoned
his vest, swinging along in splendid unconcern. He was only dimly aware that it
was raining. He was in an ecstasy, dreaming dreams and reconstructing the
scenes just past.
</p>

<p>
He had met the woman at last&mdash;the woman that he had thought little about,
not being given to thinking about women, but whom he had expected, in a remote
way, he would sometime meet. He had sat next to her at table. He had felt her
hand in his, he had looked into her eyes and caught a vision of a beautiful
spirit;&mdash;but no more beautiful than the eyes through which it shone, nor
than the flesh that gave it expression and form. He did not think of her flesh
as flesh,&mdash;which was new to him; for of the women he had known that was
the only way he thought. Her flesh was somehow different. He did not conceive
of her body as a body, subject to the ills and frailties of bodies. Her body
was more than the garb of her spirit. It was an emanation of her spirit, a pure
and gracious crystallization of her divine essence. This feeling of the divine
startled him. It shocked him from his dreams to sober thought. No word, no
clew, no hint, of the divine had ever reached him before. He had never believed
in the divine. He had always been irreligious, scoffing good-naturedly at the
sky-pilots and their immortality of the soul. There was no life beyond, he had
contended; it was here and now, then darkness everlasting. But what he had seen
in her eyes was soul&mdash;immortal soul that could never die. No man he had
known, nor any woman, had given him the message of immortality. But she had.
She had whispered it to him the first moment she looked at him. Her face
shimmered before his eyes as he walked along,&mdash;pale and serious, sweet and
sensitive, smiling with pity and tenderness as only a spirit could smile, and
pure as he had never dreamed purity could be. Her purity smote him like a blow.
It startled him. He had known good and bad; but purity, as an attribute of
existence, had never entered his mind. And now, in her, he conceived purity to
be the superlative of goodness and of cleanness, the sum of which constituted
eternal life.
</p>

<p>
And promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life. He was not fit to
carry water for her&mdash;he knew that; it was a miracle of luck and a
fantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be with her and talk with
her that night. It was accidental. There was no merit in it. He did not deserve
such fortune. His mood was essentially religious. He was humble and meek,
filled with self-disparagement and abasement. In such frame of mind sinners
come to the penitent form. He was convicted of sin. But as the meek and lowly
at the penitent form catch splendid glimpses of their future lordly existence,
so did he catch similar glimpses of the state he would gain to by possessing
her. But this possession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from
possession as he had known it. Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw himself
climbing the heights with her, sharing thoughts with her, pleasuring in
beautiful and noble things with her. It was a soul-possession he dreamed,
refined beyond any grossness, a free comradeship of spirit that he could not
put into definite thought. He did not think it. For that matter, he did not
think at all. Sensation usurped reason, and he was quivering and palpitant with
emotions he had never known, drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where
feeling itself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of
life.
</p>

<p>
He staggered along like a drunken man, murmuring fervently aloud: &ldquo;By
God! By God!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A policeman on a street corner eyed him suspiciously, then noted his sailor
roll.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; the policeman demanded.
</p>

<p>
Martin Eden came back to earth. His was a fluid organism, swiftly adjustable,
capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of nooks and crannies. With the
policeman&rsquo;s hail he was immediately his ordinary self, grasping the
situation clearly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beaut, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he laughed back. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know I was talkin&rsquo; out loud.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be singing next,&rdquo; was the policeman&rsquo;s
diagnosis.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. Gimme a match an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll catch the next car
home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He lighted his cigarette, said good night, and went on. &ldquo;Now
wouldn&rsquo;t that rattle you?&rdquo; he ejaculated under his breath.
&ldquo;That copper thought I was drunk.&rdquo; He smiled to himself and
meditated. &ldquo;I guess I was,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t
think a woman&rsquo;s face&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He caught a Telegraph Avenue car that was going to Berkeley. It was crowded
with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and again barking out
college yells. He studied them curiously. They were university boys. They went
to the same university that she did, were in her class socially, could know
her, could see her every day if they wanted to. He wondered that they did not
want to, that they had been out having a good time instead of being with her
that evening, talking with her, sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring
circle. His thoughts wandered on. He noticed one with narrow-slitted eyes and a
loose-lipped mouth. That fellow was vicious, he decided. On shipboard he would
be a sneak, a whiner, a tattler. He, Martin Eden, was a better man than that
fellow. The thought cheered him. It seemed to draw him nearer to Her. He began
comparing himself with the students. He grew conscious of the muscled mechanism
of his body and felt confident that he was physically their master. But their
heads were filled with knowledge that enabled them to talk her talk,&mdash;the
thought depressed him. But what was a brain for? he demanded passionately. What
they had done, he could do. They had been studying about life from the books
while he had been busy living life. His brain was just as full of knowledge as
theirs, though it was a different kind of knowledge. How many of them could tie
a lanyard knot, or take a wheel or a lookout? His life spread out before him in
a series of pictures of danger and daring, hardship and toil. He remembered his
failures and scrapes in the process of learning. He was that much to the good,
anyway. Later on they would have to begin living life and going through the
mill as he had gone. Very well. While they were busy with that, he could be
learning the other side of life from the books.
</p>

<p>
As the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated Oakland from
Berkeley, he kept a lookout for a familiar, two-story building along the front
of which ran the proud sign, HIGGINBOTHAM&rsquo;S CASH STORE. Martin Eden got
off at this corner. He stared up for a moment at the sign. It carried a message
to him beyond its mere wording. A personality of smallness and egotism and
petty underhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves. Bernard
Higginbotham had married his sister, and he knew him well. He let himself in
with a latch-key and climbed the stairs to the second floor. Here lived his
brother-in-law. The grocery was below. There was a smell of stale vegetables in
the air. As he groped his way across the hall he stumbled over a toy-cart, left
there by one of his numerous nephews and nieces, and brought up against a door
with a resounding bang. &ldquo;The pincher,&rdquo; was his thought; &ldquo;too
miserly to burn two cents&rsquo; worth of gas and save his boarders&rsquo;
necks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room, where sat his sister and
Bernard Higginbotham. She was patching a pair of his trousers, while his lean
body was distributed over two chairs, his feet dangling in dilapidated
carpet-slippers over the edge of the second chair. He glanced across the top of
the paper he was reading, showing a pair of dark, insincere, sharp-staring
eyes. Martin Eden never looked at him without experiencing a sense of
repulsion. What his sister had seen in the man was beyond him. The other
affected him as so much vermin, and always aroused in him an impulse to crush
him under his foot. &ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll beat the face off of him,&rdquo;
was the way he often consoled himself for enduring the man&rsquo;s existence.
The eyes, weasel-like and cruel, were looking at him complainingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Martin demanded. &ldquo;Out with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had that door painted only last week,&rdquo; Mr. Higginbotham half
whined, half bullied; &ldquo;and you know what union wages are. You should be
more careful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin had intended to reply, but he was struck by the hopelessness of it. He
gazed across the monstrous sordidness of soul to a chromo on the wall. It
surprised him. He had always liked it, but it seemed that now he was seeing it
for the first time. It was cheap, that was what it was, like everything else in
this house. His mind went back to the house he had just left, and he saw,
first, the paintings, and next, Her, looking at him with melting sweetness as
she shook his hand at leaving. He forgot where he was and Bernard
Higginbotham&rsquo;s existence, till that gentleman demanded:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seen a ghost?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin came back and looked at the beady eyes, sneering, truculent, cowardly,
and there leaped into his vision, as on a screen, the same eyes when their
owner was making a sale in the store below&mdash;subservient eyes, smug, and
oily, and flattering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Martin answered. &ldquo;I seen a ghost. Good night. Good
night, Gertrude.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He started to leave the room, tripping over a loose seam in the slatternly
carpet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bang the door,&rdquo; Mr. Higginbotham cautioned him.
</p>

<p>
He felt the blood crawl in his veins, but controlled himself and closed the
door softly behind him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Higginbotham looked at his wife exultantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ben drinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he proclaimed in a hoarse whisper.
&ldquo;I told you he would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head resignedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His eyes was pretty shiny,&rdquo; she confessed; &ldquo;and he
didn&rsquo;t have no collar, though he went away with one. But mebbe he
didn&rsquo;t have more&rsquo;n a couple of glasses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t stand up straight,&rdquo; asserted her husband.
&ldquo;I watched him. He couldn&rsquo;t walk across the floor without
stumblin&rsquo;. You heard &rsquo;m yourself almost fall down in the
hall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it was over Alice&rsquo;s cart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He
couldn&rsquo;t see it in the dark.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Higginbotham&rsquo;s voice and wrath began to rise. All day he effaced
himself in the store, reserving for the evening, with his family, the privilege
of being himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you that precious brother of yours was drunk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His voice was cold, sharp, and final, his lips stamping the enunciation of each
word like the die of a machine. His wife sighed and remained silent. She was a
large, stout woman, always dressed slatternly and always tired from the burdens
of her flesh, her work, and her husband.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it in him, I tell you, from his father,&rdquo; Mr.
Higginbotham went on accusingly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll croak in the
gutter the same way. You know that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nodded, sighed, and went on stitching. They were agreed that Martin had
come home drunk. They did not have it in their souls to know beauty, or they
would have known that those shining eyes and that glowing face betokened
youth&rsquo;s first vision of love.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Settin&rsquo; a fine example to the children,&rdquo; Mr. Higginbotham
snorted, suddenly, in the silence for which his wife was responsible and which
he resented. Sometimes he almost wished she would oppose him more. &ldquo;If he
does it again, he&rsquo;s got to get out. Understand! I won&rsquo;t put up with
his shinanigan&mdash;debotchin&rsquo; innocent children with his
boozing.&rdquo; Mr. Higginbotham liked the word, which was a new one in his
vocabulary, recently gleaned from a newspaper column. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
it is, debotchin&rsquo;&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t no other name for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Still his wife sighed, shook her head sorrowfully, and stitched on. Mr.
Higginbotham resumed the newspaper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he paid last week&rsquo;s board?&rdquo; he shot across the top of
the newspaper.
</p>

<p>
She nodded, then added, &ldquo;He still has some money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When is he goin&rsquo; to sea again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When his pay-day&rsquo;s spent, I guess,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He
was over to San Francisco yesterday looking for a ship. But he&rsquo;s got
money, yet, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s particular about the kind of ship he signs
for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for a deck-swab like him to put on airs,&rdquo; Mr.
Higginbotham snorted. &ldquo;Particular! Him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said something about a schooner that&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; ready to
go off to some outlandish place to look for buried treasure, that he&rsquo;d
sail on her if his money held out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he only wanted to steady down, I&rsquo;d give him a job drivin&rsquo;
the wagon,&rdquo; her husband said, but with no trace of benevolence in his
voice. &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s quit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His wife looked alarm and interrogation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quit to-night. Is goin&rsquo; to work for Carruthers. They paid &rsquo;m
more&rsquo;n I could afford.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;d lose &rsquo;m,&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;He
was worth more&rsquo;n you was giving him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now look here, old woman,&rdquo; Higginbotham bullied, &ldquo;for the
thousandth time I&rsquo;ve told you to keep your nose out of the business. I
won&rsquo;t tell you again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she sniffled. &ldquo;Tom was a good
boy.&rdquo; Her husband glared at her. This was unqualified defiance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If that brother of yours was worth his salt, he could take the
wagon,&rdquo; he snorted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He pays his board, just the same,&rdquo; was the retort.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s my brother, an&rsquo; so long as he don&rsquo;t owe
you money you&rsquo;ve got no right to be jumping on him all the time.
I&rsquo;ve got some feelings, if I have been married to you for seven
years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you tell &rsquo;m you&rsquo;d charge him for gas if he goes on
readin&rsquo; in bed?&rdquo; he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Higginbotham made no reply. Her revolt faded away, her spirit wilting down
into her tired flesh. Her husband was triumphant. He had her. His eyes snapped
vindictively, while his ears joyed in the sniffles she emitted. He extracted
great happiness from squelching her, and she squelched easily these days,
though it had been different in the first years of their married life, before
the brood of children and his incessant nagging had sapped her energy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you tell &rsquo;m to-morrow, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I just want to tell you, before I forget it, that you&rsquo;d
better send for Marian to-morrow to take care of the children. With Tom quit,
I&rsquo;ll have to be out on the wagon, an&rsquo; you can make up your mind to
it to be down below waitin&rsquo; on the counter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But to-morrow&rsquo;s wash day,&rdquo; she objected weakly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get up early, then, an&rsquo; do it first. I won&rsquo;t start out till
ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He crinkled the paper viciously and resumed his reading.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>
Martin Eden, with blood still crawling from contact with his brother-in-law,
felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered his room, a tiny
cubbyhole with space for a bed, a wash-stand, and one chair. Mr. Higginbotham
was too thrifty to keep a servant when his wife could do the work. Besides, the
servant&rsquo;s room enabled them to take in two boarders instead of one.
Martin placed the Swinburne and Browning on the chair, took off his coat, and
sat down on the bed. A screeching of asthmatic springs greeted the weight of
his body, but he did not notice them. He started to take off his shoes, but
fell to staring at the white plaster wall opposite him, broken by long streaks
of dirty brown where rain had leaked through the roof. On this befouled
background visions began to flow and burn. He forgot his shoes and stared long,
till his lips began to move and he murmured, &ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo; He had not thought a simple sound could be so beautiful. It
delighted his ear, and he grew intoxicated with the repetition of it.
&ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo; It was a talisman, a magic word to conjure with. Each time
he murmured it, her face shimmered before him, suffusing the foul wall with a
golden radiance. This radiance did not stop at the wall. It extended on into
infinity, and through its golden depths his soul went questing after hers. The
best that was in him was out in splendid flood. The very thought of her
ennobled and purified him, made him better, and made him want to be better.
This was new to him. He had never known women who had made him better. They had
always had the counter effect of making him beastly. He did not know that many
of them had done their best, bad as it was. Never having been conscious of
himself, he did not know that he had that in his being that drew love from
women and which had been the cause of their reaching out for his youth. Though
they had often bothered him, he had never bothered about them; and he would
never have dreamed that there were women who had been better because of him.
Always in sublime carelessness had he lived, till now, and now it seemed to him
that they had always reached out and dragged at him with vile hands. This was
not just to them, nor to himself. But he, who for the first time was becoming
conscious of himself, was in no condition to judge, and he burned with shame as
he stared at the vision of his infamy.
</p>

<p>
He got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty looking-glass over the
wash-stand. He passed a towel over it and looked again, long and carefully. It
was the first time he had ever really seen himself. His eyes were made for
seeing, but up to that moment they had been filled with the ever changing
panorama of the world, at which he had been too busy gazing, ever to gaze at
himself. He saw the head and face of a young fellow of twenty, but, being
unused to such appraisement, he did not know how to value it. Above a
square-domed forehead he saw a mop of brown hair, nut-brown, with a wave to it
and hints of curls that were a delight to any woman, making hands tingle to
stroke it and fingers tingle to pass caresses through it. But he passed it by
as without merit, in Her eyes, and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the high,
square forehead,&mdash;striving to penetrate it and learn the quality of its
content. What kind of a brain lay behind there? was his insistent
interrogation. What was it capable of? How far would it take him? Would it take
him to her?
</p>

<p>
He wondered if there was soul in those steel-gray eyes that were often quite
blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of the sun-washed deep.
He wondered, also, how his eyes looked to her. He tried to imagine himself she,
gazing into those eyes of his, but failed in the jugglery. He could
successfully put himself inside other men&rsquo;s minds, but they had to be men
whose ways of life he knew. He did not know her way of life. She was wonder and
mystery, and how could he guess one thought of hers? Well, they were honest
eyes, he concluded, and in them was neither smallness nor meanness. The brown
sunburn of his face surprised him. He had not dreamed he was so black. He
rolled up his shirt-sleeve and compared the white underside of the arm with his
face. Yes, he was a white man, after all. But the arms were sunburned, too. He
twisted his arm, rolled the biceps over with his other hand, and gazed
underneath where he was least touched by the sun. It was very white. He laughed
at his bronzed face in the glass at the thought that it was once as white as
the underside of his arm; nor did he dream that in the world there were few
pale spirits of women who could boast fairer or smoother skins than
he&mdash;fairer than where he had escaped the ravages of the sun.
</p>

<p>
His might have been a cherub&rsquo;s mouth, had not the full, sensuous lips a
trick, under stress, of drawing firmly across the teeth. At times, so tightly
did they draw, the mouth became stern and harsh, even ascetic. They were the
lips of a fighter and of a lover. They could taste the sweetness of life with
relish, and they could put the sweetness aside and command life. The chin and
jaw, strong and just hinting of square aggressiveness, helped the lips to
command life. Strength balanced sensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect,
compelling him to love beauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to
sensations that were wholesome. And between the lips were teeth that had never
known nor needed the dentist&rsquo;s care. They were white and strong and
regular, he decided, as he looked at them. But as he looked, he began to be
troubled. Somewhere, stored away in the recesses of his mind and vaguely
remembered, was the impression that there were people who washed their teeth
every day. They were the people from up above&mdash;people in her class. She
must wash her teeth every day, too. What would she think if she learned that he
had never washed his teeth in all the days of his life? He resolved to get a
tooth-brush and form the habit. He would begin at once, to-morrow. It was not
by mere achievement that he could hope to win to her. He must make a personal
reform in all things, even to tooth-washing and neck-gear, though a starched
collar affected him as a renunciation of freedom.
</p>

<p>
He held up his hand, rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused palm and
gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and which no brush
could scrub away. How different was her palm! He thrilled deliciously at the
remembrance. Like a rose-petal, he thought; cool and soft as a snowflake. He
had never thought that a mere woman&rsquo;s hand could be so sweetly soft. He
caught himself imagining the wonder of a caress from such a hand, and flushed
guiltily. It was too gross a thought for her. In ways it seemed to impugn her
high spirituality. She was a pale, slender spirit, exalted far beyond the
flesh; but nevertheless the softness of her palm persisted in his thoughts. He
was used to the harsh callousness of factory girls and working women. Well he
knew why their hands were rough; but this hand of hers . . . It was soft
because she had never used it to work with. The gulf yawned between her and him
at the awesome thought of a person who did not have to work for a living. He
suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who did not labor. It towered before
him on the wall, a figure in brass, arrogant and powerful. He had worked
himself; his first memories seemed connected with work, and all his family had
worked. There was Gertrude. When her hands were not hard from the endless
housework, they were swollen and red like boiled beef, what of the washing. And
there was his sister Marian. She had worked in the cannery the preceding
summer, and her slim, pretty hands were all scarred with the tomato-knives.
Besides, the tips of two of her fingers had been left in the cutting machine at
the paper-box factory the preceding winter. He remembered the hard palms of his
mother as she lay in her coffin. And his father had worked to the last fading
gasp; the horned growth on his hands must have been half an inch thick when he
died. But Her hands were soft, and her mother&rsquo;s hands, and her
brothers&rsquo;. This last came to him as a surprise; it was tremendously
indicative of the highness of their caste, of the enormous distance that
stretched between her and him.
</p>

<p>
He sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh, and finished taking off his shoes.
He was a fool; he had been made drunken by a woman&rsquo;s face and by a
woman&rsquo;s soft, white hands. And then, suddenly, before his eyes, on the
foul plaster-wall appeared a vision. He stood in front of a gloomy tenement
house. It was night-time, in the East End of London, and before him stood
Margey, a little factory girl of fifteen. He had seen her home after the
bean-feast. She lived in that gloomy tenement, a place not fit for swine. His
hand was going out to hers as he said good night. She had put her lips up to be
kissed, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to kiss her. Somehow he was afraid of her.
And then her hand closed on his and pressed feverishly. He felt her callouses
grind and grate on his, and a great wave of pity welled over him. He saw her
yearning, hungry eyes, and her ill-fed female form which had been rushed from
childhood into a frightened and ferocious maturity; then he put his arms about
her in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips. Her glad little
cry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging to him like a cat. Poor little
starveling! He continued to stare at the vision of what had happened in the
long ago. His flesh was crawling as it had crawled that night when she clung to
him, and his heart was warm with pity. It was a gray scene, greasy gray, and
the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement stones. And then a radiant glory
shone on the wall, and up through the other vision, displacing it, glimmered
Her pale face under its crown of golden hair, remote and inaccessible as a
star.
</p>

<p>
He took the Browning and the Swinburne from the chair and kissed them. Just the
same, she told me to call again, he thought. He took another look at himself in
the glass, and said aloud, with great solemnity:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Martin Eden, the first thing to-morrow you go to the free library
an&rsquo; read up on etiquette. Understand!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned off the gas, and the springs shrieked under his body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to quit cussin&rsquo;, Martin, old boy;
you&rsquo;ve got to quit cussin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said aloud.
</p>

<p>
Then he dozed off to sleep and to dream dreams that for madness and audacity
rivalled those of poppy-eaters.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap05"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>
He awoke next morning from rosy scenes of dream to a steamy atmosphere that
smelled of soapsuds and dirty clothes, and that was vibrant with the jar and
jangle of tormented life. As he came out of his room he heard the slosh of
water, a sharp exclamation, and a resounding smack as his sister visited her
irritation upon one of her numerous progeny. The squall of the child went
through him like a knife. He was aware that the whole thing, the very air he
breathed, was repulsive and mean. How different, he thought, from the
atmosphere of beauty and repose of the house wherein Ruth dwelt. There it was
all spiritual. Here it was all material, and meanly material.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come here, Alfred,&rdquo; he called to the crying child, at the same
time thrusting his hand into his trousers pocket, where he carried his money
loose in the same large way that he lived life in general. He put a quarter in
the youngster&rsquo;s hand and held him in his arms a moment, soothing his
sobs. &ldquo;Now run along and get some candy, and don&rsquo;t forget to give
some to your brothers and sisters. Be sure and get the kind that lasts
longest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His sister lifted a flushed face from the wash-tub and looked at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A nickel&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; ben enough,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like you, no idea of the value of money. The
child&rsquo;ll eat himself sick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, sis,&rdquo; he answered jovially. &ldquo;My
money&rsquo;ll take care of itself. If you weren&rsquo;t so busy, I&rsquo;d
kiss you good morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wanted to be affectionate to this sister, who was good, and who, in her way,
he knew, loved him. But, somehow, she grew less herself as the years went by,
and more and more baffling. It was the hard work, the many children, and the
nagging of her husband, he decided, that had changed her. It came to him, in a
flash of fancy, that her nature seemed taking on the attributes of stale
vegetables, smelly soapsuds, and of the greasy dimes, nickels, and quarters she
took in over the counter of the store.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go along an&rsquo; get your breakfast,&rdquo; she said roughly, though
secretly pleased. Of all her wandering brood of brothers he had always been her
favorite. &ldquo;I declare I <i>will</i> kiss you,&rdquo; she said, with a
sudden stir at her heart.
</p>

<p>
With thumb and forefinger she swept the dripping suds first from one arm and
then from the other. He put his arms round her massive waist and kissed her wet
steamy lips. The tears welled into her eyes&mdash;not so much from strength of
feeling as from the weakness of chronic overwork. She shoved him away from her,
but not before he caught a glimpse of her moist eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find breakfast in the oven,&rdquo; she said hurriedly.
&ldquo;Jim ought to be up now. I had to get up early for the washing. Now get
along with you and get out of the house early. It won&rsquo;t be nice to-day,
what of Tom quittin&rsquo; an&rsquo; nobody but Bernard to drive the
wagon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin went into the kitchen with a sinking heart, the image of her red face
and slatternly form eating its way like acid into his brain. She might love him
if she only had some time, he concluded. But she was worked to death. Bernard
Higginbotham was a brute to work her so hard. But he could not help but feel,
on the other hand, that there had not been anything beautiful in that kiss. It
was true, it was an unusual kiss. For years she had kissed him only when he
returned from voyages or departed on voyages. But this kiss had tasted of
soapsuds, and the lips, he had noticed, were flabby. There had been no quick,
vigorous lip-pressure such as should accompany any kiss. Hers was the kiss of a
tired woman who had been tired so long that she had forgotten how to kiss. He
remembered her as a girl, before her marriage, when she would dance with the
best, all night, after a hard day&rsquo;s work at the laundry, and think
nothing of leaving the dance to go to another day&rsquo;s hard work. And then
he thought of Ruth and the cool sweetness that must reside in her lips as it
resided in all about her. Her kiss would be like her hand-shake or the way she
looked at one, firm and frank. In imagination he dared to think of her lips on
his, and so vividly did he imagine that he went dizzy at the thought and seemed
to rift through clouds of rose-petals, filling his brain with their perfume.
</p>

<p>
In the kitchen he found Jim, the other boarder, eating mush very languidly,
with a sick, far-away look in his eyes. Jim was a plumber&rsquo;s apprentice
whose weak chin and hedonistic temperament, coupled with a certain nervous
stupidity, promised to take him nowhere in the race for bread and butter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you eat?&rdquo; he demanded, as Martin dipped dolefully
into the cold, half-cooked oatmeal mush. &ldquo;Was you drunk again last
night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head. He was oppressed by the utter squalidness of it all.
Ruth Morse seemed farther removed than ever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Jim went on with a boastful, nervous giggle. &ldquo;I was
loaded right to the neck. Oh, she was a daisy. Billy brought me home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin nodded that he heard,&mdash;it was a habit of nature with him to pay
heed to whoever talked to him,&mdash;and poured a cup of lukewarm coffee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to the Lotus Club dance to-night?&rdquo; Jim demanded.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to have beer, an&rsquo; if that Temescal bunch
comes, there&rsquo;ll be a rough-house. I don&rsquo;t care, though. I&rsquo;m
takin&rsquo; my lady friend just the same. Cripes, but I&rsquo;ve got a taste
in my mouth!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He made a wry face and attempted to wash the taste away with coffee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know Julia?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my lady friend,&rdquo; Jim explained, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s
a peach. I&rsquo;d introduce you to her, only you&rsquo;d win her. I
don&rsquo;t see what the girls see in you, honest I don&rsquo;t; but the way
you win them away from the fellers is sickenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never got any away from you,&rdquo; Martin answered uninterestedly.
The breakfast had to be got through somehow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you did, too,&rdquo; the other asserted warmly. &ldquo;There was
Maggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never had anything to do with her. Never danced with her except that one
night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s just what did it,&rdquo; Jim cried out.
&ldquo;You just danced with her an&rsquo; looked at her, an&rsquo; it was all
off. Of course you didn&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo; by it, but it settled me for
keeps. Wouldn&rsquo;t look at me again. Always askin&rsquo; about you.
She&rsquo;d have made fast dates enough with you if you&rsquo;d wanted
to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t necessary. I was left at the pole.&rdquo; Jim looked at him
admiringly. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do it, anyway, Mart?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By not carin&rsquo; about &rsquo;em,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean makin&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieve you don&rsquo;t care about
them?&rdquo; Jim queried eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Martin considered for a moment, then answered, &ldquo;Perhaps that will do, but
with me I guess it&rsquo;s different. I never have cared&mdash;much. If you can
put it on, it&rsquo;s all right, most likely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should &rsquo;a&rsquo; ben up at Riley&rsquo;s barn last
night,&rdquo; Jim announced inconsequently. &ldquo;A lot of the fellers put on
the gloves. There was a peach from West Oakland. They called &rsquo;m
&lsquo;The Rat.&rsquo; Slick as silk. No one could touch &rsquo;m. We was all
wishin&rsquo; you was there. Where was you anyway?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Down in Oakland,&rdquo; Martin replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To the show?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin shoved his plate away and got up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Comin&rsquo; to the dance to-night?&rdquo; the other called after him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
He went downstairs and out into the street, breathing great breaths of air. He
had been suffocating in that atmosphere, while the apprentice&rsquo;s chatter
had driven him frantic. There had been times when it was all he could do to
refrain from reaching over and mopping Jim&rsquo;s face in the mush-plate. The
more he had chattered, the more remote had Ruth seemed to him. How could he,
herding with such cattle, ever become worthy of her? He was appalled at the
problem confronting him, weighted down by the incubus of his working-class
station. Everything reached out to hold him down&mdash;his sister, his
sister&rsquo;s house and family, Jim the apprentice, everybody he knew, every
tie of life. Existence did not taste good in his mouth. Up to then he had
accepted existence, as he had lived it with all about him, as a good thing. He
had never questioned it, except when he read books; but then, they were only
books, fairy stories of a fairer and impossible world. But now he had seen that
world, possible and real, with a flower of a woman called Ruth in the midmost
centre of it; and thenceforth he must know bitter tastes, and longings sharp as
pain, and hopelessness that tantalized because it fed on hope.
</p>

<p>
He had debated between the Berkeley Free Library and the Oakland Free Library,
and decided upon the latter because Ruth lived in Oakland. Who could
tell?&mdash;a library was a most likely place for her, and he might see her
there. He did not know the way of libraries, and he wandered through endless
rows of fiction, till the delicate-featured French-looking girl who seemed in
charge, told him that the reference department was upstairs. He did not know
enough to ask the man at the desk, and began his adventures in the philosophy
alcove. He had heard of book philosophy, but had not imagined there had been so
much written about it. The high, bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and
at the same time stimulated him. Here was work for the vigor of his brain. He
found books on trigonometry in the mathematics section, and ran the pages, and
stared at the meaningless formulas and figures. He could read English, but he
saw there an alien speech. Norman and Arthur knew that speech. He had heard
them talking it. And they were her brothers. He left the alcove in despair.
From every side the books seemed to press upon him and crush him.
</p>

<p>
He had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big. He was
frightened. How could his brain ever master it all? Later, he remembered that
there were other men, many men, who had mastered it; and he breathed a great
oath, passionately, under his breath, swearing that his brain could do what
theirs had done.
</p>

<p>
And so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation as he stared
at the shelves packed with wisdom. In one miscellaneous section he came upon a
&ldquo;Norrie&rsquo;s Epitome.&rdquo; He turned the pages reverently. In a way,
it spoke a kindred speech. Both he and it were of the sea. Then he found a
&ldquo;Bowditch&rdquo; and books by Lecky and Marshall. There it was; he would
teach himself navigation. He would quit drinking, work up, and become a
captain. Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment. As a captain, he could
marry her (if she would have him). And if she wouldn&rsquo;t, well&mdash;he
would live a good life among men, because of Her, and he would quit drinking
anyway. Then he remembered the underwriters and the owners, the two masters a
captain must serve, either of which could and would break him and whose
interests were diametrically opposed. He cast his eyes about the room and
closed the lids down on a vision of ten thousand books. No; no more of the sea
for him. There was power in all that wealth of books, and if he would do great
things, he must do them on the land. Besides, captains were not allowed to take
their wives to sea with them.
</p>

<p>
Noon came, and afternoon. He forgot to eat, and sought on for the books on
etiquette; for, in addition to career, his mind was vexed by a simple and very
concrete problem: <i>When you meet a young lady and she asks you to call, how
soon can you call</i>? was the way he worded it to himself. But when he found
the right shelf, he sought vainly for the answer. He was appalled at the vast
edifice of etiquette, and lost himself in the mazes of visiting-card conduct
between persons in polite society. He abandoned his search. He had not found
what he wanted, though he had found that it would take all of a man&rsquo;s
time to be polite, and that he would have to live a preliminary life in which
to learn how to be polite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you find what you wanted?&rdquo; the man at the desk asked him as he
was leaving.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You have a fine library
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man nodded. &ldquo;We should be glad to see you here often. Are you a
sailor?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll come again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now, how did he know that? he asked himself as he went down the stairs.
</p>

<p>
And for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and straight and
awkwardly, until he forgot himself in his thoughts, whereupon his rolling gait
gracefully returned to him.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>
A terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden. He was
famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands had gripped his life with
a giant&rsquo;s grasp. He could not steel himself to call upon her. He was
afraid that he might call too soon, and so be guilty of an awful breach of that
awful thing called etiquette. He spent long hours in the Oakland and Berkeley
libraries, and made out application blanks for membership for himself, his
sisters Gertrude and Marian, and Jim, the latter&rsquo;s consent being obtained
at the expense of several glasses of beer. With four cards permitting him to
draw books, he burned the gas late in the servant&rsquo;s room, and was charged
fifty cents a week for it by Mr. Higginbotham.
</p>

<p>
The many books he read but served to whet his unrest. Every page of every book
was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge. His hunger fed upon what he read,
and increased. Also, he did not know where to begin, and continually suffered
from lack of preparation. The commonest references, that he could see plainly
every reader was expected to know, he did not know. And the same was true of
the poetry he read which maddened him with delight. He read more of Swinburne
than was contained in the volume Ruth had lent him; and &ldquo;Dolores&rdquo;
he understood thoroughly. But surely Ruth did not understand it, he concluded.
How could she, living the refined life she did? Then he chanced upon
Kipling&rsquo;s poems, and was swept away by the lilt and swing and glamour
with which familiar things had been invested. He was amazed at the man&rsquo;s
sympathy with life and at his incisive psychology. <i>Psychology</i> was a new
word in Martin&rsquo;s vocabulary. He had bought a dictionary, which deed had
decreased his supply of money and brought nearer the day on which he must sail
in search of more. Also, it incensed Mr. Higginbotham, who would have preferred
the money taking the form of board.
</p>

<p>
He dared not go near Ruth&rsquo;s neighborhood in the daytime, but night found
him lurking like a thief around the Morse home, stealing glimpses at the
windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her. Several times he barely
escaped being caught by her brothers, and once he trailed Mr. Morse down town
and studied his face in the lighted streets, longing all the while for some
quick danger of death to threaten so that he might spring in and save her
father. On another night, his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a
second-story window. He saw only her head and shoulders, and her arms raised as
she fixed her hair before a mirror. It was only for a moment, but it was a long
moment to him, during which his blood turned to wine and sang through his
veins. Then she pulled down the shade. But it was her room&mdash;he had learned
that; and thereafter he strayed there often, hiding under a dark tree on the
opposite side of the street and smoking countless cigarettes. One afternoon he
saw her mother coming out of a bank, and received another proof of the enormous
distance that separated Ruth from him. She was of the class that dealt with
banks. He had never been inside a bank in his life, and he had an idea that
such institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very powerful.
</p>

<p>
In one way, he had undergone a moral revolution. Her cleanness and purity had
reacted upon him, and he felt in his being a crying need to be clean. He must
be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing the same air with her. He
washed his teeth, and scrubbed his hands with a kitchen scrub-brush till he saw
a nail-brush in a drug-store window and divined its use. While purchasing it,
the clerk glanced at his nails, suggested a nail-file, and so he became
possessed of an additional toilet-tool. He ran across a book in the library on
the care of the body, and promptly developed a penchant for a cold-water bath
every morning, much to the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment of Mr.
Higginbotham, who was not in sympathy with such high-fangled notions and who
seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin extra for the water.
Another stride was in the direction of creased trousers. Now that Martin was
aroused in such matters, he swiftly noted the difference between the baggy
knees of the trousers worn by the working class and the straight line from knee
to foot of those worn by the men above the working class. Also, he learned the
reason why, and invaded his sister&rsquo;s kitchen in search of irons and
ironing-board. He had misadventures at first, hopelessly burning one pair and
buying another, which expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he must
put to sea.
</p>

<p>
But the reform went deeper than mere outward appearance. He still smoked, but
he drank no more. Up to that time, drinking had seemed to him the proper thing
for men to do, and he had prided himself on his strong head which enabled him
to drink most men under the table. Whenever he encountered a chance shipmate,
and there were many in San Francisco, he treated them and was treated in turn,
as of old, but he ordered for himself root beer or ginger ale and
good-naturedly endured their chaffing. And as they waxed maudlin he studied
them, watching the beast rise and master them and thanking God that he was no
longer as they. They had their limitations to forget, and when they were drunk,
their dim, stupid spirits were even as gods, and each ruled in his heaven of
intoxicated desire. With Martin the need for strong drink had vanished. He was
drunken in new and more profound ways&mdash;with Ruth, who had fired him with
love and with a glimpse of higher and eternal life; with books, that had set a
myriad maggots of desire gnawing in his brain; and with the sense of personal
cleanliness he was achieving, that gave him even more superb health than what
he had enjoyed and that made his whole body sing with physical well-being.
</p>

<p>
One night he went to the theatre, on the blind chance that he might see her
there, and from the second balcony he did see her. He saw her come down the
aisle, with Arthur and a strange young man with a football mop of hair and
eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him to instant apprehension and jealousy.
He saw her take her seat in the orchestra circle, and little else than her did
he see that night&mdash;a pair of slender white shoulders and a mass of pale
gold hair, dim with distance. But there were others who saw, and now and again,
glancing at those about him, he noted two young girls who looked back from the
row in front, a dozen seats along, and who smiled at him with bold eyes. He had
always been easy-going. It was not in his nature to give rebuff. In the old
days he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged smiling. But
now it was different. He did smile back, then looked away, and looked no more
deliberately. But several times, forgetting the existence of the two girls, his
eyes caught their smiles. He could not re-thumb himself in a day, nor could he
violate the intrinsic kindliness of his nature; so, at such moments, he smiled
at the girls in warm human friendliness. It was nothing new to him. He knew
they were reaching out their woman&rsquo;s hands to him. But it was different
now. Far down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world,
so different, so terrifically different, from these two girls of his class,
that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow. He had it in his heart to
wish that they could possess, in some small measure, her goodness and glory.
And not for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching. He was
not flattered by it; he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness that
permitted it. He knew, did he belong in Ruth&rsquo;s class, that there would be
no overtures from these girls; and with each glance of theirs he felt the
fingers of his own class clutching at him to hold him down.
</p>

<p>
He left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act, intent on seeing
Her as she passed out. There were always numbers of men who stood on the
sidewalk outside, and he could pull his cap down over his eyes and screen
himself behind some one&rsquo;s shoulder so that she should not see him. He
emerged from the theatre with the first of the crowd; but scarcely had he taken
his position on the edge of the sidewalk when the two girls appeared. They were
looking for him, he knew; and for the moment he could have cursed that in him
which drew women. Their casual edging across the sidewalk to the curb, as they
drew near, apprised him of discovery. They slowed down, and were in the thick
of the crowd as they came up with him. One of them brushed against him and
apparently for the first time noticed him. She was a slender, dark girl, with
black, defiant eyes. But they smiled at him, and he smiled back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
It was automatic; he had said it so often before under similar circumstances of
first meetings. Besides, he could do no less. There was that large tolerance
and sympathy in his nature that would permit him to do no less. The black-eyed
girl smiled gratification and greeting, and showed signs of stopping, while her
companion, arm linked in arm, giggled and likewise showed signs of halting. He
thought quickly. It would never do for Her to come out and see him talking
there with them. Quite naturally, as a matter of course, he swung in along-side
the dark-eyed one and walked with her. There was no awkwardness on his part, no
numb tongue. He was at home here, and he held his own royally in the badinage,
bristling with slang and sharpness, that was always the preliminary to getting
acquainted in these swift-moving affairs. At the corner where the main stream
of people flowed onward, he started to edge out into the cross street. But the
girl with the black eyes caught his arm, following him and dragging her
companion after her, as she cried:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on, Bill! What&rsquo;s yer rush? You&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to
shake us so sudden as all that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He halted with a laugh, and turned, facing them. Across their shoulders he
could see the moving throng passing under the street lamps. Where he stood it
was not so light, and, unseen, he would be able to see Her as she passed by.
She would certainly pass by, for that way led home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo; he asked of the giggling girl, nodding at
the dark-eyed one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ask her,&rdquo; was the convulsed response.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; he demanded, turning squarely on the girl in
question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t told me yours, yet,&rdquo; she retorted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never asked it,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Besides, you guessed the
first rattle. It&rsquo;s Bill, all right, all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aw, go &rsquo;long with you.&rdquo; She looked him in the eyes, her own
sharply passionate and inviting. &ldquo;What is it, honest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again she looked. All the centuries of woman since sex began were eloquent in
her eyes. And he measured her in a careless way, and knew, bold now, that she
would begin to retreat, coyly and delicately, as he pursued, ever ready to
reverse the game should he turn fainthearted. And, too, he was human, and could
feel the draw of her, while his ego could not but appreciate the flattery of
her kindness. Oh, he knew it all, and knew them well, from A to Z. Good, as
goodness might be measured in their particular class, hard-working for meagre
wages and scorning the sale of self for easier ways, nervously desirous for
some small pinch of happiness in the desert of existence, and facing a future
that was a gamble between the ugliness of unending toil and the black pit of
more terrible wretchedness, the way whereto being briefer though better paid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; he answered, nodding his head. &ldquo;Sure, Pete, Bill
an&rsquo; no other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No joshin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she queried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t Bill at all,&rdquo; the other broke in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You never laid eyes on me
before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No need to, to know you&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was the retort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Straight, Bill, what is it?&rdquo; the first girl asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bill&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he confessed.
</p>

<p>
She reached out to his arm and shook him playfully. &ldquo;I knew you was
lyin&rsquo;, but you look good to me just the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He captured the hand that invited, and felt on the palm familiar markings and
distortions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When&rsquo;d you chuck the cannery?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d yeh know?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;My, ain&rsquo;t cheh a
mind-reader!&rdquo; the girls chorussed.
</p>

<p>
And while he exchanged the stupidities of stupid minds with them, before his
inner sight towered the book-shelves of the library, filled with the wisdom of
the ages. He smiled bitterly at the incongruity of it, and was assailed by
doubts. But between inner vision and outward pleasantry he found time to watch
the theatre crowd streaming by. And then he saw Her, under the lights, between
her brother and the strange young man with glasses, and his heart seemed to
stand still. He had waited long for this moment. He had time to note the light,
fluffy something that hid her queenly head, the tasteful lines of her wrapped
figure, the gracefulness of her carriage and of the hand that caught up her
skirts; and then she was gone and he was left staring at the two girls of the
cannery, at their tawdry attempts at prettiness of dress, their tragic efforts
to be clean and trim, the cheap cloth, the cheap ribbons, and the cheap rings
on the fingers. He felt a tug at his arm, and heard a voice saying:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wake up, Bill! What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was you sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the dark girl answered, with a toss of her
head. &ldquo;I was only remarkin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I was whisperin&rsquo; it&rsquo;d be a good idea if you could dig
up a gentleman friend&mdash;for her&rdquo; (indicating her companion),
&ldquo;and then, we could go off an&rsquo; have ice-cream soda somewhere, or
coffee, or anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was afflicted by a sudden spiritual nausea. The transition from Ruth to this
had been too abrupt. Ranged side by side with the bold, defiant eyes of the
girl before him, he saw Ruth&rsquo;s clear, luminous eyes, like a
saint&rsquo;s, gazing at him out of unplumbed depths of purity. And, somehow,
he felt within him a stir of power. He was better than this. Life meant more to
him than it meant to these two girls whose thoughts did not go beyond ice-cream
and a gentleman friend. He remembered that he had led always a secret life in
his thoughts. These thoughts he had tried to share, but never had he found a
woman capable of understanding&mdash;nor a man. He had tried, at times, but had
only puzzled his listeners. And as his thoughts had been beyond them, so, he
argued now, he must be beyond them. He felt power move in him, and clenched his
fists. If life meant more to him, then it was for him to demand more from life,
but he could not demand it from such companionship as this. Those bold black
eyes had nothing to offer. He knew the thoughts behind them&mdash;of ice-cream
and of something else. But those saint&rsquo;s eyes alongside&mdash;they
offered all he knew and more than he could guess. They offered books and
painting, beauty and repose, and all the fine elegance of higher existence.
Behind those black eyes he knew every thought process. It was like clockwork.
He could watch every wheel go around. Their bid was low pleasure, narrow as the
grave, that palled, and the grave was at the end of it. But the bid of the
saint&rsquo;s eyes was mystery, and wonder unthinkable, and eternal life. He
had caught glimpses of the soul in them, and glimpses of his own soul, too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing wrong with the programme,&rdquo; he said
aloud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a date already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl&rsquo;s eyes blazed her disappointment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To sit up with a sick friend, I suppose?&rdquo; she sneered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, a real, honest date with&mdash;&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;with a
girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stringin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; she asked earnestly.
</p>

<p>
He looked her in the eyes and answered: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s straight, all right.
But why can&rsquo;t we meet some other time? You ain&rsquo;t told me your name
yet. An&rsquo; where d&rsquo;ye live?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lizzie,&rdquo; she replied, softening toward him, her hand pressing his
arm, while her body leaned against his. &ldquo;Lizzie Connolly. And I live at
Fifth an&rsquo; Market.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He talked on a few minutes before saying good night. He did not go home
immediately; and under the tree where he kept his vigils he looked up at a
window and murmured: &ldquo;That date was with you, Ruth. I kept it for
you.&rdquo;

<h2><a name="chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>
A week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met Ruth Morse,
and still he dared not call. Time and again he nerved himself up to call, but
under the doubts that assailed him his determination died away. He did not know
the proper time to call, nor was there any one to tell him, and he was afraid
of committing himself to an irretrievable blunder. Having shaken himself free
from his old companions and old ways of life, and having no new companions,
nothing remained for him but to read, and the long hours he devoted to it would
have ruined a dozen pairs of ordinary eyes. But his eyes were strong, and they
were backed by a body superbly strong. Furthermore, his mind was fallow. It had
lain fallow all his life so far as the abstract thought of the books was
concerned, and it was ripe for the sowing. It had never been jaded by study,
and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with sharp teeth that would not
let go.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him, by the end of the week, that he had lived centuries, so far
behind were the old life and outlook. But he was baffled by lack of
preparation. He attempted to read books that required years of preliminary
specialization. One day he would read a book of antiquated philosophy, and the
next day one that was ultra-modern, so that his head would be whirling with the
conflict and contradiction of ideas. It was the same with the economists. On
the one shelf at the library he found Karl Marx, Ricardo, Adam Smith, and Mill,
and the abstruse formulas of the one gave no clew that the ideas of another
were obsolete. He was bewildered, and yet he wanted to know. He had become
interested, in a day, in economics, industry, and politics. Passing through the
City Hall Park, he had noticed a group of men, in the centre of which were half
a dozen, with flushed faces and raised voices, earnestly carrying on a
discussion. He joined the listeners, and heard a new, alien tongue in the
mouths of the philosophers of the people. One was a tramp, another was a labor
agitator, a third was a law-school student, and the remainder was composed of
wordy workingmen. For the first time he heard of socialism, anarchism, and
single tax, and learned that there were warring social philosophies. He heard
hundreds of technical words that were new to him, belonging to fields of
thought that his meagre reading had never touched upon. Because of this he
could not follow the arguments closely, and he could only guess at and surmise
the ideas wrapped up in such strange expressions. Then there was a black-eyed
restaurant waiter who was a theosophist, a union baker who was an agnostic, an
old man who baffled all of them with the strange philosophy that <i>what is is
right</i>, and another old man who discoursed interminably about the cosmos and
the father-atom and the mother-atom.
</p>

<p>
Martin Eden&rsquo;s head was in a state of addlement when he went away after
several hours, and he hurried to the library to look up the definitions of a
dozen unusual words. And when he left the library, he carried under his arm
four volumes: Madam Blavatsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Secret Doctrine,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Progress and Poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Quintessence of
Socialism,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Warfare of Religion and Science.&rdquo;
Unfortunately, he began on the &ldquo;Secret Doctrine.&rdquo; Every line
bristled with many-syllabled words he did not understand. He sat up in bed, and
the dictionary was in front of him more often than the book. He looked up so
many new words that when they recurred, he had forgotten their meaning and had
to look them up again. He devised the plan of writing the definitions in a
note-book, and filled page after page with them. And still he could not
understand. He read until three in the morning, and his brain was in a turmoil,
but not one essential thought in the text had he grasped. He looked up, and it
seemed that the room was lifting, heeling, and plunging like a ship upon the
sea. Then he hurled the &ldquo;Secret Doctrine&rdquo; and many curses across
the room, turned off the gas, and composed himself to sleep. Nor did he have
much better luck with the other three books. It was not that his brain was weak
or incapable; it could think these thoughts were it not for lack of training in
thinking and lack of the thought-tools with which to think. He guessed this,
and for a while entertained the idea of reading nothing but the dictionary
until he had mastered every word in it.
</p>

<p>
Poetry, however, was his solace, and he read much of it, finding his greatest
joy in the simpler poets, who were more understandable. He loved beauty, and
there he found beauty. Poetry, like music, stirred him profoundly, and, though
he did not know it, he was preparing his mind for the heavier work that was to
come. The pages of his mind were blank, and, without effort, much he read and
liked, stanza by stanza, was impressed upon those pages, so that he was soon
able to extract great joy from chanting aloud or under his breath the music and
the beauty of the printed words he had read. Then he stumbled upon
Gayley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Classic Myths&rdquo; and Bulfinch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Age of
Fable,&rdquo; side by side on a library shelf. It was illumination, a great
light in the darkness of his ignorance, and he read poetry more avidly than
ever.
</p>

<p>
The man at the desk in the library had seen Martin there so often that he had
become quite cordial, always greeting him with a smile and a nod when he
entered. It was because of this that Martin did a daring thing. Drawing out
some books at the desk, and while the man was stamping the cards, Martin
blurted out:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to ask you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man smiled and paid attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you meet a young lady an&rsquo; she asks you to call, how soon can
you call?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin felt his shirt press and cling to his shoulders, what of the sweat of
the effort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why I&rsquo;d say any time,&rdquo; the man answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but this is different,&rdquo; Martin objected.
&ldquo;She&mdash;I&mdash;well, you see, it&rsquo;s this way: maybe she
won&rsquo;t be there. She goes to the university.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then call again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I said ain&rsquo;t what I meant,&rdquo; Martin confessed
falteringly, while he made up his mind to throw himself wholly upon the
other&rsquo;s mercy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a rough sort of a fellow, an&rsquo;
I ain&rsquo;t never seen anything of society. This girl is all that I
ain&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t anything that she is. You don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m playin&rsquo; the fool, do you?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; not at all, I assure you,&rdquo; the other protested.
&ldquo;Your request is not exactly in the scope of the reference department,
but I shall be only too pleased to assist you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin looked at him admiringly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I could tear it off that way, I&rsquo;d be all right,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg pardon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean if I could talk easy that way, an&rsquo; polite, an&rsquo; all
the rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the other, with comprehension.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the best time to call? The afternoon?&mdash;not too close to
meal-time? Or the evening? Or Sunday?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; the librarian said with a brightening face.
&ldquo;You call her up on the telephone and find out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said, picking up his books and starting
away.
</p>

<p>
He turned back and asked:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re speakin&rsquo; to a young lady&mdash;say, for
instance, Miss Lizzie Smith&mdash;do you say &lsquo;Miss Lizzie&rsquo;? or
&lsquo;Miss Smith&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say &lsquo;Miss Smith,&rsquo;&rdquo; the librarian stated
authoritatively. &ldquo;Say &lsquo;Miss Smith&rsquo; always&mdash;until you
come to know her better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So it was that Martin Eden solved the problem.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come down any time; I&rsquo;ll be at home all afternoon,&rdquo; was
Ruth&rsquo;s reply over the telephone to his stammered request as to when he
could return the borrowed books.
</p>

<p>
She met him at the door herself, and her woman&rsquo;s eyes took in immediately
the creased trousers and the certain slight but indefinable change in him for
the better. Also, she was struck by his face. It was almost violent, this
health of his, and it seemed to rush out of him and at her in waves of force.
She felt the urge again of the desire to lean toward him for warmth, and
marvelled again at the effect his presence produced upon her. And he, in turn,
knew again the swimming sensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand
in greeting. The difference between them lay in that she was cool and
self-possessed while his face flushed to the roots of the hair. He stumbled
with his old awkwardness after her, and his shoulders swung and lurched
perilously.
</p>

<p>
Once they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on easily&mdash;more
easily by far than he had expected. She made it easy for him; and the gracious
spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than ever. They
talked first of the borrowed books, of the Swinburne he was devoted to, and of
the Browning he did not understand; and she led the conversation on from
subject to subject, while she pondered the problem of how she could be of help
to him. She had thought of this often since their first meeting. She wanted to
help him. He made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever made
before, and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal in her. Her
pity could not be of the common sort, when the man who drew it was so much man
as to shock her with maidenly fears and set her mind and pulse thrilling with
strange thoughts and feelings. The old fascination of his neck was there, and
there was sweetness in the thought of laying her hands upon it. It seemed still
a wanton impulse, but she had grown more used to it. She did not dream that in
such guise new-born love would epitomize itself. Nor did she dream that the
feeling he excited in her was love. She thought she was merely interested in
him as an unusual type possessing various potential excellencies, and she even
felt philanthropic about it.
</p>

<p>
She did not know she desired him; but with him it was different. He knew that
he loved her, and he desired her as he had never before desired anything in his
life. He had loved poetry for beauty&rsquo;s sake; but since he met her the
gates to the vast field of love-poetry had been opened wide. She had given him
understanding even more than Bulfinch and Gayley. There was a line that a week
before he would not have favored with a second thought&mdash;&ldquo;God&rsquo;s
own mad lover dying on a kiss&rdquo;; but now it was ever insistent in his
mind. He marvelled at the wonder of it and the truth; and as he gazed upon her
he knew that he could die gladly upon a kiss. He felt himself God&rsquo;s own
mad lover, and no accolade of knighthood could have given him greater pride.
And at last he knew the meaning of life and why he had been born.
</p>

<p>
As he gazed at her and listened, his thoughts grew daring. He reviewed all the
wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his at the door, and longed for it
again. His gaze wandered often toward her lips, and he yearned for them
hungrily. But there was nothing gross or earthly about this yearning. It gave
him exquisite delight to watch every movement and play of those lips as they
enunciated the words she spoke; yet they were not ordinary lips such as all men
and women had. Their substance was not mere human clay. They were lips of pure
spirit, and his desire for them seemed absolutely different from the desire
that had led him to other women&rsquo;s lips. He could kiss her lips, rest his
own physical lips upon them, but it would be with the lofty and awful fervor
with which one would kiss the robe of God. He was not conscious of this
transvaluation of values that had taken place in him, and was unaware that the
light that shone in his eyes when he looked at her was quite the same light
that shines in all men&rsquo;s eyes when the desire of love is upon them. He
did not dream how ardent and masculine his gaze was, nor that the warm flame of
it was affecting the alchemy of her spirit. Her penetrative virginity exalted
and disguised his own emotions, elevating his thoughts to a star-cool chastity,
and he would have been startled to learn that there was that shining out of his
eyes, like warm waves, that flowed through her and kindled a kindred warmth.
She was subtly perturbed by it, and more than once, though she knew not why, it
disrupted her train of thought with its delicious intrusion and compelled her
to grope for the remainder of ideas partly uttered. Speech was always easy with
her, and these interruptions would have puzzled her had she not decided that it
was because he was a remarkable type. She was very sensitive to impressions,
and it was not strange, after all, that this aura of a traveller from another
world should so affect her.
</p>

<p>
The problem in the background of her consciousness was how to help him, and she
turned the conversation in that direction; but it was Martin who came to the
point first.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if I can get some advice from you,&rdquo; he began, and
received an acquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound. &ldquo;You
remember the other time I was here I said I couldn&rsquo;t talk about books
an&rsquo; things because I didn&rsquo;t know how? Well, I&rsquo;ve ben
doin&rsquo; a lot of thinkin&rsquo; ever since. I&rsquo;ve ben to the library a
whole lot, but most of the books I&rsquo;ve tackled have ben over my head.
Mebbe I&rsquo;d better begin at the beginnin&rsquo;. I ain&rsquo;t never had no
advantages. I&rsquo;ve worked pretty hard ever since I was a kid, an&rsquo;
since I&rsquo;ve ben to the library, lookin&rsquo; with new eyes at
books&mdash;an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; at new books, too&mdash;I&rsquo;ve just
about concluded that I ain&rsquo;t ben reading the right kind. You know the
books you find in cattle-camps an&rsquo; fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;ls
ain&rsquo;t the same you&rsquo;ve got in this house, for instance. Well,
that&rsquo;s the sort of readin&rsquo; matter I&rsquo;ve ben accustomed to. And
yet&mdash;an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t just makin&rsquo; a brag of
it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve ben different from the people I&rsquo;ve herded with. Not
that I&rsquo;m any better than the sailors an&rsquo; cow-punchers I travelled
with,&mdash;I was cow-punchin&rsquo; for a short time, you know,&mdash;but I
always liked books, read everything I could lay hands on, an&rsquo;&mdash;well,
I guess I think differently from most of &rsquo;em.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, to come to what I&rsquo;m drivin&rsquo; at. I was never inside a
house like this. When I come a week ago, an&rsquo; saw all this, an&rsquo; you,
an&rsquo; your mother, an&rsquo; brothers, an&rsquo; everything&mdash;well, I
liked it. I&rsquo;d heard about such things an&rsquo; read about such things in
some of the books, an&rsquo; when I looked around at your house, why, the books
come true. But the thing I&rsquo;m after is I liked it. I wanted it. I want it
now. I want to breathe air like you get in this house&mdash;air that is filled
with books, and pictures, and beautiful things, where people talk in low voices
an&rsquo; are clean, an&rsquo; their thoughts are clean. The air I always
breathed was mixed up with grub an&rsquo; house-rent an&rsquo; scrappin&rsquo;
an booze an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all they talked about, too. Why, when you was
crossin&rsquo; the room to kiss your mother, I thought it was the most
beautiful thing I ever seen. I&rsquo;ve seen a whole lot of life, an&rsquo;
somehow I&rsquo;ve seen a whole lot more of it than most of them that was with
me. I like to see, an&rsquo; I want to see more, an&rsquo; I want to see it
different.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t got to the point yet. Here it is. I want to make my
way to the kind of life you have in this house. There&rsquo;s more in life than
booze, an&rsquo; hard work, an&rsquo; knockin&rsquo; about. Now, how am I
goin&rsquo; to get it? Where do I take hold an&rsquo; begin? I&rsquo;m
willin&rsquo; to work my passage, you know, an&rsquo; I can make most men sick
when it comes to hard work. Once I get started, I&rsquo;ll work night an&rsquo;
day. Mebbe you think it&rsquo;s funny, me askin&rsquo; you about all this. I
know you&rsquo;re the last person in the world I ought to ask, but I
don&rsquo;t know anybody else I could ask&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s Arthur. Mebbe
I ought to ask him. If I was&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His voice died away. His firmly planned intention had come to a halt on the
verge of the horrible probability that he should have asked Arthur and that he
had made a fool of himself. Ruth did not speak immediately. She was too
absorbed in striving to reconcile the stumbling, uncouth speech and its
simplicity of thought with what she saw in his face. She had never looked in
eyes that expressed greater power. Here was a man who could do anything, was
the message she read there, and it accorded ill with the weakness of his spoken
thought. And for that matter so complex and quick was her own mind that she did
not have a just appreciation of simplicity. And yet she had caught an
impression of power in the very groping of this mind. It had seemed to her like
a giant writhing and straining at the bonds that held him down. Her face was
all sympathy when she did speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What you need, you realize yourself, and it is education. You should go
back and finish grammar school, and then go through to high school and
university.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that takes money,&rdquo; he interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I had not thought of that. But then you
have relatives, somebody who could assist you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My father and mother are dead. I&rsquo;ve two sisters, one married,
an&rsquo; the other&rsquo;ll get married soon, I suppose. Then I&rsquo;ve a
string of brothers,&mdash;I&rsquo;m the youngest,&mdash;but they never helped
nobody. They&rsquo;ve just knocked around over the world, lookin&rsquo; out for
number one. The oldest died in India. Two are in South Africa now, an&rsquo;
another&rsquo;s on a whaling voyage, an&rsquo; one&rsquo;s travellin&rsquo;
with a circus&mdash;he does trapeze work. An&rsquo; I guess I&rsquo;m just like
them. I&rsquo;ve taken care of myself since I was eleven&mdash;that&rsquo;s
when my mother died. I&rsquo;ve got to study by myself, I guess, an&rsquo; what
I want to know is where to begin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should say the first thing of all would be to get a grammar. Your
grammar is&mdash;&rdquo; She had intended saying &ldquo;awful,&rdquo; but she
amended it to &ldquo;is not particularly good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He flushed and sweated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know I must talk a lot of slang an&rsquo; words you don&rsquo;t
understand. But then they&rsquo;re the only words I know&mdash;how to speak.
I&rsquo;ve got other words in my mind, picked &rsquo;em up from books, but I
can&rsquo;t pronounce &rsquo;em, so I don&rsquo;t use &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what you say, so much as how you say it. You don&rsquo;t
mind my being frank, do you? I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he cried, while he secretly blessed her for her kindness.
&ldquo;Fire away. I&rsquo;ve got to know, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d sooner know from
you than anybody else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, you say, &lsquo;You was&rsquo;; it should be, &lsquo;You
were.&rsquo; You say &lsquo;I seen&rsquo; for &lsquo;I saw.&rsquo; You use the
double negative&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the double negative?&rdquo; he demanded; then added humbly,
&ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t even understand your explanations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t explain that,&rdquo; she smiled.
&ldquo;A double negative is&mdash;let me see&mdash;well, you say, &lsquo;never
helped nobody.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never&rsquo; is a negative. &lsquo;Nobody&rsquo;
is another negative. It is a rule that two negatives make a positive.
&lsquo;Never helped nobody&rsquo; means that, not helping nobody, they must
have helped somebody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty clear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never thought of it
before. But it don&rsquo;t mean they <i>must</i> have helped somebody, does it?
Seems to me that &lsquo;never helped nobody&rsquo; just naturally fails to say
whether or not they helped somebody. I never thought of it before, and
I&rsquo;ll never say it again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was pleased and surprised with the quickness and surety of his mind. As
soon as he had got the clew he not only understood but corrected her error.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it all in the grammar,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else I noticed in your speech. You say
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; when you shouldn&rsquo;t. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&rsquo;
is a contraction and stands for two words. Do you know them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought a moment, then answered, &ldquo;&lsquo;Do not.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head, and said, &ldquo;And you use &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo;
when you mean &lsquo;does not.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was puzzled over this, and did not get it so quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me an illustration,&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; She puckered her brows and pursed up her mouth as she
thought, while he looked on and decided that her expression was most adorable.
&ldquo;&lsquo;It don&rsquo;t do to be hasty.&rsquo; Change
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; to &lsquo;do not,&rsquo; and it reads, &lsquo;It do
not do to be hasty,&rsquo; which is perfectly absurd.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned it over in his mind and considered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it jar on your ear?&rdquo; she suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say that it does,&rdquo; he replied judicially.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say, &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say that it
do&rsquo;?&rdquo; she queried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That sounds wrong,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;As for the other I
can&rsquo;t make up my mind. I guess my ear ain&rsquo;t had the trainin&rsquo;
yours has.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no such word as &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said,
prettily emphatic.
</p>

<p>
Martin flushed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you say &lsquo;ben&rsquo; for &lsquo;been,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
continued; &ldquo;&lsquo;come&rsquo; for &lsquo;came&rsquo;; and the way you
chop your endings is something dreadful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; He leaned forward, feeling that he ought to get
down on his knees before so marvellous a mind. &ldquo;How do I chop?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t complete the endings. &lsquo;A-n-d&rsquo; spells
&lsquo;and.&rsquo; You pronounce it &lsquo;an&rsquo;.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I-n-g&rsquo; spells &lsquo;ing.&rsquo; Sometimes you pronounce it
&lsquo;ing&rsquo; and sometimes you leave off the &lsquo;g.&rsquo; And then you
slur by dropping initial letters and diphthongs. &lsquo;T-h-e-m&rsquo; spells
&lsquo;them.&rsquo; You pronounce it&mdash;oh, well, it is not necessary to go
over all of them. What you need is the grammar. I&rsquo;ll get one and show you
how to begin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As she arose, there shot through his mind something that he had read in the
etiquette books, and he stood up awkwardly, worrying as to whether he was doing
the right thing, and fearing that she might take it as a sign that he was about
to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; she called back, as she was leaving the
room. &ldquo;What is <i>booze</i>? You used it several times, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, booze,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slang. It means whiskey
an&rsquo; beer&mdash;anything that will make you drunk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; she laughed back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use
&lsquo;you&rsquo; when you are impersonal. &lsquo;You&rsquo; is very personal,
and your use of it just now was not precisely what you meant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just see that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you said just now, to me, &lsquo;whiskey and beer&mdash;anything
that will make you drunk&rsquo;&mdash;make me drunk, don&rsquo;t you
see?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it would, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;But it would be nicer not to
bring me into it. Substitute &lsquo;one&rsquo; for &lsquo;you&rsquo; and see
how much better it sounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When she returned with the grammar, she drew a chair near his&mdash;he wondered
if he should have helped her with the chair&mdash;and sat down beside him. She
turned the pages of the grammar, and their heads were inclined toward each
other. He could hardly follow her outlining of the work he must do, so amazed
was he by her delightful propinquity. But when she began to lay down the
importance of conjugation, he forgot all about her. He had never heard of
conjugation, and was fascinated by the glimpse he was catching into the
tie-ribs of language. He leaned closer to the page, and her hair touched his
cheek. He had fainted but once in his life, and he thought he was going to
faint again. He could scarcely breathe, and his heart was pounding the blood up
into his throat and suffocating him. Never had she seemed so accessible as now.
For the moment the great gulf that separated them was bridged. But there was no
diminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her. She had not descended to
him. It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and carried to her. His
reverence for her, in that moment, was of the same order as religious awe and
fervor. It seemed to him that he had intruded upon the holy of holies, and
slowly and carefully he moved his head aside from the contact which thrilled
him like an electric shock and of which she had not been aware.

<h2><a name="chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>
Several weeks went by, during which Martin Eden studied his grammar, reviewed
the books on etiquette, and read voraciously the books that caught his fancy.
Of his own class he saw nothing. The girls of the Lotus Club wondered what had
become of him and worried Jim with questions, and some of the fellows who put
on the glove at Riley&rsquo;s were glad that Martin came no more. He made
another discovery of treasure-trove in the library. As the grammar had shown
him the tie-ribs of language, so that book showed him the tie-ribs of poetry,
and he began to learn metre and construction and form, beneath the beauty he
loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty. Another modern book he
found treated poetry as a representative art, treated it exhaustively, with
copious illustrations from the best in literature. Never had he read fiction
with so keen zest as he studied these books. And his fresh mind, untaxed for
twenty years and impelled by maturity of desire, gripped hold of what he read
with a virility unusual to the student mind.
</p>

<p>
When he looked back now from his vantage-ground, the old world he had known,
the world of land and sea and ships, of sailor-men and harpy-women, seemed a
very small world; and yet it blended in with this new world and expanded. His
mind made for unity, and he was surprised when at first he began to see points
of contact between the two worlds. And he was ennobled, as well, by the
loftiness of thought and beauty he found in the books. This led him to believe
more firmly than ever that up above him, in society like Ruth and her family,
all men and women thought these thoughts and lived them. Down below where he
lived was the ignoble, and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble that had
soiled all his days, and to rise to that sublimated realm where dwelt the upper
classes. All his childhood and youth had been troubled by a vague unrest; he
had never known what he wanted, but he had wanted something that he had hunted
vainly for until he met Ruth. And now his unrest had become sharp and painful,
and he knew at last, clearly and definitely, that it was beauty, and intellect,
and love that he must have.
</p>

<p>
During those several weeks he saw Ruth half a dozen times, and each time was an
added inspiration. She helped him with his English, corrected his
pronunciation, and started him on arithmetic. But their intercourse was not all
devoted to elementary study. He had seen too much of life, and his mind was too
matured, to be wholly content with fractions, cube root, parsing, and analysis;
and there were times when their conversation turned on other themes&mdash;the
last poetry he had read, the latest poet she had studied. And when she read
aloud to him her favorite passages, he ascended to the topmost heaven of
delight. Never, in all the women he had heard speak, had he heard a voice like
hers. The least sound of it was a stimulus to his love, and he thrilled and
throbbed with every word she uttered. It was the quality of it, the repose, and
the musical modulation&mdash;the soft, rich, indefinable product of culture and
a gentle soul. As he listened to her, there rang in the ears of his memory the
harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags, and, in lesser degrees of
harshness, the strident voices of working women and of the girls of his own
class. Then the chemistry of vision would begin to work, and they would troop
in review across his mind, each, by contrast, multiplying Ruth&rsquo;s glories.
Then, too, his bliss was heightened by the knowledge that her mind was
comprehending what she read and was quivering with appreciation of the beauty
of the written thought. She read to him much from &ldquo;The Princess,&rdquo;
and often he saw her eyes swimming with tears, so finely was her aesthetic
nature strung. At such moments her own emotions elevated him till he was as a
god, and, as he gazed at her and listened, he seemed gazing on the face of life
and reading its deepest secrets. And then, becoming aware of the heights of
exquisite sensibility he attained, he decided that this was love and that love
was the greatest thing in the world. And in review would pass along the
corridors of memory all previous thrills and burnings he had known,&mdash;the
drunkenness of wine, the caresses of women, the rough play and give and take of
physical contests,&mdash;and they seemed trivial and mean compared with this
sublime ardor he now enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
The situation was obscured to Ruth. She had never had any experiences of the
heart. Her only experiences in such matters were of the books, where the facts
of ordinary day were translated by fancy into a fairy realm of unreality; and
she little knew that this rough sailor was creeping into her heart and storing
there pent forces that would some day burst forth and surge through her in
waves of fire. She did not know the actual fire of love. Her knowledge of love
was purely theoretical, and she conceived of it as lambent flame, gentle as the
fall of dew or the ripple of quiet water, and cool as the velvet-dark of summer
nights. Her idea of love was more that of placid affection, serving the loved
one softly in an atmosphere, flower-scented and dim-lighted, of ethereal calm.
She did not dream of the volcanic convulsions of love, its scorching heat and
sterile wastes of parched ashes. She knew neither her own potencies, nor the
potencies of the world; and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion. The
conjugal affection of her father and mother constituted her ideal of
love-affinity, and she looked forward some day to emerging, without shock or
friction, into that same quiet sweetness of existence with a loved one.
</p>

<p>
So it was that she looked upon Martin Eden as a novelty, a strange individual,
and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects he produced upon
her. It was only natural. In similar ways she had experienced unusual feelings
when she looked at wild animals in the menagerie, or when she witnessed a storm
of wind, or shuddered at the bright-ribbed lightning. There was something
cosmic in such things, and there was something cosmic in him. He came to her
breathing of large airs and great spaces. The blaze of tropic suns was in his
face, and in his swelling, resilient muscles was the primordial vigor of life.
He was marred and scarred by that mysterious world of rough men and rougher
deeds, the outposts of which began beyond her horizon. He was untamed, wild,
and in secret ways her vanity was touched by the fact that he came so mildly to
her hand. Likewise she was stirred by the common impulse to tame the wild
thing. It was an unconscious impulse, and farthest from her thoughts that her
desire was to re-thumb the clay of him into a likeness of her father&rsquo;s
image, which image she believed to be the finest in the world. Nor was there
any way, out of her inexperience, for her to know that the cosmic feel she
caught of him was that most cosmic of things, love, which with equal power drew
men and women together across the world, compelled stags to kill each other in
the rutting season, and drove even the elements irresistibly to unite.
</p>

<p>
His swift development was a source of surprise and interest. She detected
unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud, day by day, like flowers in
congenial soil. She read Browning aloud to him, and was often puzzled by the
strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages. It was beyond her to
realize that, out of his experience of men and women and life, his
interpretations were far more frequently correct than hers. His conceptions
seemed naive to her, though she was often fired by his daring flights of
comprehension, whose orbit-path was so wide among the stars that she could not
follow and could only sit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power. Then she
played to him&mdash;no longer at him&mdash;and probed him with music that sank
to depths beyond her plumb-line. His nature opened to music as a flower to the
sun, and the transition was quick from his working-class rag-time and jingles
to her classical display pieces that she knew nearly by heart. Yet he betrayed
a democratic fondness for Wagner, and the &ldquo;Tannhäuser&rdquo; overture,
when she had given him the clew to it, claimed him as nothing else she played.
In an immediate way it personified his life. All his past was the
<i>Venusburg</i> motif, while her he identified somehow with the
<i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Chorus</i> motif; and from the exalted state this elevated
him to, he swept onward and upward into that vast shadow-realm of
spirit-groping, where good and evil war eternally.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he questioned, and induced in her mind temporary doubts as to the
correctness of her own definitions and conceptions of music. But her singing he
did not question. It was too wholly her, and he sat always amazed at the divine
melody of her pure soprano voice. And he could not help but contrast it with
the weak pipings and shrill quaverings of factory girls, ill-nourished and
untrained, and with the raucous shriekings from gin-cracked throats of the
women of the seaport towns. She enjoyed singing and playing to him. In truth,
it was the first time she had ever had a human soul to play with, and the
plastic clay of him was a delight to mould; for she thought she was moulding
it, and her intentions were good. Besides, it was pleasant to be with him. He
did not repel her. That first repulsion had been really a fear of her
undiscovered self, and the fear had gone to sleep. Though she did not know it,
she had a feeling in him of proprietary right. Also, he had a tonic effect upon
her. She was studying hard at the university, and it seemed to strengthen her
to emerge from the dusty books and have the fresh sea-breeze of his personality
blow upon her. Strength! Strength was what she needed, and he gave it to her in
generous measure. To come into the same room with him, or to meet him at the
door, was to take heart of life. And when he had gone, she would return to her
books with a keener zest and fresh store of energy.
</p>

<p>
She knew her Browning, but it had never sunk into her that it was an awkward
thing to play with souls. As her interest in Martin increased, the remodelling
of his life became a passion with her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is Mr. Butler,&rdquo; she said one afternoon, when grammar and
arithmetic and poetry had been put aside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He had comparatively no advantages at first. His father had been a bank
cashier, but he lingered for years, dying of consumption in Arizona, so that
when he was dead, Mr. Butler, Charles Butler he was called, found himself alone
in the world. His father had come from Australia, you know, and so he had no
relatives in California. He went to work in a printing-office,&mdash;I have
heard him tell of it many times,&mdash;and he got three dollars a week, at
first. His income to-day is at least thirty thousand a year. How did he do it?
He was honest, and faithful, and industrious, and economical. He denied himself
the enjoyments that most boys indulge in. He made it a point to save so much
every week, no matter what he had to do without in order to save it. Of course,
he was soon earning more than three dollars a week, and as his wages increased
he saved more and more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He worked in the daytime, and at night he went to night school. He had
his eyes fixed always on the future. Later on he went to night high school.
When he was only seventeen, he was earning excellent wages at setting type, but
he was ambitious. He wanted a career, not a livelihood, and he was content to
make immediate sacrifices for his ultimate gain. He decided upon the law, and
he entered father&rsquo;s office as an office boy&mdash;think of
that!&mdash;and got only four dollars a week. But he had learned how to be
economical, and out of that four dollars he went on saving money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused for breath, and to note how Martin was receiving it. His face was
lighted up with interest in the youthful struggles of Mr. Butler; but there was
a frown upon his face as well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say they was pretty hard lines for a young fellow,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;Four dollars a week! How could he live on it? You can bet he
didn&rsquo;t have any frills. Why, I pay five dollars a week for board now,
an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; excitin&rsquo; about it, you can lay to
that. He must have lived like a dog. The food he ate&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He cooked for himself,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;on a little
kerosene stove.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The food he ate must have been worse than what a sailor gets on the
worst-feedin&rsquo; deep-water ships, than which there ain&rsquo;t much that
can be possibly worse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But think of him now!&rdquo; she cried enthusiastically. &ldquo;Think of
what his income affords him. His early denials are paid for a
thousand-fold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin looked at her sharply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ll bet you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
it is that Mr. Butler is nothin&rsquo; gay-hearted now in his fat days. He fed
himself like that for years an&rsquo; years, on a boy&rsquo;s stomach,
an&rsquo; I bet his stomach&rsquo;s none too good now for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her eyes dropped before his searching gaze.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s got dyspepsia right now!&rdquo; Martin
challenged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; she confessed; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I bet,&rdquo; Martin dashed on, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s solemn
an&rsquo; serious as an old owl, an&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t care a rap for a good
time, for all his thirty thousand a year. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s
not particularly joyful at seein&rsquo; others have a good time. Ain&rsquo;t I
right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head in agreement, and hastened to explain:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he is not that type of man. By nature he is sober and serious. He
always was that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can bet he was,&rdquo; Martin proclaimed. &ldquo;Three dollars a
week, an&rsquo; four dollars a week, an&rsquo; a young boy cookin&rsquo; for
himself on an oil-burner an&rsquo; layin&rsquo; up money, workin&rsquo; all day
an&rsquo; studyin&rsquo; all night, just workin&rsquo; an&rsquo; never
playin&rsquo;, never havin&rsquo; a good time, an&rsquo; never learnin&rsquo;
how to have a good time&mdash;of course his thirty thousand came along too
late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His sympathetic imagination was flashing upon his inner sight all the thousands
of details of the boy&rsquo;s existence and of his narrow spiritual development
into a thirty-thousand-dollar-a-year man. With the swiftness and wide-reaching
of multitudinous thought Charles Butler&rsquo;s whole life was telescoped upon
his vision.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I feel sorry for Mr. Butler. He was
too young to know better, but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty
thousand a year that&rsquo;s clean wasted upon him. Why, thirty thousand, lump
sum, wouldn&rsquo;t buy for him right now what ten cents he was layin&rsquo; up
would have bought him, when he was a kid, in the way of candy an&rsquo; peanuts
or a seat in nigger heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was just such uniqueness of points of view that startled Ruth. Not only were
they new to her, and contrary to her own beliefs, but she always felt in them
germs of truth that threatened to unseat or modify her own convictions. Had she
been fourteen instead of twenty-four, she might have been changed by them; but
she was twenty-four, conservative by nature and upbringing, and already
crystallized into the cranny of life where she had been born and formed. It was
true, his bizarre judgments troubled her in the moments they were uttered, but
she ascribed them to his novelty of type and strangeness of living, and they
were soon forgotten. Nevertheless, while she disapproved of them, the strength
of their utterance, and the flashing of eyes and earnestness of face that
accompanied them, always thrilled her and drew her toward him. She would never
have guessed that this man who had come from beyond her horizon, was, in such
moments, flashing on beyond her horizon with wider and deeper concepts. Her own
limits were the limits of her horizon; but limited minds can recognize
limitations only in others. And so she felt that her outlook was very wide
indeed, and that where his conflicted with hers marked his limitations; and she
dreamed of helping him to see as she saw, of widening his horizon until it was
identified with hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I have not finished my story,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He worked, so
father says, as no other office boy he ever had. Mr. Butler was always eager to
work. He never was late, and he was usually at the office a few minutes before
his regular time. And yet he saved his time. Every spare moment was devoted to
study. He studied book-keeping and type-writing, and he paid for lessons in
shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter who needed practice. He
quickly became a clerk, and he made himself invaluable. Father appreciated him
and saw that he was bound to rise. It was on father&rsquo;s suggestion that he
went to law college. He became a lawyer, and hardly was he back in the office
when father took him in as junior partner. He is a great man. He refused the
United States Senate several times, and father says he could become a justice
of the Supreme Court any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to. Such a life is
an inspiration to all of us. It shows us that a man with will may rise superior
to his environment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a great man,&rdquo; Martin said sincerely.
</p>

<p>
But it seemed to him there was something in the recital that jarred upon his
sense of beauty and life. He could not find an adequate motive in Mr.
Butler&rsquo;s life of pinching and privation. Had he done it for love of a
woman, or for attainment of beauty, Martin would have understood. God&rsquo;s
own mad lover should do anything for the kiss, but not for thirty thousand
dollars a year. He was dissatisfied with Mr. Butler&rsquo;s career. There was
something paltry about it, after all. Thirty thousand a year was all right, but
dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed such princely income of all
its value.
</p>

<p>
Much of this he strove to express to Ruth, and shocked her and made it clear
that more remodelling was necessary. Hers was that common insularity of mind
that makes human creatures believe that their color, creed, and politics are
best and right and that other human creatures scattered over the world are less
fortunately placed than they. It was the same insularity of mind that made the
ancient Jew thank God he was not born a woman, and sent the modern missionary
god-substituting to the ends of the earth; and it made Ruth desire to shape
this man from other crannies of life into the likeness of the men who lived in
her particular cranny of life.

<h2><a name="chap09"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>
Back from sea Martin Eden came, homing for California with a lover&rsquo;s
desire. His store of money exhausted, he had shipped before the mast on the
treasure-hunting schooner; and the Solomon Islands, after eight months of
failure to find treasure, had witnessed the breaking up of the expedition. The
men had been paid off in Australia, and Martin had immediately shipped on a
deep-water vessel for San Francisco. Not alone had those eight months earned
him enough money to stay on land for many weeks, but they had enabled him to do
a great deal of studying and reading.
</p>

<p>
His was the student&rsquo;s mind, and behind his ability to learn was the
indomitability of his nature and his love for Ruth. The grammar he had taken
along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had mastered it.
He noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates, and made a point of mentally
correcting and reconstructing their crudities of speech. To his great joy he
discovered that his ear was becoming sensitive and that he was developing
grammatical nerves. A double negative jarred him like a discord, and often,
from lack of practice, it was from his own lips that the jar came. His tongue
refused to learn new tricks in a day.
</p>

<p>
After he had been through the grammar repeatedly, he took up the dictionary and
added twenty words a day to his vocabulary. He found that this was no light
task, and at wheel or lookout he steadily went over and over his lengthening
list of pronunciations and definitions, while he invariably memorized himself
to sleep. &ldquo;Never did anything,&rdquo; &ldquo;if I were,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;those things,&rdquo; were phrases, with many variations, that he
repeated under his breath in order to accustom his tongue to the language
spoken by Ruth. &ldquo;And&rdquo; and &ldquo;ing,&rdquo; with the
&ldquo;d&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&rdquo; pronounced emphatically, he went over
thousands of times; and to his surprise he noticed that he was beginning to
speak cleaner and more correct English than the officers themselves and the
gentleman-adventurers in the cabin who had financed the expedition.
</p>

<p>
The captain was a fishy-eyed Norwegian who somehow had fallen into possession
of a complete Shakespeare, which he never read, and Martin had washed his
clothes for him and in return been permitted access to the precious volumes.
For a time, so steeped was he in the plays and in the many favorite passages
that impressed themselves almost without effort on his brain, that all the
world seemed to shape itself into forms of Elizabethan tragedy or comedy and
his very thoughts were in blank verse. It trained his ear and gave him a fine
appreciation for noble English; withal it introduced into his mind much that
was archaic and obsolete.
</p>

<p>
The eight months had been well spent, and, in addition to what he had learned
of right speaking and high thinking, he had learned much of himself. Along with
his humbleness because he knew so little, there arose a conviction of power. He
felt a sharp gradation between himself and his shipmates, and was wise enough
to realize that the difference lay in potentiality rather than achievement.
What he could do,&mdash;they could do; but within him he felt a confused
ferment working that told him there was more in him than he had done. He was
tortured by the exquisite beauty of the world, and wished that Ruth were there
to share it with him. He decided that he would describe to her many of the bits
of South Sea beauty. The creative spirit in him flamed up at the thought and
urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience than Ruth. And then, in
splendor and glory, came the great idea. He would write. He would be one of the
eyes through which the world saw, one of the ears through which it heard, one
of the hearts through which it felt. He would
write&mdash;everything&mdash;poetry and prose, fiction and description, and
plays like Shakespeare. There was career and the way to win to Ruth. The men of
literature were the world&rsquo;s giants, and he conceived them to be far finer
than the Mr. Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be Supreme
Court justices if they wanted to.
</p>

<p>
Once the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to San
Francisco was like a dream. He was drunken with unguessed power and felt that
he could do anything. In the midst of the great and lonely sea he gained
perspective. Clearly, and for the first time, he saw Ruth and her world. It was
all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing which he could take up in his
two hands and turn around and about and examine. There was much that was dim
and nebulous in that world, but he saw it as a whole and not in detail, and he
saw, also, the way to master it. To write! The thought was fire in him. He
would begin as soon as he got back. The first thing he would do would be to
describe the voyage of the treasure-hunters. He would sell it to some San
Francisco newspaper. He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she would be
surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print. While he wrote, he could
go on studying. There were twenty-four hours in each day. He was invincible. He
knew how to work, and the citadels would go down before him. He would not have
to go to sea again&mdash;as a sailor; and for the instant he caught a vision of
a steam yacht. There were other writers who possessed steam yachts. Of course,
he cautioned himself, it would be slow succeeding at first, and for a time he
would be content to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on
studying. And then, after some time,&mdash;a very indeterminate
time,&mdash;when he had learned and prepared himself, he would write the great
things and his name would be on all men&rsquo;s lips. But greater than that,
infinitely greater and greatest of all, he would have proved himself worthy of
Ruth. Fame was all very well, but it was for Ruth that his splendid dream
arose. He was not a fame-monger, but merely one of God&rsquo;s mad lovers.
</p>

<p>
Arrived in Oakland, with his snug pay-day in his pocket, he took up his old
room at Bernard Higginbotham&rsquo;s and set to work. He did not even let Ruth
know he was back. He would go and see her when he finished the article on the
treasure-hunters. It was not so difficult to abstain from seeing her, because
of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in him. Besides, the very
article he was writing would bring her nearer to him. He did not know how long
an article he should write, but he counted the words in a double-page article
in the Sunday supplement of the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>, and guided
himself by that. Three days, at white heat, completed his narrative; but when
he had copied it carefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read, he learned
from a rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as
paragraphs and quotation marks. He had never thought of such things before; and
he promptly set to work writing the article over, referring continually to the
pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the
average schoolboy in a year. When he had copied the article a second time and
rolled it up carefully, he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners,
and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never be rolled and that
they should be written on one side of the paper. He had violated the law on
both counts. Also, he learned from the item that first-class papers paid a
minimum of ten dollars a column. So, while he copied the manuscript a third
time, he consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars. The
product was always the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was
better than seafaring. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for his blunders, he would have
finished the article in three days. One hundred dollars in three days! It would
have taken him three months and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount. A
man was a fool to go to sea when he could write, he concluded, though the money
in itself meant nothing to him. Its value was in the liberty it would get him,
the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer,
swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon
itself and given him inspiration.
</p>

<p>
He mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope, and addressed it to the editor of
the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>. He had an idea that anything accepted by a
paper was published immediately, and as he had sent the manuscript in on Friday
he expected it to come out on the following Sunday. He conceived that it would
be fine to let that event apprise Ruth of his return. Then, Sunday afternoon,
he would call and see her. In the meantime he was occupied by another idea,
which he prided himself upon as being a particularly sane, careful, and modest
idea. He would write an adventure story for boys and sell it to <i>The
Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i>. He went to the free reading-room and looked
through the files of <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i>. Serial stories, he
found, were usually published in that weekly in five instalments of about three
thousand words each. He discovered several serials that ran to seven
instalments, and decided to write one of that length.
</p>

<p>
He had been on a whaling voyage in the Arctic, once&mdash;a voyage that was to
have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at the end of
six months. While his imagination was fanciful, even fantastic at times, he had
a basic love of reality that compelled him to write about the things he knew.
He knew whaling, and out of the real materials of his knowledge he proceeded to
manufacture the fictitious adventures of the two boys he intended to use as
joint heroes. It was easy work, he decided on Saturday evening. He had
completed on that day the first instalment of three thousand words&mdash;much
to the amusement of Jim, and to the open derision of Mr. Higginbotham, who
sneered throughout meal-time at the &ldquo;litery&rdquo; person they had
discovered in the family.
</p>

<p>
Martin contented himself by picturing his brother-in-law&rsquo;s surprise on
Sunday morning when he opened his <i>Examiner</i> and saw the article on the
treasure-hunters. Early that morning he was out himself to the front door,
nervously racing through the many-sheeted newspaper. He went through it a
second time, very carefully, then folded it up and left it where he had found
it. He was glad he had not told any one about his article. On second thought he
concluded that he had been wrong about the speed with which things found their
way into newspaper columns. Besides, there had not been any news value in his
article, and most likely the editor would write to him about it first.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast he went on with his serial. The words flowed from his pen,
though he broke off from the writing frequently to look up definitions in the
dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric. He often read or re-read a chapter at a
time, during such pauses; and he consoled himself that while he was not writing
the great things he felt to be in him, he was learning composition, at any
rate, and training himself to shape up and express his thoughts. He toiled on
till dark, when he went out to the reading-room and explored magazines and
weeklies until the place closed at ten o&rsquo;clock. This was his programme
for a week. Each day he did three thousand words, and each evening he puzzled
his way through the magazines, taking note of the stories, articles, and poems
that editors saw fit to publish. One thing was certain: What these
multitudinous writers did he could do, and only give him time and he would do
what they could not do. He was cheered to read in <i>Book News</i>, in a
paragraph on the payment of magazine writers, not that Rudyard Kipling received
a dollar per word, but that the minimum rate paid by first-class magazines was
two cents a word. <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i> was certainly first class,
and at that rate the three thousand words he had written that day would bring
him sixty dollars&mdash;two months&rsquo; wages on the sea!
</p>

<p>
On Friday night he finished the serial, twenty-one thousand words long. At two
cents a word, he calculated, that would bring him four hundred and twenty
dollars. Not a bad week&rsquo;s work. It was more money than he had ever
possessed at one time. He did not know how he could spend it all. He had tapped
a gold mine. Where this came from he could always get more. He planned to buy
some more clothes, to subscribe to many magazines, and to buy dozens of
reference books that at present he was compelled to go to the library to
consult. And still there was a large portion of the four hundred and twenty
dollars unspent. This worried him until the thought came to him of hiring a
servant for Gertrude and of buying a bicycle for Marian.
</p>

<p>
He mailed the bulky manuscript to <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i>, and on
Saturday afternoon, after having planned an article on pearl-diving, he went to
see Ruth. He had telephoned, and she went herself to greet him at the door. The
old familiar blaze of health rushed out from him and struck her like a blow. It
seemed to enter into her body and course through her veins in a liquid glow,
and to set her quivering with its imparted strength. He flushed warmly as he
took her hand and looked into her blue eyes, but the fresh bronze of eight
months of sun hid the flush, though it did not protect the neck from the
gnawing chafe of the stiff collar. She noted the red line of it with amusement
which quickly vanished as she glanced at his clothes. They really fitted
him,&mdash;it was his first made-to-order suit,&mdash;and he seemed slimmer and
better modelled. In addition, his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat,
which she commanded him to put on and then complimented him on his appearance.
She did not remember when she had felt so happy. This change in him was her
handiwork, and she was proud of it and fired with ambition further to help him.
</p>

<p>
But the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her most, was the
change in his speech. Not only did he speak more correctly, but he spoke more
easily, and there were many new words in his vocabulary. When he grew excited
or enthusiastic, however, he dropped back into the old slurring and the
dropping of final consonants. Also, there was an awkward hesitancy, at times,
as he essayed the new words he had learned. On the other hand, along with his
ease of expression, he displayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that
delighted her. It was his old spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a
favorite in his own class, but which he had hitherto been unable to use in her
presence through lack of words and training. He was just beginning to orientate
himself and to feel that he was not wholly an intruder. But he was very
tentative, fastidiously so, letting Ruth set the pace of sprightliness and
fancy, keeping up with her but never daring to go beyond her.
</p>

<p>
He told her of what he had been doing, and of his plan to write for a
livelihood and of going on with his studies. But he was disappointed at her
lack of approval. She did not think much of his plan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said frankly, &ldquo;writing must be a trade, like
anything else. Not that I know anything about it, of course. I only bring
common judgment to bear. You couldn&rsquo;t hope to be a blacksmith without
spending three years at learning the trade&mdash;or is it five years! Now
writers are so much better paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so
many more men who would like to write, who&mdash;try to write.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But then, may not I be peculiarly constituted to write?&rdquo; he
queried, secretly exulting at the language he had used, his swift imagination
throwing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a
thousand other scenes from his life&mdash;scenes that were rough and raw, gross
and bestial.
</p>

<p>
The whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light, producing no
pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train of thought. On the
screen of his imagination he saw himself and this sweet and beautiful girl,
facing each other and conversing in good English, in a room of books and
paintings and tone and culture, and all illuminated by a bright light of
steadfast brilliance; while ranged about and fading away to the remote edges of
the screen were antithetical scenes, each scene a picture, and he the onlooker,
free to look at will upon what he wished. He saw these other scenes through
drifting vapors and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and
garish light. He saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce whiskey, the air
filled with obscenity and ribald language, and he saw himself with them
drinking and cursing with the wildest, or sitting at table with them, under
smoking kerosene lamps, while the chips clicked and clattered and the cards
were dealt around. He saw himself, stripped to the waist, with naked fists,
fighting his great fight with Liverpool Red in the forecastle of the
<i>Susquehanna</i>; and he saw the bloody deck of the <i>John Rogers</i>, that
gray morning of attempted mutiny, the mate kicking in death-throes on the
main-hatch, the revolver in the old man&rsquo;s hand spitting fire and smoke,
the men with passion-wrenched faces, of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and
falling about him&mdash;and then he returned to the central scene, calm and
clean in the steadfast light, where Ruth sat and talked with him amid books and
paintings; and he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him;
and he heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words, &ldquo;But then,
may I not be peculiarly constituted to write?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for
blacksmithing,&rdquo; she was laughing, &ldquo;I never heard of one becoming a
blacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would you advise?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget
that I feel in me this capacity to write&mdash;I can&rsquo;t explain it; I just
know that it is in me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must get a thorough education,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;whether
or not you ultimately become a writer. This education is indispensable for
whatever career you select, and it must not be slipshod or sketchy. You should
go to high school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo; he began; but she interrupted with an afterthought:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, you could go on with your writing, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would have to,&rdquo; he said grimly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She looked at him, prettily puzzled, for she did not quite
like the persistence with which he clung to his notion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because, without writing there wouldn&rsquo;t be any high school. I must
live and buy books and clothes, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten that,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t
you born with an income?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have good health and imagination,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I can make good on the income, but the other things have to be made good
for&mdash;&rdquo; He almost said &ldquo;you,&rdquo; then amended his sentence
to, &ldquo;have to be made good for one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;make good,&rsquo;&rdquo; she cried, sweetly
petulant. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slang, and it&rsquo;s horrid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He flushed, and stammered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, and I only wish
you&rsquo;d correct me every time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; she said haltingly. &ldquo;You have so
much in you that is good that I want to see you perfect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was clay in her hands immediately, as passionately desirous of being moulded
by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image of her ideal of man.
And when she pointed out the opportuneness of the time, that the entrance
examinations to high school began on the following Monday, he promptly
volunteered that he would take them.
</p>

<p>
Then she played and sang to him, while he gazed with hungry yearning at her,
drinking in her loveliness and marvelling that there should not be a hundred
suitors listening there and longing for her as he listened and longed.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>
He stopped to dinner that evening, and, much to Ruth&rsquo;s satisfaction, made
a favorable impression on her father. They talked about the sea as a career, a
subject which Martin had at his finger-ends, and Mr. Morse remarked afterward
that he seemed a very clear-headed young man. In his avoidance of slang and his
search after right words, Martin was compelled to talk slowly, which enabled
him to find the best thoughts that were in him. He was more at ease than that
first night at dinner, nearly a year before, and his shyness and modesty even
commended him to Mrs. Morse, who was pleased at his manifest improvement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is the first man that ever drew passing notice from Ruth,&rdquo; she
told her husband. &ldquo;She has been so singularly backward where men are
concerned that I have been worried greatly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Morse looked at his wife curiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean to use this young sailor to wake her up?&rdquo; he questioned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean that she is not to die an old maid if I can help it,&rdquo; was
the answer. &ldquo;If this young Eden can arouse her interest in mankind in
general, it will be a good thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A very good thing,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;But suppose,&mdash;and we
must suppose, sometimes, my dear,&mdash;suppose he arouses her interest too
particularly in him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; Mrs. Morse laughed. &ldquo;She is three years older
than he, and, besides, it is impossible. Nothing will ever come of it. Trust
that to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so Martin&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le was arranged for him, while he, led on by
Arthur and Norman, was meditating an extravagance. They were going out for a
ride into the hills Sunday morning on their wheels, which did not interest
Martin until he learned that Ruth, too, rode a wheel and was going along. He
did not ride, nor own a wheel, but if Ruth rode, it was up to him to begin, was
his decision; and when he said good night, he stopped in at a cyclery on his
way home and spent forty dollars for a wheel. It was more than a month&rsquo;s
hard-earned wages, and it reduced his stock of money amazingly; but when he
added the hundred dollars he was to receive from the <i>Examiner</i> to the
four hundred and twenty dollars that was the least <i>The Youth&rsquo;s
Companion</i> could pay him, he felt that he had reduced the perplexity the
unwonted amount of money had caused him. Nor did he mind, in the course of
learning to ride the wheel home, the fact that he ruined his suit of clothes.
He caught the tailor by telephone that night from Mr. Higginbotham&rsquo;s
store and ordered another suit. Then he carried the wheel up the narrow
stairway that clung like a fire-escape to the rear wall of the building, and
when he had moved his bed out from the wall, found there was just space enough
in the small room for himself and the wheel.
</p>

<p>
Sunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school examination,
but the pearl-diving article lured him away, and he spent the day in the
white-hot fever of re-creating the beauty and romance that burned in him. The
fact that the <i>Examiner</i> of that morning had failed to publish his
treasure-hunting article did not dash his spirits. He was at too great a height
for that, and having been deaf to a twice-repeated summons, he went without the
heavy Sunday dinner with which Mr. Higginbotham invariably graced his table. To
Mr. Higginbotham such a dinner was advertisement of his worldly achievement and
prosperity, and he honored it by delivering platitudinous sermonettes upon
American institutions and the opportunity said institutions gave to any
hard-working man to rise&mdash;the rise, in his case, which he pointed out
unfailingly, being from a grocer&rsquo;s clerk to the ownership of
Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store.
</p>

<p>
Martin Eden looked with a sigh at his unfinished &ldquo;Pearl-diving&rdquo; on
Monday morning, and took the car down to Oakland to the high school. And when,
days later, he applied for the results of his examinations, he learned that he
had failed in everything save grammar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your grammar is excellent,&rdquo; Professor Hilton informed him, staring
at him through heavy spectacles; &ldquo;but you know nothing, positively
nothing, in the other branches, and your United States history is
abominable&mdash;there is no other word for it, abominable. I should advise
you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Professor Hilton paused and glared at him, unsympathetic and unimaginative as
one of his own test-tubes. He was professor of physics in the high school,
possessor of a large family, a meagre salary, and a select fund of
parrot-learned knowledge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Martin said humbly, wishing somehow that the man at the
desk in the library was in Professor Hilton&rsquo;s place just then.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I should advise you to go back to the grammar school for at least
two years. Good day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin was not deeply affected by his failure, though he was surprised at
Ruth&rsquo;s shocked expression when he told her Professor Hilton&rsquo;s
advice. Her disappointment was so evident that he was sorry he had failed, but
chiefly so for her sake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see I was right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You know far more than any
of the students entering high school, and yet you can&rsquo;t pass the
examinations. It is because what education you have is fragmentary, sketchy.
You need the discipline of study, such as only skilled teachers can give you.
You must be thoroughly grounded. Professor Hilton is right, and if I were you,
I&rsquo;d go to night school. A year and a half of it might enable you to catch
up that additional six months. Besides, that would leave you your days in which
to write, or, if you could not make your living by your pen, you would have
your days in which to work in some position.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But if my days are taken up with work and my nights with school, when am I
going to see you?&mdash;was Martin&rsquo;s first thought, though he refrained
from uttering it. Instead, he said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems so babyish for me to be going to night school. But I
wouldn&rsquo;t mind that if I thought it would pay. But I don&rsquo;t think it
will pay. I can do the work quicker than they can teach me. It would be a loss
of time&mdash;&rdquo; he thought of her and his desire to have
her&mdash;&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t afford the time. I haven&rsquo;t the time to
spare, in fact.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is so much that is necessary.&rdquo; She looked at him gently, and
he was a brute to oppose her. &ldquo;Physics and chemistry&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t do them without laboratory study; and you&rsquo;ll find algebra and
geometry almost hopeless without instruction. You need the skilled teachers,
the specialists in the art of imparting knowledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a minute, casting about for the least vainglorious way in
which to express himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m bragging,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t intend it that way at all. But I have a feeling that I am what I
may call a natural student. I can study by myself. I take to it kindly, like a
duck to water. You see yourself what I did with grammar. And I&rsquo;ve learned
much of other things&mdash;you would never dream how much. And I&rsquo;m only
getting started. Wait till I get&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated and assured himself
of the pronunciation before he said &ldquo;momentum. I&rsquo;m getting my first
real feel of things now. I&rsquo;m beginning to size up the
situation&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;size up,&rsquo;&rdquo; she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To get a line on things,&rdquo; he hastily amended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean anything in correct English,&rdquo; she
objected.
</p>

<p>
He floundered for a fresh start.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m driving at is that I&rsquo;m beginning to get the lay of
the land.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Out of pity she forebore, and he went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Knowledge seems to me like a chart-room. Whenever I go into the library,
I am impressed that way. The part played by teachers is to teach the student
the contents of the chart-room in a systematic way. The teachers are guides to
the chart-room, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s not something that they have in
their own heads. They don&rsquo;t make it up, don&rsquo;t create it. It&rsquo;s
all in the chart-room and they know their way about in it, and it&rsquo;s their
business to show the place to strangers who might else get lost. Now I
don&rsquo;t get lost easily. I have the bump of location. I usually know where
I&rsquo;m at&mdash;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;where I&rsquo;m at.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said gratefully, &ldquo;where I am. But
where am I at&mdash;I mean, where am I? Oh, yes, in the chart-room. Well, some
people&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Persons,&rdquo; she corrected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some persons need guides, most persons do; but I think I can get along
without them. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in the chart-room now, and
I&rsquo;m on the edge of knowing my way about, what charts I want to refer to,
what coasts I want to explore. And from the way I line it up, I&rsquo;ll
explore a whole lot more quickly by myself. The speed of a fleet, you know, is
the speed of the slowest ship, and the speed of the teachers is affected the
same way. They can&rsquo;t go any faster than the ruck of their scholars, and I
can set a faster pace for myself than they set for a whole schoolroom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;He travels the fastest who travels alone,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
quoted at him.
</p>

<p>
But I&rsquo;d travel faster with you just the same, was what he wanted to blurt
out, as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit spaces and starry
voids through which he drifted with her, his arm around her, her pale gold hair
blowing about his face. In the same instant he was aware of the pitiful
inadequacy of speech. God! If he could so frame words that she could see what
he then saw! And he felt the stir in him, like a throe of yearning pain, of the
desire to paint these visions that flashed unsummoned on the mirror of his
mind. Ah, that was it! He caught at the hem of the secret. It was the very
thing that the great writers and master-poets did. That was why they were
giants. They knew how to express what they thought, and felt, and saw. Dogs
asleep in the sun often whined and barked, but they were unable to tell what
they saw that made them whine and bark. He had often wondered what it was. And
that was all he was, a dog asleep in the sun. He saw noble and beautiful
visions, but he could only whine and bark at Ruth. But he would cease sleeping
in the sun. He would stand up, with open eyes, and he would struggle and toil
and learn until, with eyes unblinded and tongue untied, he could share with her
his visioned wealth. Other men had discovered the trick of expression, of
making words obedient servitors, and of making combinations of words mean more
than the sum of their separate meanings. He was stirred profoundly by the
passing glimpse at the secret, and he was again caught up in the vision of
sunlit spaces and starry voids&mdash;until it came to him that it was very
quiet, and he saw Ruth regarding him with an amused expression and a smile in
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have had a great visioning,&rdquo; he said, and at the sound of his
words in his own ears his heart gave a leap. Where had those words come from?
They had adequately expressed the pause his vision had put in the conversation.
It was a miracle. Never had he so loftily framed a lofty thought. But never had
he attempted to frame lofty thoughts in words. That was it. That explained it.
He had never tried. But Swinburne had, and Tennyson, and Kipling, and all the
other poets. His mind flashed on to his &ldquo;Pearl-diving.&rdquo; He had
never dared the big things, the spirit of the beauty that was a fire in him.
That article would be a different thing when he was done with it. He was
appalled by the vastness of the beauty that rightfully belonged in it, and
again his mind flashed and dared, and he demanded of himself why he could not
chant that beauty in noble verse as the great poets did. And there was all the
mysterious delight and spiritual wonder of his love for Ruth. Why could he not
chant that, too, as the poets did? They had sung of love. So would he. By
God!&mdash;
</p>

<p>
And in his frightened ears he heard his exclamation echoing. Carried away, he
had breathed it aloud. The blood surged into his face, wave upon wave,
mastering the bronze of it till the blush of shame flaunted itself from
collar-rim to the roots of his hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I was
thinking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It sounded as if you were praying,&rdquo; she said bravely, but she felt
herself inside to be withering and shrinking. It was the first time she had
heard an oath from the lips of a man she knew, and she was shocked, not merely
as a matter of principle and training, but shocked in spirit by this rough
blast of life in the garden of her sheltered maidenhood.
</p>

<p>
But she forgave, and with surprise at the ease of her forgiveness. Somehow it
was not so difficult to forgive him anything. He had not had a chance to be as
other men, and he was trying so hard, and succeeding, too. It never entered her
head that there could be any other reason for her being kindly disposed toward
him. She was tenderly disposed toward him, but she did not know it. She had no
way of knowing it. The placid poise of twenty-four years without a single love
affair did not fit her with a keen perception of her own feelings, and she who
had never warmed to actual love was unaware that she was warming now.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>
Martin went back to his pearl-diving article, which would have been finished
sooner if it had not been broken in upon so frequently by his attempts to write
poetry. His poems were love poems, inspired by Ruth, but they were never
completed. Not in a day could he learn to chant in noble verse. Rhyme and metre
and structure were serious enough in themselves, but there was, over and beyond
them, an intangible and evasive something that he caught in all great poetry,
but which he could not catch and imprison in his own. It was the elusive spirit
of poetry itself that he sensed and sought after but could not capture. It
seemed a glow to him, a warm and trailing vapor, ever beyond his reaching,
though sometimes he was rewarded by catching at shreds of it and weaving them
into phrases that echoed in his brain with haunting notes or drifted across his
vision in misty wafture of unseen beauty. It was baffling. He ached with desire
to express and could but gibber prosaically as everybody gibbered. He read his
fragments aloud. The metre marched along on perfect feet, and the rhyme pounded
a longer and equally faultless rhythm, but the glow and high exaltation that he
felt within were lacking. He could not understand, and time and again, in
despair, defeated and depressed, he returned to his article. Prose was
certainly an easier medium.
</p>

<p>
Following the &ldquo;Pearl-diving,&rdquo; he wrote an article on the sea as a
career, another on turtle-catching, and a third on the northeast trades. Then
he tried, as an experiment, a short story, and before he broke his stride he
had finished six short stories and despatched them to various magazines. He
wrote prolifically, intensely, from morning till night, and late at night,
except when he broke off to go to the reading-room, draw books from the
library, or to call on Ruth. He was profoundly happy. Life was pitched high. He
was in a fever that never broke. The joy of creation that is supposed to belong
to the gods was his. All the life about him&mdash;the odors of stale vegetables
and soapsuds, the slatternly form of his sister, and the jeering face of Mr.
Higginbotham&mdash;was a dream. The real world was in his mind, and the stories
he wrote were so many pieces of reality out of his mind.
</p>

<p>
The days were too short. There was so much he wanted to study. He cut his sleep
down to five hours and found that he could get along upon it. He tried four
hours and a half, and regretfully came back to five. He could joyfully have
spent all his waking hours upon any one of his pursuits. It was with regret
that he ceased from writing to study, that he ceased from study to go to the
library, that he tore himself away from that chart-room of knowledge or from
the magazines in the reading-room that were filled with the secrets of writers
who succeeded in selling their wares. It was like severing heart strings, when
he was with Ruth, to stand up and go; and he scorched through the dark streets
so as to get home to his books at the least possible expense of time. And
hardest of all was it to shut up the algebra or physics, put note-book and
pencil aside, and close his tired eyes in sleep. He hated the thought of
ceasing to live, even for so short a time, and his sole consolation was that
the alarm clock was set five hours ahead. He would lose only five hours anyway,
and then the jangling bell would jerk him out of unconsciousness and he would
have before him another glorious day of nineteen hours.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the weeks were passing, his money was ebbing low, and there was
no money coming in. A month after he had mailed it, the adventure serial for
boys was returned to him by <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i>. The rejection
slip was so tactfully worded that he felt kindly toward the editor. But he did
not feel so kindly toward the editor of the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>.
After waiting two whole weeks, Martin had written to him. A week later he wrote
again. At the end of the month, he went over to San Francisco and personally
called upon the editor. But he did not meet that exalted personage, thanks to a
Cerberus of an office boy, of tender years and red hair, who guarded the
portals. At the end of the fifth week the manuscript came back to him, by mail,
without comment. There was no rejection slip, no explanation, nothing. In the
same way his other articles were tied up with the other leading San Francisco
papers. When he recovered them, he sent them to the magazines in the East, from
which they were returned more promptly, accompanied always by the printed
rejection slips.
</p>

<p>
The short stories were returned in similar fashion. He read them over and over,
and liked them so much that he could not puzzle out the cause of their
rejection, until, one day, he read in a newspaper that manuscripts should
always be typewritten. That explained it. Of course editors were so busy that
they could not afford the time and strain of reading handwriting. Martin rented
a typewriter and spent a day mastering the machine. Each day he typed what he
composed, and he typed his earlier manuscripts as fast as they were returned
him. He was surprised when the typed ones began to come back. His jaw seemed to
become squarer, his chin more aggressive, and he bundled the manuscripts off to
new editors.
</p>

<p>
The thought came to him that he was not a good judge of his own work. He tried
it out on Gertrude. He read his stories aloud to her. Her eyes glistened, and
she looked at him proudly as she said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it grand, you writin&rsquo; those sort of things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he demanded impatiently. &ldquo;But the story&mdash;how
did you like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just grand,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Just grand, an&rsquo;
thrilling, too. I was all worked up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He could see that her mind was not clear. The perplexity was strong in her
good-natured face. So he waited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, say, Mart,&rdquo; after a long pause, &ldquo;how did it end? Did
that young man who spoke so highfalutin&rsquo; get her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And, after he had explained the end, which he thought he had made artistically
obvious, she would say:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to know. Why didn&rsquo;t you write that way
in the story?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
One thing he learned, after he had read her a number of stories, namely, that
she liked happy endings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That story was perfectly grand,&rdquo; she announced, straightening up
from the wash-tub with a tired sigh and wiping the sweat from her forehead with
a red, steamy hand; &ldquo;but it makes me sad. I want to cry. There is too
many sad things in the world anyway. It makes me happy to think about happy
things. Now if he&rsquo;d married her, and&mdash;You don&rsquo;t mind,
Mart?&rdquo; she queried apprehensively. &ldquo;I just happen to feel that way,
because I&rsquo;m tired, I guess. But the story was grand just the same,
perfectly grand. Where are you goin&rsquo; to sell it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a horse of another color,&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you <i>did</i> sell it, what do you think you&rsquo;d get for
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, a hundred dollars. That would be the least, the way prices
go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My! I do hope you&rsquo;ll sell it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Easy money, eh?&rdquo; Then he added proudly: &ldquo;I wrote it in two
days. That&rsquo;s fifty dollars a day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He longed to read his stories to Ruth, but did not dare. He would wait till
some were published, he decided, then she would understand what he had been
working for. In the meantime he toiled on. Never had the spirit of adventure
lured him more strongly than on this amazing exploration of the realm of mind.
He bought the text-books on physics and chemistry, and, along with his algebra,
worked out problems and demonstrations. He took the laboratory proofs on faith,
and his intense power of vision enabled him to see the reactions of chemicals
more understandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory.
Martin wandered on through the heavy pages, overwhelmed by the clews he was
getting to the nature of things. He had accepted the world as the world, but
now he was comprehending the organization of it, the play and interplay of
force and matter. Spontaneous explanations of old matters were continually
arising in his mind. Levers and purchases fascinated him, and his mind roved
backward to hand-spikes and blocks and tackles at sea. The theory of
navigation, which enabled the ships to travel unerringly their courses over the
pathless ocean, was made clear to him. The mysteries of storm, and rain, and
tide were revealed, and the reason for the existence of trade-winds made him
wonder whether he had written his article on the northeast trade too soon. At
any rate he knew he could write it better now. One afternoon he went out with
Arthur to the University of California, and, with bated breath and a feeling of
religious awe, went through the laboratories, saw demonstrations, and listened
to a physics professor lecturing to his classes.
</p>

<p>
But he did not neglect his writing. A stream of short stories flowed from his
pen, and he branched out into the easier forms of verse&mdash;the kind he saw
printed in the magazines&mdash;though he lost his head and wasted two weeks on
a tragedy in blank verse, the swift rejection of which, by half a dozen
magazines, dumfounded him. Then he discovered Henley and wrote a series of
sea-poems on the model of &ldquo;Hospital Sketches.&rdquo; They were simple
poems, of light and color, and romance and adventure. &ldquo;Sea Lyrics,&rdquo;
he called them, and he judged them to be the best work he had yet done. There
were thirty, and he completed them in a month, doing one a day after having
done his regular day&rsquo;s work on fiction, which day&rsquo;s work was the
equivalent to a week&rsquo;s work of the average successful writer. The toil
meant nothing to him. It was not toil. He was finding speech, and all the
beauty and wonder that had been pent for years behind his inarticulate lips was
now pouring forth in a wild and virile flood.
</p>

<p>
He showed the &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; to no one, not even to the editors. He
had become distrustful of editors. But it was not distrust that prevented him
from submitting the &ldquo;Lyrics.&rdquo; They were so beautiful to him that he
was impelled to save them to share with Ruth in some glorious, far-off time
when he would dare to read to her what he had written. Against that time he
kept them with him, reading them aloud, going over them until he knew them by
heart.
</p>

<p>
He lived every moment of his waking hours, and he lived in his sleep, his
subjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease and combining the
thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and impossible marvels. In
reality, he never rested, and a weaker body or a less firmly poised brain would
have been prostrated in a general break-down. His late afternoon calls on Ruth
were rarer now, for June was approaching, when she would take her degree and
finish with the university. Bachelor of Arts!&mdash;when he thought of her
degree, it seemed she fled beyond him faster than he could pursue.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon a week she gave to him, and arriving late, he usually stayed for
dinner and for music afterward. Those were his red-letter days. The atmosphere
of the house, in such contrast with that in which he lived, and the mere
nearness to her, sent him forth each time with a firmer grip on his resolve to
climb the heights. In spite of the beauty in him, and the aching desire to
create, it was for her that he struggled. He was a lover first and always. All
other things he subordinated to love.
</p>

<p>
Greater than his adventure in the world of thought was his love-adventure. The
world itself was not so amazing because of the atoms and molecules that
composed it according to the propulsions of irresistible force; what made it
amazing was the fact that Ruth lived in it. She was the most amazing thing he
had ever known, or dreamed, or guessed.
</p>

<p>
But he was oppressed always by her remoteness. She was so far from him, and he
did not know how to approach her. He had been a success with girls and women in
his own class; but he had never loved any of them, while he did love her, and
besides, she was not merely of another class. His very love elevated her above
all classes. She was a being apart, so far apart that he did not know how to
draw near to her as a lover should draw near. It was true, as he acquired
knowledge and language, that he was drawing nearer, talking her speech,
discovering ideas and delights in common; but this did not satisfy his
lover&rsquo;s yearning. His lover&rsquo;s imagination had made her holy, too
holy, too spiritualized, to have any kinship with him in the flesh. It was his
own love that thrust her from him and made her seem impossible for him. Love
itself denied him the one thing that it desired.
</p>

<p>
And then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was bridged for a
moment, and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it was ever narrower. They
had been eating cherries&mdash;great, luscious, black cherries with a juice of
the color of dark wine. And later, as she read aloud to him from &ldquo;The
Princess,&rdquo; he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries on her lips.
For the moment her divinity was shattered. She was clay, after all, mere clay,
subject to the common law of clay as his clay was subject, or anybody&rsquo;s
clay. Her lips were flesh like his, and cherries dyed them as cherries dyed
his. And if so with her lips, then was it so with all of her. She was woman,
all woman, just like any woman. It came upon him abruptly. It was a revelation
that stunned him. It was as if he had seen the sun fall out of the sky, or had
seen worshipped purity polluted.
</p>

<p>
Then he realized the significance of it, and his heart began pounding and
challenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a spirit from
other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain. He trembled at
the audacity of his thought; but all his soul was singing, and reason, in a
triumphant paean, assured him he was right. Something of this change in him
must have reached her, for she paused from her reading, looked up at him, and
smiled. His eyes dropped from her blue eyes to her lips, and the sight of the
stain maddened him. His arms all but flashed out to her and around her, in the
way of his old careless life. She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and all
his will fought to hold him back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were not following a word,&rdquo; she pouted.
</p>

<p>
Then she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion, and as he looked into her
frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he felt, he became
abashed. He had indeed in thought dared too far. Of all the women he had known
there was no woman who would not have guessed&mdash;save her. And she had not
guessed. There was the difference. She was different. He was appalled by his
own grossness, awed by her clear innocence, and he gazed again at her across
the gulf. The bridge had broken down.
</p>

<p>
But still the incident had brought him nearer. The memory of it persisted, and
in the moments when he was most cast down, he dwelt upon it eagerly. The gulf
was never again so wide. He had accomplished a distance vastly greater than a
bachelorship of arts, or a dozen bachelorships. She was pure, it was true, as
he had never dreamed of purity; but cherries stained her lips. She was subject
to the laws of the universe just as inexorably as he was. She had to eat to
live, and when she got her feet wet, she caught cold. But that was not the
point. If she could feel hunger and thirst, and heat and cold, then could she
feel love&mdash;and love for a man. Well, he was a man. And why could he not be
the man? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to me to make good,&rdquo; he would murmur
fervently. &ldquo;I will be <i>the</i> man. I will make myself <i>the</i> man.
I will make good.&rdquo;

<h2><a name="chap12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>
Early one evening, struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry the beauty
and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain, Martin was called
to the telephone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lady&rsquo;s voice, a fine lady&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Mr.
Higginbotham, who had called him, jeered.
</p>

<p>
Martin went to the telephone in the corner of the room, and felt a wave of
warmth rush through him as he heard Ruth&rsquo;s voice. In his battle with the
sonnet he had forgotten her existence, and at the sound of her voice his love
for her smote him like a sudden blow. And such a voice!&mdash;delicate and
sweet, like a strain of music heard far off and faint, or, better, like a bell
of silver, a perfect tone, crystal-pure. No mere woman had a voice like that.
There was something celestial about it, and it came from other worlds. He could
scarcely hear what it said, so ravished was he, though he controlled his face,
for he knew that Mr. Higginbotham&rsquo;s ferret eyes were fixed upon him.
</p>

<p>
It was not much that Ruth wanted to say&mdash;merely that Norman had been going
to take her to a lecture that night, but that he had a headache, and she was so
disappointed, and she had the tickets, and that if he had no other engagement,
would he be good enough to take her?
</p>

<p>
Would he! He fought to suppress the eagerness in his voice. It was amazing. He
had always seen her in her own house. And he had never dared to ask her to go
anywhere with him. Quite irrelevantly, still at the telephone and talking with
her, he felt an overpowering desire to die for her, and visions of heroic
sacrifice shaped and dissolved in his whirling brain. He loved her so much, so
terribly, so hopelessly. In that moment of mad happiness that she should go out
with him, go to a lecture with him&mdash;with him, Martin Eden&mdash;she soared
so far above him that there seemed nothing else for him to do than die for her.
It was the only fit way in which he could express the tremendous and lofty
emotion he felt for her. It was the sublime abnegation of true love that comes
to all lovers, and it came to him there, at the telephone, in a whirlwind of
fire and glory; and to die for her, he felt, was to have lived and loved well.
And he was only twenty-one, and he had never been in love before.
</p>

<p>
His hand trembled as he hung up the receiver, and he was weak from the organ
which had stirred him. His eyes were shining like an angel&rsquo;s, and his
face was transfigured, purged of all earthly dross, and pure and holy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Makin&rsquo; dates outside, eh?&rdquo; his brother-in-law sneered.
&ldquo;You know what that means. You&rsquo;ll be in the police court
yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Martin could not come down from the height. Not even the bestiality of the
allusion could bring him back to earth. Anger and hurt were beneath him. He had
seen a great vision and was as a god, and he could feel only profound and awful
pity for this maggot of a man. He did not look at him, and though his eyes
passed over him, he did not see him; and as in a dream he passed out of the
room to dress. It was not until he had reached his own room and was tying his
necktie that he became aware of a sound that lingered unpleasantly in his ears.
On investigating this sound he identified it as the final snort of Bernard
Higginbotham, which somehow had not penetrated to his brain before.
</p>

<p>
As Ruth&rsquo;s front door closed behind them and he came down the steps with
her, he found himself greatly perturbed. It was not unalloyed bliss, taking her
to the lecture. He did not know what he ought to do. He had seen, on the
streets, with persons of her class, that the women took the men&rsquo;s arms.
But then, again, he had seen them when they didn&rsquo;t; and he wondered if it
was only in the evening that arms were taken, or only between husbands and
wives and relatives.
</p>

<p>
Just before he reached the sidewalk, he remembered Minnie. Minnie had always
been a stickler. She had called him down the second time she walked out with
him, because he had gone along on the inside, and she had laid the law down to
him that a gentleman always walked on the outside&mdash;when he was with a
lady. And Minnie had made a practice of kicking his heels, whenever they
crossed from one side of the street to the other, to remind him to get over on
the outside. He wondered where she had got that item of etiquette, and whether
it had filtered down from above and was all right.
</p>

<p>
It wouldn&rsquo;t do any harm to try it, he decided, by the time they had
reached the sidewalk; and he swung behind Ruth and took up his station on the
outside. Then the other problem presented itself. Should he offer her his arm?
He had never offered anybody his arm in his life. The girls he had known never
took the fellows&rsquo; arms. For the first several times they walked freely,
side by side, and after that it was arms around the waists, and heads against
the fellows&rsquo; shoulders where the streets were unlighted. But this was
different. She wasn&rsquo;t that kind of a girl. He must do something.
</p>

<p>
He crooked the arm next to her&mdash;crooked it very slightly and with secret
tentativeness, not invitingly, but just casually, as though he was accustomed
to walk that way. And then the wonderful thing happened. He felt her hand upon
his arm. Delicious thrills ran through him at the contact, and for a few sweet
moments it seemed that he had left the solid earth and was flying with her
through the air. But he was soon back again, perturbed by a new complication.
They were crossing the street. This would put him on the inside. He should be
on the outside. Should he therefore drop her arm and change over? And if he did
so, would he have to repeat the manoeuvre the next time? And the next? There
was something wrong about it, and he resolved not to caper about and play the
fool. Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion, and when he found himself
on the inside, he talked quickly and earnestly, making a show of being carried
away by what he was saying, so that, in case he was wrong in not changing
sides, his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness.
</p>

<p>
As they crossed Broadway, he came face to face with a new problem. In the blaze
of the electric lights, he saw Lizzie Connolly and her giggly friend. Only for
an instant he hesitated, then his hand went up and his hat came off. He could
not be disloyal to his kind, and it was to more than Lizzie Connolly that his
hat was lifted. She nodded and looked at him boldly, not with soft and gentle
eyes like Ruth&rsquo;s, but with eyes that were handsome and hard, and that
swept on past him to Ruth and itemized her face and dress and station. And he
was aware that Ruth looked, too, with quick eyes that were timid and mild as a
dove&rsquo;s, but which saw, in a look that was a flutter on and past, the
working-class girl in her cheap finery and under the strange hat that all
working-class girls were wearing just then.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a pretty girl!&rdquo; Ruth said a moment later.
</p>

<p>
Martin could have blessed her, though he said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I guess it&rsquo;s all a matter of personal taste,
but she doesn&rsquo;t strike me as being particularly pretty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, there isn&rsquo;t one woman in ten thousand with features as
regular as hers. They are splendid. Her face is as clear-cut as a cameo. And
her eyes are beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; Martin queried absently, for to him there was
only one beautiful woman in the world, and she was beside him, her hand upon
his arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I think so? If that girl had proper opportunity to dress, Mr. Eden,
and if she were taught how to carry herself, you would be fairly dazzled by
her, and so would all men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She would have to be taught how to speak,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;or
else most of the men wouldn&rsquo;t understand her. I&rsquo;m sure you
couldn&rsquo;t understand a quarter of what she said if she just spoke
naturally.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! You are as bad as Arthur when you try to make your
point.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You forget how I talked when you first met me. I have learned a new
language since then. Before that time I talked as that girl talks. Now I can
manage to make myself understood sufficiently in your language to explain that
you do not know that other girl&rsquo;s language. And do you know why she
carries herself the way she does? I think about such things now, though I never
used to think about them, and I am beginning to understand&mdash;much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why does she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has worked long hours for years at machines. When one&rsquo;s body
is young, it is very pliable, and hard work will mould it like putty according
to the nature of the work. I can tell at a glance the trades of many workingmen
I meet on the street. Look at me. Why am I rolling all about the shop? Because
of the years I put in on the sea. If I&rsquo;d put in the same years
cow-punching, with my body young and pliable, I wouldn&rsquo;t be rolling now,
but I&rsquo;d be bow-legged. And so with that girl. You noticed that her eyes
were what I might call hard. She has never been sheltered. She has had to take
care of herself, and a young girl can&rsquo;t take care of herself and keep her
eyes soft and gentle like&mdash;like yours, for example.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you are right,&rdquo; Ruth said in a low voice. &ldquo;And it is
too bad. She is such a pretty girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her and saw her eyes luminous with pity. And then he remembered
that he loved her and was lost in amazement at his fortune that permitted him
to love her and to take her on his arm to a lecture.
</p>

<p>
Who are you, Martin Eden? he demanded of himself in the looking-glass, that
night when he got back to his room. He gazed at himself long and curiously. Who
are you? What are you? Where do you belong? You belong by rights to girls like
Lizzie Connolly. You belong with the legions of toil, with all that is low, and
vulgar, and unbeautiful. You belong with the oxen and the drudges, in dirty
surroundings among smells and stenches. There are the stale vegetables now.
Those potatoes are rotting. Smell them, damn you, smell them. And yet you dare
to open the books, to listen to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful
paintings, to speak good English, to think thoughts that none of your own kind
thinks, to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys and to
love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives
in the stars! Who are you? and what are you? damn you! And are you going to
make good?
</p>

<p>
He shook his fist at himself in the glass, and sat down on the edge of the bed
to dream for a space with wide eyes. Then he got out note-book and algebra and
lost himself in quadratic equations, while the hours slipped by, and the stars
dimmed, and the gray of dawn flooded against his window.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>
It was the knot of wordy socialists and working-class philosophers that held
forth in the City Hall Park on warm afternoons that was responsible for the
great discovery. Once or twice in the month, while riding through the park on
his way to the library, Martin dismounted from his wheel and listened to the
arguments, and each time he tore himself away reluctantly. The tone of
discussion was much lower than at Mr. Morse&rsquo;s table. The men were not
grave and dignified. They lost their tempers easily and called one another
names, while oaths and obscene allusions were frequent on their lips. Once or
twice he had seen them come to blows. And yet, he knew not why, there seemed
something vital about the stuff of these men&rsquo;s thoughts. Their logomachy
was far more stimulating to his intellect than the reserved and quiet dogmatism
of Mr. Morse. These men, who slaughtered English, gesticulated like lunatics,
and fought one another&rsquo;s ideas with primitive anger, seemed somehow to be
more alive than Mr. Morse and his crony, Mr. Butler.
</p>

<p>
Martin had heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times in the park, but one
afternoon a disciple of Spencer&rsquo;s appeared, a seedy tramp with a dirty
coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence of a shirt. Battle
royal was waged, amid the smoking of many cigarettes and the expectoration of
much tobacco-juice, wherein the tramp successfully held his own, even when a
socialist workman sneered, &ldquo;There is no god but the Unknowable, and
Herbert Spencer is his prophet.&rdquo; Martin was puzzled as to what the
discussion was about, but when he rode on to the library he carried with him a
new-born interest in Herbert Spencer, and because of the frequency with which
the tramp had mentioned &ldquo;First Principles,&rdquo; Martin drew out that
volume.
</p>

<p>
So the great discovery began. Once before he had tried Spencer, and choosing
the &ldquo;Principles of Psychology&rdquo; to begin with, he had failed as
abjectly as he had failed with Madam Blavatsky. There had been no understanding
the book, and he had returned it unread. But this night, after algebra and
physics, and an attempt at a sonnet, he got into bed and opened &ldquo;First
Principles.&rdquo; Morning found him still reading. It was impossible for him
to sleep. Nor did he write that day. He lay on the bed till his body grew
tired, when he tried the hard floor, reading on his back, the book held in the
air above him, or changing from side to side. He slept that night, and did his
writing next morning, and then the book tempted him and he fell, reading all
afternoon, oblivious to everything and oblivious to the fact that that was the
afternoon Ruth gave to him. His first consciousness of the immediate world
about him was when Bernard Higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to
know if he thought they were running a restaurant.
</p>

<p>
Martin Eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days. He wanted to know, and
it was this desire that had sent him adventuring over the world. But he was now
learning from Spencer that he never had known, and that he never could have
known had he continued his sailing and wandering forever. He had merely skimmed
over the surface of things, observing detached phenomena, accumulating
fragments of facts, making superficial little generalizations&mdash;and all and
everything quite unrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and
chance. The mechanism of the flight of birds he had watched and reasoned about
with understanding; but it had never entered his head to try to explain the
process whereby birds, as organic flying mechanisms, had been developed. He had
never dreamed there was such a process. That birds should have come to be, was
unguessed. They always had been. They just happened.
</p>

<p>
And as it was with birds, so had it been with everything. His ignorant and
unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless. The medieval metaphysics
of Kant had given him the key to nothing, and had served the sole purpose of
making him doubt his own intellectual powers. In similar manner his attempt to
study evolution had been confined to a hopelessly technical volume by Romanes.
He had understood nothing, and the only idea he had gathered was that evolution
was a dry-as-dust theory, of a lot of little men possessed of huge and
unintelligible vocabularies. And now he learned that evolution was no mere
theory but an accepted process of development; that scientists no longer
disagreed about it, their only differences being over the method of evolution.
</p>

<p>
And here was the man Spencer, organizing all knowledge for him, reducing
everything to unity, elaborating ultimate realities, and presenting to his
startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization that it was like the model
of a ship such as sailors make and put into glass bottles. There was no
caprice, no chance. All was law. It was in obedience to law that the bird flew,
and it was in obedience to the same law that fermenting slime had writhed and
squirmed and put out legs and wings and become a bird.
</p>

<p>
Martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and here he was
at a higher pitch than ever. All the hidden things were laying their secrets
bare. He was drunken with comprehension. At night, asleep, he lived with the
gods in colossal nightmare; and awake, in the day, he went around like a
somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon the world he had just discovered.
At table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things, his
eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him.
In the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back
through all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away, or
traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled him to
cut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to cut
the meat, until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun shining in his brain. He
was entranced by illumination, and did not hear the &ldquo;Bughouse,&rdquo;
whispered by Jim, nor see the anxiety on his sister&rsquo;s face, nor notice
the rotary motion of Bernard Higginbotham&rsquo;s finger, whereby he imparted
the suggestion of wheels revolving in his brother-in-law&rsquo;s head.
</p>

<p>
What, in a way, most profoundly impressed Martin, was the correlation of
knowledge&mdash;of all knowledge. He had been curious to know things, and
whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments in his
brain. Thus, on the subject of sailing he had an immense store. On the subject
of woman he had a fairly large store. But these two subjects had been
unrelated. Between the two memory compartments there had been no connection.
That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should be any connection whatever
between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weather-helm or
heaving to in a gale, would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible. But
Herbert Spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous, but that it
was impossible for there to be no connection. All things were related to all
other things from the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of
atoms in the grain of sand under one&rsquo;s foot. This new concept was a
perpetual amazement to Martin, and he found himself engaged continually in
tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the other side
of the sun. He drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was unhappy
until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them all&mdash;kinship
between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes, rainbows, precious gems,
monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions, illuminating gas, cannibalism,
beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and tobacco. Thus, he unified the universe
and held it up and looked at it, or wandered through its byways and alleys and
jungles, not as a terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an
unknown goal, but observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there
was to know. And the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the
universe, and life, and his own life in the midst of it all.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; he cried at his image in the looking-glass. &ldquo;You
wanted to write, and you tried to write, and you had nothing in you to write
about. What did you have in you?&mdash;some childish notions, a few half-baked
sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a great black mass of ignorance, a
heart filled to bursting with love, and an ambition as big as your love and as
futile as your ignorance. And you wanted to write! Why, you&rsquo;re just on
the edge of beginning to get something in you to write about. You wanted to
create beauty, but how could you when you knew nothing about the nature of
beauty? You wanted to write about life when you knew nothing of the essential
characteristics of life. You wanted to write about the world and the scheme of
existence when the world was a Chinese puzzle to you and all that you could
have written would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of
existence. But cheer up, Martin, my boy. You&rsquo;ll write yet. You know a
little, a very little, and you&rsquo;re on the right road now to know more.
Some day, if you&rsquo;re lucky, you may come pretty close to knowing all that
may be known. Then you will write.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He brought his great discovery to Ruth, sharing with her all his joy and wonder
in it. But she did not seem to be so enthusiastic over it. She tacitly accepted
it and, in a way, seemed aware of it from her own studies. It did not stir her
deeply, as it did him, and he would have been surprised had he not reasoned it
out that it was not new and fresh to her as it was to him. Arthur and Norman,
he found, believed in evolution and had read Spencer, though it did not seem to
have made any vital impression upon them, while the young fellow with the
glasses and the mop of hair, Will Olney, sneered disagreeably at Spencer and
repeated the epigram, &ldquo;There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert
Spencer is his prophet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Martin forgave him the sneer, for he had begun to discover that Olney was
not in love with Ruth. Later, he was dumfounded to learn from various little
happenings not only that Olney did not care for Ruth, but that he had a
positive dislike for her. Martin could not understand this. It was a bit of
phenomena that he could not correlate with all the rest of the phenomena in the
universe. But nevertheless he felt sorry for the young fellow because of the
great lack in his nature that prevented him from a proper appreciation of
Ruth&rsquo;s fineness and beauty. They rode out into the hills several Sundays
on their wheels, and Martin had ample opportunity to observe the armed truce
that existed between Ruth and Olney. The latter chummed with Norman, throwing
Arthur and Martin into company with Ruth, for which Martin was duly grateful.
</p>

<p>
Those Sundays were great days for Martin, greatest because he was with Ruth,
and great, also, because they were putting him more on a par with the young men
of her class. In spite of their long years of disciplined education, he was
finding himself their intellectual equal, and the hours spent with them in
conversation was so much practice for him in the use of the grammar he had
studied so hard. He had abandoned the etiquette books, falling back upon
observation to show him the right things to do. Except when carried away by his
enthusiasm, he was always on guard, keenly watchful of their actions and
learning their little courtesies and refinements of conduct.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Spencer was very little read was for some time a source of
surprise to Martin. &ldquo;Herbert Spencer,&rdquo; said the man at the desk in
the library, &ldquo;oh, yes, a great mind.&rdquo; But the man did not seem to
know anything of the content of that great mind. One evening, at dinner, when
Mr. Butler was there, Martin turned the conversation upon Spencer. Mr. Morse
bitterly arraigned the English philosopher&rsquo;s agnosticism, but confessed
that he had not read &ldquo;First Principles&rdquo;; while Mr. Butler stated
that he had no patience with Spencer, had never read a line of him, and had
managed to get along quite well without him. Doubts arose in Martin&rsquo;s
mind, and had he been less strongly individual he would have accepted the
general opinion and given Herbert Spencer up. As it was, he found
Spencer&rsquo;s explanation of things convincing; and, as he phrased it to
himself, to give up Spencer would be equivalent to a navigator throwing the
compass and chronometer overboard. So Martin went on into a thorough study of
evolution, mastering more and more the subject himself, and being convinced by
the corroborative testimony of a thousand independent writers. The more he
studied, the more vistas he caught of fields of knowledge yet unexplored, and
the regret that days were only twenty-four hours long became a chronic
complaint with him.
</p>

<p>
One day, because the days were so short, he decided to give up algebra and
geometry. Trigonometry he had not even attempted. Then he cut chemistry from
his study-list, retaining only physics.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not a specialist,&rdquo; he said, in defence, to Ruth. &ldquo;Nor
am I going to try to be a specialist. There are too many special fields for any
one man, in a whole lifetime, to master a tithe of them. I must pursue general
knowledge. When I need the work of specialists, I shall refer to their
books.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that is not like having the knowledge yourself,&rdquo; she
protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it is unnecessary to have it. We profit from the work of the
specialists. That&rsquo;s what they are for. When I came in, I noticed the
chimney-sweeps at work. They&rsquo;re specialists, and when they get done, you
will enjoy clean chimneys without knowing anything about the construction of
chimneys.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s far-fetched, I am afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him curiously, and he felt a reproach in her gaze and manner. But
he was convinced of the rightness of his position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All thinkers on general subjects, the greatest minds in the world, in
fact, rely on the specialists. Herbert Spencer did that. He generalized upon
the findings of thousands of investigators. He would have had to live a
thousand lives in order to do it all himself. And so with Darwin. He took
advantage of all that had been learned by the florists and
cattle-breeders.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Martin,&rdquo; Olney said. &ldquo;You know what
you&rsquo;re after, and Ruth doesn&rsquo;t. She doesn&rsquo;t know what she is
after for herself even.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Olney rushed on, heading off her objection,
&ldquo;I know you call it general culture. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you
study if you want general culture. You can study French, or you can study
German, or cut them both out and study Esperanto, you&rsquo;ll get the culture
tone just the same. You can study Greek or Latin, too, for the same purpose,
though it will never be any use to you. It will be culture, though. Why, Ruth
studied Saxon, became clever in it,&mdash;that was two years ago,&mdash;and all
that she remembers of it now is &lsquo;Whan that sweet Aprile with his schowers
soote&rsquo;&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the way it goes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s given you the culture tone just the same,&rdquo; he
laughed, again heading her off. &ldquo;I know. We were in the same
classes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you speak of culture as if it should be a means to something,&rdquo;
Ruth cried out. Her eyes were flashing, and in her cheeks were two spots of
color. &ldquo;Culture is the end in itself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that is not what Martin wants.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want, Martin?&rdquo; Olney demanded, turning squarely upon
him.
</p>

<p>
Martin felt very uncomfortable, and looked entreaty at Ruth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, what do you want?&rdquo; Ruth asked. &ldquo;That will settle
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, of course, I want culture,&rdquo; Martin faltered. &ldquo;I love
beauty, and culture will give me a finer and keener appreciation of
beauty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head and looked triumph.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rot, and you know it,&rdquo; was Olney&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;Martin&rsquo;s after career, not culture. It just happens that culture,
in his case, is incidental to career. If he wanted to be a chemist, culture
would be unnecessary. Martin wants to write, but he&rsquo;s afraid to say so
because it will put you in the wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why does Martin want to write?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Because he
isn&rsquo;t rolling in wealth. Why do you fill your head with Saxon and general
culture? Because you don&rsquo;t have to make your way in the world. Your
father sees to that. He buys your clothes for you, and all the rest. What
rotten good is our education, yours and mine and Arthur&rsquo;s and
Norman&rsquo;s? We&rsquo;re soaked in general culture, and if our daddies went
broke to-day, we&rsquo;d be falling down to-morrow on teachers&rsquo;
examinations. The best job you could get, Ruth, would be a country school or
music teacher in a girls&rsquo; boarding-school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pray what would you do?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a blessed thing. I could earn a dollar and a half a day, common
labor, and I might get in as instructor in Hanley&rsquo;s cramming
joint&mdash;I say might, mind you, and I might be chucked out at the end of the
week for sheer inability.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin followed the discussion closely, and while he was convinced that Olney
was right, he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded Ruth. A new
conception of love formed in his mind as he listened. Reason had nothing to do
with love. It mattered not whether the woman he loved reasoned correctly or
incorrectly. Love was above reason. If it just happened that she did not fully
appreciate his necessity for a career, that did not make her a bit less
lovable. She was all lovable, and what she thought had nothing to do with her
lovableness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he replied to a question from Olney that broke
in upon his train of thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was saying that I hoped you wouldn&rsquo;t be fool enough to tackle
Latin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Latin is more than culture,&rdquo; Ruth broke in. &ldquo;It is
equipment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, are you going to tackle it?&rdquo; Olney persisted.
</p>

<p>
Martin was sore beset. He could see that Ruth was hanging eagerly upon his
answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid I won&rsquo;t have time,&rdquo; he said finally.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, but I won&rsquo;t have time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, Martin&rsquo;s not seeking culture,&rdquo; Olney exulted.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to get somewhere, to do something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s mental training. It&rsquo;s mind discipline.
It&rsquo;s what makes disciplined minds.&rdquo; Ruth looked expectantly at
Martin, as if waiting for him to change his judgment. &ldquo;You know, the
foot-ball players have to train before the big game. And that is what Latin
does for the thinker. It trains.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rot and bosh! That&rsquo;s what they told us when we were kids. But
there is one thing they didn&rsquo;t tell us then. They let us find it out for
ourselves afterwards.&rdquo; Olney paused for effect, then added, &ldquo;And
what they didn&rsquo;t tell us was that every gentleman should have studied
Latin, but that no gentleman should know Latin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s unfair,&rdquo; Ruth cried. &ldquo;I knew you were
turning the conversation just in order to get off something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clever all right,&rdquo; was the retort, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s fair, too. The only men who know their Latin are the apothecaries,
the lawyers, and the Latin professors. And if Martin wants to be one of them, I
miss my guess. But what&rsquo;s all that got to do with Herbert Spencer anyway?
Martin&rsquo;s just discovered Spencer, and he&rsquo;s wild over him. Why?
Because Spencer is taking him somewhere. Spencer couldn&rsquo;t take me
anywhere, nor you. We haven&rsquo;t got anywhere to go. You&rsquo;ll get
married some day, and I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do but keep track of the
lawyers and business agents who will take care of the money my father&rsquo;s
going to leave me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Onley got up to go, but turned at the door and delivered a parting shot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You leave Martin alone, Ruth. He knows what&rsquo;s best for himself.
Look at what he&rsquo;s done already. He makes me sick sometimes, sick and
ashamed of myself. He knows more now about the world, and life, and man&rsquo;s
place, and all the rest, than Arthur, or Norman, or I, or you, too, for that
matter, and in spite of all our Latin, and French, and Saxon, and
culture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Ruth is my teacher,&rdquo; Martin answered chivalrously. &ldquo;She
is responsible for what little I have learned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; Olney looked at Ruth, and his expression was malicious.
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be telling me next that you read Spencer on her
recommendation&mdash;only you didn&rsquo;t. And she doesn&rsquo;t know anything
more about Darwin and evolution than I do about King Solomon&rsquo;s mines.
What&rsquo;s that jawbreaker definition about something or other, of
Spencer&rsquo;s, that you sprang on us the other day&mdash;that indefinite,
incoherent homogeneity thing? Spring it on her, and see if she understands a
word of it. That isn&rsquo;t culture, you see. Well, tra la, and if you tackle
Latin, Martin, I won&rsquo;t have any respect for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And all the while, interested in the discussion, Martin had been aware of an
irk in it as well. It was about studies and lessons, dealing with the rudiments
of knowledge, and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted with the big things
that were stirring in him&mdash;with the grip upon life that was even then
crooking his fingers like eagle&rsquo;s talons, with the cosmic thrills that
made him ache, and with the inchoate consciousness of mastery of it all. He
likened himself to a poet, wrecked on the shores of a strange land, filled with
power of beauty, stumbling and stammering and vainly trying to sing in the
rough, barbaric tongue of his brethren in the new land. And so with him. He was
alive, painfully alive, to the great universal things, and yet he was compelled
to potter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he should
study Latin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What in hell has Latin to do with it?&rdquo; he demanded before his
mirror that night. &ldquo;I wish dead people would stay dead. Why should I and
the beauty in me be ruled by the dead? Beauty is alive and everlasting.
Languages come and go. They are the dust of the dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well, and he
went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion when he was with
Ruth. He was only a schoolboy, with a schoolboy&rsquo;s tongue, when he was in
her presence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me time,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;Only give me time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Time! Time! Time! was his unending plaint.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>
It was not because of Olney, but in spite of Ruth, and his love for Ruth, that
he finally decided not to take up Latin. His money meant time. There was so
much that was more important than Latin, so many studies that clamored with
imperious voices. And he must write. He must earn money. He had had no
acceptances. Twoscore of manuscripts were travelling the endless round of the
magazines. How did the others do it? He spent long hours in the free
reading-room, going over what others had written, studying their work eagerly
and critically, comparing it with his own, and wondering, wondering, about the
secret trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work.
</p>

<p>
He was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead. No light,
no life, no color, was shot through it. There was no breath of life in it, and
yet it sold, at two cents a word, twenty dollars a thousand&mdash;the newspaper
clipping had said so. He was puzzled by countless short stories, written
lightly and cleverly he confessed, but without vitality or reality. Life was so
strange and wonderful, filled with an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of
heroic toils, and yet these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life.
He felt the stress and strain of life, its fevers and sweats and wild
insurgences&mdash;surely this was the stuff to write about! He wanted to
glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers, the giants that fought
under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy, making life crackle with the
strength of their endeavor. And yet the magazine short stories seemed intent on
glorifying the Mr. Butlers, the sordid dollar-chasers, and the commonplace
little love affairs of commonplace little men and women. Was it because the
editors of the magazines were commonplace? he demanded. Or were they afraid of
life, these writers and editors and readers?
</p>

<p>
But his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers. And not
merely did he not know any writers, but he did not know anybody who had ever
attempted to write. There was nobody to tell him, to hint to him, to give him
the least word of advice. He began to doubt that editors were real men. They
seemed cogs in a machine. That was what it was, a machine. He poured his soul
into stories, articles, and poems, and intrusted them to the machine. He folded
them just so, put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the
manuscript, sealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into
the mail-box. It travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse of
time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope, on the
outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed. There was no human editor at
the other end, but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that changed the
manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the stamps. It was like
the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies, and, with a metallic whirl of
machinery had delivered to him a stick of chewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate.
It depended upon which slot one dropped the penny in, whether he got chocolate
or gum. And so with the editorial machine. One slot brought checks and the
other brought rejection slips. So far he had found only the latter slot.
</p>

<p>
It was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness of the
process. These slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he had received
hundreds of them&mdash;as many as a dozen or more on each of his earlier
manuscripts. If he had received one line, one personal line, along with one
rejection of all his rejections, he would have been cheered. But not one editor
had given that proof of existence. And he could conclude only that there were
no warm human men at the other end, only mere cogs, well oiled and running
beautifully in the machine.
</p>

<p>
He was a good fighter, whole-souled and stubborn, and he would have been
content to continue feeding the machine for years; but he was bleeding to
death, and not years but weeks would determine the fight. Each week his board
bill brought him nearer destruction, while the postage on forty manuscripts
bled him almost as severely. He no longer bought books, and he economized in
petty ways and sought to delay the inevitable end; though he did not know how
to economize, and brought the end nearer by a week when he gave his sister
Marian five dollars for a dress.
</p>

<p>
He struggled in the dark, without advice, without encouragement, and in the
teeth of discouragement. Even Gertrude was beginning to look askance. At first
she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she conceived to be his
foolishness; but now, out of sisterly solicitude, she grew anxious. To her it
seemed that his foolishness was becoming a madness. Martin knew this and
suffered more keenly from it than from the open and nagging contempt of Bernard
Higginbotham. Martin had faith in himself, but he was alone in this faith. Not
even Ruth had faith. She had wanted him to devote himself to study, and, though
she had not openly disapproved of his writing, she had never approved.
</p>

<p>
He had never offered to show her his work. A fastidious delicacy had prevented
him. Besides, she had been studying heavily at the university, and he felt
averse to robbing her of her time. But when she had taken her degree, she asked
him herself to let her see something of what he had been doing. Martin was
elated and diffident. Here was a judge. She was a bachelor of arts. She had
studied literature under skilled instructors. Perhaps the editors were capable
judges, too. But she would be different from them. She would not hand him a
stereotyped rejection slip, nor would she inform him that lack of preference
for his work did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work. She would
talk, a warm human being, in her quick, bright way, and, most important of all,
she would catch glimpses of the real Martin Eden. In his work she would discern
what his heart and soul were like, and she would come to understand something,
a little something, of the stuff of his dreams and the strength of his power.
</p>

<p>
Martin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short stories,
hesitated a moment, then added his &ldquo;Sea Lyrics.&rdquo; They mounted their
wheels on a late June afternoon and rode for the hills. It was the second time
he had been out with her alone, and as they rode along through the balmy
warmth, just chilled by she sea-breeze to refreshing coolness, he was
profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very beautiful and well-ordered
world and that it was good to be alive and to love. They left their wheels by
the roadside and climbed to the brown top of an open knoll where the sunburnt
grass breathed a harvest breath of dry sweetness and content.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Its work is done,&rdquo; Martin said, as they seated themselves, she
upon his coat, and he sprawling close to the warm earth. He sniffed the
sweetness of the tawny grass, which entered his brain and set his thoughts
whirling on from the particular to the universal. &ldquo;It has achieved its
reason for existence,&rdquo; he went on, patting the dry grass affectionately.
&ldquo;It quickened with ambition under the dreary downpour of last winter,
fought the violent early spring, flowered, and lured the insects and the bees,
scattered its seeds, squared itself with its duty and the world,
and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical
eyes?&rdquo; she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve been studying evolution, I guess. It&rsquo;s only
recently that I got my eyesight, if the truth were told.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical, that
you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the down off
their beautiful wings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beauty has significance, but I never knew its significance before. I
just accepted beauty as something meaningless, as something that was just
beautiful without rhyme or reason. I did not know anything about beauty. But
now I know, or, rather, am just beginning to know. This grass is more beautiful
to me now that I know why it is grass, and all the hidden chemistry of sun and
rain and earth that makes it become grass. Why, there is romance in the
life-history of any grass, yes, and adventure, too. The very thought of it
stirs me. When I think of the play of force and matter, and all the tremendous
struggle of it, I feel as if I could write an epic on the grass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How well you talk,&rdquo; she said absently, and he noted that she was
looking at him in a searching way.
</p>

<p>
He was all confusion and embarrassment on the instant, the blood flushing red
on his neck and brow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope I am learning to talk,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;There seems to
be so much in me I want to say. But it is all so big. I can&rsquo;t find ways
to say what is really in me. Sometimes it seems to me that all the world, all
life, everything, had taken up residence inside of me and was clamoring for me
to be the spokesman. I feel&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t describe it&mdash;I feel
the bigness of it, but when I speak, I babble like a little child. It is a
great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech, written or spoken,
that will, in turn, in him who reads or listens, transmute itself back into the
selfsame feeling and sensation. It is a lordly task. See, I bury my face in the
grass, and the breath I draw in through my nostrils sets me quivering with a
thousand thoughts and fancies. It is a breath of the universe I have breathed.
I know song and laughter, and success and pain, and struggle and death; and I
see visions that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass, and I
would like to tell them to you, to the world. But how can I? My tongue is tied.
I have tried, by the spoken word, just now, to describe to you the effect on me
of the scent of the grass. But I have not succeeded. I have no more than hinted
in awkward speech. My words seem gibberish to me. And yet I am stifled with
desire to tell. Oh!&mdash;&rdquo; he threw up his hands with a despairing
gesture&mdash;&ldquo;it is impossible! It is not understandable! It is
incommunicable!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you do talk well,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Just think how you
have improved in the short time I have known you. Mr. Butler is a noted public
speaker. He is always asked by the State Committee to go out on stump during
campaign. Yet you talked just as well as he the other night at dinner. Only he
was more controlled. You get too excited; but you will get over that with
practice. Why, you would make a good public speaker. You can go far&mdash;if
you want to. You are masterly. You can lead men, I am sure, and there is no
reason why you should not succeed at anything you set your hand to, just as you
have succeeded with grammar. You would make a good lawyer. You should shine in
politics. There is nothing to prevent you from making as great a success as Mr.
Butler has made. And minus the dyspepsia,&rdquo; she added with a smile.
</p>

<p>
They talked on; she, in her gently persistent way, returning always to the need
of thorough grounding in education and to the advantages of Latin as part of
the foundation for any career. She drew her ideal of the successful man, and it
was largely in her father&rsquo;s image, with a few unmistakable lines and
touches of color from the image of Mr. Butler. He listened eagerly, with
receptive ears, lying on his back and looking up and joying in each movement of
her lips as she talked. But his brain was not receptive. There was nothing
alluring in the pictures she drew, and he was aware of a dull pain of
disappointment and of a sharper ache of love for her. In all she said there was
no mention of his writing, and the manuscripts he had brought to read lay
neglected on the ground.
</p>

<p>
At last, in a pause, he glanced at the sun, measured its height above the
horizon, and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had forgotten,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;And I am so anxious to
hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He read to her a story, one that he flattered himself was among his very best.
He called it &ldquo;The Wine of Life,&rdquo; and the wine of it, that had
stolen into his brain when he wrote it, stole into his brain now as he read it.
There was a certain magic in the original conception, and he had adorned it
with more magic of phrase and touch. All the old fire and passion with which he
had written it were reborn in him, and he was swayed and swept away so that he
was blind and deaf to the faults of it. But it was not so with Ruth. Her
trained ear detected the weaknesses and exaggerations, the overemphasis of the
tyro, and she was instantly aware each time the sentence-rhythm tripped and
faltered. She scarcely noted the rhythm otherwise, except when it became too
pompous, at which moments she was disagreeably impressed with its
amateurishness. That was her final judgment on the story as a
whole&mdash;amateurish, though she did not tell him so. Instead, when he had
done, she pointed out the minor flaws and said that she liked the story.
</p>

<p>
But he was disappointed. Her criticism was just. He acknowledged that, but he
had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her for the purpose of
schoolroom correction. The details did not matter. They could take care of
themselves. He could mend them, he could learn to mend them. Out of life he had
captured something big and attempted to imprison it in the story. It was the
big thing out of life he had read to her, not sentence-structure and
semicolons. He wanted her to feel with him this big thing that was his, that he
had seen with his own eyes, grappled with his own brain, and placed there on
the page with his own hands in printed words. Well, he had failed, was his
secret decision. Perhaps the editors were right. He had felt the big thing, but
he had failed to transmute it. He concealed his disappointment, and joined so
easily with her in her criticism that she did not realize that deep down in him
was running a strong undercurrent of disagreement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This next thing I&rsquo;ve called &lsquo;The Pot&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said,
unfolding the manuscript. &ldquo;It has been refused by four or five magazines
now, but still I think it is good. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know what to think of
it, except that I&rsquo;ve caught something there. Maybe it won&rsquo;t affect
you as it does me. It&rsquo;s a short thing&mdash;only two thousand
words.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; she cried, when he had finished. &ldquo;It is
horrible, unutterably horrible!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He noted her pale face, her eyes wide and tense, and her clenched hands, with
secret satisfaction. He had succeeded. He had communicated the stuff of fancy
and feeling from out of his brain. It had struck home. No matter whether she
liked it or not, it had gripped her and mastered her, made her sit there and
listen and forget details.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and life is not always beautiful. And
yet, perhaps because I am strangely made, I find something beautiful there. It
seems to me that the beauty is tenfold enhanced because it is
there&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why couldn&rsquo;t the poor woman&mdash;&rdquo; she broke in
disconnectedly. Then she left the revolt of her thought unexpressed to cry out:
&ldquo;Oh! It is degrading! It is not nice! It is nasty!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For the moment it seemed to him that his heart stood still. <i>Nasty</i>! He
had never dreamed it. He had not meant it. The whole sketch stood before him in
letters of fire, and in such blaze of illumination he sought vainly for
nastiness. Then his heart began to beat again. He was not guilty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you select a nice subject?&rdquo; she was saying.
&ldquo;We know there are nasty things in the world, but that is no
reason&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She talked on in her indignant strain, but he was not following her. He was
smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face, so innocent, so
penetratingly innocent, that its purity seemed always to enter into him,
driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some ethereal effulgence that
was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine. <i>We know there are nasty
things in the world</i>! He cuddled to him the notion of her knowing, and
chuckled over it as a love joke. The next moment, in a flashing vision of
multitudinous detail, he sighted the whole sea of life&rsquo;s nastiness that
he had known and voyaged over and through, and he forgave her for not
understanding the story. It was through no fault of hers that she could not
understand. He thanked God that she had been born and sheltered to such
innocence. But he knew life, its foulness as well as its fairness, its
greatness in spite of the slime that infested it, and by God he was going to
have his say on it to the world. Saints in heaven&mdash;how could they be
anything but fair and pure? No praise to them. But saints in slime&mdash;ah,
that was the everlasting wonder! That was what made life worth while. To see
moral grandeur rising out of cesspools of iniquity; to rise himself and first
glimpse beauty, faint and far, through mud-dripping eyes; to see out of
weakness, and frailty, and viciousness, and all abysmal brutishness, arising
strength, and truth, and high spiritual endowment&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He caught a stray sequence of sentences she was uttering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The tone of it all is low. And there is so much that is high. Take
&lsquo;In Memoriam.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was impelled to suggest &ldquo;Locksley Hall,&rdquo; and would have done so,
had not his vision gripped him again and left him staring at her, the female of
his kind, who, out of the primordial ferment, creeping and crawling up the vast
ladder of life for a thousand thousand centuries, had emerged on the topmost
rung, having become one Ruth, pure, and fair, and divine, and with power to
make him know love, and to aspire toward purity, and to desire to taste
divinity&mdash;him, Martin Eden, who, too, had come up in some amazing fashion
from out of the ruck and the mire and the countless mistakes and abortions of
unending creation. There was the romance, and the wonder, and the glory. There
was the stuff to write, if he could only find speech. Saints in
heaven!&mdash;They were only saints and could not help themselves. But he was a
man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have strength,&rdquo; he could hear her saying, &ldquo;but it is
untutored strength.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like a bull in a china shop,&rdquo; he suggested, and won a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you must develop discrimination. You must consult taste, and
fineness, and tone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dare too much,&rdquo; he muttered.
</p>

<p>
She smiled approbation, and settled herself to listen to another story.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll make of this,&rdquo; he said
apologetically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing. I&rsquo;m afraid I got beyond
my depth in it, but my intentions were good. Don&rsquo;t bother about the
little features of it. Just see if you catch the feel of the big thing in it.
It is big, and it is true, though the chance is large that I have failed to
make it intelligible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He read, and as he read he watched her. At last he had reached her, he thought.
She sat without movement, her eyes steadfast upon him, scarcely breathing,
caught up and out of herself, he thought, by the witchery of the thing he had
created. He had entitled the story &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; and it was the
apotheosis of adventure&mdash;not of the adventure of the storybooks, but of
real adventure, the savage taskmaster, awful of punishment and awful of reward,
faithless and whimsical, demanding terrible patience and heartbreaking days and
nights of toil, offering the blazing sunlight glory or dark death at the end of
thirst and famine or of the long drag and monstrous delirium of rotting fever,
through blood and sweat and stinging insects leading up by long chains of petty
and ignoble contacts to royal culminations and lordly achievements.
</p>

<p>
It was this, all of it, and more, that he had put into his story, and it was
this, he believed, that warmed her as she sat and listened. Her eyes were wide,
color was in her pale cheeks, and before he finished it seemed to him that she
was almost panting. Truly, she was warmed; but she was warmed, not by the
story, but by him. She did not think much of the story; it was Martin&rsquo;s
intensity of power, the old excess of strength that seemed to pour from his
body and on and over her. The paradox of it was that it was the story itself
that was freighted with his power, that was the channel, for the time being,
through which his strength poured out to her. She was aware only of the
strength, and not of the medium, and when she seemed most carried away by what
he had written, in reality she had been carried away by something quite foreign
to it&mdash;by a thought, terrible and perilous, that had formed itself
unsummoned in her brain. She had caught herself wondering what marriage was
like, and the becoming conscious of the waywardness and ardor of the thought
had terrified her. It was unmaidenly. It was not like her. She had never been
tormented by womanhood, and she had lived in a dreamland of Tennysonian poesy,
dense even to the full significance of that delicate master&rsquo;s delicate
allusions to the grossnesses that intrude upon the relations of queens and
knights. She had been asleep, always, and now life was thundering imperatively
at all her doors. Mentally she was in a panic to shoot the bolts and drop the
bars into place, while wanton instincts urged her to throw wide her portals and
bid the deliciously strange visitor to enter in.
</p>

<p>
Martin waited with satisfaction for her verdict. He had no doubt of what it
would be, and he was astounded when he heard her say:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; she repeated, with emphasis, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
Of course it was beautiful; but there was something more than mere beauty in
it, something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty its handmaiden. He
sprawled silently on the ground, watching the grisly form of a great doubt
rising before him. He had failed. He was inarticulate. He had seen one of the
greatest things in the world, and he had not expressed it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you think of the&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated, abashed at his
first attempt to use a strange word. &ldquo;Of the <i>motif</i>?&rdquo; he
asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was confused,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;That is my only criticism
in the large way. I followed the story, but there seemed so much else. It is
too wordy. You clog the action by introducing so much extraneous
material.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was the major <i>motif</i>,&rdquo; he hurriedly explained,
&ldquo;the big underrunning <i>motif</i>, the cosmic and universal thing. I
tried to make it keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial
after all. I was on the right scent, but I guess I did it badly. I did not
succeed in suggesting what I was driving at. But I&rsquo;ll learn in
time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not follow him. She was a bachelor of arts, but he had gone beyond her
limitations. This she did not comprehend, attributing her incomprehension to
his incoherence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were too voluble,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it was beautiful, in
places.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He heard her voice as from far off, for he was debating whether he would read
her the &ldquo;Sea Lyrics.&rdquo; He lay in dull despair, while she watched him
searchingly, pondering again upon unsummoned and wayward thoughts of marriage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want to be famous?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, a little bit,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;That is part of the
adventure. It is not the being famous, but the process of becoming so, that
counts. And after all, to be famous would be, for me, only a means to something
else. I want to be famous very much, for that matter, and for that
reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For your sake,&rdquo; he wanted to add, and might have added had she
proved enthusiastic over what he had read to her.
</p>

<p>
But she was too busy in her mind, carving out a career for him that would at
least be possible, to ask what the ultimate something was which he had hinted
at. There was no career for him in literature. Of that she was convinced. He
had proved it to-day, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions. He could
talk well, but he was incapable of expressing himself in a literary way. She
compared Tennyson, and Browning, and her favorite prose masters with him, and
to his hopeless discredit. Yet she did not tell him her whole mind. Her strange
interest in him led her to temporize. His desire to write was, after all, a
little weakness which he would grow out of in time. Then he would devote
himself to the more serious affairs of life. And he would succeed, too. She
knew that. He was so strong that he could not fail&mdash;if only he would drop
writing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you would show me all you write, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
He flushed with pleasure. She was interested, that much was sure. And at least
she had not given him a rejection slip. She had called certain portions of his
work beautiful, and that was the first encouragement he had ever received from
any one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said passionately. &ldquo;And I promise you, Miss
Morse, that I will make good. I have come far, I know that; and I have far to
go, and I will cover it if I have to do it on my hands and knees.&rdquo; He
held up a bunch of manuscript. &ldquo;Here are the &lsquo;Sea Lyrics.&rsquo;
When you get home, I&rsquo;ll turn them over to you to read at your leisure.
And you must be sure to tell me just what you think of them. What I need, you
know, above all things, is criticism. And do, please, be frank with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will be perfectly frank,&rdquo; she promised, with an uneasy
conviction that she had not been frank with him and with a doubt if she could
be quite frank with him the next time.

<h2><a name="chap15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;The first battle, fought and finished,&rdquo; Martin said to the
looking-glass ten days later. &ldquo;But there will be a second battle, and a
third battle, and battles to the end of time, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had not finished the sentence, but looked about the mean little room and let
his eyes dwell sadly upon a heap of returned manuscripts, still in their long
envelopes, which lay in a corner on the floor. He had no stamps with which to
continue them on their travels, and for a week they had been piling up. More of
them would come in on the morrow, and on the next day, and the next, till they
were all in. And he would be unable to start them out again. He was a
month&rsquo;s rent behind on the typewriter, which he could not pay, having
barely enough for the week&rsquo;s board which was due and for the employment
office fees.
</p>

<p>
He sat down and regarded the table thoughtfully. There were ink stains upon it,
and he suddenly discovered that he was fond of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear old table,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent some happy hours
with you, and you&rsquo;ve been a pretty good friend when all is said and done.
You never turned me down, never passed me out a reward-of-unmerit rejection
slip, never complained about working overtime.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He dropped his arms upon the table and buried his face in them. His throat was
aching, and he wanted to cry. It reminded him of his first fight, when he was
six years old, when he punched away with the tears running down his cheeks
while the other boy, two years his elder, had beaten and pounded him into
exhaustion. He saw the ring of boys, howling like barbarians as he went down at
last, writhing in the throes of nausea, the blood streaming from his nose and
the tears from his bruised eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor little shaver,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re just as
badly licked now. You&rsquo;re beaten to a pulp. You&rsquo;re down and
out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the vision of that first fight still lingered under his eyelids, and as he
watched he saw it dissolve and reshape into the series of fights which had
followed. Six months later Cheese-Face (that was the boy) had whipped him
again. But he had blacked Cheese-Face&rsquo;s eye that time. That was going
some. He saw them all, fight after fight, himself always whipped and
Cheese-Face exulting over him. But he had never run away. He felt strengthened
by the memory of that. He had always stayed and taken his medicine. Cheese-Face
had been a little fiend at fighting, and had never once shown mercy to him. But
he had stayed! He had stayed with it!
</p>

<p>
Next, he saw a narrow alley, between ramshackle frame buildings. The end of the
alley was blocked by a one-story brick building, out of which issued the
rhythmic thunder of the presses, running off the first edition of the
<i>Enquirer</i>. He was eleven, and Cheese-Face was thirteen, and they both
carried the <i>Enquirer</i>. That was why they were there, waiting for their
papers. And, of course, Cheese-Face had picked on him again, and there was
another fight that was indeterminate, because at quarter to four the door of
the press-room was thrown open and the gang of boys crowded in to fold their
papers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lick you to-morrow,&rdquo; he heard Cheese-Face promise; and
he heard his own voice, piping and trembling with unshed tears, agreeing to be
there on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
And he had come there the next day, hurrying from school to be there first, and
beating Cheese-Face by two minutes. The other boys said he was all right, and
gave him advice, pointing out his faults as a scrapper and promising him
victory if he carried out their instructions. The same boys gave Cheese-Face
advice, too. How they had enjoyed the fight! He paused in his recollections
long enough to envy them the spectacle he and Cheese-Face had put up. Then the
fight was on, and it went on, without rounds, for thirty minutes, until the
press-room door was opened.
</p>

<p>
He watched the youthful apparition of himself, day after day, hurrying from
school to the <i>Enquirer</i> alley. He could not walk very fast. He was stiff
and lame from the incessant fighting. His forearms were black and blue from
wrist to elbow, what of the countless blows he had warded off, and here and
there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester. His head and arms and
shoulders ached, the small of his back ached,&mdash;he ached all over, and his
brain was heavy and dazed. He did not play at school. Nor did he study. Even to
sit still all day at his desk, as he did, was a torment. It seemed centuries
since he had begun the round of daily fights, and time stretched away into a
nightmare and infinite future of daily fights. Why couldn&rsquo;t Cheese-Face
be licked? he often thought; that would put him, Martin, out of his misery. It
never entered his head to cease fighting, to allow Cheese-Face to whip him.
</p>

<p>
And so he dragged himself to the <i>Enquirer</i> alley, sick in body and soul,
but learning the long patience, to confront his eternal enemy, Cheese-Face, who
was just as sick as he, and just a bit willing to quit if it were not for the
gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride painful and necessary. One
afternoon, after twenty minutes of desperate efforts to annihilate each other
according to set rules that did not permit kicking, striking below the belt,
nor hitting when one was down, Cheese-Face, panting for breath and reeling,
offered to call it quits. And Martin, head on arms, thrilled at the picture he
caught of himself, at that moment in the afternoon of long ago, when he reeled
and panted and choked with the blood that ran into his mouth and down his
throat from his cut lips; when he tottered toward Cheese-Face, spitting out a
mouthful of blood so that he could speak, crying out that he would never quit,
though Cheese-Face could give in if he wanted to. And Cheese-Face did not give
in, and the fight went on.
</p>

<p>
The next day and the next, days without end, witnessed the afternoon fight.
When he put up his arms, each day, to begin, they pained exquisitely, and the
first few blows, struck and received, racked his soul; after that things grew
numb, and he fought on blindly, seeing as in a dream, dancing and wavering, the
large features and burning, animal-like eyes of Cheese-Face. He concentrated
upon that face; all else about him was a whirling void. There was nothing else
in the world but that face, and he would never know rest, blessed rest, until
he had beaten that face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles, or until the
bleeding knuckles that somehow belonged to that face had beaten him into a
pulp. And then, one way or the other, he would have rest. But to
quit,&mdash;for him, Martin, to quit,&mdash;that was impossible!
</p>

<p>
Came the day when he dragged himself into the <i>Enquirer</i> alley, and there
was no Cheese-Face. Nor did Cheese-Face come. The boys congratulated him, and
told him that he had licked Cheese-Face. But Martin was not satisfied. He had
not licked Cheese-Face, nor had Cheese-Face licked him. The problem had not
been solved. It was not until afterward that they learned that
Cheese-Face&rsquo;s father had died suddenly that very day.
</p>

<p>
Martin skipped on through the years to the night in the nigger heaven at the
Auditorium. He was seventeen and just back from sea. A row started. Somebody
was bullying somebody, and Martin interfered, to be confronted by
Cheese-Face&rsquo;s blazing eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you after de show,&rdquo; his ancient enemy hissed.
</p>

<p>
Martin nodded. The nigger-heaven bouncer was making his way toward the
disturbance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you outside, after the last act,&rdquo; Martin
whispered, the while his face showed undivided interest in the buck-and-wing
dancing on the stage.
</p>

<p>
The bouncer glared and went away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Got a gang?&rdquo; he asked Cheese-Face, at the end of the act.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I got to get one,&rdquo; Martin announced.
</p>

<p>
Between the acts he mustered his following&mdash;three fellows he knew from the
nail works, a railroad fireman, and half a dozen of the Boo Gang, along with as
many more from the dread Eighteen-and-Market Gang.
</p>

<p>
When the theatre let out, the two gangs strung along inconspicuously on
opposite sides of the street. When they came to a quiet corner, they united and
held a council of war.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eighth Street Bridge is the place,&rdquo; said a red-headed fellow
belonging to Cheese-Face&rsquo;s Gang. &ldquo;You kin fight in the middle,
under the electric light, an&rsquo; whichever way the bulls come in we kin
sneak the other way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s agreeable to me,&rdquo; Martin said, after consulting with
the leaders of his own gang.
</p>

<p>
The Eighth Street Bridge, crossing an arm of San Antonio Estuary, was the
length of three city blocks. In the middle of the bridge, and at each end, were
electric lights. No policeman could pass those end-lights unseen. It was the
safe place for the battle that revived itself under Martin&rsquo;s eyelids. He
saw the two gangs, aggressive and sullen, rigidly keeping apart from each other
and backing their respective champions; and he saw himself and Cheese-Face
stripping. A short distance away lookouts were set, their task being to watch
the lighted ends of the bridge. A member of the Boo Gang held Martin&rsquo;s
coat, and shirt, and cap, ready to race with them into safety in case the
police interfered. Martin watched himself go into the centre, facing
Cheese-Face, and he heard himself say, as he held up his hand warningly:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t no hand-shakin&rsquo; in this. Understand? They
ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but scrap. No throwin&rsquo; up the sponge. This is a
grudge-fight an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s to a finish. Understand? Somebody&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to get licked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cheese-Face wanted to demur,&mdash;Martin could see that,&mdash;but
Cheese-Face&rsquo;s old perilous pride was touched before the two gangs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aw, come on,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the good of
chewin&rsquo; de rag about it? I&rsquo;m wit&rsquo; cheh to de finish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then they fell upon each other, like young bulls, in all the glory of youth,
with naked fists, with hatred, with desire to hurt, to maim, to destroy. All
the painful, thousand years&rsquo; gains of man in his upward climb through
creation were lost. Only the electric light remained, a milestone on the path
of the great human adventure. Martin and Cheese-Face were two savages, of the
stone age, of the squatting place and the tree refuge. They sank lower and
lower into the muddy abyss, back into the dregs of the raw beginnings of life,
striving blindly and chemically, as atoms strive, as the star-dust of the
heavens strives, colliding, recoiling, and colliding again and eternally again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God! We are animals! Brute-beasts!&rdquo; Martin muttered aloud, as he
watched the progress of the fight. It was to him, with his splendid power of
vision, like gazing into a kinetoscope. He was both onlooker and participant.
His long months of culture and refinement shuddered at the sight; then the
present was blotted out of his consciousness and the ghosts of the past
possessed him, and he was Martin Eden, just returned from sea and fighting
Cheese-Face on the Eighth Street Bridge. He suffered and toiled and sweated and
bled, and exulted when his naked knuckles smashed home.
</p>

<p>
They were twin whirlwinds of hatred, revolving about each other monstrously.
The time passed, and the two hostile gangs became very quiet. They had never
witnessed such intensity of ferocity, and they were awed by it. The two
fighters were greater brutes than they. The first splendid velvet edge of youth
and condition wore off, and they fought more cautiously and deliberately. There
had been no advantage gained either way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s
fight,&rdquo; Martin heard some one saying. Then he followed up a feint, right
and left, was fiercely countered, and felt his cheek laid open to the bone. No
bare knuckle had done that. He heard mutters of amazement at the ghastly damage
wrought, and was drenched with his own blood. But he gave no sign. He became
immensely wary, for he was wise with knowledge of the low cunning and foul
vileness of his kind. He watched and waited, until he feigned a wild rush,
which he stopped midway, for he had seen the glint of metal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold up yer hand!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Them&rsquo;s brass
knuckles, an&rsquo; you hit me with &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both gangs surged forward, growling and snarling. In a second there would be a
free-for-all fight, and he would be robbed of his vengeance. He was beside
himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You guys keep out!&rdquo; he screamed hoarsely. &ldquo;Understand? Say,
d&rsquo;ye understand?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They shrank away from him. They were brutes, but he was the arch-brute, a thing
of terror that towered over them and dominated them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is my scrap, an&rsquo; they ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be no
buttin&rsquo; in. Gimme them knuckles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cheese-Face, sobered and a bit frightened, surrendered the foul weapon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You passed &rsquo;em to him, you red-head sneakin&rsquo; in behind the
push there,&rdquo; Martin went on, as he tossed the knuckles into the water.
&ldquo;I seen you, an&rsquo; I was wonderin&rsquo; what you was up to. If you
try anything like that again, I&rsquo;ll beat cheh to death. Understand?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They fought on, through exhaustion and beyond, to exhaustion immeasurable and
inconceivable, until the crowd of brutes, its blood-lust sated, terrified by
what it saw, begged them impartially to cease. And Cheese-Face, ready to drop
and die, or to stay on his legs and die, a grisly monster out of whose features
all likeness to Cheese-Face had been beaten, wavered and hesitated; but Martin
sprang in and smashed him again and again.
</p>

<p>
Next, after a seeming century or so, with Cheese-Face weakening fast, in a
mix-up of blows there was a loud snap, and Martin&rsquo;s right arm dropped to
his side. It was a broken bone. Everybody heard it and knew; and Cheese-Face
knew, rushing like a tiger in the other&rsquo;s extremity and raining blow on
blow. Martin&rsquo;s gang surged forward to interfere. Dazed by the rapid
succession of blows, Martin warned them back with vile and earnest curses
sobbed out and groaned in ultimate desolation and despair.
</p>

<p>
He punched on, with his left hand only, and as he punched, doggedly, only
half-conscious, as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear in the
gangs, and one who said with shaking voice: &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t a scrap,
fellows. It&rsquo;s murder, an&rsquo; we ought to stop it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But no one stopped it, and he was glad, punching on wearily and endlessly with
his one arm, battering away at a bloody something before him that was not a
face but a horror, an oscillating, hideous, gibbering, nameless thing that
persisted before his wavering vision and would not go away. And he punched on
and on, slower and slower, as the last shreds of vitality oozed from him,
through centuries and aeons and enormous lapses of time, until, in a dim way,
he became aware that the nameless thing was sinking, slowly sinking down to the
rough board-planking of the bridge. And the next moment he was standing over
it, staggering and swaying on shaky legs, clutching at the air for support, and
saying in a voice he did not recognize:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye want any more? Say, d&rsquo;ye want any more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was still saying it, over and over,&mdash;demanding, entreating,
threatening, to know if it wanted any more,&mdash;when he felt the fellows of
his gang laying hands on him, patting him on the back and trying to put his
coat on him. And then came a sudden rush of blackness and oblivion.
</p>

<p>
The tin alarm-clock on the table ticked on, but Martin Eden, his face buried on
his arms, did not hear it. He heard nothing. He did not think. So absolutely
had he relived life that he had fainted just as he fainted years before on the
Eighth Street Bridge. For a full minute the blackness and the blankness
endured. Then, like one from the dead, he sprang upright, eyes flaming, sweat
pouring down his face, shouting:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I licked you, Cheese-Face! It took me eleven years, but I licked
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His knees were trembling under him, he felt faint, and he staggered back to the
bed, sinking down and sitting on the edge of it. He was still in the clutch of
the past. He looked about the room, perplexed, alarmed, wondering where he was,
until he caught sight of the pile of manuscripts in the corner. Then the wheels
of memory slipped ahead through four years of time, and he was aware of the
present, of the books he had opened and the universe he had won from their
pages, of his dreams and ambitions, and of his love for a pale wraith of a
girl, sensitive and sheltered and ethereal, who would die of horror did she
witness but one moment of what he had just lived through&mdash;one moment of
all the muck of life through which he had waded.
</p>

<p>
He arose to his feet and confronted himself in the looking-glass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so you arise from the mud, Martin Eden,&rdquo; he said solemnly.
&ldquo;And you cleanse your eyes in a great brightness, and thrust your
shoulders among the stars, doing what all life has done, letting the &lsquo;ape
and tiger die&rsquo; and wresting highest heritage from all powers that
be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked more closely at himself and laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bit of hysteria and melodrama, eh?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Well,
never mind. You licked Cheese-Face, and you&rsquo;ll lick the editors if it
takes twice eleven years to do it in. You can&rsquo;t stop here. You&rsquo;ve
got to go on. It&rsquo;s to a finish, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>
The alarm-clock went off, jerking Martin out of sleep with a suddenness that
would have given headache to one with less splendid constitution. Though he
slept soundly, he awoke instantly, like a cat, and he awoke eagerly, glad that
the five hours of unconsciousness were gone. He hated the oblivion of sleep.
There was too much to do, too much of life to live. He grudged every moment of
life sleep robbed him of, and before the clock had ceased its clattering he was
head and ears in the washbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water.
</p>

<p>
But he did not follow his regular programme. There was no unfinished story
waiting his hand, no new story demanding articulation. He had studied late, and
it was nearly time for breakfast. He tried to read a chapter in Fiske, but his
brain was restless and he closed the book. To-day witnessed the beginning of
the new battle, wherein for some time there would be no writing. He was aware
of a sadness akin to that with which one leaves home and family. He looked at
the manuscripts in the corner. That was it. He was going away from them, his
pitiful, dishonored children that were welcome nowhere. He went over and began
to rummage among them, reading snatches here and there, his favorite portions.
&ldquo;The Pot&rdquo; he honored with reading aloud, as he did
&ldquo;Adventure.&rdquo; &ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; his latest-born, completed the day
before and tossed into the corner for lack of stamps, won his keenest
approbation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Or maybe it&rsquo;s
the editors who can&rsquo;t understand. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.
They publish worse every month. Everything they publish is worse&mdash;nearly
everything, anyway.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After breakfast he put the type-writer in its case and carried it down into
Oakland.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I owe a month on it,&rdquo; he told the clerk in the store. &ldquo;But
you tell the manager I&rsquo;m going to work and that I&rsquo;ll be in in a
month or so and straighten up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He crossed on the ferry to San Francisco and made his way to an employment
office. &ldquo;Any kind of work, no trade,&rdquo; he told the agent; and was
interrupted by a new-comer, dressed rather foppishly, as some workingmen dress
who have instincts for finer things. The agent shook his head despondently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo; eh?&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Well, I got
to get somebody to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned and stared at Martin, and Martin, staring back, noted the puffed and
discolored face, handsome and weak, and knew that he had been making a night of
it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lookin&rsquo; for a job?&rdquo; the other queried. &ldquo;What can you
do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hard labor, sailorizing, run a type-writer, no shorthand, can sit on a
horse, willing to do anything and tackle anything,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
The other nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sounds good to me. My name&rsquo;s Dawson, Joe Dawson, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to scare up a laundryman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too much for me.&rdquo; Martin caught an amusing glimpse of himself
ironing fluffy white things that women wear. But he had taken a liking to the
other, and he added: &ldquo;I might do the plain washing. I learned that much
at sea.&rdquo; Joe Dawson thought visibly for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, let&rsquo;s get together an&rsquo; frame it up. Willin&rsquo;
to listen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a small laundry, up country, belongs to Shelly Hot
Springs,&mdash;hotel, you know. Two men do the work, boss and assistant.
I&rsquo;m the boss. You don&rsquo;t work for me, but you work under me. Think
you&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo; to learn?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin paused to think. The prospect was alluring. A few months of it, and he
would have time to himself for study. He could work hard and study hard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good grub an&rsquo; a room to yourself,&rdquo; Joe said.
</p>

<p>
That settled it. A room to himself where he could burn the midnight oil
unmolested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But work like hell,&rdquo; the other added.
</p>

<p>
Martin caressed his swelling shoulder-muscles significantly. &ldquo;That came
from hard work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get to it.&rdquo; Joe held his hand to his head for a
moment. &ldquo;Gee, but it&rsquo;s a stem-winder. Can hardly see. I went down
the line last night&mdash;everything&mdash;everything. Here&rsquo;s the
frame-up. The wages for two is a hundred and board. I&rsquo;ve ben
drawin&rsquo; down sixty, the second man forty. But he knew the biz.
You&rsquo;re green. If I break you in, I&rsquo;ll be doing plenty of your work
at first. Suppose you begin at thirty, an&rsquo; work up to the forty.
I&rsquo;ll play fair. Just as soon as you can do your share you get the
forty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you,&rdquo; Martin announced, stretching out his hand,
which the other shook. &ldquo;Any advance?&mdash;for rail-road ticket and
extras?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I blew it in,&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s sad answer, with another reach at
his aching head. &ldquo;All I got is a return ticket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m broke&mdash;when I pay my board.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jump it,&rdquo; Joe advised.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t. Owe it to my sister.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Joe whistled a long, perplexed whistle, and racked his brains to little
purpose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the price of the drinks,&rdquo; he said desperately.
&ldquo;Come on, an&rsquo; mebbe we&rsquo;ll cook up something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin declined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Water-wagon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This time Martin nodded, and Joe lamented, &ldquo;Wish I was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I somehow just can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said in extenuation.
&ldquo;After I&rsquo;ve ben workin&rsquo; like hell all week I just got to
booze up. If I didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d cut my throat or burn up the premises.
But I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re on the wagon. Stay with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin knew of the enormous gulf between him and this man&mdash;the gulf the
books had made; but he found no difficulty in crossing back over that gulf. He
had lived all his life in the working-class world, and the <i>camaraderie</i>
of labor was second nature with him. He solved the difficulty of transportation
that was too much for the other&rsquo;s aching head. He would send his trunk up
to Shelly Hot Springs on Joe&rsquo;s ticket. As for himself, there was his
wheel. It was seventy miles, and he could ride it on Sunday and be ready for
work Monday morning. In the meantime he would go home and pack up. There was no
one to say good-by to. Ruth and her whole family were spending the long summer
in the Sierras, at Lake Tahoe.
</p>

<p>
He arrived at Shelly Hot Springs, tired and dusty, on Sunday night. Joe greeted
him exuberantly. With a wet towel bound about his aching brow, he had been at
work all day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Part of last week&rsquo;s washin&rsquo; mounted up, me bein&rsquo; away
to get you,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Your box arrived all right. It&rsquo;s
in your room. But it&rsquo;s a hell of a thing to call a trunk. An&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s in it? Gold bricks?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Joe sat on the bed while Martin unpacked. The box was a packing-case for
breakfast food, and Mr. Higginbotham had charged him half a dollar for it. Two
rope handles, nailed on by Martin, had technically transformed it into a trunk
eligible for the baggage-car. Joe watched, with bulging eyes, a few shirts and
several changes of underclothes come out of the box, followed by books, and
more books.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Books clean to the bottom?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
Martin nodded, and went on arranging the books on a kitchen table which served
in the room in place of a wash-stand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; Joe exploded, then waited in silence for the deduction to
arise in his brain. At last it came.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t care for the girls&mdash;much?&rdquo; he queried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I used to chase a lot before I tackled
the books. But since then there&rsquo;s no time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And there won&rsquo;t be any time here. All you can do is work an&rsquo;
sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin thought of his five hours&rsquo; sleep a night, and smiled. The room was
situated over the laundry and was in the same building with the engine that
pumped water, made electricity, and ran the laundry machinery. The engineer,
who occupied the adjoining room, dropped in to meet the new hand and helped
Martin rig up an electric bulb, on an extension wire, so that it travelled
along a stretched cord from over the table to the bed.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, at quarter-past six, Martin was routed out for a
quarter-to-seven breakfast. There happened to be a bath-tub for the servants in
the laundry building, and he electrified Joe by taking a cold bath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gee, but you&rsquo;re a hummer!&rdquo; Joe announced, as they sat down
to breakfast in a corner of the hotel kitchen.
</p>

<p>
With them was the engineer, the gardener, and the assistant gardener, and two
or three men from the stable. They ate hurriedly and gloomily, with but little
conversation, and as Martin ate and listened he realized how far he had
travelled from their status. Their small mental caliber was depressing to him,
and he was anxious to get away from them. So he bolted his breakfast, a sickly,
sloppy affair, as rapidly as they, and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed
out through the kitchen door.
</p>

<p>
It was a perfectly appointed, small steam laundry, wherein the most modern
machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do. Martin, after a
few instructions, sorted the great heaps of soiled clothes, while Joe started
the masher and made up fresh supplies of soft-soap, compounded of biting
chemicals that compelled him to swathe his mouth and nostrils and eyes in
bath-towels till he resembled a mummy. Finished the sorting, Martin lent a hand
in wringing the clothes. This was done by dumping them into a spinning
receptacle that went at a rate of a few thousand revolutions a minute, tearing
the water from the clothes by centrifugal force. Then Martin began to alternate
between the dryer and the wringer, between times &ldquo;shaking out&rdquo;
socks and stockings. By the afternoon, one feeding and one stacking up, they
were running socks and stockings through the mangle while the irons were
heating. Then it was hot irons and underclothes till six o&rsquo;clock, at
which time Joe shook his head dubiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Way behind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Got to work after supper.&rdquo; And
after supper they worked until ten o&rsquo;clock, under the blazing electric
lights, until the last piece of under-clothing was ironed and folded away in
the distributing room. It was a hot California night, and though the windows
were thrown wide, the room, with its red-hot ironing-stove, was a furnace.
Martin and Joe, down to undershirts, bare armed, sweated and panted for air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like trimming cargo in the tropics,&rdquo; Martin said, when they went
upstairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Joe answered. &ldquo;You take hold like a good
fellow. If you keep up the pace, you&rsquo;ll be on thirty dollars only one
month. The second month you&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; your forty. But
don&rsquo;t tell me you never ironed before. I know better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never ironed a rag in my life, honestly, until to-day,&rdquo; Martin
protested.
</p>

<p>
He was surprised at his weariness when he got into his room, forgetful of the
fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for fourteen
hours. He set the alarm clock at six, and measured back five hours to one
o&rsquo;clock. He could read until then. Slipping off his shoes, to ease his
swollen feet, he sat down at the table with his books. He opened Fiske, where
he had left off to read. But he found trouble and began to read it through a
second time. Then he awoke, in pain from his stiffened muscles and chilled by
the mountain wind that had begun to blow in through the window. He looked at
the clock. It marked two. He had been asleep four hours. He pulled off his
clothes and crawled into bed, where he was asleep the moment after his head
touched the pillow.
</p>

<p>
Tuesday was a day of similar unremitting toil. The speed with which Joe worked
won Martin&rsquo;s admiration. Joe was a dozen of demons for work. He was keyed
up to concert pitch, and there was never a moment in the long day when he was
not fighting for moments. He concentrated himself upon his work and upon how to
save time, pointing out to Martin where he did in five motions what could be
done in three, or in three motions what could be done in two.
&ldquo;Elimination of waste motion,&rdquo; Martin phrased it as he watched and
patterned after. He was a good workman himself, quick and deft, and it had
always been a point of pride with him that no man should do any of his work for
him or outwork him. As a result, he concentrated with a similar singleness of
purpose, greedily snapping up the hints and suggestions thrown out by his
working mate. He &ldquo;rubbed out&rdquo; collars and cuffs, rubbing the starch
out from between the double thicknesses of linen so that there would be no
blisters when it came to the ironing, and doing it at a pace that elicited
Joe&rsquo;s praise.
</p>

<p>
There was never an interval when something was not at hand to be done. Joe
waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from task to task.
They starched two hundred white shirts, with a single gathering movement
seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, neckband, yoke, and bosom protruded
beyond the circling right hand. At the same moment the left hand held up the
body of the shirt so that it would not enter the starch, and at the same moment
the right hand dipped into the starch&mdash;starch so hot that, in order to
wring it out, their hands had to thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket
of cold water. And that night they worked till half-past ten, dipping
&ldquo;fancy starch&rdquo;&mdash;all the frilled and airy, delicate wear of
ladies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me for the tropics and no clothes,&rdquo; Martin laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And me out of a job,&rdquo; Joe answered seriously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know nothin&rsquo; but laundrying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you know it well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ought to. Began in the Contra Costa in Oakland when I was eleven,
shakin&rsquo; out for the mangle. That was eighteen years ago, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ve never done a tap of anything else. But this job is the fiercest I
ever had. Ought to be one more man on it at least. We work to-morrow night.
Always run the mangle Wednesday nights&mdash;collars an&rsquo; cuffs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin set his alarm, drew up to the table, and opened Fiske. He did not finish
the first paragraph. The lines blurred and ran together and his head nodded. He
walked up and down, batting his head savagely with his fists, but he could not
conquer the numbness of sleep. He propped the book before him, and propped his
eyelids with his fingers, and fell asleep with his eyes wide open. Then he
surrendered, and, scarcely conscious of what he did, got off his clothes and
into bed. He slept seven hours of heavy, animal-like sleep, and awoke by the
alarm, feeling that he had not had enough.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doin&rsquo; much readin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Joe asked.
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind. We got to run the mangle to-night, but Thursday we&rsquo;ll
knock off at six. That&rsquo;ll give you a chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin washed woollens that day, by hand, in a large barrel, with strong
soft-soap, by means of a hub from a wagon wheel, mounted on a plunger-pole that
was attached to a spring-pole overhead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My invention,&rdquo; Joe said proudly. &ldquo;Beats a washboard
an&rsquo; your knuckles, and, besides, it saves at least fifteen minutes in the
week, an&rsquo; fifteen minutes ain&rsquo;t to be sneezed at in this
shebang.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Running the collars and cuffs through the mangle was also Joe&rsquo;s idea.
That night, while they toiled on under the electric lights, he explained it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something no laundry ever does, except this one. An&rsquo; I got to do
it if I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to get done Saturday afternoon at three
o&rsquo;clock. But I know how, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the difference. Got to
have right heat, right pressure, and run &rsquo;em through three times. Look at
that!&rdquo; He held a cuff aloft. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do it better by hand
or on a tiler.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thursday, Joe was in a rage. A bundle of extra &ldquo;fancy starch&rdquo; had
come in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to quit,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
stand for it. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to quit it cold. What&rsquo;s the good of
me workin&rsquo; like a slave all week, a-savin&rsquo; minutes, an&rsquo; them
a-comin&rsquo; an&rsquo; ringin&rsquo; in fancy-starch extras on me? This is a
free country, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m to tell that fat Dutchman what I think of
him. An&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;m in French. Plain United States is
good enough for me. Him a-ringin&rsquo; in fancy starch extras!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We got to work to-night,&rdquo; he said the next moment, reversing his
judgment and surrendering to fate.
</p>

<p>
And Martin did no reading that night. He had seen no daily paper all week, and,
strangely to him, felt no desire to see one. He was not interested in the news.
He was too tired and jaded to be interested in anything, though he planned to
leave Saturday afternoon, if they finished at three, and ride on his wheel to
Oakland. It was seventy miles, and the same distance back on Sunday afternoon
would leave him anything but rested for the second week&rsquo;s work. It would
have been easier to go on the train, but the round trip was two dollars and a
half, and he was intent on saving money.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p>
Martin learned to do many things. In the course of the first week, in one
afternoon, he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts. Joe ran the
tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which
furnished the pressure. By this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and
neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy
finish on the bosom. As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack
between him and Martin, who caught them up and &ldquo;backed&rdquo; them. This
task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.
</p>

<p>
It was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed. Out on the
broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white, sipped iced drinks
and kept their circulation down. But in the laundry the air was sizzling. The
huge stove roared red hot and white hot, while the irons, moving over the damp
cloth, sent up clouds of steam. The heat of these irons was different from that
used by housewives. An iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was
too cold for Joe and Martin, and such test was useless. They went wholly by
holding the irons close to their cheeks, gauging the heat by some secret mental
process that Martin admired but could not understand. When the fresh irons
proved too hot, they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them into cold water.
This again required a precise and subtle judgment. A fraction of a second too
long in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost, and
Martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed&mdash;an automatic
accuracy, founded upon criteria that were machine-like and unerring.
</p>

<p>
But there was little time in which to marvel. All Martin&rsquo;s consciousness
was concentrated in the work. Ceaselessly active, head and hand, an intelligent
machine, all that constituted him a man was devoted to furnishing that
intelligence. There was no room in his brain for the universe and its mighty
problems. All the broad and spacious corridors of his mind were closed and
hermetically sealed. The echoing chamber of his soul was a narrow room, a
conning tower, whence were directed his arm and shoulder muscles, his ten
nimble fingers, and the swift-moving iron along its steaming path in broad,
sweeping strokes, just so many strokes and no more, just so far with each
stroke and not a fraction of an inch farther, rushing along interminable
sleeves, sides, backs, and tails, and tossing the finished shirts, without
rumpling, upon the receiving frame. And even as his hurrying soul tossed, it
was reaching for another shirt. This went on, hour after hour, while outside
all the world swooned under the overhead California sun. But there was no
swooning in that superheated room. The cool guests on the verandas needed clean
linen.
</p>

<p>
The sweat poured from Martin. He drank enormous quantities of water, but so
great was the heat of the day and of his exertions, that the water sluiced
through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his pores. Always, at sea,
except at rare intervals, the work he performed had given him ample opportunity
to commune with himself. The master of the ship had been lord of Martin&rsquo;s
time; but here the manager of the hotel was lord of Martin&rsquo;s thoughts as
well. He had no thoughts save for the nerve-racking, body-destroying toil.
Outside of that it was impossible to think. He did not know that he loved Ruth.
She did not even exist, for his driven soul had no time to remember her. It was
only when he crawled to bed at night, or to breakfast in the morning, that she
asserted herself to him in fleeting memories.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is hell, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Joe remarked once.
</p>

<p>
Martin nodded, but felt a rasp of irritation. The statement had been obvious
and unnecessary. They did not talk while they worked. Conversation threw them
out of their stride, as it did this time, compelling Martin to miss a stroke of
his iron and to make two extra motions before he caught his stride again.
</p>

<p>
On Friday morning the washer ran. Twice a week they had to put through hotel
linen,&mdash;the sheets, pillow-slips, spreads, table-cloths, and napkins. This
finished, they buckled down to &ldquo;fancy starch.&rdquo; It was slow work,
fastidious and delicate, and Martin did not learn it so readily. Besides, he
could not take chances. Mistakes were disastrous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See that,&rdquo; Joe said, holding up a filmy corset-cover that he could
have crumpled from view in one hand. &ldquo;Scorch that an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
twenty dollars out of your wages.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So Martin did not scorch that, and eased down on his muscular tension, though
nervous tension rose higher than ever, and he listened sympathetically to the
other&rsquo;s blasphemies as he toiled and suffered over the beautiful things
that women wear when they do not have to do their own laundrying. &ldquo;Fancy
starch&rdquo; was Martin&rsquo;s nightmare, and it was Joe&rsquo;s, too. It was
&ldquo;fancy starch&rdquo; that robbed them of their hard-won minutes. They
toiled at it all day. At seven in the evening they broke off to run the hotel
linen through the mangle. At ten o&rsquo;clock, while the hotel guests slept,
the two laundrymen sweated on at &ldquo;fancy starch&rdquo; till midnight, till
one, till two. At half-past two they knocked off.
</p>

<p>
Saturday morning it was &ldquo;fancy starch,&rdquo; and odds and ends, and at
three in the afternoon the week&rsquo;s work was done.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to ride them seventy miles into Oakland on
top of this?&rdquo; Joe demanded, as they sat on the stairs and took a
triumphant smoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Got to,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you goin&rsquo; for?&mdash;a girl?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; to save two and a half on the railroad ticket. I want to renew some
books at the library.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you send &rsquo;em down an&rsquo; up by express?
That&rsquo;ll cost only a quarter each way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin considered it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; take a rest to-morrow,&rdquo; the other urged. &ldquo;You need
it. I know I do. I&rsquo;m plumb tuckered out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked it. Indomitable, never resting, fighting for seconds and minutes all
week, circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles, a fount of resistless
energy, a high-driven human motor, a demon for work, now that he had
accomplished the week&rsquo;s task he was in a state of collapse. He was worn
and haggard, and his handsome face drooped in lean exhaustion. He pulled his
cigarette spiritlessly, and his voice was peculiarly dead and monotonous. All
the snap and fire had gone out of him. His triumph seemed a sorry one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; next week we got to do it all over again,&rdquo; he said
sadly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the good of it all, hey? Sometimes I wish
I was a hobo. They don&rsquo;t work, an&rsquo; they get their livin&rsquo;.
Gee! I wish I had a glass of beer; but I can&rsquo;t get up the gumption to go
down to the village an&rsquo; get it. You&rsquo;ll stay over, an&rsquo; send
your books down by express, or else you&rsquo;re a damn fool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what can I do here all day Sunday?&rdquo; Martin asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rest. You don&rsquo;t know how tired you are. Why, I&rsquo;m that tired
Sunday I can&rsquo;t even read the papers. I was sick once&mdash;typhoid. In
the hospital two months an&rsquo; a half. Didn&rsquo;t do a tap of work all
that time. It was beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was beautiful,&rdquo; he repeated dreamily, a minute later.
</p>

<p>
Martin took a bath, after which he found that the head laundryman had
disappeared. Most likely he had gone for a glass of beer Martin decided, but
the half-mile walk down to the village to find out seemed a long journey to
him. He lay on his bed with his shoes off, trying to make up his mind. He did
not reach out for a book. He was too tired to feel sleepy, and he lay, scarcely
thinking, in a semi-stupor of weariness, until it was time for supper. Joe did
not appear for that function, and when Martin heard the gardener remark that
most likely he was ripping the slats off the bar, Martin understood. He went to
bed immediately afterward, and in the morning decided that he was greatly
rested. Joe being still absent, Martin procured a Sunday paper and lay down in
a shady nook under the trees. The morning passed, he knew not how. He did not
sleep, nobody disturbed him, and he did not finish the paper. He came back to
it in the afternoon, after dinner, and fell asleep over it.
</p>

<p>
So passed Sunday, and Monday morning he was hard at work, sorting clothes,
while Joe, a towel bound tightly around his head, with groans and blasphemies,
was running the washer and mixing soft-soap.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I got to drink
when Saturday night comes around.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another week passed, a great battle that continued under the electric lights
each night and that culminated on Saturday afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock,
when Joe tasted his moment of wilted triumph and then drifted down to the
village to forget. Martin&rsquo;s Sunday was the same as before. He slept in
the shade of the trees, toiled aimlessly through the newspaper, and spent long
hours lying on his back, doing nothing, thinking nothing. He was too dazed to
think, though he was aware that he did not like himself. He was self-repelled,
as though he had undergone some degradation or was intrinsically foul. All that
was god-like in him was blotted out. The spur of ambition was blunted; he had
no vitality with which to feel the prod of it. He was dead. His soul seemed
dead. He was a beast, a work-beast. He saw no beauty in the sunshine sifting
down through the green leaves, nor did the azure vault of the sky whisper as of
old and hint of cosmic vastness and secrets trembling to disclosure. Life was
intolerably dull and stupid, and its taste was bad in his mouth. A black screen
was drawn across his mirror of inner vision, and fancy lay in a darkened
sick-room where entered no ray of light. He envied Joe, down in the village,
rampant, tearing the slats off the bar, his brain gnawing with maggots,
exulting in maudlin ways over maudlin things, fantastically and gloriously
drunk and forgetful of Monday morning and the week of deadening toil to come.
</p>

<p>
A third week went by, and Martin loathed himself, and loathed life. He was
oppressed by a sense of failure. There was reason for the editors refusing his
stuff. He could see that clearly now, and laugh at himself and the dreams he
had dreamed. Ruth returned his &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; by mail. He read her
letter apathetically. She did her best to say how much she liked them and that
they were beautiful. But she could not lie, and she could not disguise the
truth from herself. She knew they were failures, and he read her disapproval in
every perfunctory and unenthusiastic line of her letter. And she was right. He
was firmly convinced of it as he read the poems over. Beauty and wonder had
departed from him, and as he read the poems he caught himself puzzling as to
what he had had in mind when he wrote them. His audacities of phrase struck him
as grotesque, his felicities of expression were monstrosities, and everything
was absurd, unreal, and impossible. He would have burned the &ldquo;Sea
Lyrics&rdquo; on the spot, had his will been strong enough to set them aflame.
There was the engine-room, but the exertion of carrying them to the furnace was
not worth while. All his exertion was used in washing other persons&rsquo;
clothes. He did not have any left for private affairs.
</p>

<p>
He resolved that when Sunday came he would pull himself together and answer
Ruth&rsquo;s letter. But Saturday afternoon, after work was finished and he had
taken a bath, the desire to forget overpowered him. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll
go down and see how Joe&rsquo;s getting on,&rdquo; was the way he put it to
himself; and in the same moment he knew that he lied. But he did not have the
energy to consider the lie. If he had had the energy, he would have refused to
consider the lie, because he wanted to forget. He started for the village
slowly and casually, increasing his pace in spite of himself as he neared the
saloon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you was on the water-wagon,&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s greeting.
</p>

<p>
Martin did not deign to offer excuses, but called for whiskey, filling his own
glass brimming before he passed the bottle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take all night about it,&rdquo; he said roughly.
</p>

<p>
The other was dawdling with the bottle, and Martin refused to wait for him,
tossing the glass off in a gulp and refilling it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, I can wait for you,&rdquo; he said grimly; &ldquo;but hurry
up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Joe hurried, and they drank together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The work did it, eh?&rdquo; Joe queried.
</p>

<p>
Martin refused to discuss the matter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fair hell, I know,&rdquo; the other went on, &ldquo;but I
kind of hate to see you come off the wagon, Mart. Well, here&rsquo;s
how!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin drank on silently, biting out his orders and invitations and awing the
barkeeper, an effeminate country youngster with watery blue eyes and hair
parted in the middle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something scandalous the way they work us poor devils,&rdquo;
Joe was remarking. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t bowl up, I&rsquo;d break loose
an&rsquo; burn down the shebang. My bowlin&rsquo; up is all that saves
&rsquo;em, I can tell you that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Martin made no answer. A few more drinks, and in his brain he felt the
maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl. Ah, it was living, the first breath
of life he had breathed in three weeks. His dreams came back to him. Fancy came
out of the darkened room and lured him on, a thing of flaming brightness. His
mirror of vision was silver-clear, a flashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery.
Wonder and beauty walked with him, hand in hand, and all power was his. He
tried to tell it to Joe, but Joe had visions of his own, infallible schemes
whereby he would escape the slavery of laundry-work and become himself the
owner of a great steam laundry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell yeh, Mart, they won&rsquo;t be no kids workin&rsquo; in my
laundry&mdash;not on yer life. An&rsquo; they won&rsquo;t be no workin&rsquo; a
livin&rsquo; soul after six P.M. You hear me talk! They&rsquo;ll be machinery
enough an&rsquo; hands enough to do it all in decent workin&rsquo; hours,
an&rsquo; Mart, s&rsquo;help me, I&rsquo;ll make yeh superintendent of the
shebang&mdash;the whole of it, all of it. Now here&rsquo;s the scheme. I get on
the water-wagon an&rsquo; save my money for two years&mdash;save an&rsquo;
then&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Martin turned away, leaving him to tell it to the barkeeper, until that
worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who, coming in,
accepted Martin&rsquo;s invitation. Martin dispensed royal largess, inviting
everybody up, farm-hands, a stableman, and the gardener&rsquo;s assistant from
the hotel, the barkeeper, and the furtive hobo who slid in like a shadow and
like a shadow hovered at the end of the bar.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p>
Monday morning, Joe groaned over the first truck load of clothes to the washer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me,&rdquo; Martin snarled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Joe,&rdquo; he said at noon, when they knocked off for
dinner.
</p>

<p>
Tears came into the other&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in
hell, an&rsquo; we can&rsquo;t help ourselves. An&rsquo;, you know, I kind of
like you a whole lot. That&rsquo;s what made it&mdash;hurt. I cottoned to you
from the first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s quit,&rdquo; Joe suggested. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s chuck it,
an&rsquo; go hoboin&rsquo;. I ain&rsquo;t never tried it, but it must be dead
easy. An&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; to do. Just think of it, nothin&rsquo; to do. I
was sick once, typhoid, in the hospital, an&rsquo; it was beautiful. I wish
I&rsquo;d get sick again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The week dragged on. The hotel was full, and extra &ldquo;fancy starch&rdquo;
poured in upon them. They performed prodigies of valor. They fought late each
night under the electric lights, bolted their meals, and even got in a half
hour&rsquo;s work before breakfast. Martin no longer took his cold baths. Every
moment was drive, drive, drive, and Joe was the masterful shepherd of moments,
herding them carefully, never losing one, counting them over like a miser
counting gold, working on in a frenzy, toil-mad, a feverish machine, aided ably
by that other machine that thought of itself as once having been one Martin
Eden, a man.
</p>

<p>
But it was only at rare moments that Martin was able to think. The house of
thought was closed, its windows boarded up, and he was its shadowy caretaker.
He was a shadow. Joe was right. They were both shadows, and this was the
unending limbo of toil. Or was it a dream? Sometimes, in the steaming, sizzling
heat, as he swung the heavy irons back and forth over the white garments, it
came to him that it was a dream. In a short while, or maybe after a thousand
years or so, he would awake, in his little room with the ink-stained table, and
take up his writing where he had left off the day before. Or maybe that was a
dream, too, and the awakening would be the changing of the watches, when he
would drop down out of his bunk in the lurching forecastle and go up on deck,
under the tropic stars, and take the wheel and feel the cool tradewind blowing
through his flesh.
</p>

<p>
Came Saturday and its hollow victory at three o&rsquo;clock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll go down an&rsquo; get a glass of beer,&rdquo; Joe said,
in the queer, monotonous tones that marked his week-end collapse.
</p>

<p>
Martin seemed suddenly to wake up. He opened the kit bag and oiled his wheel,
putting graphite on the chain and adjusting the bearings. Joe was halfway down
to the saloon when Martin passed by, bending low over the handle-bars, his legs
driving the ninety-six gear with rhythmic strength, his face set for seventy
miles of road and grade and dust. He slept in Oakland that night, and on Sunday
covered the seventy miles back. And on Monday morning, weary, he began the new
week&rsquo;s work, but he had kept sober.
</p>

<p>
A fifth week passed, and a sixth, during which he lived and toiled as a
machine, with just a spark of something more in him, just a glimmering bit of
soul, that compelled him, at each week-end, to scorch off the hundred and forty
miles. But this was not rest. It was super-machinelike, and it helped to crush
out the glimmering bit of soul that was all that was left him from former life.
At the end of the seventh week, without intending it, too weak to resist, he
drifted down to the village with Joe and drowned life and found life until
Monday morning.
</p>

<p>
Again, at the week-ends, he ground out the one hundred and forty miles,
obliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of still
greater exertion. At the end of three months he went down a third time to the
village with Joe. He forgot, and lived again, and, living, he saw, in clear
illumination, the beast he was making of himself&mdash;not by the drink, but by
the work. The drink was an effect, not a cause. It followed inevitably upon the
work, as the night follows upon the day. Not by becoming a toil-beast could he
win to the heights, was the message the whiskey whispered to him, and he nodded
approbation. The whiskey was wise. It told secrets on itself.
</p>

<p>
He called for paper and pencil, and for drinks all around, and while they drank
his very good health, he clung to the bar and scribbled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A telegram, Joe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Read it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Joe read it with a drunken, quizzical leer. But what he read seemed to sober
him. He looked at the other reproachfully, tears oozing into his eyes and down
his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; back on me, Mart?&rdquo; he queried
hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
Martin nodded, and called one of the loungers to him to take the message to the
telegraph office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Joe muttered thickly. &ldquo;Lemme think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held on to the bar, his legs wobbling under him, Martin&rsquo;s arm around
him and supporting him, while he thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make that two laundrymen,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;Here, lemme
fix it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you quitting for?&rdquo; Martin demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Same reason as you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to sea. You can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but I can hobo all right, all
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin looked at him searchingly for a moment, then cried:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By God, I think you&rsquo;re right! Better a hobo than a beast of toil.
Why, man, you&rsquo;ll live. And that&rsquo;s more than you ever did
before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was in hospital, once,&rdquo; Joe corrected. &ldquo;It was beautiful.
Typhoid&mdash;did I tell you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While Martin changed the telegram to &ldquo;two laundrymen,&rdquo; Joe went
on:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never wanted to drink when I was in hospital. Funny, ain&rsquo;t it?
But when I&rsquo;ve ben workin&rsquo; like a slave all week, I just got to bowl
up. Ever noticed that cooks drink like hell?&mdash;an&rsquo; bakers, too?
It&rsquo;s the work. They&rsquo;ve sure got to. Here, lemme pay half of that
telegram.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shake you for it,&rdquo; Martin offered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, everybody drink,&rdquo; Joe called, as they rattled the dice
and rolled them out on the damp bar.
</p>

<p>
Monday morning Joe was wild with anticipation. He did not mind his aching head,
nor did he take interest in his work. Whole herds of moments stole away and
were lost while their careless shepherd gazed out of the window at the sunshine
and the trees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just look at it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s all mine!
It&rsquo;s free. I can lie down under them trees an&rsquo; sleep for a
thousan&rsquo; years if I want to. Aw, come on, Mart, let&rsquo;s chuck it.
What&rsquo;s the good of waitin&rsquo; another moment. That&rsquo;s the land of
nothin&rsquo; to do out there, an&rsquo; I got a ticket for it&mdash;an&rsquo;
it ain&rsquo;t no return ticket, b&rsquo;gosh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, filling the truck with soiled clothes for the washer, Joe
spied the hotel manager&rsquo;s shirt. He knew its mark, and with a sudden
glorious consciousness of freedom he threw it on the floor and stamped on it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you was in it, you pig-headed Dutchman!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;In it, an&rsquo; right there where I&rsquo;ve got you! Take that!
an&rsquo; that! an&rsquo; that! damn you! Hold me back, somebody! Hold me
back!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin laughed and held him to his work. On Tuesday night the new laundrymen
arrived, and the rest of the week was spent breaking them into the routine. Joe
sat around and explained his system, but he did no more work.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a tap,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Not a tap. They can fire me if
they want to, but if they do, I&rsquo;ll quit. No more work in mine, thank you
kindly. Me for the freight cars an&rsquo; the shade under the trees. Go to it,
you slaves! That&rsquo;s right. Slave an&rsquo; sweat! Slave an&rsquo; sweat!
An&rsquo; when you&rsquo;re dead, you&rsquo;ll rot the same as me, an&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s it matter how you live?&mdash;eh? Tell me that&mdash;what&rsquo;s
it matter in the long run?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On Saturday they drew their pay and came to the parting of the ways.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t no use in me askin&rsquo; you to change your mind
an&rsquo; hit the road with me?&rdquo; Joe asked hopelessly:
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head. He was standing by his wheel, ready to start. They shook
hands, and Joe held on to his for a moment, as he said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to see you again, Mart, before you an&rsquo; me
die. That&rsquo;s straight dope. I feel it in my bones. Good-by, Mart,
an&rsquo; be good. I like you like hell, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stood, a forlorn figure, in the middle of the road, watching until Martin
turned a bend and was gone from sight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good Indian, that boy,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;A good
Indian.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he plodded down the road himself, to the water tank, where half a dozen
empties lay on a side-track waiting for the up freight.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p>
Ruth and her family were home again, and Martin, returned to Oakland, saw much
of her. Having gained her degree, she was doing no more studying; and he,
having worked all vitality out of his mind and body, was doing no writing. This
gave them time for each other that they had never had before, and their
intimacy ripened fast.
</p>

<p>
At first, Martin had done nothing but rest. He had slept a great deal, and
spent long hours musing and thinking and doing nothing. He was like one
recovering from some terrible bout of hardship. The first signs of reawakening
came when he discovered more than languid interest in the daily paper. Then he
began to read again&mdash;light novels, and poetry; and after several days more
he was head over heels in his long-neglected Fiske. His splendid body and
health made new vitality, and he possessed all the resiliency and rebound of
youth.
</p>

<p>
Ruth showed her disappointment plainly when he announced that he was going to
sea for another voyage as soon as he was well rested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you want to do that?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to lay in a supply
for my next attack on the editors. Money is the sinews of war, in my
case&mdash;money and patience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if all you wanted was money, why didn&rsquo;t you stay in the
laundry?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because the laundry was making a beast of me. Too much work of that sort
drives to drink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stared at him with horror in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;?&rdquo; she quavered.
</p>

<p>
It would have been easy for him to get out of it; but his natural impulse was
for frankness, and he remembered his old resolve to be frank, no matter what
happened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Just that. Several times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shivered and drew away from him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No man that I have ever known did that&mdash;ever did that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then they never worked in the laundry at Shelly Hot Springs,&rdquo; he
laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Toil is a good thing. It is necessary for human
health, so all the preachers say, and Heaven knows I&rsquo;ve never been afraid
of it. But there is such a thing as too much of a good thing, and the laundry
up there is one of them. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to sea one more
voyage. It will be my last, I think, for when I come back, I shall break into
the magazines. I am certain of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was silent, unsympathetic, and he watched her moodily, realizing how
impossible it was for her to understand what he had been through.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some day I shall write it up&mdash;&lsquo;The Degradation of Toil&rsquo;
or the &lsquo;Psychology of Drink in the Working-class,&rsquo; or something
like that for a title.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Never, since the first meeting, had they seemed so far apart as that day. His
confession, told in frankness, with the spirit of revolt behind, had repelled
her. But she was more shocked by the repulsion itself than by the cause of it.
It pointed out to her how near she had drawn to him, and once accepted, it
paved the way for greater intimacy. Pity, too, was aroused, and innocent,
idealistic thoughts of reform. She would save this raw young man who had come
so far. She would save him from the curse of his early environment, and she
would save him from himself in spite of himself. And all this affected her as a
very noble state of consciousness; nor did she dream that behind it and
underlying it were the jealousy and desire of love.
</p>

<p>
They rode on their wheels much in the delightful fall weather, and out in the
hills they read poetry aloud, now one and now the other, noble, uplifting
poetry that turned one&rsquo;s thoughts to higher things. Renunciation,
sacrifice, patience, industry, and high endeavor were the principles she thus
indirectly preached&mdash;such abstractions being objectified in her mind by
her father, and Mr. Butler, and by Andrew Carnegie, who, from a poor immigrant
boy had arisen to be the book-giver of the world. All of which was appreciated
and enjoyed by Martin. He followed her mental processes more clearly now, and
her soul was no longer the sealed wonder it had been. He was on terms of
intellectual equality with her. But the points of disagreement did not affect
his love. His love was more ardent than ever, for he loved her for what she
was, and even her physical frailty was an added charm in his eyes. He read of
sickly Elizabeth Barrett, who for years had not placed her feet upon the
ground, until that day of flame when she eloped with Browning and stood
upright, upon the earth, under the open sky; and what Browning had done for
her, Martin decided he could do for Ruth. But first, she must love him. The
rest would be easy. He would give her strength and health. And he caught
glimpses of their life, in the years to come, wherein, against a background of
work and comfort and general well-being, he saw himself and Ruth reading and
discussing poetry, she propped amid a multitude of cushions on the ground while
she read aloud to him. This was the key to the life they would live. And always
he saw that particular picture. Sometimes it was she who leaned against him
while he read, one arm about her, her head upon his shoulder. Sometimes they
pored together over the printed pages of beauty. Then, too, she loved nature,
and with generous imagination he changed the scene of their
reading&mdash;sometimes they read in closed-in valleys with precipitous walls,
or in high mountain meadows, and, again, down by the gray sand-dunes with a
wreath of billows at their feet, or afar on some volcanic tropic isle where
waterfalls descended and became mist, reaching the sea in vapor veils that
swayed and shivered to every vagrant wisp of wind. But always, in the
foreground, lords of beauty and eternally reading and sharing, lay he and Ruth,
and always in the background that was beyond the background of nature, dim and
hazy, were work and success and money earned that made them free of the world
and all its treasures.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should recommend my little girl to be careful,&rdquo; her mother
warned her one day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what you mean. But it is impossible. He is not&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth was blushing, but it was the blush of maidenhood called upon for the first
time to discuss the sacred things of life with a mother held equally sacred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your kind.&rdquo; Her mother finished the sentence for her.
</p>

<p>
Ruth nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not want to say it, but he is not. He is rough, brutal,
strong&mdash;too strong. He has not&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hesitated and could not go on. It was a new experience, talking over such
matters with her mother. And again her mother completed her thought for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has not lived a clean life, is what you wanted to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Ruth nodded, and again a blush mantled her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is just that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has not been his fault, but
he has played much with&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With pitch?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, with pitch. And he frightens me. Sometimes I am positively in
terror of him, when he talks in that free and easy way of the things he has
done&mdash;as if they did not matter. They do matter, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They sat with their arms twined around each other, and in the pause her mother
patted her hand and waited for her to go on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I am interested in him dreadfully,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;In a
way he is my protégé. Then, too, he is my first boy friend&mdash;but not
exactly friend; rather protégé and friend combined. Sometimes, too, when he
frightens me, it seems that he is a bulldog I have taken for a plaything, like
some of the &lsquo;frat&rsquo; girls, and he is tugging hard, and showing his
teeth, and threatening to break loose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again her mother waited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He interests me, I suppose, like the bulldog. And there is much good in
him, too; but there is much in him that I would not like in&mdash;in the other
way. You see, I have been thinking. He swears, he smokes, he drinks, he has
fought with his fists (he has told me so, and he likes it; he says so). He is
all that a man should not be&mdash;a man I would want for my&mdash;&rdquo; her
voice sank very low&mdash;&ldquo;husband. Then he is too strong. My prince must
be tall, and slender, and dark&mdash;a graceful, bewitching prince. No, there
is no danger of my falling in love with Martin Eden. It would be the worst fate
that could befall me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it is not that that I spoke about,&rdquo; her mother equivocated.
&ldquo;Have you thought about him? He is so ineligible in every way, you know,
and suppose he should come to love you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he does&mdash;already,&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was to be expected,&rdquo; Mrs. Morse said gently. &ldquo;How could
it be otherwise with any one who knew you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Olney hates me!&rdquo; she exclaimed passionately. &ldquo;And I hate
Olney. I feel always like a cat when he is around. I feel that I must be nasty
to him, and even when I don&rsquo;t happen to feel that way, why, he&rsquo;s
nasty to me, anyway. But I am happy with Martin Eden. No one ever loved me
before&mdash;no man, I mean, in that way. And it is sweet to be
loved&mdash;that way. You know what I mean, mother dear. It is sweet to feel
that you are really and truly a woman.&rdquo; She buried her face in her
mother&rsquo;s lap, sobbing. &ldquo;You think I am dreadful, I know, but I am
honest, and I tell you just how I feel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Morse was strangely sad and happy. Her child-daughter, who was a bachelor
of arts, was gone; but in her place was a woman-daughter. The experiment had
succeeded. The strange void in Ruth&rsquo;s nature had been filled, and filled
without danger or penalty. This rough sailor-fellow had been the instrument,
and, though Ruth did not love him, he had made her conscious of her womanhood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His hand trembles,&rdquo; Ruth was confessing, her face, for
shame&rsquo;s sake, still buried. &ldquo;It is most amusing and ridiculous, but
I feel sorry for him, too. And when his hands are too trembly, and his eyes too
shiny, why, I lecture him about his life and the wrong way he is going about it
to mend it. But he worships me, I know. His eyes and his hands do not lie. And
it makes me feel grown-up, the thought of it, the very thought of it; and I
feel that I am possessed of something that is by rights my own&mdash;that makes
me like the other girls&mdash;and&mdash;and young women. And, then, too, I knew
that I was not like them before, and I knew that it worried you. You thought
you did not let me know that dear worry of yours, but I did, and I wanted
to&mdash;&lsquo;to make good,&rsquo; as Martin Eden says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a holy hour for mother and daughter, and their eyes were wet as they
talked on in the twilight, Ruth all white innocence and frankness, her mother
sympathetic, receptive, yet calmly explaining and guiding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is four years younger than you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has no
place in the world. He has neither position nor salary. He is impractical.
Loving you, he should, in the name of common sense, be doing something that
would give him the right to marry, instead of paltering around with those
stories of his and with childish dreams. Martin Eden, I am afraid, will never
grow up. He does not take to responsibility and a man&rsquo;s work in the world
like your father did, or like all our friends, Mr. Butler for one. Martin Eden,
I am afraid, will never be a money-earner. And this world is so ordered that
money is necessary to happiness&mdash;oh, no, not these swollen fortunes, but
enough of money to permit of common comfort and decency. He&mdash;he has never
spoken?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has not breathed a word. He has not attempted to; but if he did, I
would not let him, because, you see, I do not love him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad of that. I should not care to see my daughter, my one
daughter, who is so clean and pure, love a man like him. There are noble men in
the world who are clean and true and manly. Wait for them. You will find one
some day, and you will love him and be loved by him, and you will be happy with
him as your father and I have been happy with each other. And there is one
thing you must always carry in mind&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Morse&rsquo;s voice was low and sweet as she said, &ldquo;And that is the
children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;have thought about them,&rdquo; Ruth confessed, remembering the
wanton thoughts that had vexed her in the past, her face again red with maiden
shame that she should be telling such things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it is that, the children, that makes Mr. Eden impossible,&rdquo;
Mrs. Morse went on incisively. &ldquo;Their heritage must be clean, and he is,
I am afraid, not clean. Your father has told me of sailors&rsquo; lives,
and&mdash;and you understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth pressed her mother&rsquo;s hand in assent, feeling that she really did
understand, though her conception was of something vague, remote, and terrible
that was beyond the scope of imagination.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I do nothing without telling you,&rdquo; she began.
&ldquo;&mdash;Only, sometimes you must ask me, like this time. I wanted to tell
you, but I did not know how. It is false modesty, I know it is that, but you
can make it easy for me. Sometimes, like this time, you must ask me, you must
give me a chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, mother, you are a woman, too!&rdquo; she cried exultantly, as they
stood up, catching her mother&rsquo;s hands and standing erect, facing her in
the twilight, conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them. &ldquo;I
should never have thought of you in that way if we had not had this talk. I had
to learn that I was a woman to know that you were one, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are women together,&rdquo; her mother said, drawing her to her and
kissing her. &ldquo;We are women together,&rdquo; she repeated, as they went
out of the room, their arms around each other&rsquo;s waists, their hearts
swelling with a new sense of companionship.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our little girl has become a woman,&rdquo; Mrs. Morse said proudly to
her husband an hour later.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That means,&rdquo; he said, after a long look at his wife, &ldquo;that
means she is in love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, but that she is loved,&rdquo; was the smiling rejoinder. &ldquo;The
experiment has succeeded. She is awakened at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to get rid of him.&rdquo; Mr. Morse spoke briskly,
in matter-of-fact, businesslike tones.
</p>

<p>
But his wife shook her head. &ldquo;It will not be necessary. Ruth says he is
going to sea in a few days. When he comes back, she will not be here. We will
send her to Aunt Clara&rsquo;s. And, besides, a year in the East, with the
change in climate, people, ideas, and everything, is just the thing she
needs.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p>
The desire to write was stirring in Martin once more. Stories and poems were
springing into spontaneous creation in his brain, and he made notes of them
against the future time when he would give them expression. But he did not
write. This was his little vacation; he had resolved to devote it to rest and
love, and in both matters he prospered. He was soon spilling over with
vitality, and each day he saw Ruth, at the moment of meeting, she experienced
the old shock of his strength and health.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; her mother warned her once again. &ldquo;I am afraid
you are seeing too much of Martin Eden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Ruth laughed from security. She was sure of herself, and in a few days he
would be off to sea. Then, by the time he returned, she would be away on her
visit East. There was a magic, however, in the strength and health of Martin.
He, too, had been told of her contemplated Eastern trip, and he felt the need
for haste. Yet he did not know how to make love to a girl like Ruth. Then, too,
he was handicapped by the possession of a great fund of experience with girls
and women who had been absolutely different from her. They had known about love
and life and flirtation, while she knew nothing about such things. Her
prodigious innocence appalled him, freezing on his lips all ardors of speech,
and convincing him, in spite of himself, of his own unworthiness. Also he was
handicapped in another way. He had himself never been in love before. He had
liked women in that turgid past of his, and been fascinated by some of them,
but he had not known what it was to love them. He had whistled in a masterful,
careless way, and they had come to him. They had been diversions, incidents,
part of the game men play, but a small part at most. And now, and for the first
time, he was a suppliant, tender and timid and doubting. He did not know the
way of love, nor its speech, while he was frightened at his loved one&rsquo;s
clear innocence.
</p>

<p>
In the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling on through
the ever changing phases of it, he had learned a rule of conduct which was to
the effect that when one played a strange game, he should let the other fellow
play first. This had stood him in good stead a thousand times and trained him
as an observer as well. He knew how to watch the thing that was strange, and to
wait for a weakness, for a place of entrance, to divulge itself. It was like
sparring for an opening in fist-fighting. And when such an opening came, he
knew by long experience to play for it and to play hard.
</p>

<p>
So he waited with Ruth and watched, desiring to speak his love but not daring.
He was afraid of shocking her, and he was not sure of himself. Had he but known
it, he was following the right course with her. Love came into the world before
articulate speech, and in its own early youth it had learned ways and means
that it had never forgotten. It was in this old, primitive way that Martin
wooed Ruth. He did not know he was doing it at first, though later he divined
it. The touch of his hand on hers was vastly more potent than any word he could
utter, the impact of his strength on her imagination was more alluring than the
printed poems and spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers. Whatever
his tongue could express would have appealed, in part, to her judgment; but the
touch of hand, the fleeting contact, made its way directly to her instinct. Her
judgment was as young as she, but her instincts were as old as the race and
older. They had been young when love was young, and they were wiser than
convention and opinion and all the new-born things. So her judgment did not
act. There was no call upon it, and she did not realize the strength of the
appeal Martin made from moment to moment to her love-nature. That he loved her,
on the other hand, was as clear as day, and she consciously delighted in
beholding his love-manifestations&mdash;the glowing eyes with their tender
lights, the trembling hands, and the never failing swarthy flush that flooded
darkly under his sunburn. She even went farther, in a timid way inciting him,
but doing it so delicately that he never suspected, and doing it
half-consciously, so that she scarcely suspected herself. She thrilled with
these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman, and she took an Eve-like
delight in tormenting him and playing upon him.
</p>

<p>
Tongue-tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly and
awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact. The touch of his hand was
pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than pleasant. Martin did not
know it, but he did know that it was not distasteful to her. Not that they
touched hands often, save at meeting and parting; but that in handling the
bicycles, in strapping on the books of verse they carried into the hills, and
in conning the pages of books side by side, there were opportunities for hand
to stray against hand. And there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush
his cheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned together over the
beauty of the books. She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from
nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while he desired greatly, when
they tired of reading, to rest his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes
about the future that was to be theirs. On Sunday picnics at Shellmound Park
and Schuetzen Park, in the past, he had rested his head on many laps, and,
usually, he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face
from the sun and looked down and loved him and wondered at his lordly
carelessness of their love. To rest his head in a girl&rsquo;s lap had been the
easiest thing in the world until now, and now he found Ruth&rsquo;s lap
inaccessible and impossible. Yet it was right here, in his reticence, that the
strength of his wooing lay. It was because of this reticence that he never
alarmed her. Herself fastidious and timid, she never awakened to the perilous
trend of their intercourse. Subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer
to him, while he, sensing the growing closeness, longed to dare but was afraid.
</p>

<p>
Once he dared, one afternoon, when he found her in the darkened living room
with a blinding headache.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing can do it any good,&rdquo; she had answered his inquiries.
&ldquo;And besides, I don&rsquo;t take headache powders. Doctor Hall
won&rsquo;t permit me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can cure it, I think, and without drugs,&rdquo; was Martin&rsquo;s
answer. &ldquo;I am not sure, of course, but I&rsquo;d like to try. It&rsquo;s
simply massage. I learned the trick first from the Japanese. They are a race of
masseurs, you know. Then I learned it all over again with variations from the
Hawaiians. They call it <i>lomi-lomi</i>. It can accomplish most of the things
drugs accomplish and a few things that drugs can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had his hands touched her head when she sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is so good,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She spoke once again, half an hour later, when she asked, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
you tired?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The question was perfunctory, and she knew what the answer would be. Then she
lost herself in drowsy contemplation of the soothing balm of his strength: Life
poured from the ends of his fingers, driving the pain before it, or so it
seemed to her, until with the easement of pain, she fell asleep and he stole
away.
</p>

<p>
She called him up by telephone that evening to thank him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I slept until dinner,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You cured me completely,
Mr. Eden, and I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was warm, and bungling of speech, and very happy, as he replied to her, and
there was dancing in his mind, throughout the telephone conversation, the
memory of Browning and of sickly Elizabeth Barrett. What had been done could be
done again, and he, Martin Eden, could do it and would do it for Ruth Morse. He
went back to his room and to the volume of Spencer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Sociology&rdquo; lying open on the bed. But he could not read. Love
tormented him and overrode his will, so that, despite all determination, he
found himself at the little ink-stained table. The sonnet he composed that
night was the first of a love-cycle of fifty sonnets which was completed within
two months. He had the &ldquo;Love-sonnets from the Portuguese&rdquo; in mind
as he wrote, and he wrote under the best conditions for great work, at a
climacteric of living, in the throes of his own sweet love-madness.
</p>

<p>
The many hours he was not with Ruth he devoted to the &ldquo;Love-cycle,&rdquo;
to reading at home, or to the public reading-rooms, where he got more closely
in touch with the magazines of the day and the nature of their policy and
content. The hours he spent with Ruth were maddening alike in promise and in
inconclusiveness. It was a week after he cured her headache that a moonlight
sail on Lake Merritt was proposed by Norman and seconded by Arthur and Olney.
Martin was the only one capable of handling a boat, and he was pressed into
service. Ruth sat near him in the stern, while the three young fellows lounged
amidships, deep in a wordy wrangle over &ldquo;frat&rdquo; affairs.
</p>

<p>
The moon had not yet risen, and Ruth, gazing into the starry vault of the sky
and exchanging no speech with Martin, experienced a sudden feeling of
loneliness. She glanced at him. A puff of wind was heeling the boat over till
the deck was awash, and he, one hand on tiller and the other on main-sheet, was
luffing slightly, at the same time peering ahead to make out the near-lying
north shore. He was unaware of her gaze, and she watched him intently,
speculating fancifully about the strange warp of soul that led him, a young man
with signal powers, to fritter away his time on the writing of stories and
poems foredoomed to mediocrity and failure.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes wandered along the strong throat, dimly seen in the starlight, and
over the firm-poised head, and the old desire to lay her hands upon his neck
came back to her. The strength she abhorred attracted her. Her feeling of
loneliness became more pronounced, and she felt tired. Her position on the
heeling boat irked her, and she remembered the headache he had cured and the
soothing rest that resided in him. He was sitting beside her, quite beside her,
and the boat seemed to tilt her toward him. Then arose in her the impulse to
lean against him, to rest herself against his strength&mdash;a vague,
half-formed impulse, which, even as she considered it, mastered her and made
her lean toward him. Or was it the heeling of the boat? She did not know. She
never knew. She knew only that she was leaning against him and that the
easement and soothing rest were very good. Perhaps it had been the boat&rsquo;s
fault, but she made no effort to retrieve it. She leaned lightly against his
shoulder, but she leaned, and she continued to lean when he shifted his
position to make it more comfortable for her.
</p>

<p>
It was a madness, but she refused to consider the madness. She was no longer
herself but a woman, with a woman&rsquo;s clinging need; and though she leaned
ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied. She was no longer tired. Martin did
not speak. Had he, the spell would have been broken. But his reticence of love
prolonged it. He was dazed and dizzy. He could not understand what was
happening. It was too wonderful to be anything but a delirium. He conquered a
mad desire to let go sheet and tiller and to clasp her in his arms. His
intuition told him it was the wrong thing to do, and he was glad that sheet and
tiller kept his hands occupied and fended off temptation. But he luffed the
boat less delicately, spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to
prolong the tack to the north shore. The shore would compel him to go about,
and the contact would be broken. He sailed with skill, stopping way on the boat
without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and mentally forgiving his
hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible, giving
him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with her beside
him, her dear weight against him on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
When the first light of the rising moon touched the sail, illuminating the boat
with pearly radiance, Ruth moved away from him. And, even as she moved, she
felt him move away. The impulse to avoid detection was mutual. The episode was
tacitly and secretly intimate. She sat apart from him with burning cheeks,
while the full force of it came home to her. She had been guilty of something
she would not have her brothers see, nor Olney see. Why had she done it? She
had never done anything like it in her life, and yet she had been
moonlight-sailing with young men before. She had never desired to do anything
like it. She was overcome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning
womanhood. She stole a glance at Martin, who was busy putting the boat about on
the other tack, and she could have hated him for having made her do an immodest
and shameful thing. And he, of all men! Perhaps her mother was right, and she
was seeing too much of him. It would never happen again, she resolved, and she
would see less of him in the future. She entertained a wild idea of explaining
to him the first time they were alone together, of lying to him, of mentioning
casually the attack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon
came up. Then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the
revealing moon, and she knew he would know it for a lie.
</p>

<p>
In the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a strange,
puzzling creature, wilful over judgment and scornful of self-analysis, refusing
to peer into the future or to think about herself and whither she was drifting.
She was in a fever of tingling mystery, alternately frightened and charmed, and
in constant bewilderment. She had one idea firmly fixed, however, which insured
her security. She would not let Martin speak his love. As long as she did this,
all would be well. In a few days he would be off to sea. And even if he did
speak, all would be well. It could not be otherwise, for she did not love him.
Of course, it would be a painful half hour for him, and an embarrassing half
hour for her, because it would be her first proposal. She thrilled deliciously
at the thought. She was really a woman, with a man ripe to ask for her in
marriage. It was a lure to all that was fundamental in her sex. The fabric of
her life, of all that constituted her, quivered and grew tremulous. The thought
fluttered in her mind like a flame-attracted moth. She went so far as to
imagine Martin proposing, herself putting the words into his mouth; and she
rehearsed her refusal, tempering it with kindness and exhorting him to true and
noble manhood. And especially he must stop smoking cigarettes. She would make a
point of that. But no, she must not let him speak at all. She could stop him,
and she had told her mother that she would. All flushed and burning, she
regretfully dismissed the conjured situation. Her first proposal would have to
be deferred to a more propitious time and a more eligible suitor.

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p>
Came a beautiful fall day, warm and languid, palpitant with the hush of the
changing season, a California Indian summer day, with hazy sun and wandering
wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air. Filmy purple mists,
that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color, hid in the recesses of the
hills. San Francisco lay like a blur of smoke upon her heights. The intervening
bay was a dull sheen of molten metal, whereon sailing craft lay motionless or
drifted with the lazy tide. Far Tamalpais, barely seen in the silver haze,
bulked hugely by the Golden Gate, the latter a pale gold pathway under the
westering sun. Beyond, the Pacific, dim and vast, was raising on its sky-line
tumbled cloud-masses that swept landward, giving warning of the first
blustering breath of winter.
</p>

<p>
The erasure of summer was at hand. Yet summer lingered, fading and fainting
among her hills, deepening the purple of her valleys, spinning a shroud of haze
from waning powers and sated raptures, dying with the calm content of having
lived and lived well. And among the hills, on their favorite knoll, Martin and
Ruth sat side by side, their heads bent over the same pages, he reading aloud
from the love-sonnets of the woman who had loved Browning as it is given to few
men to be loved.
</p>

<p>
But the reading languished. The spell of passing beauty all about them was too
strong. The golden year was dying as it had lived, a beautiful and unrepentant
voluptuary, and reminiscent rapture and content freighted heavily the air. It
entered into them, dreamy and languorous, weakening the fibres of resolution,
suffusing the face of morality, or of judgment, with haze and purple mist.
Martin felt tender and melting, and from time to time warm glows passed over
him. His head was very near to hers, and when wandering phantoms of breeze
stirred her hair so that it touched his face, the printed pages swam before his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know a word of what you are reading,&rdquo;
she said once when he had lost his place.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her with burning eyes, and was on the verge of becoming awkward,
when a retort came to his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know either. What was the last sonnet
about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she laughed frankly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
already forgotten. Don&rsquo;t let us read any more. The day is too
beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will be our last in the hills for some time,&rdquo; he announced
gravely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a storm gathering out there on the
sea-rim.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The book slipped from his hands to the ground, and they sat idly and silently,
gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed and did not see. Ruth
glanced sidewise at his neck. She did not lean toward him. She was drawn by
some force outside of herself and stronger than gravitation, strong as destiny.
It was only an inch to lean, and it was accomplished without volition on her
part. Her shoulder touched his as lightly as a butterfly touches a flower, and
just as lightly was the counter-pressure. She felt his shoulder press hers, and
a tremor run through him. Then was the time for her to draw back. But she had
become an automaton. Her actions had passed beyond the control of her
will&mdash;she never thought of control or will in the delicious madness that
was upon her. His arm began to steal behind her and around her. She waited its
slow progress in a torment of delight. She waited, she knew not for what,
panting, with dry, burning lips, a leaping pulse, and a fever of expectancy in
all her blood. The girdling arm lifted higher and drew her toward him, drew her
slowly and caressingly. She could wait no longer. With a tired sigh, and with
an impulsive movement all her own, unpremeditated, spasmodic, she rested her
head upon his breast. His head bent over swiftly, and, as his lips approached,
hers flew to meet them.
</p>

<p>
This must be love, she thought, in the one rational moment that was vouchsafed
her. If it was not love, it was too shameful. It could be nothing else than
love. She loved the man whose arms were around her and whose lips were pressed
to hers. She pressed more tightly to him, with a snuggling movement of her
body. And a moment later, tearing herself half out of his embrace, suddenly and
exultantly she reached up and placed both hands upon Martin Eden&rsquo;s
sunburnt neck. So exquisite was the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she
uttered a low moan, relaxed her hands, and lay half-swooning in his arms.
</p>

<p>
Not a word had been spoken, and not a word was spoken for a long time. Twice he
bent and kissed her, and each time her lips met his shyly and her body made its
happy, nestling movement. She clung to him, unable to release herself, and he
sat, half supporting her in his arms, as he gazed with unseeing eyes at the
blur of the great city across the bay. For once there were no visions in his
brain. Only colors and lights and glows pulsed there, warm as the day and warm
as his love. He bent over her. She was speaking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When did you love me?&rdquo; she whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From the first, the very first, the first moment I laid eye on you. I
was mad for love of you then, and in all the time that has passed since then I
have only grown the madder. I am maddest, now, dear. I am almost a lunatic, my
head is so turned with joy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad I am a woman, Martin&mdash;dear,&rdquo; she said, after a long
sigh.
</p>

<p>
He crushed her in his arms again and again, and then asked:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you? When did you first know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I knew it all the time, almost, from the first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I have been as blind as a bat!&rdquo; he cried, a ring of vexation
in his voice. &ldquo;I never dreamed it until just how, when I&mdash;when I
kissed you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo; She drew herself partly away and looked
at him. &ldquo;I meant I knew you loved almost from the first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It came to me suddenly.&rdquo; She was speaking very slowly, her eyes
warm and fluttery and melting, a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go away.
&ldquo;I never knew until just now when&mdash;you put your arms around me. And
I never expected to marry you, Martin, not until just now. How did you make me
love you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;unless just by loving you,
for I loved you hard enough to melt the heart of a stone, much less the heart
of the living, breathing woman you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is so different from what I thought love would be,&rdquo; she
announced irrelevantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you think it would be like?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would be like this.&rdquo; She was looking into
his eyes at the moment, but her own dropped as she continued, &ldquo;You see, I
didn&rsquo;t know what this was like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He offered to draw her toward him again, but it was no more than a tentative
muscular movement of the girdling arm, for he feared that he might be greedy.
Then he felt her body yielding, and once again she was close in his arms and
lips were pressed on lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What will my people say?&rdquo; she queried, with sudden apprehension,
in one of the pauses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We can find out very easily any time we are so
minded.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if mamma objects? I am sure I am afraid to tell her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me tell her,&rdquo; he volunteered valiantly. &ldquo;I think your
mother does not like me, but I can win her around. A fellow who can win you can
win anything. And if we don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll have each other. But there&rsquo;s no danger not
winning your mother to our marriage. She loves you too well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should not like to break her heart,&rdquo; Ruth said pensively.
</p>

<p>
He felt like assuring her that mothers&rsquo; hearts were not so easily broken,
but instead he said, &ldquo;And love is the greatest thing in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know, Martin, you sometimes frighten me. I am frightened now,
when I think of you and of what you have been. You must be very, very good to
me. Remember, after all, that I am only a child. I never loved before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor I. We are both children together. And we are fortunate above most,
for we have found our first love in each other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that is impossible!&rdquo; she cried, withdrawing herself from his
arms with a swift, passionate movement. &ldquo;Impossible for you. You have
been a sailor, and sailors, I have heard, are&mdash;are&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her voice faltered and died away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are addicted to having a wife in every port?&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;Is that what you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that is not love.&rdquo; He spoke authoritatively. &ldquo;I have
been in many ports, but I never knew a passing touch of love until I saw you
that first night. Do you know, when I said good night and went away, I was
almost arrested.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Arrested?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. The policeman thought I was drunk; and I was, too&mdash;with love
for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you said we were children, and I said it was impossible, for you,
and we have strayed away from the point.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said that I never loved anybody but you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You
are my first, my very first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And yet you have been a sailor,&rdquo; she objected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t prevent me from loving you the first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And there have been women&mdash;other women&mdash;oh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And to Martin Eden&rsquo;s supreme surprise, she burst into a storm of tears
that took more kisses than one and many caresses to drive away. And all the
while there was running through his head Kipling&rsquo;s line: &ldquo;<i>And
the Colonel&rsquo;s lady and Judy O&rsquo;Grady are sisters under their
skins</i>.&rdquo; It was true, he decided; though the novels he had read had
led him to believe otherwise. His idea, for which the novels were responsible,
had been that only formal proposals obtained in the upper classes. It was all
right enough, down whence he had come, for youths and maidens to win each other
by contact; but for the exalted personages up above on the heights to make love
in similar fashion had seemed unthinkable. Yet the novels were wrong. Here was
a proof of it. The same pressures and caresses, unaccompanied by speech, that
were efficacious with the girls of the working-class, were equally efficacious
with the girls above the working-class. They were all of the same flesh, after
all, sisters under their skins; and he might have known as much himself had he
remembered his Spencer. As he held Ruth in his arms and soothed her, he took
great consolation in the thought that the Colonel&rsquo;s lady and Judy
O&rsquo;Grady were pretty much alike under their skins. It brought Ruth closer
to him, made her possible. Her dear flesh was as anybody&rsquo;s flesh, as his
flesh. There was no bar to their marriage. Class difference was the only
difference, and class was extrinsic. It could be shaken off. A slave, he had
read, had risen to the Roman purple. That being so, then he could rise to Ruth.
Under her purity, and saintliness, and culture, and ethereal beauty of soul,
she was, in things fundamentally human, just like Lizzie Connolly and all
Lizzie Connollys. All that was possible of them was possible of her. She could
love, and hate, maybe have hysterics; and she could certainly be jealous, as
she was jealous now, uttering her last sobs in his arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Besides, I am older than you,&rdquo; she remarked suddenly, opening her
eyes and looking up at him, &ldquo;three years older.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, you are only a child, and I am forty years older than you, in
experience,&rdquo; was his answer.
</p>

<p>
In truth, they were children together, so far as love was concerned, and they
were as naive and immature in the expression of their love as a pair of
children, and this despite the fact that she was crammed with a university
education and that his head was full of scientific philosophy and the hard
facts of life.
</p>

<p>
They sat on through the passing glory of the day, talking as lovers are prone
to talk, marvelling at the wonder of love and at destiny that had flung them so
strangely together, and dogmatically believing that they loved to a degree
never attained by lovers before. And they returned insistently, again and
again, to a rehearsal of their first impressions of each other and to hopeless
attempts to analyze just precisely what they felt for each other and how much
there was of it.
</p>

<p>
The cloud-masses on the western horizon received the descending sun, and the
circle of the sky turned to rose, while the zenith glowed with the same warm
color. The rosy light was all about them, flooding over them, as she sang,
&ldquo;Good-by, Sweet Day.&rdquo; She sang softly, leaning in the cradle of his
arm, her hands in his, their hearts in each other&rsquo;s hands.

<h2><a name="chap22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p>
Mrs. Morse did not require a mother&rsquo;s intuition to read the advertisement
in Ruth&rsquo;s face when she returned home. The flush that would not leave the
cheeks told the simple story, and more eloquently did the eyes, large and
bright, reflecting an unmistakable inward glory.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; Mrs. Morse asked, having bided her time till
Ruth had gone to bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know?&rdquo; Ruth queried, with trembling lips.
</p>

<p>
For reply, her mother&rsquo;s arm went around her, and a hand was softly
caressing her hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He did not speak,&rdquo; she blurted out. &ldquo;I did not intend that
it should happen, and I would never have let him speak&mdash;only he
didn&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if he did not speak, then nothing could have happened, could
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it did, just the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the name of goodness, child, what are you babbling about?&rdquo; Mrs.
Morse was bewildered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know what happened, after
all. What did happen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth looked at her mother in surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you knew. Why, we&rsquo;re engaged, Martin and I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Morse laughed with incredulous vexation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; Ruth explained. &ldquo;He just loved
me, that was all. I was as surprised as you are. He didn&rsquo;t say a word. He
just put his arm around me. And&mdash;and I was not myself. And he kissed me,
and I kissed him. I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I just had to. And then I knew I
loved him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused, waiting with expectancy the benediction of her mother&rsquo;s kiss,
but Mrs. Morse was coldly silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a dreadful accident, I know,&rdquo; Ruth recommenced with a
sinking voice. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know how you will ever forgive me. But
I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I did not dream that I loved him until that moment.
And you must tell father for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would it not be better not to tell your father? Let me see Martin Eden,
and talk with him, and explain. He will understand and release you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; Ruth cried, starting up. &ldquo;I do not want to be
released. I love him, and love is very sweet. I am going to marry him&mdash;of
course, if you will let me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have other plans for you, Ruth, dear, your father and I&mdash;oh, no,
no; no man picked out for you, or anything like that. Our plans go no farther
than your marrying some man in your own station in life, a good and honorable
gentleman, whom you will select yourself, when you love him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I love Martin already,&rdquo; was the plaintive protest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We would not influence your choice in any way; but you are our daughter,
and we could not bear to see you make a marriage such as this. He has nothing
but roughness and coarseness to offer you in exchange for all that is refined
and delicate in you. He is no match for you in any way. He could not support
you. We have no foolish ideas about wealth, but comfort is another matter, and
our daughter should at least marry a man who can give her that&mdash;and not a
penniless adventurer, a sailor, a cowboy, a smuggler, and Heaven knows what
else, who, in addition to everything, is hare-brained and irresponsible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth was silent. Every word she recognized as true.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wastes his time over his writing, trying to accomplish what geniuses
and rare men with college educations sometimes accomplish. A man thinking of
marriage should be preparing for marriage. But not he. As I have said, and I
know you agree with me, he is irresponsible. And why should he not be? It is
the way of sailors. He has never learned to be economical or temperate. The
spendthrift years have marked him. It is not his fault, of course, but that
does not alter his nature. And have you thought of the years of licentiousness
he inevitably has lived? Have you thought of that, daughter? You know what
marriage means.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth shuddered and clung close to her mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have thought.&rdquo; Ruth waited a long time for the thought to frame
itself. &ldquo;And it is terrible. It sickens me to think of it. I told you it
was a dreadful accident, my loving him; but I can&rsquo;t help myself. Could
you help loving father? Then it is the same with me. There is something in me,
in him&mdash;I never knew it was there until to-day&mdash;but it is there, and
it makes me love him. I never thought to love him, but, you see, I do,&rdquo;
she concluded, a certain faint triumph in her voice.
</p>

<p>
They talked long, and to little purpose, in conclusion agreeing to wait an
indeterminate time without doing anything.
</p>

<p>
The same conclusion was reached, a little later that night, between Mrs. Morse
and her husband, after she had made due confession of the miscarriage of her
plans.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It could hardly have come otherwise,&rdquo; was Mr. Morse&rsquo;s
judgment. &ldquo;This sailor-fellow has been the only man she was in touch
with. Sooner or later she was going to awaken anyway; and she did awaken, and
lo! here was this sailor-fellow, the only accessible man at the moment, and of
course she promptly loved him, or thought she did, which amounts to the same
thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Morse took it upon herself to work slowly and indirectly upon Ruth, rather
than to combat her. There would be plenty of time for this, for Martin was not
in position to marry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let her see all she wants of him,&rdquo; was Mr. Morse&rsquo;s advice.
&ldquo;The more she knows him, the less she&rsquo;ll love him, I wager. And
give her plenty of contrast. Make a point of having young people at the house.
Young women and young men, all sorts of young men, clever men, men who have
done something or who are doing things, men of her own class, gentlemen. She
can gauge him by them. They will show him up for what he is. And after all, he
is a mere boy of twenty-one. Ruth is no more than a child. It is calf love with
the pair of them, and they will grow out of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So the matter rested. Within the family it was accepted that Ruth and Martin
were engaged, but no announcement was made. The family did not think it would
ever be necessary. Also, it was tacitly understood that it was to be a long
engagement. They did not ask Martin to go to work, nor to cease writing. They
did not intend to encourage him to mend himself. And he aided and abetted them
in their unfriendly designs, for going to work was farthest from his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;ll like what I have done!&rdquo; he said to Ruth
several days later. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided that boarding with my sister is
too expensive, and I am going to board myself. I&rsquo;ve rented a little room
out in North Oakland, retired neighborhood and all the rest, you know, and
I&rsquo;ve bought an oil-burner on which to cook.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth was overjoyed. The oil-burner especially pleased her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was the way Mr. Butler began his start,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Martin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman, and went on:
&ldquo;I put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them off to the editors
again. Then to-day I moved in, and to-morrow I start to work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A position!&rdquo; she cried, betraying the gladness of her surprise in
all her body, nestling closer to him, pressing his hand, smiling. &ldquo;And
you never told me! What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I meant that I was going to work at my writing.&rdquo; Her face fell,
and he went on hastily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misjudge me. I am not going in this
time with any iridescent ideas. It is to be a cold, prosaic, matter-of-fact
business proposition. It is better than going to sea again, and I shall earn
more money than any position in Oakland can bring an unskilled man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, this vacation I have taken has given me perspective. I
haven&rsquo;t been working the life out of my body, and I haven&rsquo;t been
writing, at least not for publication. All I&rsquo;ve done has been to love you
and to think. I&rsquo;ve read some, too, but it has been part of my thinking,
and I have read principally magazines. I have generalized about myself, and the
world, my place in it, and my chance to win to a place that will be fit for
you. Also, I&rsquo;ve been reading Spencer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Philosophy of
Style,&rsquo; and found out a lot of what was the matter with me&mdash;or my
writing, rather; and for that matter with most of the writing that is published
every month in the magazines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the upshot of it all&mdash;of my thinking and reading and
loving&mdash;is that I am going to move to Grub Street. I shall leave
masterpieces alone and do hack-work&mdash;jokes, paragraphs, feature articles,
humorous verse, and society verse&mdash;all the rot for which there seems so
much demand. Then there are the newspaper syndicates, and the newspaper
short-story syndicates, and the syndicates for the Sunday supplements. I can go
ahead and hammer out the stuff they want, and earn the equivalent of a good
salary by it. There are free-lances, you know, who earn as much as four or five
hundred a month. I don&rsquo;t care to become as they; but I&rsquo;ll earn a
good living, and have plenty of time to myself, which I wouldn&rsquo;t have in
any position.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll have my spare time for study and for real work. In
between the grind I&rsquo;ll try my hand at masterpieces, and I&rsquo;ll study
and prepare myself for the writing of masterpieces. Why, I am amazed at the
distance I have come already. When I first tried to write, I had nothing to
write about except a few paltry experiences which I neither understood nor
appreciated. But I had no thoughts. I really didn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t even
have the words with which to think. My experiences were so many meaningless
pictures. But as I began to add to my knowledge, and to my vocabulary, I saw
something more in my experiences than mere pictures. I retained the pictures
and I found their interpretation. That was when I began to do good work, when I
wrote &lsquo;Adventure,&rsquo; &lsquo;Joy,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Pot,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Wine of Life,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Jostling Street,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;Love-cycle,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Sea Lyrics.&rsquo; I shall write more
like them, and better; but I shall do it in my spare time. My feet are on the
solid earth, now. Hack-work and income first, masterpieces afterward. Just to
show you, I wrote half a dozen jokes last night for the comic weeklies; and
just as I was going to bed, the thought struck me to try my hand at a
triolet&mdash;a humorous one; and inside an hour I had written four. They ought
to be worth a dollar apiece. Four dollars right there for a few afterthoughts
on the way to bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s all valueless, just so much dull and sordid
plodding; but it is no more dull and sordid than keeping books at sixty dollars
a month, adding up endless columns of meaningless figures until one dies. And
furthermore, the hack-work keeps me in touch with things literary and gives me
time to try bigger things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what good are these bigger things, these masterpieces?&rdquo; Ruth
demanded. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sell them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can,&rdquo; he began; but she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All those you named, and which you say yourself are good&mdash;you have
not sold any of them. We can&rsquo;t get married on masterpieces that
won&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll get married on triolets that will sell,&rdquo; he
asserted stoutly, putting his arm around her and drawing a very unresponsive
sweetheart toward him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Listen to this,&rdquo; he went on in attempted gayety. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not art, but it&rsquo;s a dollar.
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;He came in<br />
    When I was out,<br />
To borrow some tin<br />
Was why he came in,<br />
    And he went without;<br />
So I was in<br />
    And he was out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The merry lilt with which he had invested the jingle was at variance with the
dejection that came into his face as he finished. He had drawn no smile from
Ruth. She was looking at him in an earnest and troubled way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It may be a dollar,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it is a jester&rsquo;s
dollar, the fee of a clown. Don&rsquo;t you see, Martin, the whole thing is
lowering. I want the man I love and honor to be something finer and higher than
a perpetrator of jokes and doggerel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want him to be like&mdash;say Mr. Butler?&rdquo; he suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t like Mr. Butler,&rdquo; she began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Butler&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only his indigestion I find fault with. But to save me I can&rsquo;t see any
difference between writing jokes or comic verse and running a type-writer,
taking dictation, or keeping sets of books. It is all a means to an end. Your
theory is for me to begin with keeping books in order to become a successful
lawyer or man of business. Mine is to begin with hack-work and develop into an
able author.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a difference,&rdquo; she insisted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, your good work, what you yourself call good, you can&rsquo;t sell.
You have tried, you know that,&mdash;but the editors won&rsquo;t buy it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me time, dear,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;The hack-work is only
makeshift, and I don&rsquo;t take it seriously. Give me two years. I shall
succeed in that time, and the editors will be glad to buy my good work. I know
what I am saying; I have faith in myself. I know what I have in me; I know what
literature is, now; I know the average rot that is poured out by a lot of
little men; and I know that at the end of two years I shall be on the highroad
to success. As for business, I shall never succeed at it. I am not in sympathy
with it. It strikes me as dull, and stupid, and mercenary, and tricky. Anyway I
am not adapted for it. I&rsquo;d never get beyond a clerkship, and how could
you and I be happy on the paltry earnings of a clerk? I want the best of
everything in the world for you, and the only time when I won&rsquo;t want it
will be when there is something better. And I&rsquo;m going to get it, going to
get all of it. The income of a successful author makes Mr. Butler look cheap. A
&lsquo;best-seller&rsquo; will earn anywhere between fifty and a hundred
thousand dollars&mdash;sometimes more and sometimes less; but, as a rule,
pretty close to those figures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She remained silent; her disappointment was apparent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had hoped and planned otherwise. I had thought, and I still think,
that the best thing for you would be to study shorthand&mdash;you already know
type-writing&mdash;and go into father&rsquo;s office. You have a good mind, and
I am confident you would succeed as a lawyer.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p>
That Ruth had little faith in his power as a writer, did not alter her nor
diminish her in Martin&rsquo;s eyes. In the breathing spell of the vacation he
had taken, he had spent many hours in self-analysis, and thereby learned much
of himself. He had discovered that he loved beauty more than fame, and that
what desire he had for fame was largely for Ruth&rsquo;s sake. It was for this
reason that his desire for fame was strong. He wanted to be great in the
world&rsquo;s eyes; &ldquo;to make good,&rdquo; as he expressed it, in order
that the woman he loved should be proud of him and deem him worthy.
</p>

<p>
As for himself, he loved beauty passionately, and the joy of serving her was to
him sufficient wage. And more than beauty he loved Ruth. He considered love the
finest thing in the world. It was love that had worked the revolution in him,
changing him from an uncouth sailor to a student and an artist; therefore, to
him, the finest and greatest of the three, greater than learning and artistry,
was love. Already he had discovered that his brain went beyond Ruth&rsquo;s,
just as it went beyond the brains of her brothers, or the brain of her father.
In spite of every advantage of university training, and in the face of her
bachelorship of arts, his power of intellect overshadowed hers, and his year or
so of self-study and equipment gave him a mastery of the affairs of the world
and art and life that she could never hope to possess.
</p>

<p>
All this he realized, but it did not affect his love for her, nor her love for
him. Love was too fine and noble, and he was too loyal a lover for him to
besmirch love with criticism. What did love have to do with Ruth&rsquo;s
divergent views on art, right conduct, the French Revolution, or equal
suffrage? They were mental processes, but love was beyond reason; it was
superrational. He could not belittle love. He worshipped it. Love lay on the
mountain-tops beyond the valley-land of reason. It was a sublimated condition
of existence, the topmost peak of living, and it came rarely. Thanks to the
school of scientific philosophers he favored, he knew the biological
significance of love; but by a refined process of the same scientific reasoning
he reached the conclusion that the human organism achieved its highest purpose
in love, that love must not be questioned, but must be accepted as the highest
guerdon of life. Thus, he considered the lover blessed over all creatures, and
it was a delight to him to think of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s own mad lover,&rdquo;
rising above the things of earth, above wealth and judgment, public opinion and
applause, rising above life itself and &ldquo;dying on a kiss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Much of this Martin had already reasoned out, and some of it he reasoned out
later. In the meantime he worked, taking no recreation except when he went to
see Ruth, and living like a Spartan. He paid two dollars and a half a month
rent for the small room he got from his Portuguese landlady, Maria Silva, a
virago and a widow, hard working and harsher tempered, rearing her large brood
of children somehow, and drowning her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals
in a gallon of the thin, sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and
saloon for fifteen cents. From detesting her and her foul tongue at first,
Martin grew to admire her as he observed the brave fight she made. There were
but four rooms in the little house&mdash;three, when Martin&rsquo;s was
subtracted. One of these, the parlor, gay with an ingrain carpet and dolorous
with a funeral card and a death-picture of one of her numerous departed babes,
was kept strictly for company. The blinds were always down, and her barefooted
tribe was never permitted to enter the sacred precinct save on state occasions.
She cooked, and all ate, in the kitchen, where she likewise washed, starched,
and ironed clothes on all days of the week except Sunday; for her income came
largely from taking in washing from her more prosperous neighbors. Remained the
bedroom, small as the one occupied by Martin, into which she and her seven
little ones crowded and slept. It was an everlasting miracle to Martin how it
was accomplished, and from her side of the thin partition he heard nightly
every detail of the going to bed, the squalls and squabbles, the soft
chattering, and the sleepy, twittering noises as of birds. Another source of
income to Maria were her cows, two of them, which she milked night and morning
and which gained a surreptitious livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that
grew on either side the public side walks, attended always by one or more of
her ragged boys, whose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in keeping their
eyes out for the poundmen.
</p>

<p>
In his own small room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept house.
Before the one window, looking out on the tiny front porch, was the kitchen
table that served as desk, library, and type-writing stand. The bed, against
the rear wall, occupied two-thirds of the total space of the room. The table
was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau, manufactured for profit and not for
service, the thin veneer of which was shed day by day. This bureau stood in the
corner, and in the opposite corner, on the table&rsquo;s other flank, was the
kitchen&mdash;the oil-stove on a dry-goods box, inside of which were dishes and
cooking utensils, a shelf on the wall for provisions, and a bucket of water on
the floor. Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there being no
tap in his room. On days when there was much steam to his cooking, the harvest
of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous. Over the bed, hoisted by a
tackle to the ceiling, was his bicycle. At first he had tried to keep it in the
basement; but the tribe of Silva, loosening the bearings and puncturing the
tires, had driven him out. Next he attempted the tiny front porch, until a
howling southeaster drenched the wheel a night-long. Then he had retreated with
it to his room and slung it aloft.
</p>

<p>
A small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated and for
which there was no room on the table or under the table. Hand in hand with
reading, he had developed the habit of making notes, and so copiously did he
make them that there would have been no existence for him in the confined
quarters had he not rigged several clothes-lines across the room on which the
notes were hung. Even so, he was crowded until navigating the room was a
difficult task. He could not open the door without first closing the closet
door, and <i>vice versa</i>. It was impossible for him anywhere to traverse the
room in a straight line. To go from the door to the head of the bed was a
zigzag course that he was never quite able to accomplish in the dark without
collisions. Having settled the difficulty of the conflicting doors, he had to
steer sharply to the right to avoid the kitchen. Next, he sheered to the left,
to escape the foot of the bed; but this sheer, if too generous, brought him
against the corner of the table. With a sudden twitch and lurch, he terminated
the sheer and bore off to the right along a sort of canal, one bank of which
was the bed, the other the table. When the one chair in the room was at its
usual place before the table, the canal was unnavigable. When the chair was not
in use, it reposed on top of the bed, though sometimes he sat on the chair when
cooking, reading a book while the water boiled, and even becoming skilful
enough to manage a paragraph or two while steak was frying. Also, so small was
the little corner that constituted the kitchen, he was able, sitting down, to
reach anything he needed. In fact, it was expedient to cook sitting down;
standing up, he was too often in his own way.
</p>

<p>
In conjunction with a perfect stomach that could digest anything, he possessed
knowledge of the various foods that were at the same time nutritious and cheap.
Pea-soup was a common article in his diet, as well as potatoes and beans, the
latter large and brown and cooked in Mexican style. Rice, cooked as American
housewives never cook it and can never learn to cook it, appeared on
Martin&rsquo;s table at least once a day. Dried fruits were less expensive than
fresh, and he had usually a pot of them, cooked and ready at hand, for they
took the place of butter on his bread. Occasionally he graced his table with a
piece of round-steak, or with a soup-bone. Coffee, without cream or milk, he
had twice a day, in the evening substituting tea; but both coffee and tea were
excellently cooked.
</p>

<p>
There was need for him to be economical. His vacation had consumed nearly all
he had earned in the laundry, and he was so far from his market that weeks must
elapse before he could hope for the first returns from his hack-work. Except at
such times as he saw Ruth, or dropped in to see his sister Gertude, he lived a
recluse, in each day accomplishing at least three days&rsquo; labor of ordinary
men. He slept a scant five hours, and only one with a constitution of iron
could have held himself down, as Martin did, day after day, to nineteen
consecutive hours of toil. He never lost a moment. On the looking-glass were
lists of definitions and pronunciations; when shaving, or dressing, or combing
his hair, he conned these lists over. Similar lists were on the wall over the
oil-stove, and they were similarly conned while he was engaged in cooking or in
washing the dishes. New lists continually displaced the old ones. Every strange
or partly familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down,
and later, when a sufficient number had been accumulated, were typed and pinned
to the wall or looking-glass. He even carried them in his pockets, and reviewed
them at odd moments on the street, or while waiting in butcher shop or grocery
to be served.
</p>

<p>
He went farther in the matter. Reading the works of men who had arrived, he
noted every result achieved by them, and worked out the tricks by which they
had been achieved&mdash;the tricks of narrative, of exposition, of style, the
points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams; and of all these he made lists for
study. He did not ape. He sought principles. He drew up lists of effective and
fetching mannerisms, till out of many such, culled from many writers, he was
able to induce the general principle of mannerism, and, thus equipped, to cast
about for new and original ones of his own, and to weigh and measure and
appraise them properly. In similar manner he collected lists of strong phrases,
the phrases of living language, phrases that bit like acid and scorched like
flame, or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of the arid
desert of common speech. He sought always for the principle that lay behind and
beneath. He wanted to know how the thing was done; after that he could do it
for himself. He was not content with the fair face of beauty. He dissected
beauty in his crowded little bedroom laboratory, where cooking smells
alternated with the outer bedlam of the Silva tribe; and, having dissected and
learned the anatomy of beauty, he was nearer being able to create beauty
itself.
</p>

<p>
He was so made that he could work only with understanding. He could not work
blindly, in the dark, ignorant of what he was producing and trusting to chance
and the star of his genius that the effect produced should be right and fine.
He had no patience with chance effects. He wanted to know why and how. His was
deliberate creative genius, and, before he began a story or poem, the thing
itself was already alive in his brain, with the end in sight and the means of
realizing that end in his conscious possession. Otherwise the effort was doomed
to failure. On the other hand, he appreciated the chance effects in words and
phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain, and that later stood all
tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and incommunicable
connotations. Before such he bowed down and marvelled, knowing that they were
beyond the deliberate creation of any man. And no matter how much he dissected
beauty in search of the principles that underlie beauty and make beauty
possible, he was aware, always, of the innermost mystery of beauty to which he
did not penetrate and to which no man had ever penetrated. He knew full well,
from his Spencer, that man can never attain ultimate knowledge of anything, and
that the mystery of beauty was no less than that of life&mdash;nay,
more&mdash;that the fibres of beauty and life were intertwisted, and that he
himself was but a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric, twisted of sunshine
and star-dust and wonder.
</p>

<p>
In fact, it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay
entitled &ldquo;Star-dust,&rdquo; in which he had his fling, not at the
principles of criticism, but at the principal critics. It was brilliant, deep,
philosophical, and deliciously touched with laughter. Also it was promptly
rejected by the magazines as often as it was submitted. But having cleared his
mind of it, he went serenely on his way. It was a habit he developed, of
incubating and maturing his thought upon a subject, and of then rushing into
the type-writer with it. That it did not see print was a matter of small moment
with him. The writing of it was the culminating act of a long mental process,
the drawing together of scattered threads of thought and the final generalizing
upon all the data with which his mind was burdened. To write such an article
was the conscious effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh
material and problems. It was in a way akin to that common habit of men and
women troubled by real or fancied grievances, who periodically and volubly
break their long-suffering silence and &ldquo;have their say&rdquo; till the
last word is said.

<h2><a name="chap24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p>
The weeks passed. Martin ran out of money, and publishers&rsquo; checks were
far away as ever. All his important manuscripts had come back and been started
out again, and his hack-work fared no better. His little kitchen was no longer
graced with a variety of foods. Caught in the pinch with a part sack of rice
and a few pounds of dried apricots, rice and apricots was his menu three times
a day for five days hand-running. Then he startled to realize on his credit.
The Portuguese grocer, to whom he had hitherto paid cash, called a halt when
Martin&rsquo;s bill reached the magnificent total of three dollars and
eighty-five cents.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For you see,&rdquo; said the grocer, &ldquo;you no catcha da work, I
losa da mon&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Martin could reply nothing. There was no way of explaining. It was not true
business principle to allow credit to a strong-bodied young fellow of the
working-class who was too lazy to work.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You catcha da job, I let you have mora da grub,&rdquo; the grocer
assured Martin. &ldquo;No job, no grub. Thata da business.&rdquo; And then, to
show that it was purely business foresight and not prejudice, &ldquo;Hava da
drink on da house&mdash;good friends justa da same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So Martin drank, in his easy way, to show that he was good friends with the
house, and then went supperless to bed.
</p>

<p>
The fruit store, where Martin had bought his vegetables, was run by an American
whose business principles were so weak that he let Martin run a bill of five
dollars before stopping his credit. The baker stopped at two dollars, and the
butcher at four dollars. Martin added his debts and found that he was possessed
of a total credit in all the world of fourteen dollars and eighty-five cents.
He was up with his type-writer rent, but he estimated that he could get two
months&rsquo; credit on that, which would be eight dollars. When that occurred,
he would have exhausted all possible credit.
</p>

<p>
The last purchase from the fruit store had been a sack of potatoes, and for a
week he had potatoes, and nothing but potatoes, three times a day. An
occasional dinner at Ruth&rsquo;s helped to keep strength in his body, though
he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further helping when his appetite was
raging at sight of so much food spread before it. Now and again, though
afflicted with secret shame, he dropped in at his sister&rsquo;s at meal-time
and ate as much as he dared&mdash;more than he dared at the Morse table.
</p>

<p>
Day by day he worked on, and day by day the postman delivered to him rejected
manuscripts. He had no money for stamps, so the manuscripts accumulated in a
heap under the table. Came a day when for forty hours he had not tasted food.
He could not hope for a meal at Ruth&rsquo;s, for she was away to San Rafael on
a two weeks&rsquo; visit; and for very shame&rsquo;s sake he could not go to
his sister&rsquo;s. To cap misfortune, the postman, in his afternoon round,
brought him five returned manuscripts. Then it was that Martin wore his
overcoat down into Oakland, and came back without it, but with five dollars
tinkling in his pocket. He paid a dollar each on account to the four tradesmen,
and in his kitchen fried steak and onions, made coffee, and stewed a large pot
of prunes. And having dined, he sat down at his table-desk and completed before
midnight an essay which he entitled &ldquo;The Dignity of Usury.&rdquo; Having
typed it out, he flung it under the table, for there had been nothing left from
the five dollars with which to buy stamps.
</p>

<p>
Later on he pawned his watch, and still later his wheel, reducing the amount
available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts and sending them
out. He was disappointed with his hack-work. Nobody cared to buy. He compared
it with what he found in the newspapers, weeklies, and cheap magazines, and
decided that his was better, far better, than the average; yet it would not
sell. Then he discovered that most of the newspapers printed a great deal of
what was called &ldquo;plate&rdquo; stuff, and he got the address of the
association that furnished it. His own work that he sent in was returned, along
with a stereotyped slip informing him that the staff supplied all the copy that
was needed.
</p>

<p>
In one of the great juvenile periodicals he noted whole columns of incident and
anecdote. Here was a chance. His paragraphs were returned, and though he tried
repeatedly he never succeeded in placing one. Later on, when it no longer
mattered, he learned that the associate editors and sub-editors augmented their
salaries by supplying those paragraphs themselves. The comic weeklies returned
his jokes and humorous verse, and the light society verse he wrote for the
large magazines found no abiding-place. Then there was the newspaper storiette.
He knew that he could write better ones than were published. Managing to obtain
the addresses of two newspaper syndicates, he deluged them with storiettes.
When he had written twenty and failed to place one of them, he ceased. And yet,
from day to day, he read storiettes in the dailies and weeklies, scores and
scores of storiettes, not one of which would compare with his. In his
despondency, he concluded that he had no judgment whatever, that he was
hypnotized by what he wrote, and that he was a self-deluded pretender.
</p>

<p>
The inhuman editorial machine ran smoothly as ever. He folded the stamps in
with his manuscript, dropped it into the letter-box, and from three weeks to a
month afterward the postman came up the steps and handed him the manuscript.
Surely there were no live, warm editors at the other end. It was all wheels and
cogs and oil-cups&mdash;a clever mechanism operated by automatons. He reached
stages of despair wherein he doubted if editors existed at all. He had never
received a sign of the existence of one, and from absence of judgment in
rejecting all he wrote it seemed plausible that editors were myths,
manufactured and maintained by office boys, typesetters, and pressmen.
</p>

<p>
The hours he spent with Ruth were the only happy ones he had, and they were not
all happy. He was afflicted always with a gnawing restlessness, more
tantalizing than in the old days before he possessed her love; for now that he
did possess her love, the possession of her was far away as ever. He had asked
for two years; time was flying, and he was achieving nothing. Again, he was
always conscious of the fact that she did not approve what he was doing. She
did not say so directly. Yet indirectly she let him understand it as clearly
and definitely as she could have spoken it. It was not resentment with her, but
disapproval; though less sweet-natured women might have resented where she was
no more than disappointed. Her disappointment lay in that this man she had
taken to mould, refused to be moulded. To a certain extent she had found his
clay plastic, then it had developed stubbornness, declining to be shaped in the
image of her father or of Mr. Butler.
</p>

<p>
What was great and strong in him, she missed, or, worse yet, misunderstood.
This man, whose clay was so plastic that he could live in any number of
pigeonholes of human existence, she thought wilful and most obstinate because
she could not shape him to live in her pigeonhole, which was the only one she
knew. She could not follow the flights of his mind, and when his brain got
beyond her, she deemed him erratic. Nobody else&rsquo;s brain ever got beyond
her. She could always follow her father and mother, her brothers and Olney;
wherefore, when she could not follow Martin, she believed the fault lay with
him. It was the old tragedy of insularity trying to serve as mentor to the
universal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You worship at the shrine of the established,&rdquo; he told her once,
in a discussion they had over Praps and Vanderwater. &ldquo;I grant that as
authorities to quote they are most excellent&mdash;the two foremost literary
critics in the United States. Every school teacher in the land looks up to
Vanderwater as the Dean of American criticism. Yet I read his stuff, and it
seems to me the perfection of the felicitous expression of the inane. Why, he
is no more than a ponderous bromide, thanks to Gelett Burgess. And Praps is no
better. His &lsquo;Hemlock Mosses,&rsquo; for instance is beautifully written.
Not a comma is out of place; and the tone&mdash;ah!&mdash;is lofty, so lofty.
He is the best-paid critic in the United States. Though, Heaven forbid!
he&rsquo;s not a critic at all. They do criticism better in England.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the point is, they sound the popular note, and they sound it so
beautifully and morally and contentedly. Their reviews remind me of a British
Sunday. They are the popular mouthpieces. They back up your professors of
English, and your professors of English back them up. And there isn&rsquo;t an
original idea in any of their skulls. They know only the established,&mdash;in
fact, they are the established. They are weak minded, and the established
impresses itself upon them as easily as the name of the brewery is impressed on
a beer bottle. And their function is to catch all the young fellows attending
the university, to drive out of their minds any glimmering originality that may
chance to be there, and to put upon them the stamp of the established.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I am nearer the truth,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;when I stand
by the established, than you are, raging around like an iconoclastic South Sea
Islander.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was the missionary who did the image breaking,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;And unfortunately, all the missionaries are off among the heathen, so
there are none left at home to break those old images, Mr. Vanderwater and Mr.
Praps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the college professors, as well,&rdquo; she added.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head emphatically. &ldquo;No; the science professors should live.
They&rsquo;re really great. But it would be a good deed to break the heads of
nine-tenths of the English professors&mdash;little, microscopic-minded
parrots!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Which was rather severe on the professors, but which to Ruth was blasphemy. She
could not help but measure the professors, neat, scholarly, in fitting clothes,
speaking in well-modulated voices, breathing of culture and refinement, with
this almost indescribable young fellow whom somehow she loved, whose clothes
never would fit him, whose heavy muscles told of damning toil, who grew excited
when he talked, substituting abuse for calm statement and passionate utterance
for cool self-possession. They at least earned good salaries and
were&mdash;yes, she compelled herself to face it&mdash;were gentlemen; while he
could not earn a penny, and he was not as they.
</p>

<p>
She did not weigh Martin&rsquo;s words nor judge his argument by them. Her
conclusion that his argument was wrong was reached&mdash;unconsciously, it is
true&mdash;by a comparison of externals. They, the professors, were right in
their literary judgments because they were successes. Martin&rsquo;s literary
judgments were wrong because he could not sell his wares. To use his own
phrase, they made good, and he did not make good. And besides, it did not seem
reasonable that he should be right&mdash;he who had stood, so short a time
before, in that same living room, blushing and awkward, acknowledging his
introduction, looking fearfully about him at the bric-a-brac his swinging
shoulders threatened to break, asking how long since Swinburne died, and
boastfully announcing that he had read &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Psalm of Life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Unwittingly, Ruth herself proved his point that she worshipped the established.
Martin followed the processes of her thoughts, but forbore to go farther. He
did not love her for what she thought of Praps and Vanderwater and English
professors, and he was coming to realize, with increasing conviction, that he
possessed brain-areas and stretches of knowledge which she could never
comprehend nor know existed.
</p>

<p>
In music she thought him unreasonable, and in the matter of opera not only
unreasonable but wilfully perverse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How did you like it?&rdquo; she asked him one night, on the way home
from the opera.
</p>

<p>
It was a night when he had taken her at the expense of a month&rsquo;s rigid
economizing on food. After vainly waiting for him to speak about it, herself
still tremulous and stirred by what she had just seen and heard, she had asked
the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I liked the overture,&rdquo; was his answer. &ldquo;It was
splendid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but the opera itself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was splendid too; that is, the orchestra was, though I&rsquo;d have
enjoyed it more if those jumping-jacks had kept quiet or gone off the
stage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth was aghast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean Tetralani or Barillo?&rdquo; she queried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All of them&mdash;the whole kit and crew.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But they are great artists,&rdquo; she protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They spoiled the music just the same, with their antics and
unrealities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you like Barillo&rsquo;s voice?&rdquo; Ruth asked.
&ldquo;He is next to Caruso, they say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I liked him, and I liked Tetralani even better. Her voice is
exquisite&mdash;or at least I think so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, but&mdash;&rdquo; Ruth stammered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
you mean, then. You admire their voices, yet say they spoiled the music.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely that. I&rsquo;d give anything to hear them in concert, and
I&rsquo;d give even a bit more not to hear them when the orchestra is playing.
I&rsquo;m afraid I am a hopeless realist. Great singers are not great actors.
To hear Barillo sing a love passage with the voice of an angel, and to hear
Tetralani reply like another angel, and to hear it all accompanied by a perfect
orgy of glowing and colorful music&mdash;is ravishing, most ravishing. I do not
admit it. I assert it. But the whole effect is spoiled when I look at
them&mdash;at Tetralani, five feet ten in her stocking feet and weighing a
hundred and ninety pounds, and at Barillo, a scant five feet four,
greasy-featured, with the chest of a squat, undersized blacksmith, and at the
pair of them, attitudinizing, clasping their breasts, flinging their arms in
the air like demented creatures in an asylum; and when I am expected to accept
all this as the faithful illusion of a love-scene between a slender and
beautiful princess and a handsome, romantic, young prince&mdash;why, I
can&rsquo;t accept it, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s rot; it&rsquo;s absurd;
it&rsquo;s unreal. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with it. It&rsquo;s not
real. Don&rsquo;t tell me that anybody in this world ever made love that way.
Why, if I&rsquo;d made love to you in such fashion, you&rsquo;d have boxed my
ears.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you misunderstand,&rdquo; Ruth protested. &ldquo;Every form of art
has its limitations.&rdquo; (She was busy recalling a lecture she had heard at
the university on the conventions of the arts.) &ldquo;In painting there are
only two dimensions to the canvas, yet you accept the illusion of three
dimensions which the art of a painter enables him to throw into the canvas. In
writing, again, the author must be omnipotent. You accept as perfectly
legitimate the author&rsquo;s account of the secret thoughts of the heroine,
and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when thinking these
thoughts, and that neither the author nor any one else was capable of hearing
them. And so with the stage, with sculpture, with opera, with every art form.
Certain irreconcilable things must be accepted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I understood that,&rdquo; Martin answered. &ldquo;All the arts have
their conventions.&rdquo; (Ruth was surprised at his use of the word. It was as
if he had studied at the university himself, instead of being ill-equipped from
browsing at haphazard through the books in the library.) &ldquo;But even the
conventions must be real. Trees, painted on flat cardboard and stuck up on each
side of the stage, we accept as a forest. It is a real enough convention. But,
on the other hand, we would not accept a sea scene as a forest. We can&rsquo;t
do it. It violates our senses. Nor would you, or, rather, should you, accept
the ravings and writhings and agonized contortions of those two lunatics
to-night as a convincing portrayal of love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t hold yourself superior to all the judges of
music?&rdquo; she protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, not for a moment. I merely maintain my right as an individual. I
have just been telling you what I think, in order to explain why the
elephantine gambols of Madame Tetralani spoil the orchestra for me. The
world&rsquo;s judges of music may all be right. But I am I, and I won&rsquo;t
subordinate my taste to the unanimous judgment of mankind. If I don&rsquo;t
like a thing, I don&rsquo;t like it, that&rsquo;s all; and there is no reason
under the sun why I should ape a liking for it just because the majority of my
fellow-creatures like it, or make believe they like it. I can&rsquo;t follow
the fashions in the things I like or dislike.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But music, you know, is a matter of training,&rdquo; Ruth argued;
&ldquo;and opera is even more a matter of training. May it not be&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I am not trained in opera?&rdquo; he dashed in.
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;And I consider I am fortunate
in not having been caught when I was young. If I had, I could have wept
sentimental tears to-night, and the clownish antics of that precious pair would
have but enhanced the beauty of their voices and the beauty of the accompanying
orchestra. You are right. It&rsquo;s mostly a matter of training. And I am too
old, now. I must have the real or nothing. An illusion that won&rsquo;t
convince is a palpable lie, and that&rsquo;s what grand opera is to me when
little Barillo throws a fit, clutches mighty Tetralani in his arms (also in a
fit), and tells her how passionately he adores her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Ruth measured his thoughts by comparison of externals and in accordance
with her belief in the established. Who was he that he should be right and all
the cultured world wrong? His words and thoughts made no impression upon her.
She was too firmly intrenched in the established to have any sympathy with
revolutionary ideas. She had always been used to music, and she had enjoyed
opera ever since she was a child, and all her world had enjoyed it, too. Then
by what right did Martin Eden emerge, as he had so recently emerged, from his
rag-time and working-class songs, and pass judgment on the world&rsquo;s music?
She was vexed with him, and as she walked beside him she had a vague feeling of
outrage. At the best, in her most charitable frame of mind, she considered the
statement of his views to be a caprice, an erratic and uncalled-for prank. But
when he took her in his arms at the door and kissed her good night in tender
lover-fashion, she forgot everything in the outrush of her own love to him. And
later, on a sleepless pillow, she puzzled, as she had often puzzled of late, as
to how it was that she loved so strange a man, and loved him despite the
disapproval of her people.
</p>

<p>
And next day Martin Eden cast hack-work aside, and at white heat hammered out
an essay to which he gave the title, &ldquo;The Philosophy of Illusion.&rdquo;
A stamp started it on its travels, but it was destined to receive many stamps
and to be started on many travels in the months that followed.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p>
Maria Silva was poor, and all the ways of poverty were clear to her. Poverty,
to Ruth, was a word signifying a not-nice condition of existence. That was her
total knowledge on the subject. She knew Martin was poor, and his condition she
associated in her mind with the boyhood of Abraham Lincoln, of Mr. Butler, and
of other men who had become successes. Also, while aware that poverty was
anything but delectable, she had a comfortable middle-class feeling that
poverty was salutary, that it was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men
who were not degraded and hopeless drudges. So that her knowledge that Martin
was so poor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her. She
even considered it the hopeful side of the situation, believing that sooner or
later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his writing.
</p>

<p>
Ruth never read hunger in Martin&rsquo;s face, which had grown lean and had
enlarged the slight hollows in the cheeks. In fact, she marked the change in
his face with satisfaction. It seemed to refine him, to remove from him much of
the dross of flesh and the too animal-like vigor that lured her while she
detested it. Sometimes, when with her, she noted an unusual brightness in his
eyes, and she admired it, for it made him appear more the poet and the
scholar&mdash;the things he would have liked to be and which she would have
liked him to be. But Maria Silva read a different tale in the hollow cheeks and
the burning eyes, and she noted the changes in them from day to day, by them
following the ebb and flow of his fortunes. She saw him leave the house with
his overcoat and return without it, though the day was chill and raw, and
promptly she saw his cheeks fill out slightly and the fire of hunger leave his
eyes. In the same way she had seen his wheel and watch go, and after each event
she had seen his vigor bloom again.
</p>

<p>
Likewise she watched his toils, and knew the measure of the midnight oil he
burned. Work! She knew that he outdid her, though his work was of a different
order. And she was surprised to behold that the less food he had, the harder he
worked. On occasion, in a casual sort of way, when she thought hunger pinched
hardest, she would send him in a loaf of new baking, awkwardly covering the act
with banter to the effect that it was better than he could bake. And again, she
would send one of her toddlers in to him with a great pitcher of hot soup,
debating inwardly the while whether she was justified in taking it from the
mouths of her own flesh and blood. Nor was Martin ungrateful, knowing as he did
the lives of the poor, and that if ever in the world there was charity, this
was it.
</p>

<p>
On a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the house, Maria
invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine. Martin, coming into
her kitchen to fetch water, was invited to sit down and drink. He drank her
very-good health, and in return she drank his. Then she drank to prosperity in
his undertakings, and he drank to the hope that James Grant would show up and
pay her for his washing. James Grant was a journeymen carpenter who did not
always pay his bills and who owed Maria three dollars.
</p>

<p>
Both Maria and Martin drank the sour new wine on empty stomachs, and it went
swiftly to their heads. Utterly differentiated creatures that they were, they
were lonely in their misery, and though the misery was tacitly ignored, it was
the bond that drew them together. Maria was amazed to learn that he had been in
the Azores, where she had lived until she was eleven. She was doubly amazed
that he had been in the Hawaiian Islands, whither she had migrated from the
Azores with her people. But her amazement passed all bounds when he told her he
had been on Maui, the particular island whereon she had attained womanhood and
married. Kahului, where she had first met her husband,&mdash;he, Martin, had
been there twice! Yes, she remembered the sugar steamers, and he had been on
them&mdash;well, well, it was a small world. And Wailuku! That place, too! Did
he know the head-luna of the plantation? Yes, and had had a couple of drinks
with him.
</p>

<p>
And so they reminiscenced and drowned their hunger in the raw, sour wine. To
Martin the future did not seem so dim. Success trembled just before him. He was
on the verge of clasping it. Then he studied the deep-lined face of the
toil-worn woman before him, remembered her soups and loaves of new baking, and
felt spring up in him the warmest gratitude and philanthropy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;What would you like to
have?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, bepuzzled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would you like to have now, right now, if you could get it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shoe alla da roun&rsquo; for da childs&mdash;seven pairs da shoe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall have them,&rdquo; he announced, while she nodded her head
gravely. &ldquo;But I mean a big wish, something big that you want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her eyes sparkled good-naturedly. He was choosing to make fun with her, Maria,
with whom few made fun these days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think hard,&rdquo; he cautioned, just as she was opening her mouth to
speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alla right,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I thinka da hard. I lika da
house, dis house&mdash;all mine, no paya da rent, seven dollar da month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; he granted, &ldquo;and in a short time. Now
wish the great wish. Make believe I am God, and I say to you anything you want
you can have. Then you wish that thing, and I listen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maria considered solemnly for a space.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You no &rsquo;fraid?&rdquo; she asked warningly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. Go ahead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Most verra big,&rdquo; she warned again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. Fire away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, den&mdash;&rdquo; She drew a big breath like a child, as she
voiced to the uttermost all she cared to demand of life. &ldquo;I lika da have
one milka ranch&mdash;good milka ranch. Plenty cow, plenty land, plenty grass.
I lika da have near San Le-an; my sister liva dere. I sella da milk in Oakland.
I maka da plentee mon. Joe an&rsquo; Nick no runna da cow. Dey go-a to school.
Bimeby maka da good engineer, worka da railroad. Yes, I lika da milka
ranch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused and regarded Martin with twinkling eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; he answered promptly.
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head and touched her lips courteously to the wine-glass and to
the giver of the gift she knew would never be given. His heart was right, and
in her own heart she appreciated his intention as much as if the gift had gone
with it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Maria,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;Nick and Joe won&rsquo;t have to
peddle milk, and all the kids can go to school and wear shoes the whole year
round. It will be a first-class milk ranch&mdash;everything complete. There
will be a house to live in and a stable for the horses, and cow-barns, of
course. There will be chickens, pigs, vegetables, fruit trees, and everything
like that; and there will be enough cows to pay for a hired man or two. Then
you won&rsquo;t have anything to do but take care of the children. For that
matter, if you find a good man, you can marry and take it easy while he runs
the ranch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And from such largess, dispensed from his future, Martin turned and took his
one good suit of clothes to the pawnshop. His plight was desperate for him to
do this, for it cut him off from Ruth. He had no second-best suit that was
presentable, and though he could go to the butcher and the baker, and even on
occasion to his sister&rsquo;s, it was beyond all daring to dream of entering
the Morse home so disreputably apparelled.
</p>

<p>
He toiled on, miserable and well-nigh hopeless. It began to appear to him that
the second battle was lost and that he would have to go to work. In doing this
he would satisfy everybody&mdash;the grocer, his sister, Ruth, and even Maria,
to whom he owed a month&rsquo;s room rent. He was two months behind with his
type-writer, and the agency was clamoring for payment or for the return of the
machine. In desperation, all but ready to surrender, to make a truce with fate
until he could get a fresh start, he took the civil service examinations for
the Railway Mail. To his surprise, he passed first. The job was assured, though
when the call would come to enter upon his duties nobody knew.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time, at the lowest ebb, that the smooth-running editorial
machine broke down. A cog must have slipped or an oil-cup run dry, for the
postman brought him one morning a short, thin envelope. Martin glanced at the
upper left-hand corner and read the name and address of the <i>Transcontinental
Monthly</i>. His heart gave a great leap, and he suddenly felt faint, the
sinking feeling accompanied by a strange trembling of the knees. He staggered
into his room and sat down on the bed, the envelope still unopened, and in that
moment came understanding to him how people suddenly fall dead upon receipt of
extraordinarily good news.
</p>

<p>
Of course this was good news. There was no manuscript in that thin envelope,
therefore it was an acceptance. He knew the story in the hands of the
<i>Transcontinental</i>. It was &ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo; one of his
horror stories, and it was an even five thousand words. And, since first-class
magazines always paid on acceptance, there was a check inside. Two cents a
word&mdash;twenty dollars a thousand; the check must be a hundred dollars. One
hundred dollars! As he tore the envelope open, every item of all his debts
surged in his brain&mdash;$3.85 to the grocer; butcher $4.00 flat; baker,
$2.00; fruit store, $5.00; total, $14.85. Then there was room rent, $2.50;
another month in advance, $2.50; two months&rsquo; type-writer, $8.00; a month
in advance, $4.00; total, $31.85. And finally to be added, his pledges, plus
interest, with the pawnbroker&mdash;watch, $5.50; overcoat, $5.50; wheel,
$7.75; suit of clothes, $5.50 (60 % interest, but what did it
matter?)&mdash;grand total, $56.10. He saw, as if visible in the air before
him, in illuminated figures, the whole sum, and the subtraction that followed
and that gave a remainder of $43.90. When he had squared every debt, redeemed
every pledge, he would still have jingling in his pockets a princely $43.90.
And on top of that he would have a month&rsquo;s rent paid in advance on the
type-writer and on the room.
</p>

<p>
By this time he had drawn the single sheet of type-written letter out and
spread it open. There was no check. He peered into the envelope, held it to the
light, but could not trust his eyes, and in trembling haste tore the envelope
apart. There was no check. He read the letter, skimming it line by line,
dashing through the editor&rsquo;s praise of his story to the meat of the
letter, the statement why the check had not been sent. He found no such
statement, but he did find that which made him suddenly wilt. The letter slid
from his hand. His eyes went lack-lustre, and he lay back on the pillow,
pulling the blanket about him and up to his chin.
</p>

<p>
Five dollars for &ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo;&mdash;five dollars for five
thousand words! Instead of two cents a word, ten words for a cent! And the
editor had praised it, too. And he would receive the check when the story was
published. Then it was all poppycock, two cents a word for minimum rate and
payment upon acceptance. It was a lie, and it had led him astray. He would
never have attempted to write had he known that. He would have gone to
work&mdash;to work for Ruth. He went back to the day he first attempted to
write, and was appalled at the enormous waste of time&mdash;and all for ten
words for a cent. And the other high rewards of writers, that he had read
about, must be lies, too. His second-hand ideas of authorship were wrong, for
here was the proof of it.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Transcontinental</i> sold for twenty-five cents, and its dignified and
artistic cover proclaimed it as among the first-class magazines. It was a
staid, respectable magazine, and it had been published continuously since long
before he was born. Why, on the outside cover were printed every month the
words of one of the world&rsquo;s great writers, words proclaiming the inspired
mission of the <i>Transcontinental</i> by a star of literature whose first
coruscations had appeared inside those self-same covers. And the high and
lofty, heaven-inspired <i>Transcontinental</i> paid five dollars for five
thousand words! The great writer had recently died in a foreign land&mdash;in
dire poverty, Martin remembered, which was not to be wondered at, considering
the magnificent pay authors receive.
</p>

<p>
Well, he had taken the bait, the newspaper lies about writers and their pay,
and he had wasted two years over it. But he would disgorge the bait now. Not
another line would he ever write. He would do what Ruth wanted him to do, what
everybody wanted him to do&mdash;get a job. The thought of going to work
reminded him of Joe&mdash;Joe, tramping through the land of nothing-to-do.
Martin heaved a great sigh of envy. The reaction of nineteen hours a day for
many days was strong upon him. But then, Joe was not in love, had none of the
responsibilities of love, and he could afford to loaf through the land of
nothing-to-do. He, Martin, had something to work for, and go to work he would.
He would start out early next morning to hunt a job. And he would let Ruth
know, too, that he had mended his ways and was willing to go into her
father&rsquo;s office.
</p>

<p>
Five dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent, the market price
for art. The disappointment of it, the lie of it, the infamy of it, were
uppermost in his thoughts; and under his closed eyelids, in fiery figures,
burned the &ldquo;$3.85&rdquo; he owed the grocer. He shivered, and was aware
of an aching in his bones. The small of his back ached especially. His head
ached, the top of it ached, the back of it ached, the brains inside of it ached
and seemed to be swelling, while the ache over his brows was intolerable. And
beneath the brows, planted under his lids, was the merciless
&ldquo;$3.85.&rdquo; He opened his eyes to escape it, but the white light of
the room seemed to sear the balls and forced him to close his eyes, when the
&ldquo;$3.85&rdquo; confronted him again.
</p>

<p>
Five dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent&mdash;that
particular thought took up its residence in his brain, and he could no more
escape it than he could the &ldquo;$3.85&rdquo; under his eyelids. A change
seemed to come over the latter, and he watched curiously, till
&ldquo;$2.00&rdquo; burned in its stead. Ah, he thought, that was the baker.
The next sum that appeared was &ldquo;$2.50.&rdquo; It puzzled him, and he
pondered it as if life and death hung on the solution. He owed somebody two
dollars and a half, that was certain, but who was it? To find it was the task
set him by an imperious and malignant universe, and he wandered through the
endless corridors of his mind, opening all manner of lumber rooms and chambers
stored with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he vainly sought the
answer. After several centuries it came to him, easily, without effort, that it
was Maria. With a great relief he turned his soul to the screen of torment
under his lids. He had solved the problem; now he could rest. But no, the
&ldquo;$2.50&rdquo; faded away, and in its place burned &ldquo;$8.00.&rdquo;
Who was that? He must go the dreary round of his mind again and find out.
</p>

<p>
How long he was gone on this quest he did not know, but after what seemed an
enormous lapse of time, he was called back to himself by a knock at the door,
and by Maria&rsquo;s asking if he was sick. He replied in a muffled voice he
did not recognize, saying that he was merely taking a nap. He was surprised
when he noted the darkness of night in the room. He had received the letter at
two in the afternoon, and he realized that he was sick.
</p>

<p>
Then the &ldquo;$8.00&rdquo; began to smoulder under his lids again, and he
returned himself to servitude. But he grew cunning. There was no need for him
to wander through his mind. He had been a fool. He pulled a lever and made his
mind revolve about him, a monstrous wheel of fortune, a merry-go-round of
memory, a revolving sphere of wisdom. Faster and faster it revolved, until its
vortex sucked him in and he was flung whirling through black chaos.
</p>

<p>
Quite naturally he found himself at a mangle, feeding starched cuffs. But as he
fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs. It was a new way of marking linen,
he thought, until, looking closer, he saw &ldquo;$3.85&rdquo; on one of the
cuffs. Then it came to him that it was the grocer&rsquo;s bill, and that these
were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle. A crafty idea came to
him. He would throw the bills on the floor and so escape paying them. No sooner
thought than done, and he crumpled the cuffs spitefully as he flung them upon
an unusually dirty floor. Ever the heap grew, and though each bill was
duplicated a thousand times, he found only one for two dollars and a half,
which was what he owed Maria. That meant that Maria would not press for
payment, and he resolved generously that it would be the only one he would pay;
so he began searching through the cast-out heap for hers. He sought it
desperately, for ages, and was still searching when the manager of the hotel
entered, the fat Dutchman. His face blazed with wrath, and he shouted in
stentorian tones that echoed down the universe, &ldquo;I shall deduct the cost
of those cuffs from your wages!&rdquo; The pile of cuffs grew into a mountain,
and Martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a thousand years to pay for
them. Well, there was nothing left to do but kill the manager and burn down the
laundry. But the big Dutchman frustrated him, seizing him by the nape of the
neck and dancing him up and down. He danced him over the ironing tables, the
stove, and the mangles, and out into the wash-room and over the wringer and
washer. Martin was danced until his teeth rattled and his head ached, and he
marvelled that the Dutchman was so strong.
</p>

<p>
And then he found himself before the mangle, this time receiving the cuffs an
editor of a magazine was feeding from the other side. Each cuff was a check,
and Martin went over them anxiously, in a fever of expectation, but they were
all blanks. He stood there and received the blanks for a million years or so,
never letting one go by for fear it might be filled out. At last he found it.
With trembling fingers he held it to the light. It was for five dollars.
&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; laughed the editor across the mangle. &ldquo;Well, then,
I shall kill you,&rdquo; Martin said. He went out into the wash-room to get the
axe, and found Joe starching manuscripts. He tried to make him desist, then
swung the axe for him. But the weapon remained poised in mid-air, for Martin
found himself back in the ironing room in the midst of a snow-storm. No, it was
not snow that was falling, but checks of large denomination, the smallest not
less than a thousand dollars. He began to collect them and sort them out, in
packages of a hundred, tying each package securely with twine.
</p>

<p>
He looked up from his task and saw Joe standing before him juggling flat-irons,
starched shirts, and manuscripts. Now and again he reached out and added a
bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that soared through the roof and out
of sight in a tremendous circle. Martin struck at him, but he seized the axe
and added it to the flying circle. Then he plucked Martin and added him. Martin
went up through the roof, clutching at manuscripts, so that by the time he came
down he had a large armful. But no sooner down than up again, and a second and
a third time and countless times he flew around the circle. From far off he
could hear a childish treble singing: &ldquo;Waltz me around again, Willie,
around, around, around.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He recovered the axe in the midst of the Milky Way of checks, starched shirts,
and manuscripts, and prepared, when he came down, to kill Joe. But he did not
come down. Instead, at two in the morning, Maria, having heard his groans
through the thin partition, came into his room, to put hot flat-irons against
his body and damp cloths upon his aching eyes.

<h2><a name="chap26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p>
Martin Eden did not go out to hunt for a job in the morning. It was late
afternoon before he came out of his delirium and gazed with aching eyes about
the room. Mary, one of the tribe of Silva, eight years old, keeping watch,
raised a screech at sight of his returning consciousness. Maria hurried into
the room from the kitchen. She put her work-calloused hand upon his hot
forehead and felt his pulse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You lika da eat?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head. Eating was farthest from his desire, and he wondered that he
should ever have been hungry in his life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick, Maria,&rdquo; he said weakly. &ldquo;What is it? Do you
know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grip,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Two or three days you alla da right.
Better you no eat now. Bimeby plenty can eat, to-morrow can eat maybe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin was not used to sickness, and when Maria and her little girl left him,
he essayed to get up and dress. By a supreme exertion of will, with rearing
brain and eyes that ached so that he could not keep them open, he managed to
get out of bed, only to be left stranded by his senses upon the table. Half an
hour later he managed to regain the bed, where he was content to lie with
closed eyes and analyze his various pains and weaknesses. Maria came in several
times to change the cold cloths on his forehead. Otherwise she left him in
peace, too wise to vex him with chatter. This moved him to gratitude, and he
murmured to himself, &ldquo;Maria, you getta da milka ranch, all righta, all
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered his long-buried past of yesterday.
</p>

<p>
It seemed a life-time since he had received that letter from the
<i>Transcontinental</i>, a life-time since it was all over and done with and a
new page turned. He had shot his bolt, and shot it hard, and now he was down on
his back. If he hadn&rsquo;t starved himself, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been
caught by La Grippe. He had been run down, and he had not had the strength to
throw off the germ of disease which had invaded his system. This was what
resulted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does it profit a man to write a whole library and lose his own
life?&rdquo; he demanded aloud. &ldquo;This is no place for me. No more
literature in mine. Me for the counting-house and ledger, the monthly salary,
and the little home with Ruth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Two days later, having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk a cup of
tea, he asked for his mail, but found his eyes still hurt too much to permit
him to read.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You read for me, Maria,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Never mind the big, long
letters. Throw them under the table. Read me the small letters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No can,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Teresa, she go to school, she
can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So Teresa Silva, aged nine, opened his letters and read them to him. He
listened absently to a long dun from the type-writer people, his mind busy with
ways and means of finding a job. Suddenly he was shocked back to himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;We offer you forty dollars for all serial rights in your
story,&rsquo;&rdquo; Teresa slowly spelled out, &ldquo;&lsquo;provided you
allow us to make the alterations suggested.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What magazine is that?&rdquo; Martin shouted. &ldquo;Here, give it to
me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He could see to read, now, and he was unaware of the pain of the action. It was
the <i>White Mouse</i> that was offering him forty dollars, and the story was
&ldquo;The Whirlpool,&rdquo; another of his early horror stories. He read the
letter through again and again. The editor told him plainly that he had not
handled the idea properly, but that it was the idea they were buying because it
was original. If they could cut the story down one-third, they would take it
and send him forty dollars on receipt of his answer.
</p>

<p>
He called for pen and ink, and told the editor he could cut the story down
three-thirds if he wanted to, and to send the forty dollars right along.
</p>

<p>
The letter despatched to the letter-box by Teresa, Martin lay back and thought.
It wasn&rsquo;t a lie, after all. The <i>White Mouse</i> paid on acceptance.
There were three thousand words in &ldquo;The Whirlpool.&rdquo; Cut down a
third, there would be two thousand. At forty dollars that would be two cents a
word. Pay on acceptance and two cents a word&mdash;the newspapers had told the
truth. And he had thought the <i>White Mouse</i> a third-rater! It was evident
that he did not know the magazines. He had deemed the <i>Transcontinental</i> a
first-rater, and it paid a cent for ten words. He had classed the <i>White
Mouse</i> as of no account, and it paid twenty times as much as the<i>
Transcontinental</i> and also had paid on acceptance.
</p>

<p>
Well, there was one thing certain: when he got well, he would not go out
looking for a job. There were more stories in his head as good as &ldquo;The
Whirlpool,&rdquo; and at forty dollars apiece he could earn far more than in
any job or position. Just when he thought the battle lost, it was won. He had
proved for his career. The way was clear. Beginning with the <i>White Mouse</i>
he would add magazine after magazine to his growing list of patrons. Hack-work
could be put aside. For that matter, it had been wasted time, for it had not
brought him a dollar. He would devote himself to work, good work, and he would
pour out the best that was in him. He wished Ruth was there to share in his
joy, and when he went over the letters left lying on his bed, he found one from
her. It was sweetly reproachful, wondering what had kept him away for so
dreadful a length of time. He reread the letter adoringly, dwelling over her
handwriting, loving each stroke of her pen, and in the end kissing her
signature.
</p>

<p>
And when he answered, he told her recklessly that he had not been to see her
because his best clothes were in pawn. He told her that he had been sick, but
was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or two weeks (as soon as a
letter could travel to New York City and return) he would redeem his clothes
and be with her.
</p>

<p>
But Ruth did not care to wait ten days or two weeks. Besides, her lover was
sick. The next afternoon, accompanied by Arthur, she arrived in the Morse
carriage, to the unqualified delight of the Silva tribe and of all the urchins
on the street, and to the consternation of Maria. She boxed the ears of the
Silvas who crowded about the visitors on the tiny front porch, and in more than
usual atrocious English tried to apologize for her appearance. Sleeves rolled
up from soap-flecked arms and a wet gunny-sack around her waist told of the
task at which she had been caught. So flustered was she by two such grand young
people asking for her lodger, that she forgot to invite them to sit down in the
little parlor. To enter Martin&rsquo;s room, they passed through the kitchen,
warm and moist and steamy from the big washing in progress. Maria, in her
excitement, jammed the bedroom and bedroom-closet doors together, and for five
minutes, through the partly open door, clouds of steam, smelling of soap-suds
and dirt, poured into the sick chamber.
</p>

<p>
Ruth succeeded in veering right and left and right again, and in running the
narrow passage between table and bed to Martin&rsquo;s side; but Arthur veered
too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots and pans in the corner
where Martin did his cooking. Arthur did not linger long. Ruth occupied the
only chair, and having done his duty, he went outside and stood by the gate,
the centre of seven marvelling Silvas, who watched him as they would have
watched a curiosity in a side-show. All about the carriage were gathered the
children from a dozen blocks, waiting and eager for some tragic and terrible
dénouement. Carriages were seen on their street only for weddings and funerals.
Here was neither marriage nor death: therefore, it was something transcending
experience and well worth waiting for.
</p>

<p>
Martin had been wild to see Ruth. His was essentially a love-nature, and he
possessed more than the average man&rsquo;s need for sympathy. He was starving
for sympathy, which, with him, meant intelligent understanding; and he had yet
to learn that Ruth&rsquo;s sympathy was largely sentimental and tactful, and
that it proceeded from gentleness of nature rather than from understanding of
the objects of her sympathy. So it was while Martin held her hand and gladly
talked, that her love for him prompted her to press his hand in return, and
that her eyes were moist and luminous at sight of his helplessness and of the
marks suffering had stamped upon his face.
</p>

<p>
But while he told her of his two acceptances, of his despair when he received
the one from the <i>Transcontinental</i>, and of the corresponding delight with
which he received the one from the <i>White Mouse</i>, she did not follow him.
She heard the words he uttered and understood their literal import, but she was
not with him in his despair and his delight. She could not get out of herself.
She was not interested in selling stories to magazines. What was important to
her was matrimony. She was not aware of it, however, any more than she was
aware that her desire that Martin take a position was the instinctive and
preparative impulse of motherhood. She would have blushed had she been told as
much in plain, set terms, and next, she might have grown indignant and asserted
that her sole interest lay in the man she loved and her desire for him to make
the best of himself. So, while Martin poured out his heart to her, elated with
the first success his chosen work in the world had received, she paid heed to
his bare words only, gazing now and again about the room, shocked by what she
saw.
</p>

<p>
For the first time Ruth gazed upon the sordid face of poverty. Starving lovers
had always seemed romantic to her,&mdash;but she had had no idea how starving
lovers lived. She had never dreamed it could be like this. Ever her gaze
shifted from the room to him and back again. The steamy smell of dirty clothes,
which had entered with her from the kitchen, was sickening. Martin must be
soaked with it, Ruth concluded, if that awful woman washed frequently. Such was
the contagiousness of degradation. When she looked at Martin, she seemed to see
the smirch left upon him by his surroundings. She had never seen him unshaven,
and the three days&rsquo; growth of beard on his face was repulsive to her. Not
alone did it give him the same dark and murky aspect of the Silva house, inside
and out, but it seemed to emphasize that animal-like strength of his which she
detested. And here he was, being confirmed in his madness by the two
acceptances he took such pride in telling her about. A little longer and he
would have surrendered and gone to work. Now he would continue on in this
horrible house, writing and starving for a few more months.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that smell?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some of Maria&rsquo;s washing smells, I imagine,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;I am growing quite accustomed to them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; not that. It is something else. A stale, sickish smell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin sampled the air before replying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t smell anything else, except stale tobacco smoke,&rdquo; he
announced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. It is terrible. Why do you smoke so much,
Martin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, except that I smoke more than usual when I am
lonely. And then, too, it&rsquo;s such a long-standing habit. I learned when I
was only a youngster.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not a nice habit, you know,&rdquo; she reproved. &ldquo;It smells
to heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fault of the tobacco. I can afford only the cheapest.
But wait until I get that forty-dollar check. I&rsquo;ll use a brand that is
not offensive even to the angels. But that wasn&rsquo;t so bad, was it, two
acceptances in three days? That forty-five dollars will pay about all my
debts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For two years&rsquo; work?&rdquo; she queried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, for less than a week&rsquo;s work. Please pass me that book over on
the far corner of the table, the account book with the gray cover.&rdquo; He
opened it and began turning over the pages rapidly. &ldquo;Yes, I was right.
Four days for &lsquo;The Ring of Bells,&rsquo; two days for &lsquo;The
Whirlpool.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s forty-five dollars for a week&rsquo;s work, one
hundred and eighty dollars a month. That beats any salary I can command. And,
besides, I&rsquo;m just beginning. A thousand dollars a month is not too much
to buy for you all I want you to have. A salary of five hundred a month would
be too small. That forty-five dollars is just a starter. Wait till I get my
stride. Then watch my smoke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth misunderstood his slang, and reverted to cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You smoke more than enough as it is, and the brand of tobacco will make
no difference. It is the smoking itself that is not nice, no matter what the
brand may be. You are a chimney, a living volcano, a perambulating smoke-stack,
and you are a perfect disgrace, Martin dear, you know you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She leaned toward him, entreaty in her eyes, and as he looked at her delicate
face and into her pure, limpid eyes, as of old he was struck with his own
unworthiness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t smoke any more,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Please, for&mdash;my sake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything
you ask, dear love, anything; you know that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A great temptation assailed her. In an insistent way she had caught glimpses of
the large, easy-going side of his nature, and she felt sure, if she asked him
to cease attempting to write, that he would grant her wish. In the swift
instant that elapsed, the words trembled on her lips. But she did not utter
them. She was not quite brave enough; she did not quite dare. Instead, she
leaned toward him to meet him, and in his arms murmured:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, it is really not for my sake, Martin, but for your own. I am
sure smoking hurts you; and besides, it is not good to be a slave to anything,
to a drug least of all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall always be your slave,&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In which case, I shall begin issuing my commands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him mischievously, though deep down she was already regretting
that she had not preferred her largest request.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I live but to obey, your majesty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, my first commandment is, Thou shalt not omit to shave every
day. Look how you have scratched my cheek.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so it ended in caresses and love-laughter. But she had made one point, and
she could not expect to make more than one at a time. She felt a woman&rsquo;s
pride in that she had made him stop smoking. Another time she would persuade
him to take a position, for had he not said he would do anything she asked?
</p>

<p>
She left his side to explore the room, examining the clothes-lines of notes
overhead, learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending his wheel
under the ceiling, and being saddened by the heap of manuscripts under the
table which represented to her just so much wasted time. The oil-stove won her
admiration, but on investigating the food shelves she found them empty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, you haven&rsquo;t anything to eat, you poor dear,&rdquo; she said
with tender compassion. &ldquo;You must be starving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I store my food in Maria&rsquo;s safe and in her pantry,&rdquo; he lied.
&ldquo;It keeps better there. No danger of my starving. Look at that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had come back to his side, and she saw him double his arm at the elbow, the
biceps crawling under his shirt-sleeve and swelling into a knot of muscle,
heavy and hard. The sight repelled her. Sentimentally, she disliked it. But her
pulse, her blood, every fibre of her, loved it and yearned for it, and, in the
old, inexplicable way, she leaned toward him, not away from him. And in the
moment that followed, when he crushed her in his arms, the brain of her,
concerned with the superficial aspects of life, was in revolt; while the heart
of her, the woman of her, concerned with life itself, exulted triumphantly. It
was in moments like this that she felt to the uttermost the greatness of her
love for Martin, for it was almost a swoon of delight to her to feel his strong
arms about her, holding her tightly, hurting her with the grip of their fervor.
At such moments she found justification for her treason to her standards, for
her violation of her own high ideals, and, most of all, for her tacit
disobedience to her mother and father. They did not want her to marry this man.
It shocked them that she should love him. It shocked her, too, sometimes, when
she was apart from him, a cool and reasoning creature. With him, she loved
him&mdash;in truth, at times a vexed and worried love; but love it was, a love
that was stronger than she.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This La Grippe is nothing,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;It hurts a bit,
and gives one a nasty headache, but it doesn&rsquo;t compare with break-bone
fever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you had that, too?&rdquo; she queried absently, intent on the
heaven-sent justification she was finding in his arms.
</p>

<p>
And so, with absent queries, she led him on, till suddenly his words startled
her.
</p>

<p>
He had had the fever in a secret colony of thirty lepers on one of the Hawaiian
Islands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why did you go there?&rdquo; she demanded.
</p>

<p>
Such royal carelessness of body seemed criminal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I never dreamed
of lepers. When I deserted the schooner and landed on the beach, I headed
inland for some place of hiding. For three days I lived off guavas,
<i>ohia</i>-apples, and bananas, all of which grew wild in the jungle. On the
fourth day I found the trail&mdash;a mere foot-trail. It led inland, and it led
up. It was the way I wanted to go, and it showed signs of recent travel. At one
place it ran along the crest of a ridge that was no more than a knife-edge. The
trail wasn&rsquo;t three feet wide on the crest, and on either side the ridge
fell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep. One man, with plenty of
ammunition, could have held it against a hundred thousand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was the only way in to the hiding-place. Three hours after I found
the trail I was there, in a little mountain valley, a pocket in the midst of
lava peaks. The whole place was terraced for taro-patches, fruit trees grew
there, and there were eight or ten grass huts. But as soon as I saw the
inhabitants I knew what I&rsquo;d struck. One sight of them was enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Ruth demanded breathlessly, listening, like any
Desdemona, appalled and fascinated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing for me to do. Their leader was a kind old fellow, pretty far
gone, but he ruled like a king. He had discovered the little valley and founded
the settlement&mdash;all of which was against the law. But he had guns, plenty
of ammunition, and those Kanakas, trained to the shooting of wild cattle and
wild pig, were dead shots. No, there wasn&rsquo;t any running away for Martin
Eden. He stayed&mdash;for three months.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how did you escape?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been there yet, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for a girl there,
a half-Chinese, quarter-white, and quarter-Hawaiian. She was a beauty, poor
thing, and well educated. Her mother, in Honolulu, was worth a million or so.
Well, this girl got me away at last. Her mother financed the settlement, you
see, so the girl wasn&rsquo;t afraid of being punished for letting me go. But
she made me swear, first, never to reveal the hiding-place; and I never have.
This is the first time I have even mentioned it. The girl had just the first
signs of leprosy. The fingers of her right hand were slightly twisted, and
there was a small spot on her arm. That was all. I guess she is dead,
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But weren&rsquo;t you frightened? And weren&rsquo;t you glad to get away
without catching that dreadful disease?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;I was a bit shivery at first; but I
got used to it. I used to feel sorry for that poor girl, though. That made me
forget to be afraid. She was such a beauty, in spirit as well as in appearance,
and she was only slightly touched; yet she was doomed to lie there, living the
life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly away. Leprosy is far more
terrible than you can imagine it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; Ruth murmured softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder she
let you get away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; Martin asked unwittingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because she must have loved you,&rdquo; Ruth said, still softly.
&ldquo;Candidly, now, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin&rsquo;s sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry and by the
indoor life he was living, while the hunger and the sickness had made his face
even pale; and across this pallor flowed the slow wave of a blush. He was
opening his mouth to speak, but Ruth shut him off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, don&rsquo;t answer; it&rsquo;s not necessary,&rdquo; she
laughed.
</p>

<p>
But it seemed to him there was something metallic in her laughter, and that the
light in her eyes was cold. On the spur of the moment it reminded him of a gale
he had once experienced in the North Pacific. And for the moment the apparition
of the gale rose before his eyes&mdash;a gale at night, with a clear sky and
under a full moon, the huge seas glinting coldly in the moonlight. Next, he saw
the girl in the leper refuge and remembered it was for love of him that she had
let him go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was noble,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;She gave me life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was all of the incident, but he heard Ruth muffle a dry sob in her throat,
and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out of the window. When she
turned it back to him, it was composed, and there was no hint of the gale in
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a silly,&rdquo; she said plaintively. &ldquo;But I
can&rsquo;t help it. I do so love you, Martin, I do, I do. I shall grow more
catholic in time, but at present I can&rsquo;t help being jealous of those
ghosts of the past, and you know your past is full of ghosts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; she silenced his protest. &ldquo;It could not be
otherwise. And there&rsquo;s poor Arthur motioning me to come. He&rsquo;s tired
waiting. And now good-by, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some kind of a mixture, put up by the druggists, that
helps men to stop the use of tobacco,&rdquo; she called back from the door,
&ldquo;and I am going to send you some.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The door closed, but opened again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do, I do,&rdquo; she whispered to him; and this time she was really
gone.
</p>

<p>
Maria, with worshipful eyes that none the less were keen to note the texture of
Ruth&rsquo;s garments and the cut of them (a cut unknown that produced an
effect mysteriously beautiful), saw her to the carriage. The crowd of
disappointed urchins stared till the carriage disappeared from view, then
transferred their stare to Maria, who had abruptly become the most important
person on the street. But it was one of her progeny who blasted Maria&rsquo;s
reputation by announcing that the grand visitors had been for her lodger. After
that Maria dropped back into her old obscurity and Martin began to notice the
respectful manner in which he was regarded by the small fry of the
neighborhood. As for Maria, Martin rose in her estimation a full hundred per
cent, and had the Portuguese grocer witnessed that afternoon carriage-call he
would have allowed Martin an additional
three-dollars-and-eighty-five-cents&rsquo; worth of credit.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p>
The sun of Martin&rsquo;s good fortune rose. The day after Ruth&rsquo;s visit,
he received a check for three dollars from a New York scandal weekly in payment
for three of his triolets. Two days later a newspaper published in Chicago
accepted his &ldquo;Treasure Hunters,&rdquo; promising to pay ten dollars for
it on publication. The price was small, but it was the first article he had
written, his very first attempt to express his thought on the printed page. To
cap everything, the adventure serial for boys, his second attempt, was accepted
before the end of the week by a juvenile monthly calling itself <i>Youth and
Age</i>. It was true the serial was twenty-one thousand words, and they offered
to pay him sixteen dollars on publication, which was something like
seventy-five cents a thousand words; but it was equally true that it was the
second thing he had attempted to write and that he was himself thoroughly aware
of its clumsy worthlessness.
</p>

<p>
But even his earliest efforts were not marked with the clumsiness of
mediocrity. What characterized them was the clumsiness of too great
strength&mdash;the clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes
butterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a war-club. So
it was that Martin was glad to sell his early efforts for songs. He knew them
for what they were, and it had not taken him long to acquire this knowledge.
What he pinned his faith to was his later work. He had striven to be something
more than a mere writer of magazine fiction. He had sought to equip himself
with the tools of artistry. On the other hand, he had not sacrificed strength.
His conscious aim had been to increase his strength by avoiding excess of
strength. Nor had he departed from his love of reality. His work was realism,
though he had endeavored to fuse with it the fancies and beauties of
imagination. What he sought was an impassioned realism, shot through with human
aspiration and faith. What he wanted was life as it was, with all its
spirit-groping and soul-reaching left in.
</p>

<p>
He had discovered, in the course of his reading, two schools of fiction. One
treated of man as a god, ignoring his earthly origin; the other treated of man
as a clod, ignoring his heaven-sent dreams and divine possibilities. Both the
god and the clod schools erred, in Martin&rsquo;s estimation, and erred through
too great singleness of sight and purpose. There was a compromise that
approximated the truth, though it flattered not the school of god, while it
challenged the brute-savageness of the school of clod. It was his story,
&ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; which had dragged with Ruth, that Martin believed had
achieved his ideal of the true in fiction; and it was in an essay, &ldquo;God
and Clod,&rdquo; that he had expressed his views on the whole general subject.
</p>

<p>
But &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; and all that he deemed his best work, still went
begging among the editors. His early work counted for nothing in his eyes
except for the money it brought, and his horror stories, two of which he had
sold, he did not consider high work nor his best work. To him they were frankly
imaginative and fantastic, though invested with all the glamour of the real,
wherein lay their power. This investiture of the grotesque and impossible with
reality, he looked upon as a trick&mdash;a skilful trick at best. Great
literature could not reside in such a field. Their artistry was high, but he
denied the worthwhileness of artistry when divorced from humanness. The trick
had been to fling over the face of his artistry a mask of humanness, and this
he had done in the half-dozen or so stories of the horror brand he had written
before he emerged upon the high peaks of &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Wine of Life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The three dollars he received for the triolets he used to eke out a precarious
existence against the arrival of the <i>White Mouse</i> check. He cashed the
first check with the suspicious Portuguese grocer, paying a dollar on account
and dividing the remaining two dollars between the baker and the fruit store.
Martin was not yet rich enough to afford meat, and he was on slim allowance
when the <i>White Mouse</i> check arrived. He was divided on the cashing of it.
He had never been in a bank in his life, much less been in one on business, and
he had a naive and childlike desire to walk into one of the big banks down in
Oakland and fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars. On the other hand,
practical common sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and thereby
make an impression that would later result in an increase of credit.
Reluctantly Martin yielded to the claims of the grocer, paying his bill with
him in full, and receiving in change a pocketful of jingling coin. Also, he
paid the other tradesmen in full, redeemed his suit and his bicycle, paid one
month&rsquo;s rent on the type-writer, and paid Maria the overdue month for his
room and a month in advance. This left him in his pocket, for emergencies, a
balance of nearly three dollars.
</p>

<p>
In itself, this small sum seemed a fortune. Immediately on recovering his
clothes he had gone to see Ruth, and on the way he could not refrain from
jingling the little handful of silver in his pocket. He had been so long
without money that, like a rescued starving man who cannot let the unconsumed
food out of his sight, Martin could not keep his hand off the silver. He was
not mean, nor avaricious, but the money meant more than so many dollars and
cents. It stood for success, and the eagles stamped upon the coins were to him
so many winged victories.
</p>

<p>
It came to him insensibly that it was a very good world. It certainly appeared
more beautiful to him. For weeks it had been a very dull and sombre world; but
now, with nearly all debts paid, three dollars jingling in his pocket, and in
his mind the consciousness of success, the sun shone bright and warm, and even
a rain-squall that soaked unprepared pedestrians seemed a merry happening to
him. When he starved, his thoughts had dwelt often upon the thousands he knew
were starving the world over; but now that he was feasted full, the fact of the
thousands starving was no longer pregnant in his brain. He forgot about them,
and, being in love, remembered the countless lovers in the world. Without
deliberately thinking about it, <i>motifs</i> for love-lyrics began to agitate
his brain. Swept away by the creative impulse, he got off the electric car,
without vexation, two blocks beyond his crossing.
</p>

<p>
He found a number of persons in the Morse home. Ruth&rsquo;s two girl-cousins
were visiting her from San Rafael, and Mrs. Morse, under pretext of
entertaining them, was pursuing her plan of surrounding Ruth with young people.
The campaign had begun during Martin&rsquo;s enforced absence, and was already
in full swing. She was making a point of having at the house men who were doing
things. Thus, in addition to the cousins Dorothy and Florence, Martin
encountered two university professors, one of Latin, the other of English; a
young army officer just back from the Philippines, one-time school-mate of
Ruth&rsquo;s; a young fellow named Melville, private secretary to Joseph
Perkins, head of the San Francisco Trust Company; and finally of the men, a
live bank cashier, Charles Hapgood, a youngish man of thirty-five, graduate of
Stanford University, member of the Nile Club and the Unity Club, and a
conservative speaker for the Republican Party during campaigns&mdash;in short,
a rising young man in every way. Among the women was one who painted portraits,
another who was a professional musician, and still another who possessed the
degree of Doctor of Sociology and who was locally famous for her social
settlement work in the slums of San Francisco. But the women did not count for
much in Mrs. Morse&rsquo;s plan. At the best, they were necessary accessories.
The men who did things must be drawn to the house somehow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited when you talk,&rdquo; Ruth admonished Martin,
before the ordeal of introduction began.
</p>

<p>
He bore himself a bit stiffly at first, oppressed by a sense of his own
awkwardness, especially of his shoulders, which were up to their old trick of
threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments. Also, he was rendered
self-conscious by the company. He had never before been in contact with such
exalted beings nor with so many of them. Melville, the bank cashier, fascinated
him, and he resolved to investigate him at the first opportunity. For
underneath Martin&rsquo;s awe lurked his assertive ego, and he felt the urge to
measure himself with these men and women and to find out what they had learned
from the books and life which he had not learned.
</p>

<p>
Ruth&rsquo;s eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting on, and she
was surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got acquainted with her
cousins. He certainly did not grow excited, while being seated removed from him
the worry of his shoulders. Ruth knew them for clever girls, superficially
brilliant, and she could scarcely understand their praise of Martin later that
night at going to bed. But he, on the other hand, a wit in his own class, a gay
quizzer and laughter-maker at dances and Sunday picnics, had found the making
of fun and the breaking of good-natured lances simple enough in this
environment. And on this evening success stood at his back, patting him on the
shoulder and telling him that he was making good, so that he could afford to
laugh and make laughter and remain unabashed.
</p>

<p>
Later, Ruth&rsquo;s anxiety found justification. Martin and Professor Caldwell
had got together in a conspicuous corner, and though Martin no longer wove the
air with his hands, to Ruth&rsquo;s critical eye he permitted his own eyes to
flash and glitter too frequently, talked too rapidly and warmly, grew too
intense, and allowed his aroused blood to redden his cheeks too much. He lacked
decorum and control, and was in decided contrast to the young professor of
English with whom he talked.
</p>

<p>
But Martin was not concerned with appearances! He had been swift to note the
other&rsquo;s trained mind and to appreciate his command of knowledge.
Furthermore, Professor Caldwell did not realize Martin&rsquo;s concept of the
average English professor. Martin wanted him to talk shop, and, though he
seemed averse at first, succeeded in making him do it. For Martin did not see
why a man should not talk shop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd and unfair,&rdquo; he had told Ruth weeks before,
&ldquo;this objection to talking shop. For what reason under the sun do men and
women come together if not for the exchange of the best that is in them? And
the best that is in them is what they are interested in, the thing by which
they make their living, the thing they&rsquo;ve specialized on and sat up days
and nights over, and even dreamed about. Imagine Mr. Butler living up to social
etiquette and enunciating his views on Paul Verlaine or the German drama or the
novels of D&rsquo;Annunzio. We&rsquo;d be bored to death. I, for one, if I must
listen to Mr. Butler, prefer to hear him talk about his law. It&rsquo;s the
best that is in him, and life is so short that I want the best of every man and
woman I meet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Ruth had objected, &ldquo;there are the topics of general
interest to all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, you mistake,&rdquo; he had rushed on. &ldquo;All persons in
society, all cliques in society&mdash;or, rather, nearly all persons and
cliques&mdash;ape their betters. Now, who are the best betters? The idlers, the
wealthy idlers. They do not know, as a rule, the things known by the persons
who are doing something in the world. To listen to conversation about such
things would mean to be bored, wherefore the idlers decree that such things are
shop and must not be talked about. Likewise they decree the things that are not
shop and which may be talked about, and those things are the latest operas,
latest novels, cards, billiards, cocktails, automobiles, horse shows, trout
fishing, tuna-fishing, big-game shooting, yacht sailing, and so forth&mdash;and
mark you, these are the things the idlers know. In all truth, they constitute
the shop-talk of the idlers. And the funniest part of it is that many of the
clever people, and all the would-be clever people, allow the idlers so to
impose upon them. As for me, I want the best a man&rsquo;s got in him, call it
shop vulgarity or anything you please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Ruth had not understood. This attack of his on the established had seemed
to her just so much wilfulness of opinion.
</p>

<p>
So Martin contaminated Professor Caldwell with his own earnestness, challenging
him to speak his mind. As Ruth paused beside them she heard Martin saying:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t pronounce such heresies in the University of
California?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Professor Caldwell shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;The honest taxpayer and the
politician, you know. Sacramento gives us our appropriations and therefore we
kowtow to Sacramento, and to the Board of Regents, and to the party press, or
to the press of both parties.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s clear; but how about you?&rdquo; Martin urged.
&ldquo;You must be a fish out of the water.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Few like me, I imagine, in the university pond. Sometimes I am fairly
sure I am out of water, and that I should belong in Paris, in Grub Street, in a
hermit&rsquo;s cave, or in some sadly wild Bohemian crowd, drinking
claret,&mdash;dago-red they call it in San Francisco,&mdash;dining in cheap
restaurants in the Latin Quarter, and expressing vociferously radical views
upon all creation. Really, I am frequently almost sure that I was cut out to be
a radical. But then, there are so many questions on which I am not sure. I grow
timid when I am face to face with my human frailty, which ever prevents me from
grasping all the factors in any problem&mdash;human, vital problems, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And as he talked on, Martin became aware that to his own lips had come the
&ldquo;Song of the Trade Wind&rdquo;:-
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;I am strongest at noon,<br />
But under the moon<br />
    I stiffen the bunt of the sail.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was almost humming the words, and it dawned upon him that the other reminded
him of the trade wind, of the Northeast Trade, steady, and cool, and strong. He
was equable, he was to be relied upon, and withal there was a certain
bafflement about him. Martin had the feeling that he never spoke his full mind,
just as he had often had the feeling that the trades never blew their strongest
but always held reserves of strength that were never used. Martin&rsquo;s trick
of visioning was active as ever. His brain was a most accessible storehouse of
remembered fact and fancy, and its contents seemed ever ordered and spread for
his inspection. Whatever occurred in the instant present, Martin&rsquo;s mind
immediately presented associated antithesis or similitude which ordinarily
expressed themselves to him in vision. It was sheerly automatic, and his
visioning was an unfailing accompaniment to the living present. Just as
Ruth&rsquo;s face, in a momentary jealousy had called before his eyes a
forgotten moonlight gale, and as Professor Caldwell made him see again the
Northeast Trade herding the white billows across the purple sea, so, from
moment to moment, not disconcerting but rather identifying and classifying, new
memory-visions rose before him, or spread under his eyelids, or were thrown
upon the screen of his consciousness. These visions came out of the actions and
sensations of the past, out of things and events and books of yesterday and
last week&mdash;a countless host of apparitions that, waking or sleeping,
forever thronged his mind.
</p>

<p>
So it was, as he listened to Professor Caldwell&rsquo;s easy flow of
speech&mdash;the conversation of a clever, cultured man&mdash;that Martin kept
seeing himself down all his past. He saw himself when he had been quite the
hoodlum, wearing a &ldquo;stiff-rim&rdquo; Stetson hat and a square-cut,
double-breasted coat, with a certain swagger to the shoulders and possessing
the ideal of being as tough as the police permitted. He did not disguise it to
himself, nor attempt to palliate it. At one time in his life he had been just a
common hoodlum, the leader of a gang that worried the police and terrorized
honest, working-class householders. But his ideals had changed. He glanced
about him at the well-bred, well-dressed men and women, and breathed into his
lungs the atmosphere of culture and refinement, and at the same moment the
ghost of his early youth, in stiff-rim and square-cut, with swagger and
toughness, stalked across the room. This figure, of the corner hoodlum, he saw
merge into himself, sitting and talking with an actual university professor.
</p>

<p>
For, after all, he had never found his permanent abiding place. He had fitted
in wherever he found himself, been a favorite always and everywhere by virtue
of holding his own at work and at play and by his willingness and ability to
fight for his rights and command respect. But he had never taken root. He had
fitted in sufficiently to satisfy his fellows but not to satisfy himself. He
had been perturbed always by a feeling of unrest, had heard always the call of
something from beyond, and had wandered on through life seeking it until he
found books and art and love. And here he was, in the midst of all this, the
only one of all the comrades he had adventured with who could have made
themselves eligible for the inside of the Morse home.
</p>

<p>
But such thoughts and visions did not prevent him from following Professor
Caldwell closely. And as he followed, comprehendingly and critically, he noted
the unbroken field of the other&rsquo;s knowledge. As for himself, from moment
to moment the conversation showed him gaps and open stretches, whole subjects
with which he was unfamiliar. Nevertheless, thanks to his Spencer, he saw that
he possessed the outlines of the field of knowledge. It was a matter only of
time, when he would fill in the outline. Then watch out, he
thought&mdash;&rsquo;ware shoal, everybody! He felt like sitting at the feet of
the professor, worshipful and absorbent; but, as he listened, he began to
discern a weakness in the other&rsquo;s judgments&mdash;a weakness so stray and
elusive that he might not have caught it had it not been ever present. And when
he did catch it, he leapt to equality at once.
</p>

<p>
Ruth came up to them a second time, just as Martin began to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you where you are wrong, or, rather, what weakens your
judgments,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You lack biology. It has no place in your
scheme of things.&mdash;Oh, I mean the real interpretative biology, from the
ground up, from the laboratory and the test-tube and the vitalized inorganic
right on up to the widest aesthetic and sociological generalizations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth was appalled. She had sat two lecture courses under Professor Caldwell and
looked up to him as the living repository of all knowledge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely follow you,&rdquo; he said dubiously.
</p>

<p>
Martin was not so sure but what he had followed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll try to explain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I remember
reading in Egyptian history something to the effect that understanding could
not be had of Egyptian art without first studying the land question.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; the professor nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it seems to me,&rdquo; Martin continued, &ldquo;that knowledge of
the land question, in turn, of all questions, for that matter, cannot be had
without previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution of life. How can
we understand laws and institutions, religions and customs, without
understanding, not merely the nature of the creatures that made them, but the
nature of the stuff out of which the creatures are made? Is literature less
human than the architecture and sculpture of Egypt? Is there one thing in the
known universe that is not subject to the law of evolution?&mdash;Oh, I know
there is an elaborate evolution of the various arts laid down, but it seems to
me to be too mechanical. The human himself is left out. The evolution of the
tool, of the harp, of music and song and dance, are all beautifully elaborated;
but how about the evolution of the human himself, the development of the basic
and intrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or gibbered
his first chant? It is that which you do not consider, and which I call
biology. It is biology in its largest aspects.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know I express myself incoherently, but I&rsquo;ve tried to hammer out
the idea. It came to me as you were talking, so I was not primed and ready to
deliver it. You spoke yourself of the human frailty that prevented one from
taking all the factors into consideration. And you, in turn,&mdash;or so it
seems to me,&mdash;leave out the biological factor, the very stuff out of which
has been spun the fabric of all the arts, the warp and the woof of all human
actions and achievements.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To Ruth&rsquo;s amazement, Martin was not immediately crushed, and that the
professor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance for
Martin&rsquo;s youth. Professor Caldwell sat for a full minute, silent and
fingering his watch chain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had that same
criticism passed on me once before&mdash;by a very great man, a scientist and
evolutionist, Joseph Le Conte. But he is dead, and I thought to remain
undetected; and now you come along and expose me. Seriously, though&mdash;and
this is confession&mdash;I think there is something in your contention&mdash;a
great deal, in fact. I am too classical, not enough up-to-date in the
interpretative branches of science, and I can only plead the disadvantages of
my education and a temperamental slothfulness that prevents me from doing the
work. I wonder if you&rsquo;ll believe that I&rsquo;ve never been inside a
physics or chemistry laboratory? It is true, nevertheless. Le Conte was right,
and so are you, Mr. Eden, at least to an extent&mdash;how much I do not
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth drew Martin away with her on a pretext; when she had got him aside,
whispering:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have monopolized Professor Caldwell that way. There
may be others who want to talk with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My mistake,&rdquo; Martin admitted contritely. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d got
him stirred up, and he was so interesting that I did not think. Do you know, he
is the brightest, the most intellectual, man I have ever talked with. And
I&rsquo;ll tell you something else. I once thought that everybody who went to
universities, or who sat in the high places in society, was just as brilliant
and intelligent as he.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an exception,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should say so. Whom do you want me to talk to now?&mdash;Oh, say,
bring me up against that cashier-fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin talked for fifteen minutes with him, nor could Ruth have wished better
behavior on her lover&rsquo;s part. Not once did his eyes flash nor his cheeks
flush, while the calmness and poise with which he talked surprised her. But in
Martin&rsquo;s estimation the whole tribe of bank cashiers fell a few hundred
per cent, and for the rest of the evening he labored under the impression that
bank cashiers and talkers of platitudes were synonymous phrases. The army
officer he found good-natured and simple, a healthy, wholesome young fellow,
content to occupy the place in life into which birth and luck had flung him. On
learning that he had completed two years in the university, Martin was puzzled
to know where he had stored it away. Nevertheless Martin liked him better than
the platitudinous bank cashier.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t object to platitudes,&rdquo; he told Ruth later;
&ldquo;but what worries me into nervousness is the pompous, smugly complacent,
superior certitude with which they are uttered and the time taken to do it.
Why, I could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time he
took to tell me that the Union-Labor Party had fused with the Democrats. Do you
know, he skins his words as a professional poker-player skins the cards that
are dealt out to him. Some day I&rsquo;ll show you what I mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; was her reply.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a favorite of Mr. Butler&rsquo;s. Mr. Butler says he is safe
and honest&mdash;calls him the Rock, Peter, and says that upon him any banking
institution can well be built.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it&mdash;from the little I saw of him and the less I
heard from him; but I don&rsquo;t think so much of banks as I did. You
don&rsquo;t mind my speaking my mind this way, dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; it is most interesting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Martin went on heartily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more than a
barbarian getting my first impressions of civilization. Such impressions must
be entertainingly novel to the civilized person.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you think of my cousins?&rdquo; Ruth queried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I liked them better than the other women. There&rsquo;s plenty of fun in
them along with paucity of pretence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you did like the other women?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That social-settlement woman is no more than a sociological poll-parrot.
I swear, if you winnowed her out between the stars, like Tomlinson, there would
be found in her not one original thought. As for the portrait-painter, she was
a positive bore. She&rsquo;d make a good wife for the cashier. And the musician
woman! I don&rsquo;t care how nimble her fingers are, how perfect her
technique, how wonderful her expression&mdash;the fact is, she knows nothing
about music.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She plays beautifully,&rdquo; Ruth protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s undoubtedly gymnastic in the externals of music, but
the intrinsic spirit of music is unguessed by her. I asked her what music meant
to her&mdash;you know I&rsquo;m always curious to know that particular thing;
and she did not know what it meant to her, except that she adored it, that it
was the greatest of the arts, and that it meant more than life to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were making them talk shop,&rdquo; Ruth charged him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I confess it. And if they were failures on shop, imagine my sufferings
if they had discoursed on other subjects. Why, I used to think that up here,
where all the advantages of culture were enjoyed&mdash;&rdquo; He paused for a
moment, and watched the youthful shade of himself, in stiff-rim and square-cut,
enter the door and swagger across the room. &ldquo;As I was saying, up here I
thought all men and women were brilliant and radiant. But now, from what little
I&rsquo;ve seen of them, they strike me as a pack of ninnies, most of them, and
ninety percent of the remainder as bores. Now there&rsquo;s Professor
Caldwell&mdash;he&rsquo;s different. He&rsquo;s a man, every inch of him and
every atom of his gray matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth&rsquo;s face brightened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about him,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Not what is large and
brilliant&mdash;I know those qualities; but whatever you feel is adverse. I am
most curious to know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll get myself in a pickle.&rdquo; Martin debated
humorously for a moment. &ldquo;Suppose you tell me first. Or maybe you find in
him nothing less than the best.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I attended two lecture courses under him, and I have known him for two
years; that is why I am anxious for your first impression.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bad impression, you mean? Well, here goes. He is all the fine things you
think about him, I guess. At least, he is the finest specimen of intellectual
man I have met; but he is a man with a secret shame.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; he hastened to cry. &ldquo;Nothing paltry nor vulgar.
What I mean is that he strikes me as a man who has gone to the bottom of
things, and is so afraid of what he saw that he makes believe to himself that
he never saw it. Perhaps that&rsquo;s not the clearest way to express it.
Here&rsquo;s another way. A man who has found the path to the hidden temple but
has not followed it; who has, perhaps, caught glimpses of the temple and
striven afterward to convince himself that it was only a mirage of foliage. Yet
another way. A man who could have done things but who placed no value on the
doing, and who, all the time, in his innermost heart, is regretting that he has
not done them; who has secretly laughed at the rewards for doing, and yet,
still more secretly, has yearned for the rewards and for the joy of
doing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t read him that way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And for that
matter, I don&rsquo;t see just what you mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is only a vague feeling on my part,&rdquo; Martin temporized.
&ldquo;I have no reason for it. It is only a feeling, and most likely it is
wrong. You certainly should know him better than I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
From the evening at Ruth&rsquo;s Martin brought away with him strange
confusions and conflicting feelings. He was disappointed in his goal, in the
persons he had climbed to be with. On the other hand, he was encouraged with
his success. The climb had been easier than he expected. He was superior to the
climb, and (he did not, with false modesty, hide it from himself) he was
superior to the beings among whom he had climbed&mdash;with the exception, of
course, of Professor Caldwell. About life and the books he knew more than they,
and he wondered into what nooks and crannies they had cast aside their
educations. He did not know that he was himself possessed of unusual brain
vigor; nor did he know that the persons who were given to probing the depths
and to thinking ultimate thoughts were not to be found in the drawing rooms of
the world&rsquo;s Morses; nor did he dream that such persons were as lonely
eagles sailing solitary in the azure sky far above the earth and its swarming
freight of gregarious life.

<h2><a name="chap28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p>
But success had lost Martin&rsquo;s address, and her messengers no longer came
to his door. For twenty-five days, working Sundays and holidays, he toiled on
&ldquo;The Shame of the Sun,&rdquo; a long essay of some thirty thousand words.
It was a deliberate attack on the mysticism of the Maeterlinck school&mdash;an
attack from the citadel of positive science upon the wonder-dreamers, but an
attack nevertheless that retained much of beauty and wonder of the sort
compatible with ascertained fact. It was a little later that he followed up the
attack with two short essays, &ldquo;The Wonder-Dreamers&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Yardstick of the Ego.&rdquo; And on essays, long and short, he began to pay the
travelling expenses from magazine to magazine.
</p>

<p>
During the twenty-five days spent on &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun,&rdquo; he
sold hack-work to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents. A joke had brought
in fifty cents, and a second one, sold to a high-grade comic weekly, had
fetched a dollar. Then two humorous poems had earned two dollars and three
dollars respectively. As a result, having exhausted his credit with the
tradesmen (though he had increased his credit with the grocer to five dollars),
his wheel and suit of clothes went back to the pawnbroker. The type-writer
people were again clamoring for money, insistently pointing out that according
to the agreement rent was to be paid strictly in advance.
</p>

<p>
Encouraged by his several small sales, Martin went back to hack-work. Perhaps
there was a living in it, after all. Stored away under his table were the
twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the newspaper short-story
syndicate. He read them over in order to find out how not to write newspaper
storiettes, and so doing, reasoned out the perfect formula. He found that the
newspaper storiette should never be tragic, should never end unhappily, and
should never contain beauty of language, subtlety of thought, nor real delicacy
of sentiment. Sentiment it must contain, plenty of it, pure and noble, of the
sort that in his own early youth had brought his applause from &ldquo;nigger
heaven&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;For-God-my-country-and-the-Czar&rdquo; and
&ldquo;I-may-be-poor-but-I-am-honest&rdquo; brand of sentiment.
</p>

<p>
Having learned such precautions, Martin consulted &ldquo;The Duchess&rdquo; for
tone, and proceeded to mix according to formula. The formula consists of three
parts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2) by some deed or event they
are reunited; (3) marriage bells. The third part was an unvarying quantity, but
the first and second parts could be varied an infinite number of times. Thus,
the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives, by accident
of fate, by jealous rivals, by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming
relatives, and so forth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of
the man lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one
lover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming relative,
or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by discovery of some
unguessed secret, by lover storming girl&rsquo;s heart, by lover making long
and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly. It was very fetching to make
the girl propose in the course of being reunited, and Martin discovered, bit by
bit, other decidedly piquant and fetching ruses. But marriage bells at the end
was the one thing he could take no liberties with; though the heavens rolled up
as a scroll and the stars fell, the wedding bells must go on ringing just the
same. In quantity, the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose,
fifteen hundred words maximum dose.
</p>

<p>
Before he got very far along in the art of the storiette, Martin worked out
half a dozen stock forms, which he always consulted when constructing
storiettes. These forms were like the cunning tables used by mathematicians,
which may be entered from top, bottom, right, and left, which entrances consist
of scores of lines and dozens of columns, and from which may be drawn, without
reasoning or thinking, thousands of different conclusions, all unchallengably
precise and true. Thus, in the course of half an hour with his forms, Martin
could frame up a dozen or so storiettes, which he put aside and filled in at
his convenience. He found that he could fill one in, after a day of serious
work, in the hour before going to bed. As he later confessed to Ruth, he could
almost do it in his sleep. The real work was in constructing the frames, and
that was merely mechanical.
</p>

<p>
He had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula, and for once he knew
the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that the first two he
sent off would bring checks. And checks they brought, for four dollars each, at
the end of twelve days.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime he was making fresh and alarming discoveries concerning the
magazines. Though the <i>Transcontinental</i> had published &ldquo;The Ring of
Bells,&rdquo; no check was forthcoming. Martin needed it, and he wrote for it.
An evasive answer and a request for more of his work was all he received. He
had gone hungry two days waiting for the reply, and it was then that he put his
wheel back in pawn. He wrote regularly, twice a week, to the
<i>Transcontinental</i> for his five dollars, though it was only
semi-occasionally that he elicited a reply. He did not know that the
<i>Transcontinental</i> had been staggering along precariously for years, that
it was a fourth-rater, or tenth-rater, without standing, with a crazy
circulation that partly rested on petty bullying and partly on patriotic
appealing, and with advertisements that were scarcely more than charitable
donations. Nor did he know that the <i>Transcontinental</i> was the sole
livelihood of the editor and the business manager, and that they could wring
their livelihood out of it only by moving to escape paying rent and by never
paying any bill they could evade. Nor could he have guessed that the particular
five dollars that belonged to him had been appropriated by the business manager
for the painting of his house in Alameda, which painting he performed himself,
on week-day afternoons, because he could not afford to pay union wages and
because the first scab he had employed had had a ladder jerked out from under
him and been sent to the hospital with a broken collar-bone.
</p>

<p>
The ten dollars for which Martin had sold &ldquo;Treasure Hunters&rdquo; to the
Chicago newspaper did not come to hand. The article had been published, as he
had ascertained at the file in the Central Reading-room, but no word could he
get from the editor. His letters were ignored. To satisfy himself that they had
been received, he registered several of them. It was nothing less than robbery,
he concluded&mdash;a cold-blooded steal; while he starved, he was pilfered of
his merchandise, of his goods, the sale of which was the sole way of getting
bread to eat.
</p>

<p>
<i>Youth and Age</i> was a weekly, and it had published two-thirds of his
twenty-one-thousand-word serial when it went out of business. With it went all
hopes of getting his sixteen dollars.
</p>

<p>
To cap the situation, &ldquo;The Pot,&rdquo; which he looked upon as one of the
best things he had written, was lost to him. In despair, casting about
frantically among the magazines, he had sent it to <i>The Billow</i>, a society
weekly in San Francisco. His chief reason for submitting it to that publication
was that, having only to travel across the bay from Oakland, a quick decision
could be reached. Two weeks later he was overjoyed to see, in the latest number
on the news-stand, his story printed in full, illustrated, and in the place of
honor. He went home with leaping pulse, wondering how much they would pay him
for one of the best things he had done. Also, the celerity with which it had
been accepted and published was a pleasant thought to him. That the editor had
not informed him of the acceptance made the surprise more complete. After
waiting a week, two weeks, and half a week longer, desperation conquered
diffidence, and he wrote to the editor of <i>The Billow</i>, suggesting that
possibly through some negligence of the business manager his little account had
been overlooked.
</p>

<p>
Even if it isn&rsquo;t more than five dollars, Martin thought to himself, it
will buy enough beans and pea-soup to enable me to write half a dozen like it,
and possibly as good.
</p>

<p>
Back came a cool letter from the editor that at least elicited Martin&rsquo;s
admiration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We thank you,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;for your excellent contribution. All
of us in the office enjoyed it immensely, and, as you see, it was given the
place of honor and immediate publication. We earnestly hope that you liked the
illustrations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On rereading your letter it seems to us that you are laboring under the
misapprehension that we pay for unsolicited manuscripts. This is not our
custom, and of course yours was unsolicited. We assumed, naturally, when we
received your story, that you understood the situation. We can only deeply
regret this unfortunate misunderstanding, and assure you of our unfailing
regard. Again, thanking you for your kind contribution, and hoping to receive
more from you in the near future, we remain, etc.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was also a postscript to the effect that though <i>The Billow</i> carried
no free-list, it took great pleasure in sending him a complimentary
subscription for the ensuing year.
</p>

<p>
After that experience, Martin typed at the top of the first sheet of all his
manuscripts: &ldquo;Submitted at your usual rate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Some day, he consoled himself, they will be submitted at <i>my</i> usual rate.
</p>

<p>
He discovered in himself, at this period, a passion for perfection, under the
sway of which he rewrote and polished &ldquo;The Jostling Street,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Wine of Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Sea
Lyrics,&rdquo; and others of his earlier work. As of old, nineteen hours of
labor a day was all too little to suit him. He wrote prodigiously, and he read
prodigiously, forgetting in his toil the pangs caused by giving up his tobacco.
Ruth&rsquo;s promised cure for the habit, flamboyantly labelled, he stowed away
in the most inaccessible corner of his bureau. Especially during his stretches
of famine he suffered from lack of the weed; but no matter how often he
mastered the craving, it remained with him as strong as ever. He regarded it as
the biggest thing he had ever achieved. Ruth&rsquo;s point of view was that he
was doing no more than was right. She brought him the anti-tobacco remedy,
purchased out of her glove money, and in a few days forgot all about it.
</p>

<p>
His machine-made storiettes, though he hated them and derided them, were
successful. By means of them he redeemed all his pledges, paid most of his
bills, and bought a new set of tires for his wheel. The storiettes at least
kept the pot a-boiling and gave him time for ambitious work; while the one
thing that upheld him was the forty dollars he had received from <i>The White
Mouse</i>. He anchored his faith to that, and was confident that the really
first-class magazines would pay an unknown writer at least an equal rate, if
not a better one. But the thing was, how to get into the first-class magazines.
His best stories, essays, and poems went begging among them, and yet, each
month, he read reams of dull, prosy, inartistic stuff between all their various
covers. If only one editor, he sometimes thought, would descend from his high
seat of pride to write me one cheering line! No matter if my work is unusual,
no matter if it is unfit, for prudential reasons, for their pages, surely there
must be some sparks in it, somewhere, a few, to warm them to some sort of
appreciation. And thereupon he would get out one or another of his manuscripts,
such as &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; and read it over and over in a vain attempt to
vindicate the editorial silence.
</p>

<p>
As the sweet California spring came on, his period of plenty came to an end.
For several weeks he had been worried by a strange silence on the part of the
newspaper storiette syndicate. Then, one day, came back to him through the mail
ten of his immaculate machine-made storiettes. They were accompanied by a brief
letter to the effect that the syndicate was overstocked, and that some months
would elapse before it would be in the market again for manuscripts. Martin had
even been extravagant on the strength of those ten storiettes. Toward the last
the syndicate had been paying him five dollars each for them and accepting
every one he sent. So he had looked upon the ten as good as sold, and he had
lived accordingly, on a basis of fifty dollars in the bank. So it was that he
entered abruptly upon a lean period, wherein he continued selling his earlier
efforts to publications that would not pay and submitting his later work to
magazines that would not buy. Also, he resumed his trips to the pawn-broker
down in Oakland. A few jokes and snatches of humorous verse, sold to the New
York weeklies, made existence barely possible for him. It was at this time that
he wrote letters of inquiry to the several great monthly and quarterly reviews,
and learned in reply that they rarely considered unsolicited articles, and that
most of their contents were written upon order by well-known specialists who
were authorities in their various fields.

<h2><a name="chap29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p>
It was a hard summer for Martin. Manuscript readers and editors were away on
vacation, and publications that ordinarily returned a decision in three weeks
now retained his manuscript for three months or more. The consolation he drew
from it was that a saving in postage was effected by the deadlock. Only the
robber-publications seemed to remain actively in business, and to them Martin
disposed of all his early efforts, such as &ldquo;Pearl-diving,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Sea as a Career,&rdquo; &ldquo;Turtle-catching,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Northeast Trades.&rdquo; For these manuscripts he never received a
penny. It is true, after six months&rsquo; correspondence, he effected a
compromise, whereby he received a safety razor for
&ldquo;Turtle-catching,&rdquo; and that <i>The Acropolis</i>, having agreed to
give him five dollars cash and five yearly subscriptions: for &ldquo;The
Northeast Trades,&rdquo; fulfilled the second part of the agreement.
</p>

<p>
For a sonnet on Stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of a Boston
editor who was running a magazine with a Matthew Arnold taste and a
penny-dreadful purse. &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl,&rdquo; a clever skit of a
poem of two hundred lines, just finished, white hot from his brain, won the
heart of the editor of a San Francisco magazine published in the interest of a
great railroad. When the editor wrote, offering him payment in transportation,
Martin wrote back to inquire if the transportation was transferable. It was
not, and so, being prevented from peddling it, he asked for the return of the
poem. Back it came, with the editor&rsquo;s regrets, and Martin sent it to San
Francisco again, this time to <i>The Hornet</i>, a pretentious monthly that had
been fanned into a constellation of the first magnitude by the brilliant
journalist who founded it. But <i>The Hornet&rsquo;s</i> light had begun to dim
long before Martin was born. The editor promised Martin fifteen dollars for the
poem, but, when it was published, seemed to forget about it. Several of his
letters being ignored, Martin indicted an angry one which drew a reply. It was
written by a new editor, who coolly informed Martin that he declined to be held
responsible for the old editor&rsquo;s mistakes, and that he did not think much
of &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; anyway.
</p>

<p>
But <i>The Globe</i>, a Chicago magazine, gave Martin the most cruel treatment
of all. He had refrained from offering his &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; for
publication, until driven to it by starvation. After having been rejected by a
dozen magazines, they had come to rest in <i>The Globe</i> office. There were
thirty poems in the collection, and he was to receive a dollar apiece for them.
The first month four were published, and he promptly received a check for four
dollars; but when he looked over the magazine, he was appalled at the
slaughter. In some cases the titles had been altered: &ldquo;Finis,&rdquo; for
instance, being changed to &ldquo;The Finish,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Song of the
Outer Reef&rdquo; to &ldquo;The Song of the Coral Reef.&rdquo; In one case, an
absolutely different title, a misappropriate title, was substituted. In place
of his own, &ldquo;Medusa Lights,&rdquo; the editor had printed, &ldquo;The
Backward Track.&rdquo; But the slaughter in the body of the poems was
terrifying. Martin groaned and sweated and thrust his hands through his hair.
Phrases, lines, and stanzas were cut out, interchanged, or juggled about in the
most incomprehensible manner. Sometimes lines and stanzas not his own were
substituted for his. He could not believe that a sane editor could be guilty of
such maltreatment, and his favorite hypothesis was that his poems must have
been doctored by the office boy or the stenographer. Martin wrote immediately,
begging the editor to cease publishing the lyrics and to return them to him.
</p>

<p>
He wrote again and again, begging, entreating, threatening, but his letters
were ignored. Month by month the slaughter went on till the thirty poems were
published, and month by month he received a check for those which had appeared
in the current number.
</p>

<p>
Despite these various misadventures, the memory of the <i>White Mouse</i>
forty-dollar check sustained him, though he was driven more and more to
hack-work. He discovered a bread-and-butter field in the agricultural weeklies
and trade journals, though among the religious weeklies he found he could
easily starve. At his lowest ebb, when his black suit was in pawn, he made a
ten-strike&mdash;or so it seemed to him&mdash;in a prize contest arranged by
the County Committee of the Republican Party. There were three branches of the
contest, and he entered them all, laughing at himself bitterly the while in
that he was driven to such straits to live. His poem won the first prize of ten
dollars, his campaign song the second prize of five dollars, his essay on the
principles of the Republican Party the first prize of twenty-five dollars.
Which was very gratifying to him until he tried to collect. Something had gone
wrong in the County Committee, and, though a rich banker and a state senator
were members of it, the money was not forthcoming. While this affair was
hanging fire, he proved that he understood the principles of the Democratic
Party by winning the first prize for his essay in a similar contest. And,
moreover, he received the money, twenty-five dollars. But the forty dollars won
in the first contest he never received.
</p>

<p>
Driven to shifts in order to see Ruth, and deciding that the long walk from
north Oakland to her house and back again consumed too much time, he kept his
black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle. The latter gave him exercise, saved
him hours of time for work, and enabled him to see Ruth just the same. A pair
of knee duck trousers and an old sweater made him a presentable wheel costume,
so that he could go with Ruth on afternoon rides. Besides, he no longer had
opportunity to see much of her in her own home, where Mrs. Morse was thoroughly
prosecuting her campaign of entertainment. The exalted beings he met there, and
to whom he had looked up but a short time before, now bored him. They were no
longer exalted. He was nervous and irritable, what of his hard times,
disappointments, and close application to work, and the conversation of such
people was maddening. He was not unduly egotistic. He measured the narrowness
of their minds by the minds of the thinkers in the books he read. At
Ruth&rsquo;s home he never met a large mind, with the exception of Professor
Caldwell, and Caldwell he had met there only once. As for the rest, they were
numskulls, ninnies, superficial, dogmatic, and ignorant. It was their ignorance
that astounded him. What was the matter with them? What had they done with
their educations? They had had access to the same books he had. How did it
happen that they had drawn nothing from them?
</p>

<p>
He knew that the great minds, the deep and rational thinkers, existed. He had
his proofs from the books, the books that had educated him beyond the Morse
standard. And he knew that higher intellects than those of the Morse circle
were to be found in the world. He read English society novels, wherein he
caught glimpses of men and women talking politics and philosophy. And he read
of salons in great cities, even in the United States, where art and intellect
congregated. Foolishly, in the past, he had conceived that all well-groomed
persons above the working class were persons with power of intellect and vigor
of beauty. Culture and collars had gone together, to him, and he had been
deceived into believing that college educations and mastery were the same
things.
</p>

<p>
Well, he would fight his way on and up higher. And he would take Ruth with him.
Her he dearly loved, and he was confident that she would shine anywhere. As it
was clear to him that he had been handicapped by his early environment, so now
he perceived that she was similarly handicapped. She had not had a chance to
expand. The books on her father&rsquo;s shelves, the paintings on the walls,
the music on the piano&mdash;all was just so much meretricious display. To real
literature, real painting, real music, the Morses and their kind, were dead.
And bigger than such things was life, of which they were densely, hopelessly
ignorant. In spite of their Unitarian proclivities and their masks of
conservative broadmindedness, they were two generations behind interpretative
science: their mental processes were mediaeval, while their thinking on the
ultimate data of existence and of the universe struck him as the same
metaphysical method that was as young as the youngest race, as old as the
cave-man, and older&mdash;the same that moved the first Pleistocene ape-man to
fear the dark; that moved the first hasty Hebrew savage to incarnate Eve from
Adam&rsquo;s rib; that moved Descartes to build an idealistic system of the
universe out of the projections of his own puny ego; and that moved the famous
British ecclesiastic to denounce evolution in satire so scathing as to win
immediate applause and leave his name a notorious scrawl on the page of
history.
</p>

<p>
So Martin thought, and he thought further, till it dawned upon him that the
difference between these lawyers, officers, business men, and bank cashiers he
had met and the members of the working class he had known was on a par with the
difference in the food they ate, clothes they wore, neighborhoods in which they
lived. Certainly, in all of them was lacking the something more which he found
in himself and in the books. The Morses had shown him the best their social
position could produce, and he was not impressed by it. A pauper himself, a
slave to the money-lender, he knew himself the superior of those he met at the
Morses&rsquo;; and, when his one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn, he
moved among them a lord of life, quivering with a sense of outrage akin to what
a prince would suffer if condemned to live with goat-herds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You hate and fear the socialists,&rdquo; he remarked to Mr. Morse, one
evening at dinner; &ldquo;but why? You know neither them nor their
doctrines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The conversation had been swung in that direction by Mrs. Morse, who had been
invidiously singing the praises of Mr. Hapgood. The cashier was Martin&rsquo;s
black beast, and his temper was a trifle short where the talker of platitudes
was concerned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;Charley Hapgood is what they call a
rising young man&mdash;somebody told me as much. And it is true. He&rsquo;ll
make the Governor&rsquo;s Chair before he dies, and, who knows? maybe the
United States Senate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; Mrs. Morse had inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard him make a campaign speech. It was so cleverly stupid
and unoriginal, and also so convincing, that the leaders cannot help but regard
him as safe and sure, while his platitudes are so much like the platitudes of
the average voter that&mdash;oh, well, you know you flatter any man by dressing
up his own thoughts for him and presenting them to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I actually think you are jealous of Mr. Hapgood,&rdquo; Ruth had chimed
in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The look of horror on Martin&rsquo;s face stirred Mrs. Morse to belligerence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t mean to say that Mr. Hapgood is stupid?&rdquo;
she demanded icily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more than the average Republican,&rdquo; was the retort, &ldquo;or
average Democrat, either. They are all stupid when they are not crafty, and
very few of them are crafty. The only wise Republicans are the millionnaires
and their conscious henchmen. They know which side their bread is buttered on,
and they know why.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am a Republican,&rdquo; Mr. Morse put in lightly. &ldquo;Pray, how do
you classify me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you are an unconscious henchman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Henchman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, yes. You do corporation work. You have no working-class nor
criminal practice. You don&rsquo;t depend upon wife-beaters and pickpockets for
your income. You get your livelihood from the masters of society, and whoever
feeds a man is that man&rsquo;s master. Yes, you are a henchman. You are
interested in advancing the interests of the aggregations of capital you
serve.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Morse&rsquo;s face was a trifle red.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I confess, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you talk like a scoundrelly
socialist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then it was that Martin made his remark:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You hate and fear the socialists; but why? You know neither them nor
their doctrines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your doctrine certainly sounds like socialism,&rdquo; Mr. Morse replied,
while Ruth gazed anxiously from one to the other, and Mrs. Morse beamed happily
at the opportunity afforded of rousing her liege lord&rsquo;s antagonism.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I say Republicans are stupid, and hold that liberty, equality,
and fraternity are exploded bubbles, does not make me a socialist,&rdquo;
Martin said with a smile. &ldquo;Because I question Jefferson and the
unscientific Frenchmen who informed his mind, does not make me a socialist.
Believe me, Mr. Morse, you are far nearer socialism than I who am its avowed
enemy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you please to be facetious,&rdquo; was all the other could say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all. I speak in all seriousness. You still believe in equality,
and yet you do the work of the corporations, and the corporations, from day to
day, are busily engaged in burying equality. And you call me a socialist
because I deny equality, because I affirm just what you live up to. The
Republicans are foes to equality, though most of them fight the battle against
equality with the very word itself the slogan on their lips. In the name of
equality they destroy equality. That was why I called them stupid. As for
myself, I am an individualist. I believe the race is to the swift, the battle
to the strong. Such is the lesson I have learned from biology, or at least
think I have learned. As I said, I am an individualist, and individualism is
the hereditary and eternal foe of socialism.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you frequent socialist meetings,&rdquo; Mr. Morse challenged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, just as spies frequent hostile camps. How else are you to
learn about the enemy? Besides, I enjoy myself at their meetings. They are good
fighters, and, right or wrong, they have read the books. Any one of them knows
far more about sociology and all the other ologies than the average captain of
industry. Yes, I have been to half a dozen of their meetings, but that
doesn&rsquo;t make me a socialist any more than hearing Charley Hapgood orate
made me a Republican.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; Mr. Morse said feebly, &ldquo;but I still
believe you incline that way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bless me, Martin thought to himself, he doesn&rsquo;t know what I was talking
about. He hasn&rsquo;t understood a word of it. What did he do with his
education, anyway?
</p>

<p>
Thus, in his development, Martin found himself face to face with economic
morality, or the morality of class; and soon it became to him a grisly monster.
Personally, he was an intellectual moralist, and more offending to him than
platitudinous pomposity was the morality of those about him, which was a
curious hotchpotch of the economic, the metaphysical, the sentimental, and the
imitative.
</p>

<p>
A sample of this curious messy mixture he encountered nearer home. His sister
Marian had been keeping company with an industrious young mechanic, of German
extraction, who, after thoroughly learning the trade, had set up for himself in
a bicycle-repair shop. Also, having got the agency for a low-grade make of
wheel, he was prosperous. Marian had called on Martin in his room a short time
before to announce her engagement, during which visit she had playfully
inspected Martin&rsquo;s palm and told his fortune. On her next visit she
brought Hermann von Schmidt along with her. Martin did the honors and
congratulated both of them in language so easy and graceful as to affect
disagreeably the peasant-mind of his sister&rsquo;s lover. This bad impression
was further heightened by Martin&rsquo;s reading aloud the half-dozen stanzas
of verse with which he had commemorated Marian&rsquo;s previous visit. It was a
bit of society verse, airy and delicate, which he had named &ldquo;The
Palmist.&rdquo; He was surprised, when he finished reading it, to note no
enjoyment in his sister&rsquo;s face. Instead, her eyes were fixed anxiously
upon her betrothed, and Martin, following her gaze, saw spread on that
worthy&rsquo;s asymmetrical features nothing but black and sullen disapproval.
The incident passed over, they made an early departure, and Martin forgot all
about it, though for the moment he had been puzzled that any woman, even of the
working class, should not have been flattered and delighted by having poetry
written about her.
</p>

<p>
Several evenings later Marian again visited him, this time alone. Nor did she
waste time in coming to the point, upbraiding him sorrowfully for what he had
done.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Marian,&rdquo; he chided, &ldquo;you talk as though you were
ashamed of your relatives, or of your brother at any rate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I am, too,&rdquo; she blurted out.
</p>

<p>
Martin was bewildered by the tears of mortification he saw in her eyes. The
mood, whatever it was, was genuine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Marian, why should your Hermann be jealous of my writing poetry
about my own sister?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t jealous,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;He says it was
indecent, ob&mdash;obscene.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin emitted a long, low whistle of incredulity, then proceeded to resurrect
and read a carbon copy of &ldquo;The Palmist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; he said finally, proffering the manuscript
to her. &ldquo;Read it yourself and show me whatever strikes you as
obscene&mdash;that was the word, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says so, and he ought to know,&rdquo; was the answer, with a wave
aside of the manuscript, accompanied by a look of loathing. &ldquo;And he says
you&rsquo;ve got to tear it up. He says he won&rsquo;t have no wife of his with
such things written about her which anybody can read. He says it&rsquo;s a
disgrace, an&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, look here, Marian, this is nothing but nonsense,&rdquo; Martin
began; then abruptly changed his mind.
</p>

<p>
He saw before him an unhappy girl, knew the futility of attempting to convince
her husband or her, and, though the whole situation was absurd and
preposterous, he resolved to surrender.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he announced, tearing the manuscript into half a dozen
pieces and throwing it into the waste-basket.
</p>

<p>
He contented himself with the knowledge that even then the original
type-written manuscript was reposing in the office of a New York magazine.
Marian and her husband would never know, and neither himself nor they nor the
world would lose if the pretty, harmless poem ever were published.
</p>

<p>
Marian, starting to reach into the waste-basket, refrained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
He nodded his head, regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the torn pieces
of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her jacket&mdash;ocular
evidence of the success of her mission. She reminded him of Lizzie Connolly,
though there was less of fire and gorgeous flaunting life in her than in that
other girl of the working class whom he had seen twice. But they were on a par,
the pair of them, in dress and carriage, and he smiled with inward amusement at
the caprice of his fancy which suggested the appearance of either of them in
Mrs. Morse&rsquo;s drawing-room. The amusement faded, and he was aware of a
great loneliness. This sister of his and the Morse drawing-room were milestones
of the road he had travelled. And he had left them behind. He glanced
affectionately about him at his few books. They were all the comrades left to
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he demanded in startled surprise.
</p>

<p>
Marian repeated her question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I go to work?&rdquo; He broke into a laugh that was only
half-hearted. &ldquo;That Hermann of yours has been talking to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; he commanded, and the nod of her head affirmed
his charge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you tell that Hermann of yours to mind his own business; that when
I write poetry about the girl he&rsquo;s keeping company with it&rsquo;s his
business, but that outside of that he&rsquo;s got no say so. Understand?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll succeed as a writer, eh?&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m no good?&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve fallen down
and am a disgrace to the family?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it would be much better if you got a job,&rdquo; she said
firmly, and he saw she was sincere. &ldquo;Hermann says&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn Hermann!&rdquo; he broke out good-naturedly. &ldquo;What I want to
know is when you&rsquo;re going to get married. Also, you find out from your
Hermann if he will deign to permit you to accept a wedding present from
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He mused over the incident after she had gone, and once or twice broke out into
laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her betrothed, all the
members of his own class and the members of Ruth&rsquo;s class, directing their
narrow little lives by narrow little formulas&mdash;herd-creatures, flocking
together and patterning their lives by one another&rsquo;s opinions, failing of
being individuals and of really living life because of the childlike formulas
by which they were enslaved. He summoned them before him in apparitional
procession: Bernard Higginbotham arm in arm with Mr. Butler, Hermann von
Schmidt cheek by jowl with Charley Hapgood, and one by one and in pairs he
judged them and dismissed them&mdash;judged them by the standards of intellect
and morality he had learned from the books. Vainly he asked: Where are the
great souls, the great men and women? He found them not among the careless,
gross, and stupid intelligences that answered the call of vision to his narrow
room. He felt a loathing for them such as Circe must have felt for her swine.
When he had dismissed the last one and thought himself alone, a late-comer
entered, unexpected and unsummoned. Martin watched him and saw the stiff-rim,
the square-cut, double-breasted coat and the swaggering shoulders, of the
youthful hoodlum who had once been he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were like all the rest, young fellow,&rdquo; Martin sneered.
&ldquo;Your morality and your knowledge were just the same as theirs. You did
not think and act for yourself. Your opinions, like your clothes, were ready
made; your acts were shaped by popular approval. You were cock of your gang
because others acclaimed you the real thing. You fought and ruled the gang, not
because you liked to,&mdash;you know you really despised it,&mdash;but because
the other fellows patted you on the shoulder. You licked Cheese-Face because
you wouldn&rsquo;t give in, and you wouldn&rsquo;t give in partly because you
were an abysmal brute and for the rest because you believed what every one
about you believed, that the measure of manhood was the carnivorous ferocity
displayed in injuring and marring fellow-creatures&rsquo; anatomies. Why, you
whelp, you even won other fellows&rsquo; girls away from them, not because you
wanted the girls, but because in the marrow of those about you, those who set
your moral pace, was the instinct of the wild stallion and the bull-seal. Well,
the years have passed, and what do you think about it now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As if in reply, the vision underwent a swift metamorphosis. The stiff-rim and
the square-cut vanished, being replaced by milder garments; the toughness went
out of the face, the hardness out of the eyes; and, the face, chastened and
refined, was irradiated from an inner life of communion with beauty and
knowledge. The apparition was very like his present self, and, as he regarded
it, he noted the student-lamp by which it was illuminated, and the book over
which it pored. He glanced at the title and read, &ldquo;The Science of
Æsthetics.&rdquo; Next, he entered into the apparition, trimmed the
student-lamp, and himself went on reading &ldquo;The Science of
Æsthetics.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap30"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p>
On a beautiful fall day, a day of similar Indian summer to that which had seen
their love declared the year before, Martin read his &ldquo;Love-cycle&rdquo;
to Ruth. It was in the afternoon, and, as before, they had ridden out to their
favorite knoll in the hills. Now and again she had interrupted his reading with
exclamations of pleasure, and now, as he laid the last sheet of manuscript with
its fellows, he waited her judgment.
</p>

<p>
She delayed to speak, and at last she spoke haltingly, hesitating to frame in
words the harshness of her thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think they are beautiful, very beautiful,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but
you can&rsquo;t sell them, can you? You see what I mean,&rdquo; she said,
almost pleaded. &ldquo;This writing of yours is not practical. Something is the
matter&mdash;maybe it is with the market&mdash;that prevents you from earning a
living by it. And please, dear, don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I am flattered,
and made proud, and all that&mdash;I could not be a true woman were it
otherwise&mdash;that you should write these poems to me. But they do not make
our marriage possible. Don&rsquo;t you see, Martin? Don&rsquo;t think me
mercenary. It is love, the thought of our future, with which I am burdened. A
whole year has gone by since we learned we loved each other, and our wedding
day is no nearer. Don&rsquo;t think me immodest in thus talking about our
wedding, for really I have my heart, all that I am, at stake. Why don&rsquo;t
you try to get work on a newspaper, if you are so bound up in your writing? Why
not become a reporter?&mdash;for a while, at least?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would spoil my style,&rdquo; was his answer, in a low, monotonous
voice. &ldquo;You have no idea how I&rsquo;ve worked for style.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But those storiettes,&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;You called them
hack-work. You wrote many of them. Didn&rsquo;t they spoil your style?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, the cases are different. The storiettes were ground out, jaded, at
the end of a long day of application to style. But a reporter&rsquo;s work is
all hack from morning till night, is the one paramount thing of life. And it is
a whirlwind life, the life of the moment, with neither past nor future, and
certainly without thought of any style but reportorial style, and that
certainly is not literature. To become a reporter now, just as my style is
taking form, crystallizing, would be to commit literary suicide. As it is,
every storiette, every word of every storiette, was a violation of myself, of
my self-respect, of my respect for beauty. I tell you it was sickening. I was
guilty of sin. And I was secretly glad when the markets failed, even if my
clothes did go into pawn. But the joy of writing the &lsquo;Love-cycle&rsquo;!
The creative joy in its noblest form! That was compensation for
everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin did not know that Ruth was unsympathetic concerning the creative joy.
She used the phrase&mdash;it was on her lips he had first heard it. She had
read about it, studied about it, in the university in the course of earning her
Bachelorship of Arts; but she was not original, not creative, and all
manifestations of culture on her part were but harpings of the harpings of
others.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May not the editor have been right in his revision of your &lsquo;Sea
Lyrics&rsquo;?&rdquo; she questioned. &ldquo;Remember, an editor must have
proved qualifications or else he would not be an editor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s in line with the persistence of the established,&rdquo; he
rejoined, his heat against the editor-folk getting the better of him.
&ldquo;What is, is not only right, but is the best possible. The existence of
anything is sufficient vindication of its fitness to exist&mdash;to exist, mark
you, as the average person unconsciously believes, not merely in present
conditions, but in all conditions. It is their ignorance, of course, that makes
them believe such rot&mdash;their ignorance, which is nothing more nor less
than the henidical mental process described by Weininger. They think they
think, and such thinkless creatures are the arbiters of the lives of the few
who really think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused, overcome by the consciousness that he had been talking over
Ruth&rsquo;s head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know who this Weininger is,&rdquo; she
retorted. &ldquo;And you are so dreadfully general that I fail to follow you.
What I was speaking of was the qualification of editors&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;The chief
qualification of ninety-nine per cent of all editors is failure. They have
failed as writers. Don&rsquo;t think they prefer the drudgery of the desk and
the slavery to their circulation and to the business manager to the joy of
writing. They have tried to write, and they have failed. And right there is the
cursed paradox of it. Every portal to success in literature is guarded by those
watch-dogs, the failures in literature. The editors, sub-editors, associate
editors, most of them, and the manuscript-readers for the magazines and
book-publishers, most of them, nearly all of them, are men who wanted to write
and who have failed. And yet they, of all creatures under the sun the most
unfit, are the very creatures who decide what shall and what shall not find its
way into print&mdash;they, who have proved themselves not original, who have
demonstrated that they lack the divine fire, sit in judgment upon originality
and genius. And after them come the reviewers, just so many more failures.
Don&rsquo;t tell me that they have not dreamed the dream and attempted to write
poetry or fiction; for they have, and they have failed. Why, the average review
is more nauseating than cod-liver oil. But you know my opinion on the reviewers
and the alleged critics. There are great critics, but they are as rare as
comets. If I fail as a writer, I shall have proved for the career of
editorship. There&rsquo;s bread and butter and jam, at any rate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth&rsquo;s mind was quick, and her disapproval of her lover&rsquo;s views was
buttressed by the contradiction she found in his contention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Martin, if that be so, if all the doors are closed as you have
shown so conclusively, how is it possible that any of the great writers ever
arrived?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They arrived by achieving the impossible,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;They did such blazing, glorious work as to burn to ashes those that
opposed them. They arrived by course of miracle, by winning a thousand-to-one
wager against them. They arrived because they were Carlyle&rsquo;s
battle-scarred giants who will not be kept down. And that is what I must do; I
must achieve the impossible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you fail? You must consider me as well, Martin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I fail?&rdquo; He regarded her for a moment as though the thought she
had uttered was unthinkable. Then intelligence illumined his eyes. &ldquo;If I
fail, I shall become an editor, and you will be an editor&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She frowned at his facetiousness&mdash;a pretty, adorable frown that made him
put his arm around her and kiss it away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; she urged, by an effort of will
withdrawing herself from the fascination of his strength. &ldquo;I have talked
with father and mother. I never before asserted myself so against them. I
demanded to be heard. I was very undutiful. They are against you, you know; but
I assured them over and over of my abiding love for you, and at last father
agreed that if you wanted to, you could begin right away in his office. And
then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you enough at the start so that
we could get married and have a little cottage somewhere. Which I think was
very fine of him&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin, with the dull pain of despair at his heart, mechanically reaching for
the tobacco and paper (which he no longer carried) to roll a cigarette,
muttered something inarticulate, and Ruth went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Frankly, though, and don&rsquo;t let it hurt you&mdash;I tell you, to
show you precisely how you stand with him&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t like your
radical views, and he thinks you are lazy. Of course I know you are not. I know
you work hard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
How hard, even she did not know, was the thought in Martin&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how about my views? Do you think they
are so radical?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held her eyes and waited the answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think them, well, very disconcerting,&rdquo; she replied.
</p>

<p>
The question was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the grayness of
life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made for him to go to
work. And she, having gone as far as she dared, was willing to wait the answer
till she should bring the question up again.
</p>

<p>
She had not long to wait. Martin had a question of his own to propound to her.
He wanted to ascertain the measure of her faith in him, and within the week
each was answered. Martin precipitated it by reading to her his &ldquo;The
Shame of the Sun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you become a reporter?&rdquo; she asked when he had
finished. &ldquo;You love writing so, and I am sure you would succeed. You
could rise in journalism and make a name for yourself. There are a number of
great special correspondents. Their salaries are large, and their field is the
world. They are sent everywhere, to the heart of Africa, like Stanley, or to
interview the Pope, or to explore unknown Thibet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t like my essay?&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;You
believe that I have some show in journalism but none in literature?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; I do like it. It reads well. But I am afraid it&rsquo;s over the
heads of your readers. At least it is over mine. It sounds beautiful, but I
don&rsquo;t understand it. Your scientific slang is beyond me. You are an
extremist, you know, dear, and what may be intelligible to you may not be
intelligible to the rest of us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I imagine it&rsquo;s the philosophic slang that bothers you,&rdquo; was
all he could say.
</p>

<p>
He was flaming from the fresh reading of the ripest thought he had expressed,
and her verdict stunned him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No matter how poorly it is done,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you see anything in it?&mdash;in the thought of it, I mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it is so different from anything I have read. I read Maeterlinck and
understand him&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His mysticism, you understand that?&rdquo; Martin flashed out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but this of yours, which is supposed to be an attack upon him, I
don&rsquo;t understand. Of course, if originality counts&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stopped her with an impatient gesture that was not followed by speech. He
became suddenly aware that she was speaking and that she had been speaking for
some time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, your writing has been a toy to you,&rdquo; she was saying.
&ldquo;Surely you have played with it long enough. It is time to take up life
seriously&mdash;<i>our</i> life, Martin. Hitherto you have lived solely your
own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want me to go to work?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Father has offered&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand all that,&rdquo; he broke in; &ldquo;but what I want to
know is whether or not you have lost faith in me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pressed his hand mutely, her eyes dim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In your writing, dear,&rdquo; she admitted in a half-whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read lots of my stuff,&rdquo; he went on brutally.
&ldquo;What do you think of it? Is it utterly hopeless? How does it compare
with other men&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But they sell theirs, and you&mdash;don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t answer my question. Do you think that literature is
not at all my vocation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I will answer.&rdquo; She steeled herself to do it. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think you were made to write. Forgive me, dear. You compel me to
say it; and you know I know more about literature than you do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you are a Bachelor of Arts,&rdquo; he said meditatively; &ldquo;and
you ought to know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there is more to be said,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause painful
to both. &ldquo;I know what I have in me. No one knows that so well as I. I
know I shall succeed. I will not be kept down. I am afire with what I have to
say in verse, and fiction, and essay. I do not ask you to have faith in that,
though. I do not ask you to have faith in me, nor in my writing. What I do ask
of you is to love me and have faith in love.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A year ago I begged for two years. One of those years is yet to run. And
I do believe, upon my honor and my soul, that before that year is run I shall
have succeeded. You remember what you told me long ago, that I must serve my
apprenticeship to writing. Well, I have served it. I have crammed it and
telescoped it. With you at the end awaiting me, I have never shirked. Do you
know, I have forgotten what it is to fall peacefully asleep. A few million
years ago I knew what it was to sleep my fill and to awake naturally from very
glut of sleep. I am awakened always now by an alarm clock. If I fall asleep
early or late, I set the alarm accordingly; and this, and the putting out of
the lamp, are my last conscious actions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I begin to feel drowsy, I change the heavy book I am reading for a
lighter one. And when I doze over that, I beat my head with my knuckles in
order to drive sleep away. Somewhere I read of a man who was afraid to sleep.
Kipling wrote the story. This man arranged a spur so that when unconsciousness
came, his naked body pressed against the iron teeth. Well, I&rsquo;ve done the
same. I look at the time, and I resolve that not until midnight, or not until
one o&rsquo;clock, or two o&rsquo;clock, or three o&rsquo;clock, shall the spur
be removed. And so it rowels me awake until the appointed time. That spur has
been my bed-mate for months. I have grown so desperate that five and a half
hours of sleep is an extravagance. I sleep four hours now. I am starved for
sleep. There are times when I am light-headed from want of sleep, times when
death, with its rest and sleep, is a positive lure to me, times when I am
haunted by Longfellow&rsquo;s lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;&lsquo;The sea is still and deep;<br />
All things within its bosom sleep;<br />
A single step and all is o&rsquo;er,<br />
A plunge, a bubble, and no more.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, this is sheer nonsense. It comes from nervousness, from an
overwrought mind. But the point is: Why have I done this? For you. To shorten
my apprenticeship. To compel Success to hasten. And my apprenticeship is now
served. I know my equipment. I swear that I learn more each month than the
average college man learns in a year. I know it, I tell you. But were my need
for you to understand not so desperate I should not tell you. It is not
boasting. I measure the results by the books. Your brothers, to-day, are
ignorant barbarians compared with me and the knowledge I have wrung from the
books in the hours they were sleeping. Long ago I wanted to be famous. I care
very little for fame now. What I want is you; I am more hungry for you than for
food, or clothing, or recognition. I have a dream of laying my head on your
breast and sleeping an aeon or so, and the dream will come true ere another
year is gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His power beat against her, wave upon wave; and in the moment his will opposed
hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him. The strength that
had always poured out from him to her was now flowering in his impassioned
voice, his flashing eyes, and the vigor of life and intellect surging in him.
And in that moment, and for the moment, she was aware of a rift that showed in
her certitude&mdash;a rift through which she caught sight of the real Martin
Eden, splendid and invincible; and as animal-trainers have their moments of
doubt, so she, for the instant, seemed to doubt her power to tame this wild
spirit of a man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; he swept on. &ldquo;You love me. But why do
you love me? The thing in me that compels me to write is the very thing that
draws your love. You love me because I am somehow different from the men you
have known and might have loved. I was not made for the desk and
counting-house, for petty business squabbling, and legal jangling. Make me do
such things, make me like those other men, doing the work they do, breathing
the air they breathe, developing the point of view they have developed, and you
have destroyed the difference, destroyed me, destroyed the thing you love. My
desire to write is the most vital thing in me. Had I been a mere clod, neither
would I have desired to write, nor would you have desired me for a
husband.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you forget,&rdquo; she interrupted, the quick surface of her mind
glimpsing a parallel. &ldquo;There have been eccentric inventors, starving
their families while they sought such chimeras as perpetual motion. Doubtless
their wives loved them, and suffered with them and for them, not because of but
in spite of their infatuation for perpetual motion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But there have been inventors who
were not eccentric and who starved while they sought to invent practical
things; and sometimes, it is recorded, they succeeded. Certainly I do not seek
any impossibilities&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have called it &lsquo;achieving the impossible,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
interpolated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I spoke figuratively. I seek to do what men have done before me&mdash;to
write and to live by my writing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her silence spurred him on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To you, then, my goal is as much a chimera as perpetual motion?&rdquo;
he demanded.
</p>

<p>
He read her answer in the pressure of her hand on his&mdash;the pitying
mother-hand for the hurt child. And to her, just then, he was the hurt child,
the infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible.
</p>

<p>
Toward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism of her
father and mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you love me?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do! I do!&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I love you, not them, and nothing they do can hurt me.&rdquo;
Triumph sounded in his voice. &ldquo;For I have faith in your love, not fear of
their enmity. All things may go astray in this world, but not love. Love cannot
go wrong unless it be a weakling that faints and stumbles by the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p>
Martin had encountered his sister Gertrude by chance on Broadway&mdash;as it
proved, a most propitious yet disconcerting chance. Waiting on the corner for a
car, she had seen him first, and noted the eager, hungry lines of his face and
the desperate, worried look of his eyes. In truth, he was desperate and
worried. He had just come from a fruitless interview with the pawnbroker, from
whom he had tried to wring an additional loan on his wheel. The muddy fall
weather having come on, Martin had pledged his wheel some time since and
retained his black suit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the black suit,&rdquo; the pawnbroker, who knew his every
asset, had answered. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve gone and
pledged it with that Jew, Lipka. Because if you have&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man had looked the threat, and Martin hastened to cry:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no; I&rsquo;ve got it. But I want to wear it on a matter of
business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the mollified usurer had replied. &ldquo;And I want it
on a matter of business before I can let you have any more money. You
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m in it for my health?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a forty-dollar wheel, in good condition,&rdquo; Martin
had argued. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve only let me have seven dollars on it. No,
not even seven. Six and a quarter; you took the interest in advance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you want some more, bring the suit,&rdquo; had been the reply that
sent Martin out of the stuffy little den, so desperate at heart as to reflect
it in his face and touch his sister to pity.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had they met when the Telegraph Avenue car came along and stopped to
take on a crowd of afternoon shoppers. Mrs. Higginbotham divined from the grip
on her arm as he helped her on, that he was not going to follow her. She turned
on the step and looked down upon him. His haggard face smote her to the heart
again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked
</p>

<p>
The next moment she had descended to his side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking&mdash;exercise, you know,&rdquo; he explained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go along for a few blocks,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;Mebbe it&rsquo;ll do me good. I ain&rsquo;t ben feelin&rsquo; any too
spry these last few days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general slovenly
appearance, in the unhealthy fat, in the drooping shoulders, the tired face
with the sagging lines, and in the heavy fall of her feet, without
elasticity&mdash;a very caricature of the walk that belongs to a free and happy
body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stop here,&rdquo; he said, though she had already
come to a halt at the first corner, &ldquo;and take the next car.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My goodness!&mdash;if I ain&rsquo;t all tired a&rsquo;ready!&rdquo; she
panted. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m just as able to walk as you in them soles.
They&rsquo;re that thin they&rsquo;ll bu&rsquo;st long before you git out to
North Oakland.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a better pair at home,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come out to dinner to-morrow,&rdquo; she invited irrelevantly.
&ldquo;Mr. Higginbotham won&rsquo;t be there. He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to San
Leandro on business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head, but he had failed to keep back the wolfish, hungry look
that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a penny, Mart, and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re
walkin&rsquo;. Exercise!&rdquo; She tried to sniff contemptuously, but
succeeded in producing only a sniffle. &ldquo;Here, lemme see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And, fumbling in her satchel, she pressed a five-dollar piece into his hand.
&ldquo;I guess I forgot your last birthday, Mart,&rdquo; she mumbled lamely.
</p>

<p>
Martin&rsquo;s hand instinctively closed on the piece of gold. In the same
instant he knew he ought not to accept, and found himself struggling in the
throes of indecision. That bit of gold meant food, life, and light in his body
and brain, power to go on writing, and&mdash;who was to say?&mdash;maybe to
write something that would bring in many pieces of gold. Clear on his vision
burned the manuscripts of two essays he had just completed. He saw them under
the table on top of the heap of returned manuscripts for which he had no
stamps, and he saw their titles, just as he had typed them&mdash;&ldquo;The
High Priests of Mystery,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Cradle of Beauty.&rdquo; He had
never submitted them anywhere. They were as good as anything he had done in
that line. If only he had stamps for them! Then the certitude of his ultimate
success rose up in him, an able ally of hunger, and with a quick movement he
slipped the coin into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you back, Gertrude, a hundred times over,&rdquo; he
gulped out, his throat painfully contracted and in his eyes a swift hint of
moisture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mark my words!&rdquo; he cried with abrupt positiveness. &ldquo;Before
the year is out I&rsquo;ll put an even hundred of those little yellow-boys into
your hand. I don&rsquo;t ask you to believe me. All you have to do is wait and
see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nor did she believe. Her incredulity made her uncomfortable, and failing of
other expedient, she said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re hungry, Mart. It&rsquo;s sticking out all over you.
Come in to meals any time. I&rsquo;ll send one of the children to tell you when
Mr. Higginbotham ain&rsquo;t to be there. An&rsquo; Mart&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He waited, though he knew in his secret heart what she was about to say, so
visible was her thought process to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s about time you got a job?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll win out?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody has faith in me, Gertrude, except myself.&rdquo; His voice was
passionately rebellious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done good work already, plenty of
it, and sooner or later it will sell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know it is good?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; He faltered as the whole vast field of literature
and the history of literature stirred in his brain and pointed the futility of
his attempting to convey to her the reasons for his faith. &ldquo;Well, because
it&rsquo;s better than ninety-nine per cent of what is published in the
magazines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d listen to reason,&rdquo; she answered feebly,
but with unwavering belief in the correctness of her diagnosis of what was
ailing him. &ldquo;I wish&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d listen to reason,&rdquo; she
repeated, &ldquo;an&rsquo; come to dinner to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After Martin had helped her on the car, he hurried to the post-office and
invested three of the five dollars in stamps; and when, later in the day, on
the way to the Morse home, he stopped in at the post-office to weigh a large
number of long, bulky envelopes, he affixed to them all the stamps save three
of the two-cent denomination.
</p>

<p>
It proved a momentous night for Martin, for after dinner he met Russ
Brissenden. How he chanced to come there, whose friend he was or what
acquaintance brought him, Martin did not know. Nor had he the curiosity to
inquire about him of Ruth. In short, Brissenden struck Martin as anaemic and
feather-brained, and was promptly dismissed from his mind. An hour later he
decided that Brissenden was a boor as well, what of the way he prowled about
from one room to another, staring at the pictures or poking his nose into books
and magazines he picked up from the table or drew from the shelves. Though a
stranger in the house he finally isolated himself in the midst of the company,
huddling into a capacious Morris chair and reading steadily from a thin volume
he had drawn from his pocket. As he read, he abstractedly ran his fingers, with
a caressing movement, through his hair. Martin noticed him no more that
evening, except once when he observed him chaffing with great apparent success
with several of the young women.
</p>

<p>
It chanced that when Martin was leaving, he overtook Brissenden already half
down the walk to the street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, is that you?&rdquo; Martin said.
</p>

<p>
The other replied with an ungracious grunt, but swung alongside. Martin made no
further attempt at conversation, and for several blocks unbroken silence lay
upon them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pompous old ass!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The suddenness and the virulence of the exclamation startled Martin. He felt
amused, and at the same time was aware of a growing dislike for the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you go to such a place for?&rdquo; was abruptly flung at him
after another block of silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you?&rdquo; Martin countered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless me, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; came back. &ldquo;At least this is
my first indiscretion. There are twenty-four hours in each day, and I must
spend them somehow. Come and have a drink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Martin answered.
</p>

<p>
The next moment he was nonplussed by the readiness of his acceptance. At home
was several hours&rsquo; hack-work waiting for him before he went to bed, and
after he went to bed there was a volume of Weismann waiting for him, to say
nothing of Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s Autobiography, which was as replete for him
with romance as any thrilling novel. Why should he waste any time with this man
he did not like? was his thought. And yet, it was not so much the man nor the
drink as was it what was associated with the drink&mdash;the bright lights, the
mirrors and dazzling array of glasses, the warm and glowing faces and the
resonant hum of the voices of men. That was it, it was the voices of men,
optimistic men, men who breathed success and spent their money for drinks like
men. He was lonely, that was what was the matter with him; that was why he had
snapped at the invitation as a bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook. Not
since with Joe, at Shelly Hot Springs, with the one exception of the wine he
took with the Portuguese grocer, had Martin had a drink at a public bar. Mental
exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor such as physical exhaustion
did, and he had felt no need for it. But just now he felt desire for the drink,
or, rather, for the atmosphere wherein drinks were dispensed and disposed of.
Such a place was the Grotto, where Brissenden and he lounged in capacious
leather chairs and drank Scotch and soda.
</p>

<p>
They talked. They talked about many things, and now Brissenden and now Martin
took turn in ordering Scotch and soda. Martin, who was extremely strong-headed,
marvelled at the other&rsquo;s capacity for liquor, and ever and anon broke off
to marvel at the other&rsquo;s conversation. He was not long in assuming that
Brissenden knew everything, and in deciding that here was the second
intellectual man he had met. But he noted that Brissenden had what Professor
Caldwell lacked&mdash;namely, fire, the flashing insight and perception, the
flaming uncontrol of genius. Living language flowed from him. His thin lips,
like the dies of a machine, stamped out phrases that cut and stung; or again,
pursing caressingly about the inchoate sound they articulated, the thin lips
shaped soft and velvety things, mellow phrases of glow and glory, of haunting
beauty, reverberant of the mystery and inscrutableness of life; and yet again
the thin lips were like a bugle, from which rang the crash and tumult of cosmic
strife, phrases that sounded clear as silver, that were luminous as starry
spaces, that epitomized the final word of science and yet said something
more&mdash;the poet&rsquo;s word, the transcendental truth, elusive and without
words which could express, and which none the less found expression in the
subtle and all but ungraspable connotations of common words. He, by some wonder
of vision, saw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism, where was no language
for narration, and yet, by some golden miracle of speech, investing known words
with unknown significances, he conveyed to Martin&rsquo;s consciousness
messages that were incommunicable to ordinary souls.
</p>

<p>
Martin forgot his first impression of dislike. Here was the best the books had
to offer coming true. Here was an intelligence, a living man for him to look up
to. &ldquo;I am down in the dirt at your feet,&rdquo; Martin repeated to
himself again and again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve studied biology,&rdquo; he said aloud, in significant
allusion.
</p>

<p>
To his surprise Brissenden shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you are stating truths that are substantiated only by
biology,&rdquo; Martin insisted, and was rewarded by a blank stare. &ldquo;Your
conclusions are in line with the books which you must have read.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;That my smattering
of knowledge should enable me to short-cut my way to truth is most reassuring.
As for myself, I never bother to find out if I am right or not. It is all
valueless anyway. Man can never know the ultimate verities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a disciple of Spencer!&rdquo; Martin cried triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read him since adolescence, and all I read then was his
&lsquo;Education.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could gather knowledge as carelessly,&rdquo; Martin broke out
half an hour later. He had been closely analyzing Brissenden&rsquo;s mental
equipment. &ldquo;You are a sheer dogmatist, and that&rsquo;s what makes it so
marvellous. You state dogmatically the latest facts which science has been able
to establish only by <i>&agrave; posteriori</i> reasoning. You jump at correct
conclusions. You certainly short-cut with a vengeance. You feel your way with
the speed of light, by some hyperrational process, to truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that was what used to bother Father Joseph, and Brother
Dutton,&rdquo; Brissenden replied. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I am
not anything. It was a lucky trick of fate that sent me to a Catholic college
for my education. Where did you pick up what you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And while Martin told him, he was busy studying Brissenden, ranging from a
long, lean, aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the overcoat on a
neighboring chair, its pockets sagged and bulged by the freightage of many
books. Brissenden&rsquo;s face and long, slender hands were browned by the
sun&mdash;excessively browned, Martin thought. This sunburn bothered Martin. It
was patent that Brissenden was no outdoor man. Then how had he been ravaged by
the sun? Something morbid and significant attached to that sunburn, was
Martin&rsquo;s thought as he returned to a study of the face, narrow, with high
cheek-bones and cavernous hollows, and graced with as delicate and fine an
aquiline nose as Martin had ever seen. There was nothing remarkable about the
size of the eyes. They were neither large nor small, while their color was a
nondescript brown; but in them smouldered a fire, or, rather, lurked an
expression dual and strangely contradictory. Defiant, indomitable, even harsh
to excess, they at the same time aroused pity. Martin found himself pitying him
he knew not why, though he was soon to learn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a lunger,&rdquo; Brissenden announced, offhand, a little
later, having already stated that he came from Arizona. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
down there a couple of years living on the climate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid to venture it up in this climate?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was no special emphasis of his repetition of Martin&rsquo;s word. But
Martin saw in that ascetic face the advertisement that there was nothing of
which it was afraid. The eyes had narrowed till they were eagle-like, and
Martin almost caught his breath as he noted the eagle beak with its dilated
nostrils, defiant, assertive, aggressive. Magnificent, was what he commented to
himself, his blood thrilling at the sight. Aloud, he quoted:-
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Under the bludgeoning of Chance<br />
    My head is bloody but unbowed.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You like Henley,&rdquo; Brissenden said, his expression changing swiftly
to large graciousness and tenderness. &ldquo;Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t have
expected anything else of you. Ah, Henley! A brave soul. He stands out among
contemporary rhymesters&mdash;magazine rhymesters&mdash;as a gladiator stands
out in the midst of a band of eunuchs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the magazines,&rdquo; Martin softly impeached.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; was snarled back at him so savagely as to startle him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I write, or, rather, try to write, for the magazines,&rdquo;
Martin faltered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; was the mollified rejoinder. &ldquo;You try
to write, but you don&rsquo;t succeed. I respect and admire your failure. I
know what you write. I can see it with half an eye, and there&rsquo;s one
ingredient in it that shuts it out of the magazines. It&rsquo;s guts, and
magazines have no use for that particular commodity. What they want is
wish-wash and slush, and God knows they get it, but not from you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not above hack-work,&rdquo; Martin contended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary&mdash;&rdquo; Brissenden paused and ran an insolent eye
over Martin&rsquo;s objective poverty, passing from the well-worn tie and the
saw-edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat and on to the slight fray of
one cuff, winding up and dwelling upon Martin&rsquo;s sunken cheeks. &ldquo;On
the contrary, hack-work is above you, so far above you that you can never hope
to rise to it. Why, man, I could insult you by asking you to have something to
eat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin felt the heat in his face of the involuntary blood, and Brissenden
laughed triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A full man is not insulted by such an invitation,&rdquo; he concluded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a devil,&rdquo; Martin cried irritably.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t ask you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that. I invite you now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brissenden half rose from his chair as he spoke, as if with the intention of
departing to the restaurant forthwith.
</p>

<p>
Martin&rsquo;s fists were tight-clenched, and his blood was drumming in his
temples.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bosco! He eats &rsquo;em alive! Eats &rsquo;em alive!&rdquo; Brissenden
exclaimed, imitating the <i>spieler</i> of a locally famous snake-eater.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could certainly eat you alive,&rdquo; Martin said, in turn running
insolent eyes over the other&rsquo;s disease-ravaged frame.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only I&rsquo;m not worthy of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Martin considered, &ldquo;because the incident
is not worthy.&rdquo; He broke into a laugh, hearty and wholesome. &ldquo;I
confess you made a fool of me, Brissenden. That I am hungry and you are aware
of it are only ordinary phenomena, and there&rsquo;s no disgrace. You see, I
laugh at the conventional little moralities of the herd; then you drift by, say
a sharp, true word, and immediately I am the slave of the same little
moralities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were insulted,&rdquo; Brissenden affirmed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I certainly was, a moment ago. The prejudice of early youth, you know. I
learned such things then, and they cheapen what I have since learned. They are
the skeletons in my particular closet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got the door shut on them now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I certainly have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go and get something to eat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you,&rdquo; Martin answered, attempting to pay for the
current Scotch and soda with the last change from his two dollars and seeing
the waiter bullied by Brissenden into putting that change back on the table.
</p>

<p>
Martin pocketed it with a grimace, and felt for a moment the kindly weight of
Brissenden&rsquo;s hand upon his shoulder.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p>
Promptly, the next afternoon, Maria was excited by Martin&rsquo;s second
visitor. But she did not lose her head this time, for she seated Brissenden in
her parlor&rsquo;s grandeur of respectability.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hope you don&rsquo;t mind my coming?&rdquo; Brissenden began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, not at all,&rdquo; Martin answered, shaking hands and waving him
to the solitary chair, himself taking to the bed. &ldquo;But how did you know
where I lived?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Called up the Morses. Miss Morse answered the &rsquo;phone. And here I
am.&rdquo; He tugged at his coat pocket and flung a thin volume on the table.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a book, by a poet. Read it and keep it.&rdquo; And then,
in reply to Martin&rsquo;s protest: &ldquo;What have I to do with books? I had
another hemorrhage this morning. Got any whiskey? No, of course not. Wait a
minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was off and away. Martin watched his long figure go down the outside steps,
and, on turning to close the gate, noted with a pang the shoulders, which had
once been broad, drawn in now over the collapsed ruin of the chest. Martin got
two tumblers, and fell to reading the book of verse, Henry Vaughn
Marlow&rsquo;s latest collection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No Scotch,&rdquo; Brissenden announced on his return. &ldquo;The beggar
sells nothing but American whiskey. But here&rsquo;s a quart of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send one of the youngsters for lemons, and we&rsquo;ll make a
toddy,&rdquo; Martin offered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what a book like that will earn Marlow?&rdquo; he went on,
holding up the volume in question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly fifty dollars,&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;Though he&rsquo;s
lucky if he pulls even on it, or if he can inveigle a publisher to risk
bringing it out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then one can&rsquo;t make a living out of poetry?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin&rsquo;s tone and face alike showed his dejection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly not. What fool expects to? Out of rhyming, yes. There&rsquo;s
Bruce, and Virginia Spring, and Sedgwick. They do very nicely. But
poetry&mdash;do you know how Vaughn Marlow makes his living?&mdash;teaching in
a boys&rsquo; cramming-joint down in Pennsylvania, and of all private little
hells such a billet is the limit. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade places with him if he
had fifty years of life before him. And yet his work stands out from the ruck
of the contemporary versifiers as a balas ruby among carrots. And the reviews
he gets! Damn them, all of them, the crass manikins!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too much is written by the men who can&rsquo;t write about the men who
do write,&rdquo; Martin concurred. &ldquo;Why, I was appalled at the quantities
of rubbish written about Stevenson and his work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ghouls and harpies!&rdquo; Brissenden snapped out with clicking teeth.
&ldquo;Yes, I know the spawn&mdash;complacently pecking at him for his Father
Damien letter, analyzing him, weighing him&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Measuring him by the yardstick of their own miserable egos,&rdquo;
Martin broke in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it, a good phrase,&mdash;mouthing and besliming the
True, and Beautiful, and Good, and finally patting him on the back and saying,
&lsquo;Good dog, Fido.&rsquo; Faugh! &lsquo;The little chattering daws of
men,&rsquo; Richard Realf called them the night he died.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pecking at star-dust,&rdquo; Martin took up the strain warmly; &ldquo;at
the meteoric flight of the master-men. I once wrote a squib on them&mdash;the
critics, or the reviewers, rather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see it,&rdquo; Brissenden begged eagerly.
</p>

<p>
So Martin unearthed a carbon copy of &ldquo;Star-dust,&rdquo; and during the
reading of it Brissenden chuckled, rubbed his hands, and forgot to sip his
toddy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Strikes me you&rsquo;re a bit of star-dust yourself, flung into a world
of cowled gnomes who cannot see,&rdquo; was his comment at the end of it.
&ldquo;Of course it was snapped up by the first magazine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin ran over the pages of his manuscript book. &ldquo;It has been refused by
twenty-seven of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brissenden essayed a long and hearty laugh, but broke down in a fit of
coughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say, you needn&rsquo;t tell me you haven&rsquo;t tackled poetry,&rdquo;
he gasped. &ldquo;Let me see some of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t read it now,&rdquo; Martin pleaded. &ldquo;I want to talk
with you. I&rsquo;ll make up a bundle and you can take it home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brissenden departed with the &ldquo;Love-cycle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Peri and
the Pearl,&rdquo; returning next day to greet Martin with:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Not only did he assure Martin that he was a poet, but Martin learned that
Brissenden also was one. He was swept off his feet by the other&rsquo;s work,
and astounded that no attempt had been made to publish it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A plague on all their houses!&rdquo; was Brissenden&rsquo;s answer to
Martin&rsquo;s volunteering to market his work for him. &ldquo;Love Beauty for
its own sake,&rdquo; was his counsel, &ldquo;and leave the magazines alone.
Back to your ships and your sea&mdash;that&rsquo;s my advice to you, Martin
Eden. What do you want in these sick and rotten cities of men? You are cutting
your throat every day you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the
needs of magazinedom. What was it you quoted me the other day?&mdash;Oh, yes,
&lsquo;Man, the latest of the ephemera.&rsquo; Well, what do you, the latest of
the ephemera, want with fame? If you got it, it would be poison to you. You are
too simple, too elemental, and too rational, by my faith, to prosper on such
pap. I hope you never do sell a line to the magazines. Beauty is the only
master to serve. Serve her and damn the multitude! Success! What in
hell&rsquo;s success if it isn&rsquo;t right there in your Stevenson sonnet,
which outranks Henley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Apparition,&rsquo; in that
&lsquo;Love-cycle,&rsquo; in those sea-poems?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy, but in the
doing of it. You can&rsquo;t tell me. I know it. You know it. Beauty hurts you.
It is an everlasting pain in you, a wound that does not heal, a knife of flame.
Why should you palter with magazines? Let beauty be your end. Why should you
mint beauty into gold? Anyway, you can&rsquo;t; so there&rsquo;s no use in my
getting excited over it. You can read the magazines for a thousand years and
you won&rsquo;t find the value of one line of Keats. Leave fame and coin alone,
sign away on a ship to-morrow, and go back to your sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not for fame, but for love,&rdquo; Martin laughed. &ldquo;Love seems to
have no place in your Cosmos; in mine, Beauty is the handmaiden of Love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly. &ldquo;You are so young,
Martin boy, so young. You will flutter high, but your wings are of the finest
gauze, dusted with the fairest pigments. Do not scorch them. But of course you
have scorched them already. It required some glorified petticoat to account for
that &lsquo;Love-cycle,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s the shame of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It glorifies love as well as the petticoat,&rdquo; Martin laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The philosophy of madness,&rdquo; was the retort. &ldquo;So have I
assured myself when wandering in hasheesh dreams. But beware. These bourgeois
cities will kill you. Look at that den of traitors where I met you. Dry rot is
no name for it. One can&rsquo;t keep his sanity in such an atmosphere.
It&rsquo;s degrading. There&rsquo;s not one of them who is not degrading, man
and woman, all of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and
artistic impulses of clams&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He broke off suddenly and regarded Martin. Then, with a flash of divination, he
saw the situation. The expression on his face turned to wondering horror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you wrote that tremendous &lsquo;Love-cycle&rsquo; to her&mdash;that
pale, shrivelled, female thing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The next instant Martin&rsquo;s right hand had shot to a throttling clutch on
his throat, and he was being shaken till his teeth rattled. But Martin, looking
into his eyes, saw no fear there,&mdash;naught but a curious and mocking devil.
Martin remembered himself, and flung Brissenden, by the neck, sidelong upon the
bed, at the same moment releasing his hold.
</p>

<p>
Brissenden panted and gasped painfully for a moment, then began to chuckle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You had made me eternally your debtor had you shaken out the
flame,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My nerves are on a hair-trigger these days,&rdquo; Martin apologized.
&ldquo;Hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt you. Here, let me mix a fresh toddy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you young Greek!&rdquo; Brissenden went on. &ldquo;I wonder if you
take just pride in that body of yours. You are devilish strong. You are a young
panther, a lion cub. Well, well, it is you who must pay for that
strength.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Martin asked curiously, passing him a glass.
&ldquo;Here, down this and be good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; Brissenden sipped his toddy and smiled
appreciation of it. &ldquo;Because of the women. They will worry you until you
die, as they have already worried you, or else I was born yesterday. Now
there&rsquo;s no use in your choking me; I&rsquo;m going to have my say. This
is undoubtedly your calf love; but for Beauty&rsquo;s sake show better taste
next time. What under heaven do you want with a daughter of the bourgeoisie?
Leave them alone. Pick out some great, wanton flame of a woman, who laughs at
life and jeers at death and loves one while she may. There are such women, and
they will love you just as readily as any pusillanimous product of bourgeois
sheltered life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pusillanimous?&rdquo; Martin protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just so, pusillanimous; prattling out little moralities that have been
prattled into them, and afraid to live life. They will love you, Martin, but
they will love their little moralities more. What you want is the magnificent
abandon of life, the great free souls, the blazing butterflies and not the
little gray moths. Oh, you will grow tired of them, too, of all the female
things, if you are unlucky enough to live. But you won&rsquo;t live. You
won&rsquo;t go back to your ships and sea; therefore, you&rsquo;ll hang around
these pest-holes of cities until your bones are rotten, and then you&rsquo;ll
die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can lecture me, but you can&rsquo;t make me talk back,&rdquo; Martin
said. &ldquo;After all, you have but the wisdom of your temperament, and the
wisdom of my temperament is just as unimpeachable as yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They disagreed about love, and the magazines, and many things, but they liked
each other, and on Martin&rsquo;s part it was no less than a profound liking.
Day after day they were together, if for no more than the hour Brissenden spent
in Martin&rsquo;s stuffy room. Brissenden never arrived without his quart of
whiskey, and when they dined together down-town, he drank Scotch and soda
throughout the meal. He invariably paid the way for both, and it was through
him that Martin learned the refinements of food, drank his first champagne, and
made acquaintance with Rhenish wines.
</p>

<p>
But Brissenden was always an enigma. With the face of an ascetic, he was, in
all the failing blood of him, a frank voluptuary. He was unafraid to die,
bitter and cynical of all the ways of living; and yet, dying, he loved life, to
the last atom of it. He was possessed by a madness to live, to thrill,
&ldquo;to squirm my little space in the cosmic dust whence I came,&rdquo; as he
phrased it once himself. He had tampered with drugs and done many strange
things in quest of new thrills, new sensations. As he told Martin, he had once
gone three days without water, had done so voluntarily, in order to experience
the exquisite delight of such a thirst assuaged. Who or what he was, Martin
never learned. He was a man without a past, whose future was the imminent grave
and whose present was a bitter fever of living.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<p>
Martin was steadily losing his battle. Economize as he would, the earnings from
hack-work did not balance expenses. Thanksgiving found him with his black suit
in pawn and unable to accept the Morses&rsquo; invitation to dinner. Ruth was
not made happy by his reason for not coming, and the corresponding effect on
him was one of desperation. He told her that he would come, after all; that he
would go over to San Francisco, to the <i>Transcontinental</i> office, collect
the five dollars due him, and with it redeem his suit of clothes.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he borrowed ten cents from Maria. He would have borrowed it, by
preference, from Brissenden, but that erratic individual had disappeared. Two
weeks had passed since Martin had seen him, and he vainly cudgelled his brains
for some cause of offence. The ten cents carried Martin across the ferry to San
Francisco, and as he walked up Market Street he speculated upon his predicament
in case he failed to collect the money. There would then be no way for him to
return to Oakland, and he knew no one in San Francisco from whom to borrow
another ten cents.
</p>

<p>
The door to the <i>Transcontinental</i> office was ajar, and Martin, in the act
of opening it, was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice from within, which
exclaimed:- &ldquo;But that is not the question, Mr. Ford.&rdquo; (Ford, Martin
knew, from his correspondence, to be the editor&rsquo;s name.) &ldquo;The
question is, are you prepared to pay?&mdash;cash, and cash down, I mean? I am
not interested in the prospects of the <i>Transcontinental</i> and what you
expect to make it next year. What I want is to be paid for what I do. And I
tell you, right now, the Christmas <i>Transcontinental</i> don&rsquo;t go to
press till I have the money in my hand. Good day. When you get the money, come
and see me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The door jerked open, and the man flung past Martin, with an angry countenance
and went down the corridor, muttering curses and clenching his fists. Martin
decided not to enter immediately, and lingered in the hallways for a quarter of
an hour. Then he shoved the door open and walked in. It was a new experience,
the first time he had been inside an editorial office. Cards evidently were not
necessary in that office, for the boy carried word to an inner room that there
was a man who wanted to see Mr. Ford. Returning, the boy beckoned him from
halfway across the room and led him to the private office, the editorial
sanctum. Martin&rsquo;s first impression was of the disorder and cluttered
confusion of the room. Next he noticed a bewhiskered, youthful-looking man,
sitting at a roll-top desk, who regarded him curiously. Martin marvelled at the
calm repose of his face. It was evident that the squabble with the printer had
not affected his equanimity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I am Martin Eden,&rdquo; Martin began the conversation.
(&ldquo;And I want my five dollars,&rdquo; was what he would have liked to
say.)
</p>

<p>
But this was his first editor, and under the circumstances he did not desire to
scare him too abruptly. To his surprise, Mr. Ford leaped into the air with a
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; and the next moment, with both hands, was
shaking Martin&rsquo;s hand effusively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say how glad I am to see you, Mr. Eden. Often wondered what
you were like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here he held Martin off at arm&rsquo;s length and ran his beaming eyes over
Martin&rsquo;s second-best suit, which was also his worst suit, and which was
ragged and past repair, though the trousers showed the careful crease he had
put in with Maria&rsquo;s flat-irons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I confess, though, I conceived you to be a much older man than you are.
Your story, you know, showed such breadth, and vigor, such maturity and depth
of thought. A masterpiece, that story&mdash;I knew it when I had read the first
half-dozen lines. Let me tell you how I first read it. But no; first let me
introduce you to the staff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Still talking, Mr. Ford led him into the general office, where he introduced
him to the associate editor, Mr. White, a slender, frail little man whose hand
seemed strangely cold, as if he were suffering from a chill, and whose whiskers
were sparse and silky.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Mr. Ends, Mr. Eden. Mr. Ends is our business manager, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin found himself shaking hands with a cranky-eyed, bald-headed man, whose
face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen of it, for most of
it was covered by a snow-white beard, carefully trimmed&mdash;by his wife, who
did it on Sundays, at which times she also shaved the back of his neck.
</p>

<p>
The three men surrounded Martin, all talking admiringly and at once, until it
seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We often wondered why you didn&rsquo;t call,&rdquo; Mr. White was
saying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have the carfare, and I live across the Bay,&rdquo;
Martin answered bluntly, with the idea of showing them his imperative need for
the money.
</p>

<p>
Surely, he thought to himself, my glad rags in themselves are eloquent
advertisement of my need. Time and again, whenever opportunity offered, he
hinted about the purpose of his business. But his admirers&rsquo; ears were
deaf. They sang his praises, told him what they had thought of his story at
first sight, what they subsequently thought, what their wives and families
thought; but not one hint did they breathe of intention to pay him for it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did I tell you how I first read your story?&rdquo; Mr. Ford said.
&ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t. I was coming west from New York, and when the
train stopped at Ogden, the train-boy on the new run brought aboard the current
number of the <i>Transcontinental</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My God! Martin thought; you can travel in a Pullman while I starve for the
paltry five dollars you owe me. A wave of anger rushed over him. The wrong done
him by the <i>Transcontinental</i> loomed colossal, for strong upon him were
all the dreary months of vain yearning, of hunger and privation, and his
present hunger awoke and gnawed at him, reminding him that he had eaten nothing
since the day before, and little enough then. For the moment he saw red. These
creatures were not even robbers. They were sneak-thieves. By lies and broken
promises they had tricked him out of his story. Well, he would show them. And a
great resolve surged into his will to the effect that he would not leave the
office until he got his money. He remembered, if he did not get it, that there
was no way for him to go back to Oakland. He controlled himself with an effort,
but not before the wolfish expression of his face had awed and perturbed them.
</p>

<p>
They became more voluble than ever. Mr. Ford started anew to tell how he had
first read &ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo; and Mr. Ends at the same time was
striving to repeat his niece&rsquo;s appreciation of &ldquo;The Ring of
Bells,&rdquo; said niece being a school-teacher in Alameda.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I came for,&rdquo; Martin said finally.
&ldquo;To be paid for that story all of you like so well. Five dollars, I
believe, is what you promised me would be paid on publication.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford, with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and happy
acquiescence, started to reach for his pocket, then turned suddenly to Mr.
Ends, and said that he had left his money home. That Mr. Ends resented this,
was patent; and Martin saw the twitch of his arm as if to protect his trousers
pocket. Martin knew that the money was there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Mr. Ends, &ldquo;but I paid the printer not an
hour ago, and he took my ready change. It was careless of me to be so short;
but the bill was not yet due, and the printer&rsquo;s request, as a favor, to
make an immediate advance, was quite unexpected.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both men looked expectantly at Mr. White, but that gentleman laughed and
shrugged his shoulders. His conscience was clean at any rate. He had come into
the <i>Transcontinental</i> to learn magazine-literature, instead of which he
had principally learned finance. The <i>Transcontinental</i> owed him four
months&rsquo; salary, and he knew that the printer must be appeased before the
associate editor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather absurd, Mr. Eden, to have caught us in this
shape,&rdquo; Mr. Ford preambled airily. &ldquo;All carelessness, I assure you.
But I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. We&rsquo;ll mail you a check the
first thing in the morning. You have Mr. Eden&rsquo;s address, haven&rsquo;t
you, Mr. Ends?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yes, Mr. Ends had the address, and the check would be mailed the first thing in
the morning. Martin&rsquo;s knowledge of banks and checks was hazy, but he
could see no reason why they should not give him the check on this day just as
well as on the next.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it is understood, Mr. Eden, that we&rsquo;ll mail you the check
to-morrow?&rdquo; Mr. Ford said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I need the money to-day,&rdquo; Martin answered stolidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The unfortunate circumstances&mdash;if you had chanced here any other
day,&rdquo; Mr. Ford began suavely, only to be interrupted by Mr. Ends, whose
cranky eyes justified themselves in his shortness of temper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Ford has already explained the situation,&rdquo; he said with
asperity. &ldquo;And so have I. The check will be mailed&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I also have explained,&rdquo; Martin broke in, &ldquo;and I have
explained that I want the money to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business manager&rsquo;s
brusqueness, and upon him he kept an alert eye, for it was in that
gentleman&rsquo;s trousers pocket that he divined the
<i>Transcontinental&rsquo;s</i> ready cash was reposing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is too bad&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Ford began.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment, with an impatient movement, Mr. Ends turned as if about to
leave the room. At the same instant Martin sprang for him, clutching him by the
throat with one hand in such fashion that Mr. Ends&rsquo; snow-white beard,
still maintaining its immaculate trimness, pointed ceilingward at an angle of
forty-five degrees. To the horror of Mr. White and Mr. Ford, they saw their
business manager shaken like an Astrakhan rug.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dig up, you venerable discourager of rising young talent!&rdquo; Martin
exhorted. &ldquo;Dig up, or I&rsquo;ll shake it out of you, even if it&rsquo;s
all in nickels.&rdquo; Then, to the two affrighted onlookers: &ldquo;Keep away!
If you interfere, somebody&rsquo;s liable to get hurt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ends was choking, and it was not until the grip on his throat was eased
that he was able to signify his acquiescence in the digging-up programme. All
together, after repeated digs, its trousers pocket yielded four dollars and
fifteen cents.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Inside out with it,&rdquo; Martin commanded.
</p>

<p>
An additional ten cents fell out. Martin counted the result of his raid a
second time to make sure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You next!&rdquo; he shouted at Mr. Ford. &ldquo;I want seventy-five
cents more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ford did not wait, but ransacked his pockets, with the result of sixty
cents.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure that is all?&rdquo; Martin demanded menacingly, possessing himself
of it. &ldquo;What have you got in your vest pockets?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In token of his good faith, Mr. Ford turned two of his pockets inside out. A
strip of cardboard fell to the floor from one of them. He recovered it and was
in the act of returning it, when Martin cried:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;A ferry ticket? Here, give it to me. It&rsquo;s
worth ten cents. I&rsquo;ll credit you with it. I&rsquo;ve now got four dollars
and ninety-five cents, including the ticket. Five cents is still due me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked fiercely at Mr. White, and found that fragile creature in the act of
handing him a nickel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Martin said, addressing them collectively. &ldquo;I
wish you a good day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Robber!&rdquo; Mr. Ends snarled after him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sneak-thief!&rdquo; Martin retorted, slamming the door as he passed out.
</p>

<p>
Martin was elated&mdash;so elated that when he recollected that <i>The
Hornet</i> owed him fifteen dollars for &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl,&rdquo;
he decided forthwith to go and collect it. But <i>The Hornet</i> was run by a
set of clean-shaven, strapping young men, frank buccaneers who robbed
everything and everybody, not excepting one another. After some breakage of the
office furniture, the editor (an ex-college athlete), ably assisted by the
business manager, an advertising agent, and the porter, succeeded in removing
Martin from the office and in accelerating, by initial impulse, his descent of
the first flight of stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come again, Mr. Eden; glad to see you any time,&rdquo; they laughed down
at him from the landing above.
</p>

<p>
Martin grinned as he picked himself up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; he murmured back. &ldquo;The <i>Transcontinental</i> crowd
were nanny-goats, but you fellows are a lot of prize-fighters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
More laughter greeted this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must say, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; the editor of <i>The Hornet</i> called
down, &ldquo;that for a poet you can go some yourself. Where did you learn that
right cross&mdash;if I may ask?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where you learned that half-Nelson,&rdquo; Martin answered.
&ldquo;Anyway, you&rsquo;re going to have a black eye.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope your neck doesn&rsquo;t stiffen up,&rdquo; the editor wished
solicitously: &ldquo;What do you say we all go out and have a drink on
it&mdash;not the neck, of course, but the little rough-house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you if I lose,&rdquo; Martin accepted.
</p>

<p>
And robbers and robbed drank together, amicably agreeing that the battle was to
the strong, and that the fifteen dollars for &ldquo;The Peri and the
Pearl&rdquo; belonged by right to <i>The Hornet&rsquo;s</i> editorial staff.

<h2><a name="chap34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<p>
Arthur remained at the gate while Ruth climbed Maria&rsquo;s front steps. She
heard the rapid click of the type-writer, and when Martin let her in, found him
on the last page of a manuscript. She had come to make certain whether or not
he would be at their table for Thanksgiving dinner; but before she could broach
the subject Martin plunged into the one with which he was full.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, let me read you this,&rdquo; he cried, separating the carbon
copies and running the pages of manuscript into shape. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my
latest, and different from anything I&rsquo;ve done. It is so altogether
different that I am almost afraid of it, and yet I&rsquo;ve a sneaking idea it
is good. You be judge. It&rsquo;s an Hawaiian story. I&rsquo;ve called it
&lsquo;Wiki-wiki.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in the cold
room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting. She listened
closely while he read, and though he from time to time had seen only
disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Frankly, what do you think of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she, answered. &ldquo;Will
it&mdash;do you think it will sell?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; was the confession. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
strong for the magazines. But it&rsquo;s true, on my word it&rsquo;s
true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why do you persist in writing such things when you know they
won&rsquo;t sell?&rdquo; she went on inexorably. &ldquo;The reason for your
writing is to make a living, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right; but the miserable story got away with me. I
couldn&rsquo;t help writing it. It demanded to be written.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that character, that Wiki-Wiki, why do you make him talk so roughly?
Surely it will offend your readers, and surely that is why the editors are
justified in refusing your work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because the real Wiki-Wiki would have talked that way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it is not good taste.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is life,&rdquo; he replied bluntly. &ldquo;It is real. It is true.
And I must write life as I see it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She made no answer, and for an awkward moment they sat silent. It was because
he loved her that he did not quite understand her, and she could not understand
him because he was so large that he bulked beyond her horizon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve collected from the <i>Transcontinental</i>,&rdquo; he
said in an effort to shift the conversation to a more comfortable subject. The
picture of the bewhiskered trio, as he had last seen them, mulcted of four
dollars and ninety cents and a ferry ticket, made him chuckle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; she cried joyously. &ldquo;That was what
I came to find out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come?&rdquo; he muttered absently. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, to dinner to-morrow. You know you said you&rsquo;d recover your
suit if you got that money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I forgot all about it,&rdquo; he said humbly. &ldquo;You see, this
morning the poundman got Maria&rsquo;s two cows and the baby calf,
and&mdash;well, it happened that Maria didn&rsquo;t have any money, and so I
had to recover her cows for her. That&rsquo;s where the <i>Transcontinental</i>
fiver went&mdash;&lsquo;The Ring of Bells&rsquo; went into the poundman&rsquo;s
pocket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked down at his clothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tears of disappointment and reproach glistened in her blue eyes, but she said
nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next Thanksgiving you&rsquo;ll have dinner with me in
Delmonico&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said cheerily; &ldquo;or in London, or Paris, or
anywhere you wish. I know it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw in the paper a few days ago,&rdquo; she announced abruptly,
&ldquo;that there had been several local appointments to the Railway Mail. You
passed first, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was compelled to admit that the call had come for him, but that he had
declined it. &ldquo;I was so sure&mdash;I am so sure&mdash;of myself,&rdquo; he
concluded. &ldquo;A year from now I&rsquo;ll be earning more than a dozen men
in the Railway Mail. You wait and see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was all she said, when he finished. She stood up, pulling at
her gloves. &ldquo;I must go, Martin. Arthur is waiting for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her in his arms and kissed her, but she proved a passive sweetheart.
There was no tenseness in her body, her arms did not go around him, and her
lips met his without their wonted pressure.
</p>

<p>
She was angry with him, he concluded, as he returned from the gate. But why? It
was unfortunate that the poundman had gobbled Maria&rsquo;s cows. But it was
only a stroke of fate. Nobody could be blamed for it. Nor did it enter his head
that he could have done aught otherwise than what he had done. Well, yes, he
was to blame a little, was his next thought, for having refused the call to the
Railway Mail. And she had not liked &ldquo;Wiki-Wiki.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned at the head of the steps to meet the letter-carrier on his afternoon
round. The ever recurrent fever of expectancy assailed Martin as he took the
bundle of long envelopes. One was not long. It was short and thin, and outside
was printed the address of <i>The New York Outview</i>. He paused in the act of
tearing the envelope open. It could not be an acceptance. He had no manuscripts
with that publication. Perhaps&mdash;his heart almost stood still at
the&mdash;wild thought&mdash;perhaps they were ordering an article from him;
but the next instant he dismissed the surmise as hopelessly impossible.
</p>

<p>
It was a short, formal letter, signed by the office editor, merely informing
him that an anonymous letter which they had received was enclosed, and that he
could rest assured the <i>Outview&rsquo;s</i> staff never under any
circumstances gave consideration to anonymous correspondence.
</p>

<p>
The enclosed letter Martin found to be crudely printed by hand. It was a
hotchpotch of illiterate abuse of Martin, and of assertion that the
&ldquo;so-called Martin Eden&rdquo; who was selling stories to magazines was no
writer at all, and that in reality he was stealing stories from old magazines,
typing them, and sending them out as his own. The envelope was postmarked
&ldquo;San Leandro.&rdquo; Martin did not require a second thought to discover
the author. Higginbotham&rsquo;s grammar, Higginbotham&rsquo;s colloquialisms,
Higginbotham&rsquo;s mental quirks and processes, were apparent throughout.
Martin saw in every line, not the fine Italian hand, but the coarse
grocer&rsquo;s fist, of his brother-in-law.
</p>

<p>
But why? he vainly questioned. What injury had he done Bernard Higginbotham?
The thing was so unreasonable, so wanton. There was no explaining it. In the
course of the week a dozen similar letters were forwarded to Martin by the
editors of various Eastern magazines. The editors were behaving handsomely,
Martin concluded. He was wholly unknown to them, yet some of them had even been
sympathetic. It was evident that they detested anonymity. He saw that the
malicious attempt to hurt him had failed. In fact, if anything came of it, it
was bound to be good, for at least his name had been called to the attention of
a number of editors. Sometime, perhaps, reading a submitted manuscript of his,
they might remember him as the fellow about whom they had received an anonymous
letter. And who was to say that such a remembrance might not sway the balance
of their judgment just a trifle in his favor?
</p>

<p>
It was about this time that Martin took a great slump in Maria&rsquo;s
estimation. He found her in the kitchen one morning groaning with pain, tears
of weakness running down her cheeks, vainly endeavoring to put through a large
ironing. He promptly diagnosed her affliction as La Grippe, dosed her with hot
whiskey (the remnants in the bottles for which Brissenden was responsible), and
ordered her to bed. But Maria was refractory. The ironing had to be done, she
protested, and delivered that night, or else there would be no food on the
morrow for the seven small and hungry Silvas.
</p>

<p>
To her astonishment (and it was something that she never ceased from relating
to her dying day), she saw Martin Eden seize an iron from the stove and throw a
fancy shirt-waist on the ironing-board. It was Kate Flanagan&rsquo;s best
Sunday waist, than whom there was no more exacting and fastidiously dressed
woman in Maria&rsquo;s world. Also, Miss Flanagan had sent special instruction
that said waist must be delivered by that night. As every one knew, she was
keeping company with John Collins, the blacksmith, and, as Maria knew privily,
Miss Flanagan and Mr. Collins were going next day to Golden Gate Park. Vain was
Maria&rsquo;s attempt to rescue the garment. Martin guided her tottering
footsteps to a chair, from where she watched him with bulging eyes. In a
quarter of the time it would have taken her she saw the shirt-waist safely
ironed, and ironed as well as she could have done it, as Martin made her grant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could work faster,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;if your irons were only
hotter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To her, the irons he swung were much hotter than she ever dared to use.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your sprinkling is all wrong,&rdquo; he complained next. &ldquo;Here,
let me teach you how to sprinkle. Pressure is what&rsquo;s wanted. Sprinkle
under pressure if you want to iron fast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He procured a packing-case from the woodpile in the cellar, fitted a cover to
it, and raided the scrap-iron the Silva tribe was collecting for the junkman.
With fresh-sprinkled garments in the box, covered with the board and pressed by
the iron, the device was complete and in operation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you watch me, Maria,&rdquo; he said, stripping off to his undershirt
and gripping an iron that was what he called &ldquo;really hot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; when he feenish da iron&rsquo; he washa da wools,&rdquo; as
she described it afterward. &ldquo;He say, &lsquo;Maria, you are da greata
fool. I showa you how to washa da wools,&rsquo; an&rsquo; he shows me, too. Ten
minutes he maka da machine&mdash;one barrel, one wheel-hub, two poles, justa
like dat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin had learned the contrivance from Joe at the Shelly Hot Springs. The old
wheel-hub, fixed on the end of the upright pole, constituted the plunger.
Making this, in turn, fast to the spring-pole attached to the kitchen rafters,
so that the hub played upon the woollens in the barrel, he was able, with one
hand, thoroughly to pound them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more Maria washa da wools,&rdquo; her story always ended. &ldquo;I
maka da kids worka da pole an&rsquo; da hub an&rsquo; da barrel. Him da smarta
man, Mister Eden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, by his masterly operation and improvement of her kitchen-laundry
he fell an immense distance in her regard. The glamour of romance with which
her imagination had invested him faded away in the cold light of fact that he
was an ex-laundryman. All his books, and his grand friends who visited him in
carriages or with countless bottles of whiskey, went for naught. He was, after
all, a mere workingman, a member of her own class and caste. He was more human
and approachable, but, he was no longer mystery.
</p>

<p>
Martin&rsquo;s alienation from his family continued. Following upon Mr.
Higginbotham&rsquo;s unprovoked attack, Mr. Hermann von Schmidt showed his
hand. The fortunate sale of several storiettes, some humorous verse, and a few
jokes gave Martin a temporary splurge of prosperity. Not only did he partially
pay up his bills, but he had sufficient balance left to redeem his black suit
and wheel. The latter, by virtue of a twisted crank-hanger, required repairing,
and, as a matter of friendliness with his future brother-in-law, he sent it to
Von Schmidt&rsquo;s shop.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon of the same day Martin was pleased by the wheel being delivered
by a small boy. Von Schmidt was also inclined to be friendly, was
Martin&rsquo;s conclusion from this unusual favor. Repaired wheels usually had
to be called for. But when he examined the wheel, he discovered no repairs had
been made. A little later in the day he telephoned his sister&rsquo;s
betrothed, and learned that that person didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with
him in &ldquo;any shape, manner, or form.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hermann von Schmidt,&rdquo; Martin answered cheerfully,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to come over and punch that Dutch nose of
yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You come to my shop,&rdquo; came the reply, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
send for the police. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll put you through, too. Oh, I know you,
but you can&rsquo;t make no rough-house with me. I don&rsquo;t want
nothin&rsquo; to do with the likes of you. You&rsquo;re a loafer, that&rsquo;s
what, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t asleep. You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to do no
spongin&rsquo; off me just because I&rsquo;m marryin&rsquo; your sister. Why
don&rsquo;t you go to work an&rsquo; earn an honest livin&rsquo;, eh? Answer me
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin&rsquo;s philosophy asserted itself, dissipating his anger, and he hung
up the receiver with a long whistle of incredulous amusement. But after the
amusement came the reaction, and he was oppressed by his loneliness. Nobody
understood him, nobody seemed to have any use for him, except Brissenden, and
Brissenden had disappeared, God alone knew where.
</p>

<p>
Twilight was falling as Martin left the fruit store and turned homeward, his
marketing on his arm. At the corner an electric car had stopped, and at sight
of a lean, familiar figure alighting, his heart leapt with joy. It was
Brissenden, and in the fleeting glimpse, ere the car started up, Martin noted
the overcoat pockets, one bulging with books, the other bulging with a quart
bottle of whiskey.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<p>
Brissenden gave no explanation of his long absence, nor did Martin pry into it.
He was content to see his friend&rsquo;s cadaverous face opposite him through
the steam rising from a tumbler of toddy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I, too, have not been idle,&rdquo; Brissenden proclaimed, after hearing
Martin&rsquo;s account of the work he had accomplished.
</p>

<p>
He pulled a manuscript from his inside coat pocket and passed it to Martin, who
looked at the title and glanced up curiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Brissenden laughed. &ldquo;Pretty good
title, eh? &lsquo;Ephemera&rsquo;&mdash;it is the one word. And you&rsquo;re
responsible for it, what of your <i>man</i>, who is always the erected, the
vitalized inorganic, the latest of the ephemera, the creature of temperature
strutting his little space on the thermometer. It got into my head and I had to
write it to get rid of it. Tell me what you think of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin&rsquo;s face, flushed at first, paled as he read on. It was perfect art.
Form triumphed over substance, if triumph it could be called where the last
conceivable atom of substance had found expression in so perfect construction
as to make Martin&rsquo;s head swim with delight, to put passionate tears into
his eyes, and to send chills creeping up and down his back. It was a long poem
of six or seven hundred lines, and it was a fantastic, amazing, unearthly
thing. It was terrific, impossible; and yet there it was, scrawled in black ink
across the sheets of paper. It dealt with man and his soul-gropings in their
ultimate terms, plumbing the abysses of space for the testimony of remotest
suns and rainbow spectrums. It was a mad orgy of imagination, wassailing in the
skull of a dying man who half sobbed under his breath and was quick with the
wild flutter of fading heart-beats. The poem swung in majestic rhythm to the
cool tumult of interstellar conflict, to the onset of starry hosts, to the
impact of cold suns and the flaming up of nebulae in the darkened void; and
through it all, unceasing and faint, like a silver shuttle, ran the frail,
piping voice of man, a querulous chirp amid the screaming of planets and the
crash of systems.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing like it in literature,&rdquo; Martin said, when at last
he was able to speak. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful!&mdash;wonderful! It has gone
to my head. I am drunken with it. That great, infinitesimal question&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t shake it out of my thoughts. That questing, eternal, ever
recurring, thin little wailing voice of man is still ringing in my ears. It is
like the dead-march of a gnat amid the trumpeting of elephants and the roaring
of lions. It is insatiable with microscopic desire. I now I&rsquo;m making a
fool of myself, but the thing has obsessed me. You are&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what you are&mdash;you are wonderful, that&rsquo;s all. But how do you do it?
How do you do it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin paused from his rhapsody, only to break out afresh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall never write again. I am a dauber in clay. You have shown me the
work of the real artificer-artisan. Genius! This is something more than genius.
It transcends genius. It is truth gone mad. It is true, man, every line of it.
I wonder if you realize that, you dogmatist. Science cannot give you the lie.
It is the truth of the sneer, stamped out from the black iron of the Cosmos and
interwoven with mighty rhythms of sound into a fabric of splendor and beauty.
And now I won&rsquo;t say another word. I am overwhelmed, crushed. Yes, I will,
too. Let me market it for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brissenden grinned. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a magazine in Christendom that
would dare to publish it&mdash;you know that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know nothing of the sort. I know there&rsquo;s not a magazine in
Christendom that wouldn&rsquo;t jump at it. They don&rsquo;t get things like
that every day. That&rsquo;s no mere poem of the year. It&rsquo;s the poem of
the century.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take you up on the proposition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get cynical,&rdquo; Martin exhorted. &ldquo;The magazine
editors are not wholly fatuous. I know that. And I&rsquo;ll close with you on
the bet. I&rsquo;ll wager anything you want that &lsquo;Ephemera&rsquo; is
accepted either on the first or second offering.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one thing that prevents me from taking you.&rdquo;
Brissenden waited a moment. &ldquo;The thing is big&mdash;the biggest
I&rsquo;ve ever done. I know that. It&rsquo;s my swan song. I am almighty proud
of it. I worship it. It&rsquo;s better than whiskey. It is what I dreamed
of&mdash;the great and perfect thing&mdash;when I was a simple young man, with
sweet illusions and clean ideals. And I&rsquo;ve got it, now, in my last grasp,
and I&rsquo;ll not have it pawed over and soiled by a lot of swine. No, I
won&rsquo;t take the bet. It&rsquo;s mine. I made it, and I&rsquo;ve shared it
with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But think of the rest of the world,&rdquo; Martin protested. &ldquo;The
function of beauty is joy-making.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my beauty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be selfish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not selfish.&rdquo; Brissenden grinned soberly in the way he
had when pleased by the thing his thin lips were about to shape.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as unselfish as a famished hog.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In vain Martin strove to shake him from his decision. Martin told him that his
hatred of the magazines was rabid, fanatical, and that his conduct was a
thousand times more despicable than that of the youth who burned the temple of
Diana at Ephesus. Under the storm of denunciation Brissenden complacently
sipped his toddy and affirmed that everything the other said was quite true,
with the exception of the magazine editors. His hatred of them knew no bounds,
and he excelled Martin in denunciation when he turned upon them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d type it for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know how a
thousand times better than any stenographer. And now I want to give you some
advice.&rdquo; He drew a bulky manuscript from his outside coat pocket.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your &lsquo;Shame of the Sun.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve read it not
once, but twice and three times&mdash;the highest compliment I can pay you.
After what you&rsquo;ve said about &lsquo;Ephemera&rsquo; I must be silent. But
this I will say: when &lsquo;The Shame of the Sun&rsquo; is published, it will
make a hit. It will start a controversy that will be worth thousands to you
just in advertising.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin laughed. &ldquo;I suppose your next advice will be to submit it to the
magazines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By all means no&mdash;that is, if you want to see it in print. Offer it
to the first-class houses. Some publisher&rsquo;s reader may be mad enough or
drunk enough to report favorably on it. You&rsquo;ve read the books. The meat
of them has been transmuted in the alembic of Martin Eden&rsquo;s mind and
poured into &lsquo;The Shame of the Sun,&rsquo; and one day Martin Eden will be
famous, and not the least of his fame will rest upon that work. So you must get
a publisher for it&mdash;the sooner the better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brissenden went home late that night; and just as he mounted the first step of
the car, he swung suddenly back on Martin and thrust into his hand a small,
tightly crumpled wad of paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, take this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was out to the races to-day,
and I had the right dope.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The bell clanged and the car pulled out, leaving Martin wondering as to the
nature of the crinkly, greasy wad he clutched in his hand. Back in his room he
unrolled it and found a hundred-dollar bill.
</p>

<p>
He did not scruple to use it. He knew his friend had always plenty of money,
and he knew also, with profound certitude, that his success would enable him to
repay it. In the morning he paid every bill, gave Maria three months&rsquo;
advance on the room, and redeemed every pledge at the pawnshop. Next he bought
Marian&rsquo;s wedding present, and simpler presents, suitable to Christmas,
for Ruth and Gertrude. And finally, on the balance remaining to him, he herded
the whole Silva tribe down into Oakland. He was a winter late in redeeming his
promise, but redeemed it was, for the last, least Silva got a pair of shoes, as
well as Maria herself. Also, there were horns, and dolls, and toys of various
sorts, and parcels and bundles of candies and nuts that filled the arms of all
the Silvas to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
It was with this extraordinary procession trooping at his and Maria&rsquo;s
heels into a confectioner&rsquo;s in quest of the biggest candy-cane ever made,
that he encountered Ruth and her mother. Mrs. Morse was shocked. Even Ruth was
hurt, for she had some regard for appearances, and her lover, cheek by jowl
with Maria, at the head of that army of Portuguese ragamuffins, was not a
pretty sight. But it was not that which hurt so much as what she took to be his
lack of pride and self-respect. Further, and keenest of all, she read into the
incident the impossibility of his living down his working-class origin. There
was stigma enough in the fact of it, but shamelessly to flaunt it in the face
of the world&mdash;her world&mdash;was going too far. Though her engagement to
Martin had been kept secret, their long intimacy had not been unproductive of
gossip; and in the shop, glancing covertly at her lover and his following, had
been several of her acquaintances. She lacked the easy largeness of Martin and
could not rise superior to her environment. She had been hurt to the quick, and
her sensitive nature was quivering with the shame of it. So it was, when Martin
arrived later in the day, that he kept her present in his breast-pocket,
deferring the giving of it to a more propitious occasion. Ruth in
tears&mdash;passionate, angry tears&mdash;was a revelation to him. The
spectacle of her suffering convinced him that he had been a brute, yet in the
soul of him he could not see how nor why. It never entered his head to be
ashamed of those he knew, and to take the Silvas out to a Christmas treat could
in no way, so it seemed to him, show lack of consideration for Ruth. On the
other hand, he did see Ruth&rsquo;s point of view, after she had explained it;
and he looked upon it as a feminine weakness, such as afflicted all women and
the best of women.

<h2><a name="chap36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you the real dirt,&rdquo; Brissenden said
to him, one evening in January.
</p>

<p>
They had dined together in San Francisco, and were at the Ferry Building,
returning to Oakland, when the whim came to him to show Martin the &ldquo;real
dirt.&rdquo; He turned and fled across the water-front, a meagre shadow in a
flapping overcoat, with Martin straining to keep up with him. At a wholesale
liquor store he bought two gallon-demijohns of old port, and with one in each
hand boarded a Mission Street car, Martin at his heels burdened with several
quart-bottles of whiskey.
</p>

<p>
If Ruth could see me now, was his thought, while he wondered as to what
constituted the real dirt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe nobody will be there,&rdquo; Brissenden said, when they dismounted
and plunged off to the right into the heart of the working-class ghetto, south
of Market Street. &ldquo;In which case you&rsquo;ll miss what you&rsquo;ve been
looking for so long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what the deuce is that?&rdquo; Martin asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Men, intelligent men, and not the gibbering nonentities I found you
consorting with in that trader&rsquo;s den. You read the books and you found
yourself all alone. Well, I&rsquo;m going to show you to-night some other men
who&rsquo;ve read the books, so that you won&rsquo;t be lonely any more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not that I bother my head about their everlasting discussions,&rdquo; he
said at the end of a block. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in book philosophy.
But you&rsquo;ll find these fellows intelligences and not bourgeois swine. But
watch out, they&rsquo;ll talk an arm off of you on any subject under the
sun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hope Norton&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; he panted a little later, resisting
Martin&rsquo;s effort to relieve him of the two demijohns.
&ldquo;Norton&rsquo;s an idealist&mdash;a Harvard man. Prodigious memory.
Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
Father&rsquo;s a railroad president and many times millionnaire, but the
son&rsquo;s starving in &rsquo;Frisco, editing an anarchist sheet for
twenty-five a month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin was little acquainted in San Francisco, and not at all south of Market;
so he had no idea of where he was being led.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;tell me about them beforehand. What do
they do for a living? How do they happen to be here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hope Hamilton&rsquo;s there.&rdquo; Brissenden paused and rested his
hands. &ldquo;Strawn-Hamilton&rsquo;s his name&mdash;hyphenated, you
know&mdash;comes of old Southern stock. He&rsquo;s a tramp&mdash;laziest man I
ever knew, though he&rsquo;s clerking, or trying to, in a socialist
co&ouml;perative store for six dollars a week. But he&rsquo;s a confirmed hobo.
Tramped into town. I&rsquo;ve seen him sit all day on a bench and never a bite
pass his lips, and in the evening, when I invited him to
dinner&mdash;restaurant two blocks away&mdash;have him say, &lsquo;Too much
trouble, old man. Buy me a package of cigarettes instead.&rsquo; He was a
Spencerian like you till Kreis turned him to materialistic monism. I&rsquo;ll
start him on monism if I can. Norton&rsquo;s another monist&mdash;only he
affirms naught but spirit. He can give Kreis and Hamilton all they want,
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is Kreis?&rdquo; Martin asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His rooms we&rsquo;re going to. One time professor&mdash;fired from
university&mdash;usual story. A mind like a steel trap. Makes his living any
old way. I know he&rsquo;s been a street fakir when he was down. Unscrupulous.
Rob a corpse of a shroud&mdash;anything. Difference between him and the
bourgeoisie is that he robs without illusion. He&rsquo;ll talk Nietzsche, or
Schopenhauer, or Kant, or anything, but the only thing in this world, not
excepting Mary, that he really cares for, is his monism. Haeckel is his little
tin god. The only way to insult him is to take a slap at Haeckel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the hang-out.&rdquo; Brissenden rested his demijohn at the
upstairs entrance, preliminary to the climb. It was the usual two-story corner
building, with a saloon and grocery underneath. &ldquo;The gang lives
here&mdash;got the whole upstairs to themselves. But Kreis is the only one who
has two rooms. Come on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No lights burned in the upper hall, but Brissenden threaded the utter blackness
like a familiar ghost. He stopped to speak to Martin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one fellow&mdash;Stevens&mdash;a theosophist. Makes a
pretty tangle when he gets going. Just now he&rsquo;s dish-washer in a
restaurant. Likes a good cigar. I&rsquo;ve seen him eat in a ten-cent
hash-house and pay fifty cents for the cigar he smoked afterward. I&rsquo;ve
got a couple in my pocket for him, if he shows up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another fellow&mdash;Parry&mdash;an Australian, a
statistician and a sporting encyclopaedia. Ask him the grain output of Paraguay
for 1903, or the English importation of sheetings into China for 1890, or at
what weight Jimmy Britt fought Battling Nelson, or who was welter-weight
champion of the United States in &rsquo;68, and you&rsquo;ll get the correct
answer with the automatic celerity of a slot-machine. And there&rsquo;s Andy, a
stone-mason, has ideas on everything, a good chess-player; and another fellow,
Harry, a baker, red hot socialist and strong union man. By the way, you
remember Cooks&rsquo; and Waiters&rsquo; strike&mdash;Hamilton was the chap who
organized that union and precipitated the strike&mdash;planned it all out in
advance, right here in Kreis&rsquo;s rooms. Did it just for the fun of it, but
was too lazy to stay by the union. Yet he could have risen high if he wanted
to. There&rsquo;s no end to the possibilities in that man&mdash;if he
weren&rsquo;t so insuperably lazy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Brissenden advanced through the darkness till a thread of light marked the
threshold of a door. A knock and an answer opened it, and Martin found himself
shaking hands with Kreis, a handsome brunette man, with dazzling white teeth, a
drooping black mustache, and large, flashing black eyes. Mary, a matronly young
blonde, was washing dishes in the little back room that served for kitchen and
dining room. The front room served as bedchamber and living room. Overhead was
the week&rsquo;s washing, hanging in festoons so low that Martin did not see at
first the two men talking in a corner. They hailed Brissenden and his demijohns
with acclamation, and, on being introduced, Martin learned they were Andy and
Parry. He joined them and listened attentively to the description of a
prize-fight Parry had seen the night before; while Brissenden, in his glory,
plunged into the manufacture of a toddy and the serving of wine and
whiskey-and-sodas. At his command, &ldquo;Bring in the clan,&rdquo; Andy
departed to go the round of the rooms for the lodgers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky that most of them are here,&rdquo; Brissenden
whispered to Martin. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Norton and Hamilton; come on and meet
them. Stevens isn&rsquo;t around, I hear. I&rsquo;m going to get them started
on monism if I can. Wait till they get a few jolts in them and they&rsquo;ll
warm up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At first the conversation was desultory. Nevertheless Martin could not fail to
appreciate the keen play of their minds. They were men with opinions, though
the opinions often clashed, and, though they were witty and clever, they were
not superficial. He swiftly saw, no matter upon what they talked, that each man
applied the correlation of knowledge and had also a deep-seated and unified
conception of society and the Cosmos. Nobody manufactured their opinions for
them; they were all rebels of one variety or another, and their lips were
strangers to platitudes. Never had Martin, at the Morses&rsquo;, heard so
amazing a range of topics discussed. There seemed no limit save time to the
things they were alive to. The talk wandered from Mrs. Humphry Ward&rsquo;s new
book to Shaw&rsquo;s latest play, through the future of the drama to
reminiscences of Mansfield. They appreciated or sneered at the morning
editorials, jumped from labor conditions in New Zealand to Henry James and
Brander Matthews, passed on to the German designs in the Far East and the
economic aspect of the Yellow Peril, wrangled over the German elections and
Bebel&rsquo;s last speech, and settled down to local politics, the latest plans
and scandals in the union labor party administration, and the wires that were
pulled to bring about the Coast Seamen&rsquo;s strike. Martin was struck by the
inside knowledge they possessed. They knew what was never printed in the
newspapers&mdash;the wires and strings and the hidden hands that made the
puppets dance. To Martin&rsquo;s surprise, the girl, Mary, joined in the
conversation, displaying an intelligence he had never encountered in the few
women he had met. They talked together on Swinburne and Rossetti, after which
she led him beyond his depth into the by-paths of French literature. His
revenge came when she defended Maeterlinck and he brought into action the
carefully-thought-out thesis of &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Several other men had dropped in, and the air was thick with tobacco smoke,
when Brissenden waved the red flag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s fresh meat for your axe, Kreis,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a
rose-white youth with the ardor of a lover for Herbert Spencer. Make a
Haeckelite of him&mdash;if you can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kreis seemed to wake up and flash like some metallic, magnetic thing, while
Norton looked at Martin sympathetically, with a sweet, girlish smile, as much
as to say that he would be amply protected.
</p>

<p>
Kreis began directly on Martin, but step by step Norton interfered, until he
and Kreis were off and away in a personal battle. Martin listened and fain
would have rubbed his eyes. It was impossible that this should be, much less in
the labor ghetto south of Market. The books were alive in these men. They
talked with fire and enthusiasm, the intellectual stimulant stirring them as he
had seen drink and anger stir other men. What he heard was no longer the
philosophy of the dry, printed word, written by half-mythical demigods like
Kant and Spencer. It was living philosophy, with warm, red blood, incarnated in
these two men till its very features worked with excitement. Now and again
other men joined in, and all followed the discussion with cigarettes going out
in their hands and with alert, intent faces.
</p>

<p>
Idealism had never attracted Martin, but the exposition it now received at the
hands of Norton was a revelation. The logical plausibility of it, that made an
appeal to his intellect, seemed missed by Kreis and Hamilton, who sneered at
Norton as a metaphysician, and who, in turn, sneered back at them as
metaphysicians. <i>Phenomenon</i> and <i>noumenon</i> were bandied back and
forth. They charged him with attempting to explain consciousness by itself. He
charged them with word-jugglery, with reasoning from words to theory instead of
from facts to theory. At this they were aghast. It was the cardinal tenet of
their mode of reasoning to start with facts and to give names to the facts.
</p>

<p>
When Norton wandered into the intricacies of Kant, Kreis reminded him that all
good little German philosophies when they died went to Oxford. A little later
Norton reminded them of Hamilton&rsquo;s Law of Parsimony, the application of
which they immediately claimed for every reasoning process of theirs. And
Martin hugged his knees and exulted in it all. But Norton was no Spencerian,
and he, too, strove for Martin&rsquo;s philosophic soul, talking as much at him
as to his two opponents.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know Berkeley has never been answered,&rdquo; he said, looking
directly at Martin. &ldquo;Herbert Spencer came the nearest, which was not very
near. Even the stanchest of Spencer&rsquo;s followers will not go farther. I
was reading an essay of Saleeby&rsquo;s the other day, and the best Saleeby
could say was that Herbert Spencer <i>nearly</i> succeeded in answering
Berkeley.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know what Hume said?&rdquo; Hamilton asked. Norton nodded, but
Hamilton gave it for the benefit of the rest. &ldquo;He said that
Berkeley&rsquo;s arguments admit of no answer and produce no conviction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In his, Hume&rsquo;s, mind,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;And
Hume&rsquo;s mind was the same as yours, with this difference: he was wise
enough to admit there was no answering Berkeley.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Norton was sensitive and excitable, though he never lost his head, while Kreis
and Hamilton were like a pair of cold-blooded savages, seeking out tender
places to prod and poke. As the evening grew late, Norton, smarting under the
repeated charges of being a metaphysician, clutching his chair to keep from
jumping to his feet, his gray eyes snapping and his girlish face grown harsh
and sure, made a grand attack upon their position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, you Haeckelites, I may reason like a medicine man, but, pray,
how do you reason? You have nothing to stand on, you unscientific dogmatists
with your positive science which you are always lugging about into places it
has no right to be. Long before the school of materialistic monism arose, the
ground was removed so that there could be no foundation. Locke was the man,
John Locke. Two hundred years ago&mdash;more than that, even in his
&lsquo;Essay concerning the Human Understanding,&rsquo; he proved the
non-existence of innate ideas. The best of it is that that is precisely what
you claim. To-night, again and again, you have asserted the non-existence of
innate ideas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what does that mean? It means that you can never know ultimate
reality. Your brains are empty when you are born. Appearances, or phenomena,
are all the content your minds can receive from your five senses. Then noumena,
which are not in your minds when you are born, have no way of getting
in&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I deny&mdash;&rdquo; Kreis started to interrupt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wait till I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; Norton shouted. &ldquo;You can know
only that much of the play and interplay of force and matter as impinges in one
way or another on our senses. You see, I am willing to admit, for the sake of
the argument, that matter exists; and what I am about to do is to efface you by
your own argument. I can&rsquo;t do it any other way, for you are both
congenitally unable to understand a philosophic abstraction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now, what do you know of matter, according to your own positive
science? You know it only by its phenomena, its appearances. You are aware only
of its changes, or of such changes in it as cause changes in your
consciousness. Positive science deals only with phenomena, yet you are foolish
enough to strive to be ontologists and to deal with noumena. Yet, by the very
definition of positive science, science is concerned only with appearances. As
somebody has said, phenomenal knowledge cannot transcend phenomena.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You cannot answer Berkeley, even if you have annihilated Kant, and yet,
perforce, you assume that Berkeley is wrong when you affirm that science proves
the non-existence of God, or, as much to the point, the existence of
matter.&mdash;You know I granted the reality of matter only in order to make
myself intelligible to your understanding. Be positive scientists, if you
please; but ontology has no place in positive science, so leave it alone.
Spencer is right in his agnosticism, but if Spencer&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But it was time to catch the last ferry-boat for Oakland, and Brissenden and
Martin slipped out, leaving Norton still talking and Kreis and Hamilton waiting
to pounce on him like a pair of hounds as soon as he finished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have given me a glimpse of fairyland,&rdquo; Martin said on the
ferry-boat. &ldquo;It makes life worth while to meet people like that. My mind
is all worked up. I never appreciated idealism before. Yet I can&rsquo;t accept
it. I know that I shall always be a realist. I am so made, I guess. But
I&rsquo;d like to have made a reply to Kreis and Hamilton, and I think
I&rsquo;d have had a word or two for Norton. I didn&rsquo;t see that Spencer
was damaged any. I&rsquo;m as excited as a child on its first visit to the
circus. I see I must read up some more. I&rsquo;m going to get hold of Saleeby.
I still think Spencer is unassailable, and next time I&rsquo;m going to take a
hand myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Brissenden, breathing painfully, had dropped off to sleep, his chin buried
in a scarf and resting on his sunken chest, his body wrapped in the long
overcoat and shaking to the vibration of the propellers.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<p>
The first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to
Brissenden&rsquo;s advice and command. &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; he
wrapped and mailed to <i>The Acropolis</i>. He believed he could find magazine
publication for it, and he felt that recognition by the magazines would commend
him to the book-publishing houses. &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; he likewise wrapped
and mailed to a magazine. Despite Brissenden&rsquo;s prejudice against the
magazines, which was a pronounced mania with him, Martin decided that the great
poem should see print. He did not intend, however, to publish it without the
other&rsquo;s permission. His plan was to get it accepted by one of the high
magazines, and, thus armed, again to wrestle with Brissenden for consent.
</p>

<p>
Martin began, that morning, a story which he had sketched out a number of weeks
before and which ever since had been worrying him with its insistent clamor to
be created. Apparently it was to be a rattling sea story, a tale of
twentieth-century adventure and romance, handling real characters, in a real
world, under real conditions. But beneath the swing and go of the story was to
be something else&mdash;something that the superficial reader would never
discern and which, on the other hand, would not diminish in any way the
interest and enjoyment for such a reader. It was this, and not the mere story,
that impelled Martin to write it. For that matter, it was always the great,
universal motif that suggested plots to him. After having found such a motif,
he cast about for the particular persons and particular location in time and
space wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing. &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo;
was the title he had decided for it, and its length he believed would not be
more than sixty thousand words&mdash;a bagatelle for him with his splendid
vigor of production. On this first day he took hold of it with conscious
delight in the mastery of his tools. He no longer worried for fear that the
sharp, cutting edges should slip and mar his work. The long months of intense
application and study had brought their reward. He could now devote himself
with sure hand to the larger phases of the thing he shaped; and as he worked,
hour after hour, he felt, as never before, the sure and cosmic grasp with which
he held life and the affairs of life. &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; would tell a story
that would be true of its particular characters and its particular events; but
it would tell, too, he was confident, great vital things that would be true of
all time, and all sea, and all life&mdash;thanks to Herbert Spencer, he
thought, leaning back for a moment from the table. Ay, thanks to Herbert
Spencer and to the master-key of life, evolution, which Spencer had placed in
his hands.
</p>

<p>
He was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing. &ldquo;It will go! It
will go!&rdquo; was the refrain that kept sounding in his ears. Of course it
would go. At last he was turning out the thing at which the magazines would
jump. The whole story worked out before him in lightning flashes. He broke off
from it long enough to write a paragraph in his note-book. This would be the
last paragraph in &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo;; but so thoroughly was the whole book
already composed in his brain that he could write, weeks before he had arrived
at the end, the end itself. He compared the tale, as yet unwritten, with the
tales of the sea-writers, and he felt it to be immeasurably superior.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one man who could touch it,&rdquo; he murmured aloud,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s Conrad. And it ought to make even him sit up and shake
hands with me, and say, &lsquo;Well done, Martin, my boy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He toiled on all day, recollecting, at the last moment, that he was to have
dinner at the Morses&rsquo;. Thanks to Brissenden, his black suit was out of
pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties. Down town he stopped off
long enough to run into the library and search for Saleeby&rsquo;s books. He
drew out &ldquo;The Cycle of Life,&rdquo; and on the car turned to the essay
Norton had mentioned on Spencer. As Martin read, he grew angry. His face
flushed, his jaw set, and unconsciously his hand clenched, unclenched, and
clenched again as if he were taking fresh grips upon some hateful thing out of
which he was squeezing the life. When he left the car, he strode along the
sidewalk as a wrathful man will stride, and he rang the Morse bell with such
viciousness that it roused him to consciousness of his condition, so that he
entered in good nature, smiling with amusement at himself. No sooner, however,
was he inside than a great depression descended upon him. He fell from the
height where he had been up-borne all day on the wings of inspiration.
&ldquo;Bourgeois,&rdquo; &ldquo;trader&rsquo;s
den&rdquo;&mdash;Brissenden&rsquo;s epithets repeated themselves in his mind.
But what of that? he demanded angrily. He was marrying Ruth, not her family.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that he had never seen Ruth more beautiful, more spiritual and
ethereal and at the same time more healthy. There was color in her cheeks, and
her eyes drew him again and again&mdash;the eyes in which he had first read
immortality. He had forgotten immortality of late, and the trend of his
scientific reading had been away from it; but here, in Ruth&rsquo;s eyes, he
read an argument without words that transcended all worded arguments. He saw
that in her eyes before which all discussion fled away, for he saw love there.
And in his own eyes was love; and love was unanswerable. Such was his
passionate doctrine.
</p>

<p>
The half hour he had with her, before they went in to dinner, left him
supremely happy and supremely satisfied with life. Nevertheless, at table, the
inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the hard day seized hold of
him. He was aware that his eyes were tired and that he was irritable. He
remembered it was at this table, at which he now sneered and was so often
bored, that he had first eaten with civilized beings in what he had imagined
was an atmosphere of high culture and refinement. He caught a glimpse of that
pathetic figure of him, so long ago, a self-conscious savage, sprouting sweat
at every pore in an agony of apprehension, puzzled by the bewildering minutiae
of eating-implements, tortured by the ogre of a servant, striving at a leap to
live at such dizzy social altitude, and deciding in the end to be frankly
himself, pretending no knowledge and no polish he did not possess.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at Ruth for reassurance, much in the same manner that a passenger,
with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck, will strive to locate the life
preservers. Well, that much had come out of it&mdash;love and Ruth. All the
rest had failed to stand the test of the books. But Ruth and love had stood the
test; for them he found a biological sanction. Love was the most exalted
expression of life. Nature had been busy designing him, as she had been busy
with all normal men, for the purpose of loving. She had spent ten thousand
centuries&mdash;ay, a hundred thousand and a million centuries&mdash;upon the
task, and he was the best she could do. She had made love the strongest thing
in him, increased its power a myriad per cent with her gift of imagination, and
sent him forth into the ephemera to thrill and melt and mate. His hand sought
Ruth&rsquo;s hand beside him hidden by the table, and a warm pressure was given
and received. She looked at him a swift instant, and her eyes were radiant and
melting. So were his in the thrill that pervaded him; nor did he realize how
much that was radiant and melting in her eyes had been aroused by what she had
seen in his.
</p>

<p>
Across the table from him, cater-cornered, at Mr. Morse&rsquo;s right, sat
Judge Blount, a local superior court judge. Martin had met him a number of
times and had failed to like him. He and Ruth&rsquo;s father were discussing
labor union politics, the local situation, and socialism, and Mr. Morse was
endeavoring to twit Martin on the latter topic. At last Judge Blount looked
across the table with benignant and fatherly pity. Martin smiled to himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll grow out of it, young man,&rdquo; he said soothingly.
&ldquo;Time is the best cure for such youthful distempers.&rdquo; He turned to
Mr. Morse. &ldquo;I do not believe discussion is good in such cases. It makes
the patient obstinate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; the other assented gravely. &ldquo;But it is well
to warn the patient occasionally of his condition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin laughed merrily, but it was with an effort. The day had been too long,
the day&rsquo;s effort too intense, and he was deep in the throes of the
reaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Undoubtedly you are both excellent doctors,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
if you care a whit for the opinion of the patient, let him tell you that you
are poor diagnosticians. In fact, you are both suffering from the disease you
think you find in me. As for me, I am immune. The socialist philosophy that
riots half-baked in your veins has passed me by.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Clever, clever,&rdquo; murmured the judge. &ldquo;An excellent ruse in
controversy, to reverse positions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out of your mouth.&rdquo; Martin&rsquo;s eyes were sparkling, but he
kept control of himself. &ldquo;You see, Judge, I&rsquo;ve heard your campaign
speeches. By some henidical process&mdash;henidical, by the way is a favorite
word of mine which nobody understands&mdash;by some henidical process you
persuade yourself that you believe in the competitive system and the survival
of the strong, and at the same time you indorse with might and main all sorts
of measures to shear the strength from the strong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My young man&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember, I&rsquo;ve heard your campaign speeches,&rdquo; Martin warned.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on record, your position on interstate commerce regulation,
on regulation of the railway trust and Standard Oil, on the conservation of the
forests, on a thousand and one restrictive measures that are nothing else than
socialistic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that you do not believe in regulating these
various outrageous exercises of power?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point. I mean to tell you that you are a poor
diagnostician. I mean to tell you that I am not suffering from the microbe of
socialism. I mean to tell you that it is you who are suffering from the
emasculating ravages of that same microbe. As for me, I am an inveterate
opponent of socialism just as I am an inveterate opponent of your own mongrel
democracy that is nothing else than pseudo-socialism masquerading under a garb
of words that will not stand the test of the dictionary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am a reactionary&mdash;so complete a reactionary that my position is
incomprehensible to you who live in a veiled lie of social organization and
whose sight is not keen enough to pierce the veil. You make believe that you
believe in the survival of the strong and the rule of the strong. I believe.
That is the difference. When I was a trifle younger,&mdash;a few months
younger,&mdash;I believed the same thing. You see, the ideas of you and yours
had impressed me. But merchants and traders are cowardly rulers at best; they
grunt and grub all their days in the trough of money-getting, and I have swung
back to aristocracy, if you please. I am the only individualist in this room. I
look to the state for nothing. I look only to the strong man, the man on
horseback, to save the state from its own rotten futility.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nietzsche was right. I won&rsquo;t take the time to tell you who
Nietzsche was, but he was right. The world belongs to the strong&mdash;to the
strong who are noble as well and who do not wallow in the swine-trough of trade
and exchange. The world belongs to the true nobleman, to the great blond
beasts, to the noncompromisers, to the &lsquo;yes-sayers.&rsquo; And they will
eat you up, you socialists&mdash;who are afraid of socialism and who think
yourselves individualists. Your slave-morality of the meek and lowly will never
save you.&mdash;Oh, it&rsquo;s all Greek, I know, and I won&rsquo;t bother you
any more with it. But remember one thing. There aren&rsquo;t half a dozen
individualists in Oakland, but Martin Eden is one of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He signified that he was done with the discussion, and turned to Ruth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrought up to-day,&rdquo; he said in an undertone. &ldquo;All
I want to do is to love, not talk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He ignored Mr. Morse, who said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am unconvinced. All socialists are Jesuits. That is the way to tell
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a good Republican out of you yet,&rdquo; said Judge
Blount.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The man on horseback will arrive before that time,&rdquo; Martin
retorted with good humor, and returned to Ruth.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Morse was not content. He did not like the laziness and the
disinclination for sober, legitimate work of this prospective son-in-law of
his, for whose ideas he had no respect and of whose nature he had no
understanding. So he turned the conversation to Herbert Spencer. Judge Blount
ably seconded him, and Martin, whose ears had pricked at the first mention of
the philosopher&rsquo;s name, listened to the judge enunciate a grave and
complacent diatribe against Spencer. From time to time Mr. Morse glanced at
Martin, as much as to say, &ldquo;There, my boy, you see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chattering daws,&rdquo; Martin muttered under his breath, and went on
talking with Ruth and Arthur.
</p>

<p>
But the long day and the &ldquo;real dirt&rdquo; of the night before were
telling upon him; and, besides, still in his burnt mind was what had made him
angry when he read it on the car.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Ruth asked suddenly alarmed by the effort he
was making to contain himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is its
prophet,&rdquo; Judge Blount was saying at that moment.
</p>

<p>
Martin turned upon him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A cheap judgment,&rdquo; he remarked quietly. &ldquo;I heard it first in
the City Hall Park, on the lips of a workingman who ought to have known better.
I have heard it often since, and each time the clap-trap of it nauseates me.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. To hear that great and noble man&rsquo;s
name upon your lips is like finding a dew-drop in a cesspool. You are
disgusting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was like a thunderbolt. Judge Blount glared at him with apoplectic
countenance, and silence reigned. Mr. Morse was secretly pleased. He could see
that his daughter was shocked. It was what he wanted to do&mdash;to bring out
the innate ruffianism of this man he did not like.
</p>

<p>
Ruth&rsquo;s hand sought Martin&rsquo;s beseechingly under the table, but his
blood was up. He was inflamed by the intellectual pretence and fraud of those
who sat in the high places. A Superior Court Judge! It was only several years
before that he had looked up from the mire at such glorious entities and deemed
them gods.
</p>

<p>
Judge Blount recovered himself and attempted to go on, addressing himself to
Martin with an assumption of politeness that the latter understood was for the
benefit of the ladies. Even this added to his anger. Was there no honesty in
the world?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t discuss Spencer with me,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You do
not know any more about Spencer than do his own countrymen. But it is no fault
of yours, I grant. It is just a phase of the contemptible ignorance of the
times. I ran across a sample of it on my way here this evening. I was reading
an essay by Saleeby on Spencer. You should read it. It is accessible to all
men. You can buy it in any book-store or draw it from the public library. You
would feel ashamed of your paucity of abuse and ignorance of that noble man
compared with what Saleeby has collected on the subject. It is a record of
shame that would shame your shame.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The philosopher of the half-educated,&rsquo; he was called by an
academic Philosopher who was not worthy to pollute the atmosphere he breathed.
I don&rsquo;t think you have read ten pages of Spencer, but there have been
critics, assumably more intelligent than you, who have read no more than you of
Spencer, who publicly challenged his followers to adduce one single idea from
all his writings&mdash;from Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s writings, the man who has
impressed the stamp of his genius over the whole field of scientific research
and modern thought; the father of psychology; the man who revolutionized
pedagogy, so that to-day the child of the French peasant is taught the three
R&rsquo;s according to principles laid down by him. And the little gnats of men
sting his memory when they get their very bread and butter from the technical
application of his ideas. What little of worth resides in their brains is
largely due to him. It is certain that had he never lived, most of what is
correct in their parrot-learned knowledge would be absent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And yet a man like Principal Fairbanks of Oxford&mdash;a man who sits in
an even higher place than you, Judge Blount&mdash;has said that Spencer will be
dismissed by posterity as a poet and dreamer rather than a thinker. Yappers and
blatherskites, the whole brood of them! &lsquo;&ldquo;First Principles&rdquo;
is not wholly destitute of a certain literary power,&rsquo; said one of them.
And others of them have said that he was an industrious plodder rather than an
original thinker. Yappers and blatherskites! Yappers and blatherskites!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin ceased abruptly, in a dead silence. Everybody in Ruth&rsquo;s family
looked up to Judge Blount as a man of power and achievement, and they were
horrified at Martin&rsquo;s outbreak. The remainder of the dinner passed like a
funeral, the judge and Mr. Morse confining their talk to each other, and the
rest of the conversation being extremely desultory. Then afterward, when Ruth
and Martin were alone, there was a scene.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are unbearable,&rdquo; she wept.
</p>

<p>
But his anger still smouldered, and he kept muttering, &ldquo;The beasts! The
beasts!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When she averred he had insulted the judge, he retorted:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By telling the truth about him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether it was true or not,&rdquo; she insisted.
&ldquo;There are certain bounds of decency, and you had no license to insult
anybody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then where did Judge Blount get the license to assault truth?&rdquo;
Martin demanded. &ldquo;Surely to assault truth is a more serious misdemeanor
than to insult a pygmy personality such as the judge&rsquo;s. He did worse than
that. He blackened the name of a great, noble man who is dead. Oh, the beasts!
The beasts!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His complex anger flamed afresh, and Ruth was in terror of him. Never had she
seen him so angry, and it was all mystified and unreasonable to her
comprehension. And yet, through her very terror ran the fibres of fascination
that had drawn and that still drew her to him&mdash;that had compelled her to
lean towards him, and, in that mad, culminating moment, lay her hands upon his
neck. She was hurt and outraged by what had taken place, and yet she lay in his
arms and quivered while he went on muttering, &ldquo;The beasts! The
beasts!&rdquo; And she still lay there when he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
bother your table again, dear. They do not like me, and it is wrong of me to
thrust my objectionable presence upon them. Besides, they are just as
objectionable to me. Faugh! They are sickening. And to think of it, I dreamed
in my innocence that the persons who sat in the high places, who lived in fine
houses and had educations and bank accounts, were worth while!&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go down to the local.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So spoke Brissenden, faint from a hemorrhage of half an hour before&mdash;the
second hemorrhage in three days. The perennial whiskey glass was in his hands,
and he drained it with shaking fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do I want with socialism?&rdquo; Martin demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Outsiders are allowed five-minute speeches,&rdquo; the sick man urged.
&ldquo;Get up and spout. Tell them why you don&rsquo;t want socialism. Tell
them what you think about them and their ghetto ethics. Slam Nietzsche into
them and get walloped for your pains. Make a scrap of it. It will do them good.
Discussion is what they want, and what you want, too. You see, I&rsquo;d like
to see you a socialist before I&rsquo;m gone. It will give you a sanction for
your existence. It is the one thing that will save you in the time of
disappointment that is coming to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never can puzzle out why you, of all men, are a socialist,&rdquo;
Martin pondered. &ldquo;You detest the crowd so. Surely there is nothing in the
canaille to recommend it to your aesthetic soul.&rdquo; He pointed an accusing
finger at the whiskey glass which the other was refilling. &ldquo;Socialism
doesn&rsquo;t seem to save you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sick,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;With you it is
different. You have health and much to live for, and you must be handcuffed to
life somehow. As for me, you wonder why I am a socialist. I&rsquo;ll tell you.
It is because Socialism is inevitable; because the present rotten and
irrational system cannot endure; because the day is past for your man on
horseback. The slaves won&rsquo;t stand for it. They are too many, and
willy-nilly they&rsquo;ll drag down the would-be equestrian before ever he gets
astride. You can&rsquo;t get away from them, and you&rsquo;ll have to swallow
the whole slave-morality. It&rsquo;s not a nice mess, I&rsquo;ll allow. But
it&rsquo;s been a-brewing and swallow it you must. You are antediluvian anyway,
with your Nietzsche ideas. The past is past, and the man who says history
repeats itself is a liar. Of course I don&rsquo;t like the crowd, but
what&rsquo;s a poor chap to do? We can&rsquo;t have the man on horseback, and
anything is preferable to the timid swine that now rule. But come on, anyway.
I&rsquo;m loaded to the guards now, and if I sit here any longer, I&rsquo;ll
get drunk. And you know the doctor says&mdash;damn the doctor! I&rsquo;ll fool
him yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was Sunday night, and they found the small hall packed by the Oakland
socialists, chiefly members of the working class. The speaker, a clever Jew,
won Martin&rsquo;s admiration at the same time that he aroused his antagonism.
The man&rsquo;s stooped and narrow shoulders and weazened chest proclaimed him
the true child of the crowded ghetto, and strong on Martin was the age-long
struggle of the feeble, wretched slaves against the lordly handful of men who
had ruled over them and would rule over them to the end of time. To Martin this
withered wisp of a creature was a symbol. He was the figure that stood forth
representative of the whole miserable mass of weaklings and inefficients who
perished according to biological law on the ragged confines of life. They were
the unfit. In spite of their cunning philosophy and of their antlike
proclivities for co&ouml;peration, Nature rejected them for the exceptional
man. Out of the plentiful spawn of life she flung from her prolific hand she
selected only the best. It was by the same method that men, aping her, bred
race-horses and cucumbers. Doubtless, a creator of a Cosmos could have devised
a better method; but creatures of this particular Cosmos must put up with this
particular method. Of course, they could squirm as they perished, as the
socialists squirmed, as the speaker on the platform and the perspiring crowd
were squirming even now as they counselled together for some new device with
which to minimize the penalties of living and outwit the Cosmos.
</p>

<p>
So Martin thought, and so he spoke when Brissenden urged him to give them hell.
He obeyed the mandate, walking up to the platform, as was the custom, and
addressing the chairman. He began in a low voice, haltingly, forming into order
the ideas which had surged in his brain while the Jew was speaking. In such
meetings five minutes was the time allotted to each speaker; but when
Martin&rsquo;s five minutes were up, he was in full stride, his attack upon
their doctrines but half completed. He had caught their interest, and the
audience urged the chairman by acclamation to extend Martin&rsquo;s time. They
appreciated him as a foeman worthy of their intellect, and they listened
intently, following every word. He spoke with fire and conviction, mincing no
words in his attack upon the slaves and their morality and tactics and frankly
alluding to his hearers as the slaves in question. He quoted Spencer and
Malthus, and enunciated the biological law of development.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he concluded, in a swift résumé, &ldquo;no
state composed of the slave-types can endure. The old law of development still
holds. In the struggle for existence, as I have shown, the strong and the
progeny of the strong tend to survive, while the weak and the progeny of the
weak are crushed and tend to perish. The result is that the strong and the
progeny of the strong survive, and, so long as the struggle obtains, the
strength of each generation increases. That is development. But you
slaves&mdash;it is too bad to be slaves, I grant&mdash;but you slaves dream of
a society where the law of development will be annulled, where no weaklings and
inefficients will perish, where every inefficient will have as much as he wants
to eat as many times a day as he desires, and where all will marry and have
progeny&mdash;the weak as well as the strong. What will be the result? No
longer will the strength and life-value of each generation increase. On the
contrary, it will diminish. There is the Nemesis of your slave philosophy. Your
society of slaves&mdash;of, by, and for, slaves&mdash;must inevitably weaken
and go to pieces as the life which composes it weakens and goes to pieces.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember, I am enunciating biology and not sentimental ethics. No state
of slaves can stand&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about the United States?&rdquo; a man yelled from the audience.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how about it?&rdquo; Martin retorted. &ldquo;The thirteen colonies
threw off their rulers and formed the Republic so-called. The slaves were their
own masters. There were no more masters of the sword. But you couldn&rsquo;t
get along without masters of some sort, and there arose a new set of
masters&mdash;not the great, virile, noble men, but the shrewd and spidery
traders and money-lenders. And they enslaved you over again&mdash;but not
frankly, as the true, noble men would do with weight of their own right arms,
but secretly, by spidery machinations and by wheedling and cajolery and lies.
They have purchased your slave judges, they have debauched your slave
legislatures, and they have forced to worse horrors than chattel slavery your
slave boys and girls. Two million of your children are toiling to-day in this
trader-oligarchy of the United States. Ten millions of you slaves are not
properly sheltered nor properly fed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But to return. I have shown that no society of slaves can endure,
because, in its very nature, such society must annul the law of development. No
sooner can a slave society be organized than deterioration sets in. It is easy
for you to talk of annulling the law of development, but where is the new law
of development that will maintain your strength? Formulate it. Is it already
formulated? Then state it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin took his seat amidst an uproar of voices. A score of men were on their
feet clamoring for recognition from the chair. And one by one, encouraged by
vociferous applause, speaking with fire and enthusiasm and excited gestures,
they replied to the attack. It was a wild night&mdash;but it was wild
intellectually, a battle of ideas. Some strayed from the point, but most of the
speakers replied directly to Martin. They shook him with lines of thought that
were new to him; and gave him insights, not into new biological laws, but into
new applications of the old laws. They were too earnest to be always polite,
and more than once the chairman rapped and pounded for order.
</p>

<p>
It chanced that a cub reporter sat in the audience, detailed there on a day
dull of news and impressed by the urgent need of journalism for sensation. He
was not a bright cub reporter. He was merely facile and glib. He was too dense
to follow the discussion. In fact, he had a comfortable feeling that he was
vastly superior to these wordy maniacs of the working class. Also, he had a
great respect for those who sat in the high places and dictated the policies of
nations and newspapers. Further, he had an ideal, namely, of achieving that
excellence of the perfect reporter who is able to make something&mdash;even a
great deal&mdash;out of nothing.
</p>

<p>
He did not know what all the talk was about. It was not necessary. Words like
<i>revolution</i> gave him his cue. Like a paleontologist, able to reconstruct
an entire skeleton from one fossil bone, he was able to reconstruct a whole
speech from the one word <i>revolution</i>. He did it that night, and he did it
well; and since Martin had made the biggest stir, he put it all into his mouth
and made him the arch-anarch of the show, transforming his reactionary
individualism into the most lurid, red-shirt socialist utterance. The cub
reporter was an artist, and it was a large brush with which he laid on the
local color&mdash;wild-eyed long-haired men, neurasthenic and degenerate types
of men, voices shaken with passion, clenched fists raised on high, and all
projected against a background of oaths, yells, and the throaty rumbling of
angry men.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<p>
Over the coffee, in his little room, Martin read next morning&rsquo;s paper. It
was a novel experience to find himself head-lined, on the first page at that;
and he was surprised to learn that he was the most notorious leader of the
Oakland socialists. He ran over the violent speech the cub reporter had
constructed for him, and, though at first he was angered by the fabrication, in
the end he tossed the paper aside with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Either the man was drunk or criminally malicious,&rdquo; he said that
afternoon, from his perch on the bed, when Brissenden had arrived and dropped
limply into the one chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what do you care?&rdquo; Brissenden asked. &ldquo;Surely you
don&rsquo;t desire the approval of the bourgeois swine that read the
newspapers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin thought for a while, then said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I really don&rsquo;t care for their approval, not a whit. On the
other hand, it&rsquo;s very likely to make my relations with Ruth&rsquo;s
family a trifle awkward. Her father always contended I was a socialist, and
this miserable stuff will clinch his belief. Not that I care for his
opinion&mdash;but what&rsquo;s the odds? I want to read you what I&rsquo;ve
been doing to-day. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Overdue,&rsquo; of course, and I&rsquo;m
just about halfway through.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was reading aloud when Maria thrust open the door and ushered in a young man
in a natty suit who glanced briskly about him, noting the oil-burner and the
kitchen in the corner before his gaze wandered on to Martin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; Brissenden said.
</p>

<p>
Martin made room for the young man on the bed and waited for him to broach his
business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heard you speak last night, Mr. Eden, and I&rsquo;ve come to interview
you,&rdquo; he began.
</p>

<p>
Brissenden burst out in a hearty laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A brother socialist?&rdquo; the reporter asked, with a quick glance at
Brissenden that appraised the color-value of that cadaverous and dying man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he wrote that report,&rdquo; Martin said softly. &ldquo;Why, he is
only a boy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you poke him?&rdquo; Brissenden asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
give a thousand dollars to have my lungs back for five minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The cub reporter was a trifle perplexed by this talking over him and around him
and at him. But he had been commended for his brilliant description of the
socialist meeting and had further been detailed to get a personal interview
with Martin Eden, the leader of the organized menace to society.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do not object to having your picture taken, Mr. Eden?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a staff photographer outside, you see, and he says it
will be better to take you right away before the sun gets lower. Then we can
have the interview afterward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A photographer,&rdquo; Brissenden said meditatively. &ldquo;Poke him,
Martin! Poke him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m getting old,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I know I
ought, but I really haven&rsquo;t the heart. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to
matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For his mother&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; Brissenden urged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth considering,&rdquo; Martin replied; &ldquo;but it
doesn&rsquo;t seem worth while enough to rouse sufficient energy in me. You
see, it does take energy to give a fellow a poking. Besides, what does it
matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way to take it,&rdquo; the cub
announced airily, though he had already begun to glance anxiously at the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t true, not a word of what he wrote,&rdquo; Martin
went on, confining his attention to Brissenden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was just in a general way a description, you understand,&rdquo; the
cub ventured, &ldquo;and besides, it&rsquo;s good advertising. That&rsquo;s
what counts. It was a favor to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good advertising, Martin, old boy,&rdquo; Brissenden repeated
solemnly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it was a favor to me&mdash;think of that!&rdquo; was Martin&rsquo;s
contribution.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;where were you born, Mr. Eden?&rdquo; the cub asked,
assuming an air of expectant attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t take notes,&rdquo; said Brissenden. &ldquo;He remembers
it all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is sufficient for me.&rdquo; The cub was trying not to look
worried. &ldquo;No decent reporter needs to bother with notes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was sufficient&mdash;for last night.&rdquo; But Brissenden was not
a disciple of quietism, and he changed his attitude abruptly. &ldquo;Martin, if
you don&rsquo;t poke him, I&rsquo;ll do it myself, if I fall dead on the floor
the next moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How will a spanking do?&rdquo; Martin asked.
</p>

<p>
Brissenden considered judicially, and nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
The next instant Martin was seated on the edge of the bed with the cub face
downward across his knees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t bite,&rdquo; Martin warned, &ldquo;or else I&rsquo;ll
have to punch your face. It would be a pity, for it is such a pretty
face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His uplifted hand descended, and thereafter rose and fell in a swift and steady
rhythm. The cub struggled and cursed and squirmed, but did not offer to bite.
Brissenden looked on gravely, though once he grew excited and gripped the
whiskey bottle, pleading, &ldquo;Here, just let me swat him once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sorry my hand played out,&rdquo; Martin said, when at last he desisted.
&ldquo;It is quite numb.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He uprighted the cub and perched him on the bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested for this,&rdquo; he snarled, tears of
boyish indignation running down his flushed cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you
sweat for this. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The pretty thing,&rdquo; Martin remarked. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
realize that he has entered upon the downward path. It is not honest, it is not
square, it is not manly, to tell lies about one&rsquo;s fellow-creatures the
way he has done, and he doesn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has to come to us to be told,&rdquo; Brissenden filled in a pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, to me whom he has maligned and injured. My grocery will undoubtedly
refuse me credit now. The worst of it is that the poor boy will keep on this
way until he deteriorates into a first-class newspaper man and also a
first-class scoundrel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there is yet time,&rdquo; quoth Brissenden. &ldquo;Who knows but
what you may prove the humble instrument to save him. Why didn&rsquo;t you let
me swat him just once? I&rsquo;d like to have had a hand in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested, the pair of you, you b-b-big
brutes,&rdquo; sobbed the erring soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, his mouth is too pretty and too weak.&rdquo; Martin shook his head
lugubriously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve numbed my hand in vain. The
young man cannot reform. He will become eventually a very great and successful
newspaper man. He has no conscience. That alone will make him great.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With that the cub passed out the door in trepidation to the last for fear that
Brissenden would hit him in the back with the bottle he still clutched.
</p>

<p>
In the next morning&rsquo;s paper Martin learned a great deal more about
himself that was new to him. &ldquo;We are the sworn enemies of society,&rdquo;
he found himself quoted as saying in a column interview. &ldquo;No, we are not
anarchists but socialists.&rdquo; When the reporter pointed out to him that
there seemed little difference between the two schools, Martin had shrugged his
shoulders in silent affirmation. His face was described as bilaterally
asymmetrical, and various other signs of degeneration were described.
Especially notable were his thuglike hands and the fiery gleams in his
blood-shot eyes.
</p>

<p>
He learned, also, that he spoke nightly to the workmen in the City Hall Park,
and that among the anarchists and agitators that there inflamed the minds of
the people he drew the largest audiences and made the most revolutionary
speeches. The cub painted a high-light picture of his poor little room, its
oil-stove and the one chair, and of the death&rsquo;s-head tramp who kept him
company and who looked as if he had just emerged from twenty years of solitary
confinement in some fortress dungeon.
</p>

<p>
The cub had been industrious. He had scurried around and nosed out
Martin&rsquo;s family history, and procured a photograph of
Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store with Bernard Higginbotham himself standing out
in front. That gentleman was depicted as an intelligent, dignified businessman
who had no patience with his brother-in-law&rsquo;s socialistic views, and no
patience with the brother-in-law, either, whom he was quoted as characterizing
as a lazy good-for-nothing who wouldn&rsquo;t take a job when it was offered to
him and who would go to jail yet. Hermann von Schmidt, Marian&rsquo;s husband,
had likewise been interviewed. He had called Martin the black sheep of the
family and repudiated him. &ldquo;He tried to sponge off of me, but I put a
stop to that good and quick,&rdquo; Von Schmidt had said to the reporter.
&ldquo;He knows better than to come bumming around here. A man who won&rsquo;t
work is no good, take that from me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This time Martin was genuinely angry. Brissenden looked upon the affair as a
good joke, but he could not console Martin, who knew that it would be no easy
task to explain to Ruth. As for her father, he knew that he must be overjoyed
with what had happened and that he would make the most of it to break off the
engagement. How much he would make of it he was soon to realize. The afternoon
mail brought a letter from Ruth. Martin opened it with a premonition of
disaster, and read it standing at the open door when he had received it from
the postman. As he read, mechanically his hand sought his pocket for the
tobacco and brown paper of his old cigarette days. He was not aware that the
pocket was empty or that he had even reached for the materials with which to
roll a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
It was not a passionate letter. There were no touches of anger in it. But all
the way through, from the first sentence to the last, was sounded the note of
hurt and disappointment. She had expected better of him. She had thought he had
got over his youthful wildness, that her love for him had been sufficiently
worth while to enable him to live seriously and decently. And now her father
and mother had taken a firm stand and commanded that the engagement be broken.
That they were justified in this she could not but admit. Their relation could
never be a happy one. It had been unfortunate from the first. But one regret
she voiced in the whole letter, and it was a bitter one to Martin. &ldquo;If
only you had settled down to some position and attempted to make something of
yourself,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;But it was not to be. Your past life had
been too wild and irregular. I can understand that you are not to be blamed.
You could act only according to your nature and your early training. So I do
not blame you, Martin. Please remember that. It was simply a mistake. As father
and mother have contended, we were not made for each other, and we should both
be happy because it was discovered not too late.&rdquo; . . &ldquo;There is no
use trying to see me,&rdquo; she said toward the last. &ldquo;It would be an
unhappy meeting for both of us, as well as for my mother. I feel, as it is,
that I have caused her great pain and worry. I shall have to do much living to
atone for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He read it through to the end, carefully, a second time, then sat down and
replied. He outlined the remarks he had uttered at the socialist meeting,
pointing out that they were in all ways the converse of what the newspaper had
put in his mouth. Toward the end of the letter he was God&rsquo;s own lover
pleading passionately for love. &ldquo;Please answer,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and in your answer you have to tell me but one thing. Do you love me?
That is all&mdash;the answer to that one question.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But no answer came the next day, nor the next. &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; lay
untouched upon the table, and each day the heap of returned manuscripts under
the table grew larger. For the first time Martin&rsquo;s glorious sleep was
interrupted by insomnia, and he tossed through long, restless nights. Three
times he called at the Morse home, but was turned away by the servant who
answered the bell. Brissenden lay sick in his hotel, too feeble to stir out,
and, though Martin was with him often, he did not worry him with his troubles.
</p>

<p>
For Martin&rsquo;s troubles were many. The aftermath of the cub
reporter&rsquo;s deed was even wider than Martin had anticipated. The
Portuguese grocer refused him further credit, while the greengrocer, who was an
American and proud of it, had called him a traitor to his country and refused
further dealings with him&mdash;carrying his patriotism to such a degree that
he cancelled Martin&rsquo;s account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay it.
The talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling, and indignation
against Martin ran high. No one would have anything to do with a socialist
traitor. Poor Maria was dubious and frightened, but she remained loyal. The
children of the neighborhood recovered from the awe of the grand carriage which
once had visited Martin, and from safe distances they called him
&ldquo;hobo&rdquo; and &ldquo;bum.&rdquo; The Silva tribe, however, stanchly
defended him, fighting more than one pitched battle for his honor, and black
eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the day and added to
Maria&rsquo;s perplexities and troubles.
</p>

<p>
Once, Martin met Gertrude on the street, down in Oakland, and learned what he
knew could not be otherwise&mdash;that Bernard Higginbotham was furious with
him for having dragged the family into public disgrace, and that he had
forbidden him the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go away, Martin?&rdquo; Gertrude had begged.
&ldquo;Go away and get a job somewhere and steady down. Afterwards, when this
all blows over, you can come back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head, but gave no explanations. How could he explain? He was
appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that yawned between him and his
people. He could never cross it and explain to them his position,&mdash;the
Nietzschean position, in regard to socialism. There were not words enough in
the English language, nor in any language, to make his attitude and conduct
intelligible to them. Their highest concept of right conduct, in his case, was
to get a job. That was their first word and their last. It constituted their
whole lexicon of ideas. Get a job! Go to work! Poor, stupid slaves, he thought,
while his sister talked. Small wonder the world belonged to the strong. The
slaves were obsessed by their own slavery. A job was to them a golden fetich
before which they fell down and worshipped.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head again, when Gertrude offered him money, though he knew that
within the day he would have to make a trip to the pawnbroker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near Bernard now,&rdquo; she admonished him.
&ldquo;After a few months, when he is cooled down, if you want to, you can get
the job of drivin&rsquo; delivery-wagon for him. Any time you want me, just
send for me an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll come. Don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She went away weeping audibly, and he felt a pang of sorrow shoot through him
at sight of her heavy body and uncouth gait. As he watched her go, the
Nietzschean edifice seemed to shake and totter. The slave-class in the abstract
was all very well, but it was not wholly satisfactory when it was brought home
to his own family. And yet, if there was ever a slave trampled by the strong,
that slave was his sister Gertrude. He grinned savagely at the paradox. A fine
Nietzsche-man he was, to allow his intellectual concepts to be shaken by the
first sentiment or emotion that strayed along&mdash;ay, to be shaken by the
slave-morality itself, for that was what his pity for his sister really was.
The true noble men were above pity and compassion. Pity and compassion had been
generated in the subterranean barracoons of the slaves and were no more than
the agony and sweat of the crowded miserables and weaklings.

<h2><a name="chap40"></a>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; still continued to lie forgotten on the table. Every
manuscript that he had had out now lay under the table. Only one manuscript he
kept going, and that was Brissenden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ephemera.&rdquo; His bicycle
and black suit were again in pawn, and the type-writer people were once more
worrying about the rent. But such things no longer bothered him. He was seeking
a new orientation, and until that was found his life must stand still.
</p>

<p>
After several weeks, what he had been waiting for happened. He met Ruth on the
street. It was true, she was accompanied by her brother, Norman, and it was
true that they tried to ignore him and that Norman attempted to wave him aside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you interfere with my sister, I&rsquo;ll call an officer,&rdquo;
Norman threatened. &ldquo;She does not wish to speak with you, and your
insistence is insult.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you persist, you&rsquo;ll have to call that officer, and then
you&rsquo;ll get your name in the papers,&rdquo; Martin answered grimly.
&ldquo;And now, get out of my way and get the officer if you want to. I&rsquo;m
going to talk with Ruth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to have it from your own lips,&rdquo; he said to her.
</p>

<p>
She was pale and trembling, but she held up and looked inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The question I asked in my letter,&rdquo; he prompted.
</p>

<p>
Norman made an impatient movement, but Martin checked him with a swift look.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is all this of your own free will?&rdquo; he demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; She spoke in a low, firm voice and with deliberation.
&ldquo;It is of my own free will. You have disgraced me so that I am ashamed to
meet my friends. They are all talking about me, I know. That is all I can tell
you. You have made me very unhappy, and I never wish to see you again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Friends! Gossip! Newspaper misreports! Surely such things are not
stronger than love! I can only believe that you never loved me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A blush drove the pallor from her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After what has passed?&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;Martin, you do
not know what you are saying. I am not common.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, she doesn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with you,&rdquo;
Norman blurted out, starting on with her.
</p>

<p>
Martin stood aside and let them pass, fumbling unconsciously in his coat pocket
for the tobacco and brown papers that were not there.
</p>

<p>
It was a long walk to North Oakland, but it was not until he went up the steps
and entered his room that he knew he had walked it. He found himself sitting on
the edge of the bed and staring about him like an awakened somnambulist. He
noticed &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; lying on the table and drew up his chair and
reached for his pen. There was in his nature a logical compulsion toward
completeness. Here was something undone. It had been deferred against the
completion of something else. Now that something else had been finished, and he
would apply himself to this task until it was finished. What he would do next
he did not know. All that he did know was that a climacteric in his life had
been attained. A period had been reached, and he was rounding it off in
workman-like fashion. He was not curious about the future. He would soon enough
find out what it held in store for him. Whatever it was, it did not matter.
Nothing seemed to matter.
</p>

<p>
For five days he toiled on at &ldquo;Overdue,&rdquo; going nowhere, seeing
nobody, and eating meagrely. On the morning of the sixth day the postman
brought him a thin letter from the editor of <i>The Parthenon</i>. A glance
told him that &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was accepted. &ldquo;We have submitted the
poem to Mr. Cartwright Bruce,&rdquo; the editor went on to say, &ldquo;and he
has reported so favorably upon it that we cannot let it go. As an earnest of
our pleasure in publishing the poem, let me tell you that we have set it for
the August number, our July number being already made up. Kindly extend our
pleasure and our thanks to Mr. Brissenden. Please send by return mail his
photograph and biographical data. If our honorarium is unsatisfactory, kindly
telegraph us at once and state what you consider a fair price.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Since the honorarium they had offered was three hundred and fifty dollars,
Martin thought it not worth while to telegraph. Then, too, there was
Brissenden&rsquo;s consent to be gained. Well, he had been right, after all.
Here was one magazine editor who knew real poetry when he saw it. And the price
was splendid, even though it was for the poem of a century. As for Cartwright
Bruce, Martin knew that he was the one critic for whose opinions Brissenden had
any respect.
</p>

<p>
Martin rode down town on an electric car, and as he watched the houses and
cross-streets slipping by he was aware of a regret that he was not more elated
over his friend&rsquo;s success and over his own signal victory. The one critic
in the United States had pronounced favorably on the poem, while his own
contention that good stuff could find its way into the magazines had proved
correct. But enthusiasm had lost its spring in him, and he found that he was
more anxious to see Brissenden than he was to carry the good news. The
acceptance of <i>The Parthenon</i> had recalled to him that during his five
days&rsquo; devotion to &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; he had not heard from Brissenden
nor even thought about him. For the first time Martin realized the daze he had
been in, and he felt shame for having forgotten his friend. But even the shame
did not burn very sharply. He was numb to emotions of any sort save the
artistic ones concerned in the writing of &ldquo;Overdue.&rdquo; So far as
other affairs were concerned, he had been in a trance. For that matter, he was
still in a trance. All this life through which the electric car whirred seemed
remote and unreal, and he would have experienced little interest and less shock
if the great stone steeple of the church he passed had suddenly crumbled to
mortar-dust upon his head.
</p>

<p>
At the hotel he hurried up to Brissenden&rsquo;s room, and hurried down again.
The room was empty. All luggage was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did Mr. Brissenden leave any address?&rdquo; he asked the clerk, who
looked at him curiously for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, the papers were full of it. He was found dead in bed. Suicide. Shot
himself through the head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he buried yet?&rdquo; Martin seemed to hear his voice, like some one
else&rsquo;s voice, from a long way off, asking the question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. The body was shipped East after the inquest. Lawyers engaged by his
people saw to the arrangements.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They were quick about it, I must say,&rdquo; Martin commented.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. It happened five days ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Five days ago?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, five days ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Martin said as he turned and went out.
</p>

<p>
At the corner he stepped into the Western Union and sent a telegram to <i>The
Parthenon</i>, advising them to proceed with the publication of the poem. He
had in his pocket but five cents with which to pay his carfare home, so he sent
the message collect.
</p>

<p>
Once in his room, he resumed his writing. The days and nights came and went,
and he sat at his table and wrote on. He went nowhere, save to the pawnbroker,
took no exercise, and ate methodically when he was hungry and had something to
cook, and just as methodically went without when he had nothing to cook.
Composed as the story was, in advance, chapter by chapter, he nevertheless saw
and developed an opening that increased the power of it, though it necessitated
twenty thousand additional words. It was not that there was any vital need that
the thing should be well done, but that his artistic canons compelled him to do
it well. He worked on in the daze, strangely detached from the world around
him, feeling like a familiar ghost among these literary trappings of his former
life. He remembered that some one had said that a ghost was the spirit of a man
who was dead and who did not have sense enough to know it; and he paused for
the moment to wonder if he were really dead and unaware of it.
</p>

<p>
Came the day when &ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; was finished. The agent of the
type-writer firm had come for the machine, and he sat on the bed while Martin,
on the one chair, typed the last pages of the final chapter.
&ldquo;Finis,&rdquo; he wrote, in capitals, at the end, and to him it was
indeed finis. He watched the type-writer carried out the door with a feeling of
relief, then went over and lay down on the bed. He was faint from hunger. Food
had not passed his lips in thirty-six hours, but he did not think about it. He
lay on his back, with closed eyes, and did not think at all, while the daze or
stupor slowly welled up, saturating his consciousness. Half in delirium, he
began muttering aloud the lines of an anonymous poem Brissenden had been fond
of quoting to him. Maria, listening anxiously outside his door, was perturbed
by his monotonous utterance. The words in themselves were not significant to
her, but the fact that he was saying them was. &ldquo;I have done,&rdquo; was
the burden of the poem.
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;&lsquo;I have done&mdash;<br />
Put by the lute.<br />
Song and singing soon are over<br />
As the airy shades that hover<br />
In among the purple clover.<br />
I have done&mdash;<br />
Put by the lute.<br />
Once I sang as early thrushes<br />
Sing among the dewy bushes;<br />
Now I&rsquo;m mute.<br />
I am like a weary linnet,<br />
For my throat has no song in it;<br />
I have had my singing minute.<br />
I have done.<br />
Put by the lute.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maria could stand it no longer, and hurried away to the stove, where she filled
a quart-bowl with soup, putting into it the lion&rsquo;s share of chopped meat
and vegetables which her ladle scraped from the bottom of the pot. Martin
roused himself and sat up and began to eat, between spoonfuls reassuring Maria
that he had not been talking in his sleep and that he did not have any fever.
</p>

<p>
After she left him he sat drearily, with drooping shoulders, on the edge of the
bed, gazing about him with lack-lustre eyes that saw nothing until the torn
wrapper of a magazine, which had come in the morning&rsquo;s mail and which lay
unopened, shot a gleam of light into his darkened brain. It is <i>The
Parthenon</i>, he thought, the August <i>Parthenon</i>, and it must contain
&ldquo;Ephemera.&rdquo; If only Brissenden were here to see!
</p>

<p>
He was turning the pages of the magazine, when suddenly he stopped.
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; had been featured, with gorgeous head-piece and
Beardsley-like margin decorations. On one side of the head-piece was
Brissenden&rsquo;s photograph, on the other side was the photograph of Sir John
Value, the British Ambassador. A preliminary editorial note quoted Sir John
Value as saying that there were no poets in America, and the publication of
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was <i>The Parthenon&rsquo;s</i>. &ldquo;There, take
that, Sir John Value!&rdquo; Cartwright Bruce was described as the greatest
critic in America, and he was quoted as saying that &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was
the greatest poem ever written in America. And finally, the editor&rsquo;s
foreword ended with: &ldquo;We have not yet made up our minds entirely as to
the merits of &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo;; perhaps we shall never be able to do so.
But we have read it often, wondering at the words and their arrangement,
wondering where Mr. Brissenden got them, and how he could fasten them
together.&rdquo; Then followed the poem.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty good thing you died, Briss, old man,&rdquo; Martin murmured,
letting the magazine slip between his knees to the floor.
</p>

<p>
The cheapness and vulgarity of it was nauseating, and Martin noted
apathetically that he was not nauseated very much. He wished he could get
angry, but did not have energy enough to try. He was too numb. His blood was
too congealed to accelerate to the swift tidal flow of indignation. After all,
what did it matter? It was on a par with all the rest that Brissenden had
condemned in bourgeois society.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Briss,&rdquo; Martin communed; &ldquo;he would never have forgiven
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rousing himself with an effort, he possessed himself of a box which had once
contained type-writer paper. Going through its contents, he drew forth eleven
poems which his friend had written. These he tore lengthwise and crosswise and
dropped into the waste basket. He did it languidly, and, when he had finished,
sat on the edge of the bed staring blankly before him.
</p>

<p>
How long he sat there he did not know, until, suddenly, across his sightless
vision he saw form a long horizontal line of white. It was curious. But as he
watched it grow in definiteness he saw that it was a coral reef smoking in the
white Pacific surges. Next, in the line of breakers he made out a small canoe,
an outrigger canoe. In the stern he saw a young bronzed god in scarlet
hip-cloth dipping a flashing paddle. He recognized him. He was Moti, the
youngest son of Tati, the chief, and this was Tahiti, and beyond that smoking
reef lay the sweet land of Papara and the chief&rsquo;s grass house by the
river&rsquo;s mouth. It was the end of the day, and Moti was coming home from
the fishing. He was waiting for the rush of a big breaker whereon to jump the
reef. Then he saw himself, sitting forward in the canoe as he had often sat in
the past, dipping a paddle that waited Moti&rsquo;s word to dig in like mad
when the turquoise wall of the great breaker rose behind them. Next, he was no
longer an onlooker but was himself in the canoe, Moti was crying out, they were
both thrusting hard with their paddles, racing on the steep face of the flying
turquoise. Under the bow the water was hissing as from a steam jet, the air was
filled with driven spray, there was a rush and rumble and long-echoing roar,
and the canoe floated on the placid water of the lagoon. Moti laughed and shook
the salt water from his eyes, and together they paddled in to the pounded-coral
beach where Tati&rsquo;s grass walls through the cocoanut-palms showed golden
in the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
The picture faded, and before his eyes stretched the disorder of his squalid
room. He strove in vain to see Tahiti again. He knew there was singing among
the trees and that the maidens were dancing in the moonlight, but he could not
see them. He could see only the littered writing-table, the empty space where
the type-writer had stood, and the unwashed window-pane. He closed his eyes
with a groan, and slept.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap41"></a>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<p>
He slept heavily all night, and did not stir until aroused by the postman on
his morning round. Martin felt tired and passive, and went through his letters
aimlessly. One thin envelope, from a robber magazine, contained a check for
twenty-two dollars. He had been dunning for it for a year and a half. He noted
its amount apathetically. The old-time thrill at receiving a publisher&rsquo;s
check was gone. Unlike his earlier checks, this one was not pregnant with
promise of great things to come. To him it was a check for twenty-two dollars,
that was all, and it would buy him something to eat.
</p>

<p>
Another check was in the same mail, sent from a New York weekly in payment for
some humorous verse which had been accepted months before. It was for ten
dollars. An idea came to him, which he calmly considered. He did not know what
he was going to do, and he felt in no hurry to do anything. In the meantime he
must live. Also he owed numerous debts. Would it not be a paying investment to
put stamps on the huge pile of manuscripts under the table and start them on
their travels again? One or two of them might be accepted. That would help him
to live. He decided on the investment, and, after he had cashed the checks at
the bank down in Oakland, he bought ten dollars&rsquo; worth of postage stamps.
The thought of going home to cook breakfast in his stuffy little room was
repulsive to him. For the first time he refused to consider his debts. He knew
that in his room he could manufacture a substantial breakfast at a cost of from
fifteen to twenty cents. But, instead, he went into the Forum Café and
ordered a breakfast that cost two dollars. He tipped the waiter a quarter, and
spent fifty cents for a package of Egyptian cigarettes. It was the first time
he had smoked since Ruth had asked him to stop. But he could see now no reason
why he should not, and besides, he wanted to smoke. And what did the money
matter? For five cents he could have bought a package of Durham and brown
papers and rolled forty cigarettes&mdash;but what of it? Money had no meaning
to him now except what it would immediately buy. He was chartless and
rudderless, and he had no port to make, while drifting involved the least
living, and it was living that hurt.
</p>

<p>
The days slipped along, and he slept eight hours regularly every night. Though
now, while waiting for more checks, he ate in the Japanese restaurants where
meals were served for ten cents, his wasted body filled out, as did the hollows
in his cheeks. He no longer abused himself with short sleep, overwork, and
overstudy. He wrote nothing, and the books were closed. He walked much, out in
the hills, and loafed long hours in the quiet parks. He had no friends nor
acquaintances, nor did he make any. He had no inclination. He was waiting for
some impulse, from he knew not where, to put his stopped life into motion
again. In the meantime his life remained run down, planless, and empty and
idle.
</p>

<p>
Once he made a trip to San Francisco to look up the &ldquo;real dirt.&rdquo;
But at the last moment, as he stepped into the upstairs entrance, he recoiled
and turned and fled through the swarming ghetto. He was frightened at the
thought of hearing philosophy discussed, and he fled furtively, for fear that
some one of the &ldquo;real dirt&rdquo; might chance along and recognize him.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he glanced over the magazines and newspapers to see how
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was being maltreated. It had made a hit. But what a hit!
Everybody had read it, and everybody was discussing whether or not it was
really poetry. The local papers had taken it up, and daily there appeared
columns of learned criticisms, facetious editorials, and serious letters from
subscribers. Helen Della Delmar (proclaimed with a flourish of trumpets and
rolling of tomtoms to be the greatest woman poet in the United States) denied
Brissenden a seat beside her on Pegasus and wrote voluminous letters to the
public, proving that he was no poet.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Parthenon</i> came out in its next number patting itself on the back for
the stir it had made, sneering at Sir John Value, and exploiting
Brissenden&rsquo;s death with ruthless commercialism. A newspaper with a sworn
circulation of half a million published an original and spontaneous poem by
Helen Della Delmar, in which she gibed and sneered at Brissenden. Also, she was
guilty of a second poem, in which she parodied him.
</p>

<p>
Martin had many times to be glad that Brissenden was dead. He had hated the
crowd so, and here all that was finest and most sacred of him had been thrown
to the crowd. Daily the vivisection of Beauty went on. Every nincompoop in the
land rushed into free print, floating their wizened little egos into the public
eye on the surge of Brissenden&rsquo;s greatness. Quoth one paper: &ldquo;We
have received a letter from a gentleman who wrote a poem just like it, only
better, some time ago.&rdquo; Another paper, in deadly seriousness, reproving
Helen Della Delmar for her parody, said: &ldquo;But unquestionably Miss Delmar
wrote it in a moment of badinage and not quite with the respect that one great
poet should show to another and perhaps to the greatest. However, whether Miss
Delmar be jealous or not of the man who invented &lsquo;Ephemera,&rsquo; it is
certain that she, like thousands of others, is fascinated by his work, and that
the day may come when she will try to write lines like his.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ministers began to preach sermons against &ldquo;Ephemera,&rdquo; and one, who
too stoutly stood for much of its content, was expelled for heresy. The great
poem contributed to the gayety of the world. The comic verse-writers and the
cartoonists took hold of it with screaming laughter, and in the personal
columns of society weeklies jokes were perpetrated on it to the effect that
Charley Frensham told Archie Jennings, in confidence, that five lines of
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; would drive a man to beat a cripple, and that ten lines
would send him to the bottom of the river.
</p>

<p>
Martin did not laugh; nor did he grit his teeth in anger. The effect produced
upon him was one of great sadness. In the crash of his whole world, with love
on the pinnacle, the crash of magazinedom and the dear public was a small crash
indeed. Brissenden had been wholly right in his judgment of the magazines, and
he, Martin, had spent arduous and futile years in order to find it out for
himself. The magazines were all Brissenden had said they were and more. Well,
he was done, he solaced himself. He had hitched his wagon to a star and been
landed in a pestiferous marsh. The visions of Tahiti&mdash;clean, sweet
Tahiti&mdash;were coming to him more frequently. And there were the low
Paumotus, and the high Marquesas; he saw himself often, now, on board trading
schooners or frail little cutters, slipping out at dawn through the reef at
Papeete and beginning the long beat through the pearl-atolls to Nukahiva and
the Bay of Taiohae, where Tamari, he knew, would kill a pig in honor of his
coming, and where Tamari&rsquo;s flower-garlanded daughters would seize his
hands and with song and laughter garland him with flowers. The South Seas were
calling, and he knew that sooner or later he would answer the call.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime he drifted, resting and recuperating after the long traverse he
had made through the realm of knowledge. When <i>The Parthenon</i> check of
three hundred and fifty dollars was forwarded to him, he turned it over to the
local lawyer who had attended to Brissenden&rsquo;s affairs for his family.
Martin took a receipt for the check, and at the same time gave a note for the
hundred dollars Brissenden had let him have.
</p>

<p>
The time was not long when Martin ceased patronizing the Japanese restaurants.
At the very moment when he had abandoned the fight, the tide turned. But it had
turned too late. Without a thrill he opened a thick envelope from <i>The
Millennium</i>, scanned the face of a check that represented three hundred
dollars, and noted that it was the payment on acceptance for
&ldquo;Adventure.&rdquo; Every debt he owed in the world, including the
pawnshop, with its usurious interest, amounted to less than a hundred dollars.
And when he had paid everything, and lifted the hundred-dollar note with
Brissenden&rsquo;s lawyer, he still had over a hundred dollars in pocket. He
ordered a suit of clothes from the tailor and ate his meals in the best
cafés in town. He still slept in his little room at Maria&rsquo;s, but
the sight of his new clothes caused the neighborhood children to cease from
calling him &ldquo;hobo&rdquo; and &ldquo;tramp&rdquo; from the roofs of
woodsheds and over back fences.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wiki-Wiki,&rdquo; his Hawaiian short story, was bought by
<i>Warren&rsquo;s Monthly</i> for two hundred and fifty dollars. <i>The
Northern Review</i> took his essay, &ldquo;The Cradle of Beauty,&rdquo; and
<i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s Magazine</i> took &ldquo;The Palmist&rdquo;&mdash;the
poem he had written to Marian. The editors and readers were back from their
summer vacations, and manuscripts were being handled quickly. But Martin could
not puzzle out what strange whim animated them to this general acceptance of
the things they had persistently rejected for two years. Nothing of his had
been published. He was not known anywhere outside of Oakland, and in Oakland,
with the few who thought they knew him, he was notorious as a red-shirt and a
socialist. So there was no explaining this sudden acceptability of his wares.
It was sheer jugglery of fate.
</p>

<p>
After it had been refused by a number of magazines, he had taken
Brissenden&rsquo;s rejected advice and started &ldquo;The Shame of the
Sun&rdquo; on the round of publishers. After several refusals, Singletree,
Darnley &amp; Co. accepted it, promising fall publication. When Martin asked
for an advance on royalties, they wrote that such was not their custom, that
books of that nature rarely paid for themselves, and that they doubted if his
book would sell a thousand copies. Martin figured what the book would earn him
on such a sale. Retailed at a dollar, on a royalty of fifteen per cent, it
would bring him one hundred and fifty dollars. He decided that if he had it to
do over again he would confine himself to fiction. &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo;
one-fourth as long, had brought him twice as much from <i>The Millennium</i>.
That newspaper paragraph he had read so long ago had been true, after all. The
first-class magazines did not pay on acceptance, and they paid well. Not two
cents a word, but four cents a word, had <i>The Millennium</i> paid him. And,
furthermore, they bought good stuff, too, for were they not buying his? This
last thought he accompanied with a grin.
</p>

<p>
He wrote to Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co., offering to sell out his rights in
&ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; for a hundred dollars, but they did not care
to take the risk. In the meantime he was not in need of money, for several of
his later stories had been accepted and paid for. He actually opened a bank
account, where, without a debt in the world, he had several hundred dollars to
his credit. &ldquo;Overdue,&rdquo; after having been declined by a number of
magazines, came to rest at the Meredith-Lowell Company. Martin remembered the
five dollars Gertrude had given him, and his resolve to return it to her a
hundred times over; so he wrote for an advance on royalties of five hundred
dollars. To his surprise a check for that amount, accompanied by a contract,
came by return mail. He cashed the check into five-dollar gold pieces and
telephoned Gertrude that he wanted to see her.
</p>

<p>
She arrived at the house panting and short of breath from the haste she had
made. Apprehensive of trouble, she had stuffed the few dollars she possessed
into her hand-satchel; and so sure was she that disaster had overtaken her
brother, that she stumbled forward, sobbing, into his arms, at the same time
thrusting the satchel mutely at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have come myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t
want a row with Mr. Higginbotham, and that is what would have surely
happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right after a time,&rdquo; she assured him, while she
wondered what the trouble was that Martin was in. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;d best
get a job first an&rsquo; steady down. Bernard does like to see a man at honest
work. That stuff in the newspapers broke &rsquo;m all up. I never saw &rsquo;m
so mad before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to get a job,&rdquo; Martin said with a smile.
&ldquo;And you can tell him so from me. I don&rsquo;t need a job, and
there&rsquo;s the proof of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He emptied the hundred gold pieces into her lap in a glinting, tinkling stream.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You remember that fiver you gave me the time I didn&rsquo;t have
carfare? Well, there it is, with ninety-nine brothers of different ages but all
of the same size.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If Gertrude had been frightened when she arrived, she was now in a panic of
fear. Her fear was such that it was certitude. She was not suspicious. She was
convinced. She looked at Martin in horror, and her heavy limbs shrank under the
golden stream as though it were burning her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours,&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
She burst into tears, and began to moan, &ldquo;My poor boy, my poor
boy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was puzzled for a moment. Then he divined the cause of her agitation and
handed her the Meredith-Lowell letter which had accompanied the check. She
stumbled through it, pausing now and again to wipe her eyes, and when she had
finished, said:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; does it mean that you come by the money honestly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More honestly than if I&rsquo;d won it in a lottery. I earned it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Slowly faith came back to her, and she reread the letter carefully. It took him
long to explain to her the nature of the transaction which had put the money
into his possession, and longer still to get her to understand that the money
was really hers and that he did not need it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it in the bank for you,&rdquo; she said finally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort. It&rsquo;s yours, to do with as you
please, and if you won&rsquo;t take it, I&rsquo;ll give it to Maria.
She&rsquo;ll know what to do with it. I&rsquo;d suggest, though, that you hire
a servant and take a good long rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell Bernard all about it,&rdquo; she
announced, when she was leaving.
</p>

<p>
Martin winced, then grinned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And then, maybe, he&rsquo;ll invite me
to dinner again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he will&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he will!&rdquo; she exclaimed
fervently, as she drew him to her and kissed and hugged him.

<h2><a name="chap42"></a>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<p>
One day Martin became aware that he was lonely. He was healthy and strong, and
had nothing to do. The cessation from writing and studying, the death of
Brissenden, and the estrangement from Ruth had made a big hole in his life; and
his life refused to be pinned down to good living in cafés and the
smoking of Egyptian cigarettes. It was true the South Seas were calling to him,
but he had a feeling that the game was not yet played out in the United States.
Two books were soon to be published, and he had more books that might find
publication. Money could be made out of them, and he would wait and take a
sackful of it into the South Seas. He knew a valley and a bay in the Marquesas
that he could buy for a thousand Chili dollars. The valley ran from the
horseshoe, land-locked bay to the tops of the dizzy, cloud-capped peaks and
contained perhaps ten thousand acres. It was filled with tropical fruits, wild
chickens, and wild pigs, with an occasional herd of wild cattle, while high up
among the peaks were herds of wild goats harried by packs of wild dogs. The
whole place was wild. Not a human lived in it. And he could buy it and the bay
for a thousand Chili dollars.
</p>

<p>
The bay, as he remembered it, was magnificent, with water deep enough to
accommodate the largest vessel afloat, and so safe that the South Pacific
Directory recommended it as the best careening place for ships for hundreds of
miles around. He would buy a schooner&mdash;one of those yacht-like, coppered
crafts that sailed like witches&mdash;and go trading copra and pearling among
the islands. He would make the valley and the bay his headquarters. He would
build a patriarchal grass house like Tati&rsquo;s, and have it and the valley
and the schooner filled with dark-skinned servitors. He would entertain there
the factor of Taiohae, captains of wandering traders, and all the best of the
South Pacific riffraff. He would keep open house and entertain like a prince.
And he would forget the books he had opened and the world that had proved an
illusion.
</p>

<p>
To do all this he must wait in California to fill the sack with money. Already
it was beginning to flow in. If one of the books made a strike, it might enable
him to sell the whole heap of manuscripts. Also he could collect the stories
and the poems into books, and make sure of the valley and the bay and the
schooner. He would never write again. Upon that he was resolved. But in the
meantime, awaiting the publication of the books, he must do something more than
live dazed and stupid in the sort of uncaring trance into which he had fallen.
</p>

<p>
He noted, one Sunday morning, that the Bricklayers&rsquo; Picnic took place
that day at Shell Mound Park, and to Shell Mound Park he went. He had been to
the working-class picnics too often in his earlier life not to know what they
were like, and as he entered the park he experienced a recrudescence of all the
old sensations. After all, they were his kind, these working people. He had
been born among them, he had lived among them, and though he had strayed for a
time, it was well to come back among them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t Mart!&rdquo; he heard some one say, and the next
moment a hearty hand was on his shoulder. &ldquo;Where you ben all the time?
Off to sea? Come on an&rsquo; have a drink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was the old crowd in which he found himself&mdash;the old crowd, with here
and there a gap, and here and there a new face. The fellows were not
bricklayers, but, as in the old days, they attended all Sunday picnics for the
dancing, and the fighting, and the fun. Martin drank with them, and began to
feel really human once more. He was a fool to have ever left them, he thought;
and he was very certain that his sum of happiness would have been greater had
he remained with them and let alone the books and the people who sat in the
high places. Yet the beer seemed not so good as of yore. It didn&rsquo;t taste
as it used to taste. Brissenden had spoiled him for steam beer, he concluded,
and wondered if, after all, the books had spoiled him for companionship with
these friends of his youth. He resolved that he would not be so spoiled, and he
went on to the dancing pavilion. Jimmy, the plumber, he met there, in the
company of a tall, blond girl who promptly forsook him for Martin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;s like old times,&rdquo; Jimmy explained to the gang that
gave him the laugh as Martin and the blonde whirled away in a waltz.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t give a rap. I&rsquo;m too damned glad to see
&rsquo;m back. Watch &rsquo;m waltz, eh? It&rsquo;s like silk. Who&rsquo;d
blame any girl?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Martin restored the blonde to Jimmy, and the three of them, with half a
dozen friends, watched the revolving couples and laughed and joked with one
another. Everybody was glad to see Martin back. No book of his been published;
he carried no fictitious value in their eyes. They liked him for himself. He
felt like a prince returned from excile, and his lonely heart burgeoned in the
geniality in which it bathed. He made a mad day of it, and was at his best.
Also, he had money in his pockets, and, as in the old days when he returned
from sea with a pay-day, he made the money fly.
</p>

<p>
Once, on the dancing-floor, he saw Lizzie Connolly go by in the arms of a young
workingman; and, later, when he made the round of the pavilion, he came upon
her sitting by a refreshment table. Surprise and greetings over, he led her
away into the grounds, where they could talk without shouting down the music.
From the instant he spoke to her, she was his. He knew it. She showed it in the
proud humility of her eyes, in every caressing movement of her proudly carried
body, and in the way she hung upon his speech. She was not the young girl as he
had known her. She was a woman, now, and Martin noted that her wild, defiant
beauty had improved, losing none of its wildness, while the defiance and the
fire seemed more in control. &ldquo;A beauty, a perfect beauty,&rdquo; he
murmured admiringly under his breath. And he knew she was his, that all he had
to do was to say &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and she would go with him over the world
wherever he led.
</p>

<p>
Even as the thought flashed through his brain he received a heavy blow on the
side of his head that nearly knocked him down. It was a man&rsquo;s fist,
directed by a man so angry and in such haste that the fist had missed the jaw
for which it was aimed. Martin turned as he staggered, and saw the fist coming
at him in a wild swing. Quite as a matter of course he ducked, and the fist
flew harmlessly past, pivoting the man who had driven it. Martin hooked with
his left, landing on the pivoting man with the weight of his body behind the
blow. The man went to the ground sidewise, leaped to his feet, and made a mad
rush. Martin saw his passion-distorted face and wondered what could be the
cause of the fellow&rsquo;s anger. But while he wondered, he shot in a straight
left, the weight of his body behind the blow. The man went over backward and
fell in a crumpled heap. Jimmy and others of the gang were running toward them.
</p>

<p>
Martin was thrilling all over. This was the old days with a vengeance, with
their dancing, and their fighting, and their fun. While he kept a wary eye on
his antagonist, he glanced at Lizzie. Usually the girls screamed when the
fellows got to scrapping, but she had not screamed. She was looking on with
bated breath, leaning slightly forward, so keen was her interest, one hand
pressed to her breast, her cheek flushed, and in her eyes a great and amazed
admiration.
</p>

<p>
The man had gained his feet and was struggling to escape the restraining arms
that were laid on him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was waitin&rsquo; for me to come back!&rdquo; he was proclaiming to
all and sundry. &ldquo;She was waitin&rsquo; for me to come back, an&rsquo;
then that fresh guy comes buttin&rsquo; in. Let go o&rsquo; me, I tell yeh.
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to fix &rsquo;m.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; yer?&rdquo; Jimmy was demanding, as he helped
hold the young fellow back. &ldquo;That guy&rsquo;s Mart Eden. He&rsquo;s nifty
with his mits, lemme tell you that, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll eat you alive if you
monkey with &rsquo;m.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t steal her on me that way,&rdquo; the other interjected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He licked the Flyin&rsquo; Dutchman, an&rsquo; you know
<i>him</i>,&rdquo; Jimmy went on expostulating. &ldquo;An&rsquo; he did it in
five rounds. You couldn&rsquo;t last a minute against him. See?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This information seemed to have a mollifying effect, and the irate young man
favored Martin with a measuring stare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t look it,&rdquo; he sneered; but the sneer was without
passion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the Flyin&rsquo; Dutchman thought,&rdquo; Jimmy
assured him. &ldquo;Come on, now, let&rsquo;s get outa this. There&rsquo;s lots
of other girls. Come on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young fellow allowed himself to be led away toward the pavilion, and the
gang followed after him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Martin asked Lizzie. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s it all
about, anyway?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Already the zest of combat, which of old had been so keen and lasting, had died
down, and he discovered that he was self-analytical, too much so to live,
single heart and single hand, so primitive an existence.
</p>

<p>
Lizzie tossed her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s nobody,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just ben
keepin&rsquo; company with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had to, you see,&rdquo; she explained after a pause. &ldquo;I was
gettin&rsquo; pretty lonesome. But I never forgot.&rdquo; Her voice sank lower,
and she looked straight before her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d throw &rsquo;m down for
you any time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin looking at her averted face, knowing that all he had to do was to reach
out his hand and pluck her, fell to pondering whether, after all, there was any
real worth in refined, grammatical English, and, so, forgot to reply to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You put it all over him,&rdquo; she said tentatively, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a husky young fellow, though,&rdquo; he admitted generously.
&ldquo;If they hadn&rsquo;t taken him away, he might have given me my hands
full.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who was that lady friend I seen you with that night?&rdquo; she asked
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, just a lady friend,&rdquo; was his answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a long time ago,&rdquo; she murmured contemplatively. &ldquo;It
seems like a thousand years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Martin went no further into the matter. He led the conversation off into
other channels. They had lunch in the restaurant, where he ordered wine and
expensive delicacies and afterward he danced with her and with no one but her,
till she was tired. He was a good dancer, and she whirled around and around
with him in a heaven of delight, her head against his shoulder, wishing that it
could last forever. Later in the afternoon they strayed off among the trees,
where, in the good old fashion, she sat down while he sprawled on his back, his
head in her lap. He lay and dozed, while she fondled his hair, looked down on
his closed eyes, and loved him without reserve. Looking up suddenly, he read
the tender advertisement in her face. Her eyes fluttered down, then they opened
and looked into his with soft defiance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept straight all these years,&rdquo; she said, her voice so
low that it was almost a whisper.
</p>

<p>
In his heart Martin knew that it was the miraculous truth. And at his heart
pleaded a great temptation. It was in his power to make her happy. Denied
happiness himself, why should he deny happiness to her? He could marry her and
take her down with him to dwell in the grass-walled castle in the Marquesas.
The desire to do it was strong, but stronger still was the imperative command
of his nature not to do it. In spite of himself he was still faithful to Love.
The old days of license and easy living were gone. He could not bring them
back, nor could he go back to them. He was changed&mdash;how changed he had not
realized until now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not a marrying man, Lizzie,&rdquo; he said lightly.
</p>

<p>
The hand caressing his hair paused perceptibly, then went on with the same
gentle stroke. He noticed her face harden, but it was with the hardness of
resolution, for still the soft color was in her cheeks and she was all glowing
and melting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not mean that&mdash;&rdquo; she began, then faltered. &ldquo;Or
anyway I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to be
your friend. I&rsquo;d do anything for you. I&rsquo;m made that way, I
guess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin sat up. He took her hand in his. He did it deliberately, with warmth but
without passion; and such warmth chilled her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a great and noble woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And it is I who
should be proud to know you. And I am, I am. You are a ray of light to me in a
very dark world, and I&rsquo;ve got to be straight with you, just as straight
as you have been.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re straight with me or not. You
could do anything with me. You could throw me in the dirt an&rsquo; walk on me.
An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re the only man in the world that can,&rdquo; she added
with a defiant flash. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t taken care of myself ever since I
was a kid for nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s just because of that that I&rsquo;m not going to,&rdquo;
he said gently. &ldquo;You are so big and generous that you challenge me to
equal generousness. I&rsquo;m not marrying, and I&rsquo;m not&mdash;well,
loving without marrying, though I&rsquo;ve done my share of that in the past.
I&rsquo;m sorry I came here to-day and met you. But it can&rsquo;t be helped
now, and I never expected it would turn out this way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But look here, Lizzie. I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you how much I like
you. I do more than like you. I admire and respect you. You are magnificent,
and you are magnificently good. But what&rsquo;s the use of words? Yet
there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to do. You&rsquo;ve had a hard life; let
me make it easy for you.&rdquo; (A joyous light welled into her eyes, then
faded out again.) &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure of getting hold of some money
soon&mdash;lots of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In that moment he abandoned the idea of the valley and the bay, the
grass-walled castle and the trim, white schooner. After all, what did it
matter? He could go away, as he had done so often, before the mast, on any ship
bound anywhere.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to turn it over to you. There must be something you
want&mdash;to go to school or business college. You might like to study and be
a stenographer. I could fix it for you. Or maybe your father and mother are
living&mdash;I could set them up in a grocery store or something. Anything you
want, just name it, and I can fix it for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She made no reply, but sat, gazing straight before her, dry-eyed and
motionless, but with an ache in the throat which Martin divined so strongly
that it made his own throat ache. He regretted that he had spoken. It seemed so
tawdry what he had offered her&mdash;mere money&mdash;compared with what she
offered him. He offered her an extraneous thing with which he could part
without a pang, while she offered him herself, along with disgrace and shame,
and sin, and all her hopes of heaven.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it,&rdquo; she said with a catch in
her voice that she changed to a cough. She stood up. &ldquo;Come on,
let&rsquo;s go home. I&rsquo;m all tired out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The day was done, and the merrymakers had nearly all departed. But as Martin
and Lizzie emerged from the trees they found the gang waiting for them. Martin
knew immediately the meaning of it. Trouble was brewing. The gang was his
body-guard. They passed out through the gates of the park with, straggling in
the rear, a second gang, the friends that Lizzie&rsquo;s young man had
collected to avenge the loss of his lady. Several constables and special police
officers, anticipating trouble, trailed along to prevent it, and herded the two
gangs separately aboard the train for San Francisco. Martin told Jimmy that he
would get off at Sixteenth Street Station and catch the electric car into
Oakland. Lizzie was very quiet and without interest in what was impending. The
train pulled in to Sixteenth Street Station, and the waiting electric car could
be seen, the conductor of which was impatiently clanging the gong.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; Jimmy counselled. &ldquo;Make a run for it,
an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll hold &rsquo;em back. Now you go! Hit her up!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hostile gang was temporarily disconcerted by the manoeuvre, then it dashed
from the train in pursuit. The staid and sober Oakland folk who sat upon the
car scarcely noted the young fellow and the girl who ran for it and found a
seat in front on the outside. They did not connect the couple with Jimmy, who
sprang on the steps, crying to the motorman:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Slam on the juice, old man, and beat it outa here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The next moment Jimmy whirled about, and the passengers saw him land his fist
on the face of a running man who was trying to board the car. But fists were
landing on faces the whole length of the car. Thus, Jimmy and his gang, strung
out on the long, lower steps, met the attacking gang. The car started with a
great clanging of its gong, and, as Jimmy&rsquo;s gang drove off the last
assailants, they, too, jumped off to finish the job. The car dashed on, leaving
the flurry of combat far behind, and its dumfounded passengers never dreamed
that the quiet young man and the pretty working-girl sitting in the corner on
the outside seat had been the cause of the row.
</p>

<p>
Martin had enjoyed the fight, with a recrudescence of the old fighting thrills.
But they quickly died away, and he was oppressed by a great sadness. He felt
very old&mdash;centuries older than those careless, care-free young companions
of his others days. He had travelled far, too far to go back. Their mode of
life, which had once been his, was now distasteful to him. He was disappointed
in it all. He had developed into an alien. As the steam beer had tasted raw, so
their companionship seemed raw to him. He was too far removed. Too many
thousands of opened books yawned between them and him. He had exiled himself.
He had travelled in the vast realm of intellect until he could no longer return
home. On the other hand, he was human, and his gregarious need for
companionship remained unsatisfied. He had found no new home. As the gang could
not understand him, as his own family could not understand him, as the
bourgeoisie could not understand him, so this girl beside him, whom he honored
high, could not understand him nor the honor he paid her. His sadness was not
untouched with bitterness as he thought it over.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make it up with him,&rdquo; he advised Lizzie, at parting, as they stood
in front of the workingman&rsquo;s shack in which she lived, near Sixth and
Market. He referred to the young fellow whose place he had usurped that day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;now,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, go on,&rdquo; he said jovially. &ldquo;All you have to do is whistle
and he&rsquo;ll come running.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she said simply.
</p>

<p>
And he knew what she had meant.
</p>

<p>
She leaned toward him as he was about to say good night. But she leaned not
imperatively, not seductively, but wistfully and humbly. He was touched to the
heart. His large tolerance rose up in him. He put his arms around her, and
kissed her, and knew that upon his own lips rested as true a kiss as man ever
received.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I could die for you. I could die for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She tore herself from him suddenly and ran up the steps. He felt a quick
moisture in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Martin Eden,&rdquo; he communed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a brute, and
you&rsquo;re a damn poor Nietzscheman. You&rsquo;d marry her if you could and
fill her quivering heart full with happiness. But you can&rsquo;t, you
can&rsquo;t. And it&rsquo;s a damn shame.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
muttered, remembering his Henly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Life is, I think, a blunder and
a shame.&rsquo; It is&mdash;a blunder and a shame.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap43"></a>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; was published in October. As Martin cut the
cords of the express package and the half-dozen complimentary copies from the
publishers spilled out on the table, a heavy sadness fell upon him. He thought
of the wild delight that would have been his had this happened a few short
months before, and he contrasted that delight that should have been with his
present uncaring coldness. His book, his first book, and his pulse had not gone
up a fraction of a beat, and he was only sad. It meant little to him now. The
most it meant was that it might bring some money, and little enough did he care
for money.
</p>

<p>
He carried a copy out into the kitchen and presented it to Maria.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did it,&rdquo; he explained, in order to clear up her bewilderment.
&ldquo;I wrote it in the room there, and I guess some few quarts of your
vegetable soup went into the making of it. Keep it. It&rsquo;s yours. Just to
remember me by, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was not bragging, not showing off. His sole motive was to make her happy, to
make her proud of him, to justify her long faith in him. She put the book in
the front room on top of the family Bible. A sacred thing was this book her
lodger had made, a fetich of friendship. It softened the blow of his having
been a laundryman, and though she could not understand a line of it, she knew
that every line of it was great. She was a simple, practical, hard-working
woman, but she possessed faith in large endowment.
</p>

<p>
Just as emotionlessly as he had received &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; did
he read the reviews of it that came in weekly from the clipping bureau. The
book was making a hit, that was evident. It meant more gold in the money sack.
He could fix up Lizzie, redeem all his promises, and still have enough left to
build his grass-walled castle.
</p>

<p>
Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co. had cautiously brought out an edition of fifteen
hundred copies, but the first reviews had started a second edition of twice the
size through the presses; and ere this was delivered a third edition of five
thousand had been ordered. A London firm made arrangements by cable for an
English edition, and hot-footed upon this came the news of French, German, and
Scandinavian translations in progress. The attack upon the Maeterlinck school
could not have been made at a more opportune moment. A fierce controversy was
precipitated. Saleeby and Haeckel indorsed and defended &ldquo;The Shame of the
Sun,&rdquo; for once finding themselves on the same side of a question. Crookes
and Wallace ranged up on the opposing side, while Sir Oliver Lodge attempted to
formulate a compromise that would jibe with his particular cosmic theories.
Maeterlinck&rsquo;s followers rallied around the standard of mysticism.
Chesterton set the whole world laughing with a series of alleged non-partisan
essays on the subject, and the whole affair, controversy and controversialists,
was well-nigh swept into the pit by a thundering broadside from George Bernard
Shaw. Needless to say the arena was crowded with hosts of lesser lights, and
the dust and sweat and din became terrific.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a most marvellous happening,&rdquo; Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co.
wrote Martin, &ldquo;a critical philosophic essay selling like a novel. You
could not have chosen your subject better, and all contributory factors have
been unwarrantedly propitious. We need scarcely to assure you that we are
making hay while the sun shines. Over forty thousand copies have already been
sold in the United States and Canada, and a new edition of twenty thousand is
on the presses. We are overworked, trying to supply the demand. Nevertheless we
have helped to create that demand. We have already spent five thousand dollars
in advertising. The book is bound to be a record-breaker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please find herewith a contract in duplicate for your next book which we
have taken the liberty of forwarding to you. You will please note that we have
increased your royalties to twenty per cent, which is about as high as a
conservative publishing house dares go. If our offer is agreeable to you,
please fill in the proper blank space with the title of your book. We make no
stipulations concerning its nature. Any book on any subject. If you have one
already written, so much the better. Now is the time to strike. The iron could
not be hotter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On receipt of signed contract we shall be pleased to make you an advance
on royalties of five thousand dollars. You see, we have faith in you, and we
are going in on this thing big. We should like, also, to discuss with you the
drawing up of a contract for a term of years, say ten, during which we shall
have the exclusive right of publishing in book-form all that you produce. But
more of this anon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin laid down the letter and worked a problem in mental arithmetic, finding
the product of fifteen cents times sixty thousand to be nine thousand dollars.
He signed the new contract, inserting &ldquo;The Smoke of Joy&rdquo; in the
blank space, and mailed it back to the publishers along with the twenty
storiettes he had written in the days before he discovered the formula for the
newspaper storiette. And promptly as the United States mail could deliver and
return, came Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co.&rsquo;s check for five thousand
dollars.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you to come down town with me, Maria, this afternoon about two
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Martin said, the morning the check arrived. &ldquo;Or,
better, meet me at Fourteenth and Broadway at two o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ll be
looking out for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At the appointed time she was there; but <i>shoes</i> was the only clew to the
mystery her mind had been capable of evolving, and she suffered a distinct
shock of disappointment when Martin walked her right by a shoe-store and dived
into a real estate office. What happened thereupon resided forever after in her
memory as a dream. Fine gentlemen smiled at her benevolently as they talked
with Martin and one another; a type-writer clicked; signatures were affixed to
an imposing document; her own landlord was there, too, and affixed his
signature; and when all was over and she was outside on the sidewalk, her
landlord spoke to her, saying, &ldquo;Well, Maria, you won&rsquo;t have to pay
me no seven dollars and a half this month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Maria was too stunned for speech.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or next month, or the next, or the next,&rdquo; her landlord said.
</p>

<p>
She thanked him incoherently, as if for a favor. And it was not until she had
returned home to North Oakland and conferred with her own kind, and had the
Portuguese grocer investigate, that she really knew that she was the owner of
the little house in which she had lived and for which she had paid rent so
long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you trade with me no more?&rdquo; the Portuguese grocer
asked Martin that evening, stepping out to hail him when he got off the car;
and Martin explained that he wasn&rsquo;t doing his own cooking any more, and
then went in and had a drink of wine on the house. He noted it was the best
wine the grocer had in stock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; Martin announced that night, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
leave you. And you&rsquo;re going to leave here yourself soon. Then you can
rent the house and be a landlord yourself. You&rsquo;ve a brother in San
Leandro or Haywards, and he&rsquo;s in the milk business. I want you to send
all your washing back unwashed&mdash;understand?&mdash;unwashed, and to go out
to San Leandro to-morrow, or Haywards, or wherever it is, and see that brother
of yours. Tell him to come to see me. I&rsquo;ll be stopping at the Metropole
down in Oakland. He&rsquo;ll know a good milk-ranch when he sees one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so it was that Maria became a landlord and the sole owner of a dairy, with
two hired men to do the work for her and a bank account that steadily increased
despite the fact that her whole brood wore shoes and went to school. Few
persons ever meet the fairy princes they dream about; but Maria, who worked
hard and whose head was hard, never dreaming about fairy princes, entertained
hers in the guise of an ex-laundryman.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the world had begun to ask: &ldquo;Who is this Martin
Eden?&rdquo; He had declined to give any biographical data to his publishers,
but the newspapers were not to be denied. Oakland was his own town, and the
reporters nosed out scores of individuals who could supply information. All
that he was and was not, all that he had done and most of what he had not done,
was spread out for the delectation of the public, accompanied by snapshots and
photographs&mdash;the latter procured from the local photographer who had once
taken Martin&rsquo;s picture and who promptly copyrighted it and put it on the
market. At first, so great was his disgust with the magazines and all bourgeois
society, Martin fought against publicity; but in the end, because it was easier
than not to, he surrendered. He found that he could not refuse himself to the
special writers who travelled long distances to see him. Then again, each day
was so many hours long, and, since he no longer was occupied with writing and
studying, those hours had to be occupied somehow; so he yielded to what was to
him a whim, permitted interviews, gave his opinions on literature and
philosophy, and even accepted invitations of the bourgeoisie. He had settled
down into a strange and comfortable state of mind. He no longer cared. He
forgave everybody, even the cub reporter who had painted him red and to whom he
now granted a full page with specially posed photographs.
</p>

<p>
He saw Lizzie occasionally, and it was patent that she regretted the greatness
that had come to him. It widened the space between them. Perhaps it was with
the hope of narrowing it that she yielded to his persuasions to go to night
school and business college and to have herself gowned by a wonderful
dressmaker who charged outrageous prices. She improved visibly from day to day,
until Martin wondered if he was doing right, for he knew that all her
compliance and endeavor was for his sake. She was trying to make herself of
worth in his eyes&mdash;of the sort of worth he seemed to value. Yet he gave
her no hope, treating her in brotherly fashion and rarely seeing her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Overdue&rdquo; was rushed upon the market by the Meredith-Lowell Company
in the height of his popularity, and being fiction, in point of sales it made
even a bigger strike than &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun.&rdquo; Week after week
his was the credit of the unprecedented performance of having two books at the
head of the list of best-sellers. Not only did the story take with the
fiction-readers, but those who read &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; with
avidity were likewise attracted to the sea-story by the cosmic grasp of mastery
with which he had handled it. First he had attacked the literature of
mysticism, and had done it exceeding well; and, next, he had successfully
supplied the very literature he had exposited, thus proving himself to be that
rare genius, a critic and a creator in one.
</p>

<p>
Money poured in on him, fame poured in on him; he flashed, comet-like, through
the world of literature, and he was more amused than interested by the stir he
was making. One thing was puzzling him, a little thing that would have puzzled
the world had it known. But the world would have puzzled over his bepuzzlement
rather than over the little thing that to him loomed gigantic. Judge Blount
invited him to dinner. That was the little thing, or the beginning of the
little thing, that was soon to become the big thing. He had insulted Judge
Blount, treated him abominably, and Judge Blount, meeting him on the street,
invited him to dinner. Martin bethought himself of the numerous occasions on
which he had met Judge Blount at the Morses&rsquo; and when Judge Blount had
not invited him to dinner. Why had he not invited him to dinner then? he asked
himself. He had not changed. He was the same Martin Eden. What made the
difference? The fact that the stuff he had written had appeared inside the
covers of books? But it was work performed. It was not something he had done
since. It was achievement accomplished at the very time Judge Blount was
sharing this general view and sneering at his Spencer and his intellect.
Therefore it was not for any real value, but for a purely fictitious value that
Judge Blount invited him to dinner.
</p>

<p>
Martin grinned and accepted the invitation, marvelling the while at his
complacence. And at the dinner, where, with their womankind, were half a dozen
of those that sat in high places, and where Martin found himself quite the
lion, Judge Blount, warmly seconded by Judge Hanwell, urged privately that
Martin should permit his name to be put up for the Styx&mdash;the ultra-select
club to which belonged, not the mere men of wealth, but the men of attainment.
And Martin declined, and was more puzzled than ever.
</p>

<p>
He was kept busy disposing of his heap of manuscripts. He was overwhelmed by
requests from editors. It had been discovered that he was a stylist, with meat
under his style. <i>The Northern Review</i>, after publishing &ldquo;The Cradle
of Beauty,&rdquo; had written him for half a dozen similar essays, which would
have been supplied out of the heap, had not <i>Burton&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, in
a speculative mood, offered him five hundred dollars each for five essays. He
wrote back that he would supply the demand, but at a thousand dollars an essay.
He remembered that all these manuscripts had been refused by the very magazines
that were now clamoring for them. And their refusals had been cold-blooded,
automatic, stereotyped. They had made him sweat, and now he intended to make
them sweat. <i>Burton&rsquo;s Magazine</i> paid his price for five essays, and
the remaining four, at the same rate, were snapped up by <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s
Monthly, The Northern Review</i> being too poor to stand the pace. Thus went
out to the world &ldquo;The High Priests of Mystery,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Wonder-Dreamers,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Yardstick of the Ego,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Philosophy of Illusion,&rdquo; &ldquo;God and Clod,&rdquo; &ldquo;Art
and Biology,&rdquo; &ldquo;Critics and Test-tubes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Star-dust,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dignity of Usury,&rdquo;&mdash;to raise
storms and rumblings and mutterings that were many a day in dying down.
</p>

<p>
Editors wrote to him telling him to name his own terms, which he did, but it
was always for work performed. He refused resolutely to pledge himself to any
new thing. The thought of again setting pen to paper maddened him. He had seen
Brissenden torn to pieces by the crowd, and despite the fact that him the crowd
acclaimed, he could not get over the shock nor gather any respect for the
crowd. His very popularity seemed a disgrace and a treason to Brissenden. It
made him wince, but he made up his mind to go on and fill the money-bag.
</p>

<p>
He received letters from editors like the following: &ldquo;About a year ago we
were unfortunate enough to refuse your collection of love-poems. We were
greatly impressed by them at the time, but certain arrangements already entered
into prevented our taking them. If you still have them, and if you will be kind
enough to forward them, we shall be glad to publish the entire collection on
your own terms. We are also prepared to make a most advantageous offer for
bringing them out in book-form.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin recollected his blank-verse tragedy, and sent it instead. He read it
over before mailing, and was particularly impressed by its sophomoric
amateurishness and general worthlessness. But he sent it; and it was published,
to the everlasting regret of the editor. The public was indignant and
incredulous. It was too far a cry from Martin Eden&rsquo;s high standard to
that serious bosh. It was asserted that he had never written it, that the
magazine had faked it very clumsily, or that Martin Eden was emulating the
elder Dumas and at the height of success was hiring his writing done for him.
But when he explained that the tragedy was an early effort of his literary
childhood, and that the magazine had refused to be happy unless it got it, a
great laugh went up at the magazine&rsquo;s expense and a change in the
editorship followed. The tragedy was never brought out in book-form, though
Martin pocketed the advance royalties that had been paid.
</p>

<p>
<i>Coleman&rsquo;s Weekly</i> sent Martin a lengthy telegram, costing nearly
three hundred dollars, offering him a thousand dollars an article for twenty
articles. He was to travel over the United States, with all expenses paid, and
select whatever topics interested him. The body of the telegram was devoted to
hypothetical topics in order to show him the freedom of range that was to be
his. The only restriction placed upon him was that he must confine himself to
the United States. Martin sent his inability to accept and his regrets by wire
&ldquo;collect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wiki-Wiki,&rdquo; published in <i>Warren&rsquo;s Monthly</i>, was an
instantaneous success. It was brought out forward in a wide-margined,
beautifully decorated volume that struck the holiday trade and sold like
wildfire. The critics were unanimous in the belief that it would take its place
with those two classics by two great writers, &ldquo;The Bottle Imp&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Magic Skin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The public, however, received the &ldquo;Smoke of Joy&rdquo; collection rather
dubiously and coldly. The audacity and unconventionality of the storiettes was
a shock to bourgeois morality and prejudice; but when Paris went mad over the
immediate translation that was made, the American and English reading public
followed suit and bought so many copies that Martin compelled the conservative
house of Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co. to pay a flat royalty of twenty-five per
cent for a third book, and thirty per cent flat for a fourth. These two volumes
comprised all the short stories he had written and which had received, or were
receiving, serial publication. &ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo; and his horror
stories constituted one collection; the other collection was composed of
&ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pot,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wine of Life,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Whirlpool,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Jostling Street,&rdquo; and four other
stories. The Lowell-Meredith Company captured the collection of all his essays,
and the Maxmillian Company got his &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Love-cycle,&rdquo; the latter receiving serial publication in the
<i>Ladies&rsquo; Home Companion</i> after the payment of an extortionate price.
</p>

<p>
Martin heaved a sigh of relief when he had disposed of the last manuscript. The
grass-walled castle and the white, coppered schooner were very near to him.
Well, at any rate he had discovered Brissenden&rsquo;s contention that nothing
of merit found its way into the magazines. His own success demonstrated that
Brissenden had been wrong.
</p>

<p>
And yet, somehow, he had a feeling that Brissenden had been right, after all.
&ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; had been the cause of his success more than
the stuff he had written. That stuff had been merely incidental. It had been
rejected right and left by the magazines. The publication of &ldquo;The Shame
of the Sun&rdquo; had started a controversy and precipitated the landslide in
his favor. Had there been no &ldquo;Shame of the Sun&rdquo; there would have
been no landslide, and had there been no miracle in the go of &ldquo;The Shame
of the Sun&rdquo; there would have been no landslide. Singletree, Darnley &amp;
Co. attested that miracle. They had brought out a first edition of fifteen
hundred copies and been dubious of selling it. They were experienced publishers
and no one had been more astounded than they at the success which had followed.
To them it had been in truth a miracle. They never got over it, and every
letter they wrote him reflected their reverent awe of that first mysterious
happening. They did not attempt to explain it. There was no explaining it. It
had happened. In the face of all experience to the contrary, it had happened.
</p>

<p>
So it was, reasoning thus, that Martin questioned the validity of his
popularity. It was the bourgeoisie that bought his books and poured its gold
into his money-sack, and from what little he knew of the bourgeoisie it was not
clear to him how it could possibly appreciate or comprehend what he had
written. His intrinsic beauty and power meant nothing to the hundreds of
thousands who were acclaiming him and buying his books. He was the fad of the
hour, the adventurer who had stormed Parnassus while the gods nodded. The
hundreds of thousands read him and acclaimed him with the same brute
non-understanding with which they had flung themselves on Brissenden&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; and torn it to pieces&mdash;a wolf-rabble that fawned on
him instead of fanging him. Fawn or fang, it was all a matter of chance. One
thing he knew with absolute certitude: &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was infinitely
greater than anything he had done. It was infinitely greater than anything he
had in him. It was a poem of centuries. Then the tribute the mob paid him was a
sorry tribute indeed, for that same mob had wallowed &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo;
into the mire. He sighed heavily and with satisfaction. He was glad the last
manuscript was sold and that he would soon be done with it all.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap44"></a>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<p>
Mr. Morse met Martin in the office of the Hotel Metropole. Whether he had
happened there just casually, intent on other affairs, or whether he had come
there for the direct purpose of inviting him to dinner, Martin never could
quite make up his mind, though he inclined toward the second hypothesis. At any
rate, invited to dinner he was by Mr. Morse&mdash;Ruth&rsquo;s father, who had
forbidden him the house and broken off the engagement.
</p>

<p>
Martin was not angry. He was not even on his dignity. He tolerated Mr. Morse,
wondering the while how it felt to eat such humble pie. He did not decline the
invitation. Instead, he put it off with vagueness and indefiniteness and
inquired after the family, particularly after Mrs. Morse and Ruth. He spoke her
name without hesitancy, naturally, though secretly surprised that he had had no
inward quiver, no old, familiar increase of pulse and warm surge of blood.
</p>

<p>
He had many invitations to dinner, some of which he accepted. Persons got
themselves introduced to him in order to invite him to dinner. And he went on
puzzling over the little thing that was becoming a great thing. Bernard
Higginbotham invited him to dinner. He puzzled the harder. He remembered the
days of his desperate starvation when no one invited him to dinner. That was
the time he needed dinners, and went weak and faint for lack of them and lost
weight from sheer famine. That was the paradox of it. When he wanted dinners,
no one gave them to him, and now that he could buy a hundred thousand dinners
and was losing his appetite, dinners were thrust upon him right and left. But
why? There was no justice in it, no merit on his part. He was no different. All
the work he had done was even at that time work performed. Mr. and Mrs. Morse
had condemned him for an idler and a shirk and through Ruth had urged that he
take a clerk&rsquo;s position in an office. Furthermore, they had been aware of
his work performed. Manuscript after manuscript of his had been turned over to
them by Ruth. They had read them. It was the very same work that had put his
name in all the papers, and, it was his name being in all the papers that led
them to invite him.
</p>

<p>
One thing was certain: the Morses had not cared to have him for himself or for
his work. Therefore they could not want him now for himself or for his work,
but for the fame that was his, because he was somebody amongst men,
and&mdash;why not?&mdash;because he had a hundred thousand dollars or so. That
was the way bourgeois society valued a man, and who was he to expect it
otherwise? But he was proud. He disdained such valuation. He desired to be
valued for himself, or for his work, which, after all, was an expression of
himself. That was the way Lizzie valued him. The work, with her, did not even
count. She valued him, himself. That was the way Jimmy, the plumber, and all
the old gang valued him. That had been proved often enough in the days when he
ran with them; it had been proved that Sunday at Shell Mound Park. His work
could go hang. What they liked, and were willing to scrap for, was just Mart
Eden, one of the bunch and a pretty good guy.
</p>

<p>
Then there was Ruth. She had liked him for himself, that was indisputable. And
yet, much as she had liked him she had liked the bourgeois standard of
valuation more. She had opposed his writing, and principally, it seemed to him,
because it did not earn money. That had been her criticism of his
&ldquo;Love-cycle.&rdquo; She, too, had urged him to get a job. It was true,
she refined it to &ldquo;position,&rdquo; but it meant the same thing, and in
his own mind the old nomenclature stuck. He had read her all that he
wrote&mdash;poems, stories, essays&mdash;&ldquo;Wiki-Wiki,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Shame of the Sun,&rdquo; everything. And she had always and consistently urged
him to get a job, to go to work&mdash;good God!&mdash;as if he hadn&rsquo;t
been working, robbing sleep, exhausting life, in order to be worthy of her.
</p>

<p>
So the little thing grew bigger. He was healthy and normal, ate regularly,
slept long hours, and yet the growing little thing was becoming an obsession.
<i>Work performed</i>. The phrase haunted his brain. He sat opposite Bernard
Higginbotham at a heavy Sunday dinner over Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store, and
it was all he could do to restrain himself from shouting out:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was work performed! And now you feed me, when then you let me starve,
forbade me your house, and damned me because I wouldn&rsquo;t get a job. And
the work was already done, all done. And now, when I speak, you check the
thought unuttered on your lips and hang on my lips and pay respectful attention
to whatever I choose to say. I tell you your party is rotten and filled with
grafters, and instead of flying into a rage you hum and haw and admit there is
a great deal in what I say. And why? Because I&rsquo;m famous; because
I&rsquo;ve a lot of money. Not because I&rsquo;m Martin Eden, a pretty good
fellow and not particularly a fool. I could tell you the moon is made of green
cheese and you would subscribe to the notion, at least you would not repudiate
it, because I&rsquo;ve got dollars, mountains of them. And it was all done long
ago; it was work performed, I tell you, when you spat upon me as the dirt under
your feet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Martin did not shout out. The thought gnawed in his brain, an unceasing
torment, while he smiled and succeeded in being tolerant. As he grew silent,
Bernard Higginbotham got the reins and did the talking. He was a success
himself, and proud of it. He was self-made. No one had helped him. He owed no
man. He was fulfilling his duty as a citizen and bringing up a large family.
And there was Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store, that monument of his own
industry and ability. He loved Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store as some men
loved their wives. He opened up his heart to Martin, showed with what keenness
and with what enormous planning he had made the store. And he had plans for it,
ambitious plans. The neighborhood was growing up fast. The store was really too
small. If he had more room, he would be able to put in a score of labor-saving
and money-saving improvements. And he would do it yet. He was straining every
effort for the day when he could buy the adjoining lot and put up another
two-story frame building. The upstairs he could rent, and the whole
ground-floor of both buildings would be Higginbotham&rsquo;s Cash Store. His
eyes glistened when he spoke of the new sign that would stretch clear across
both buildings.
</p>

<p>
Martin forgot to listen. The refrain of &ldquo;Work performed,&rdquo; in his
own brain, was drowning the other&rsquo;s clatter. The refrain maddened him,
and he tried to escape from it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How much did you say it would cost?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
His brother-in-law paused in the middle of an expatiation on the business
opportunities of the neighborhood. He hadn&rsquo;t said how much it would cost.
But he knew. He had figured it out a score of times.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the way lumber is now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;four thousand could do
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Including the sign?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t count on that. It&rsquo;d just have to come, onc&rsquo;t
the buildin&rsquo; was there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the ground?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three thousand more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leaned forward, licking his lips, nervously spreading and closing his
fingers, while he watched Martin write a check. When it was passed over to him,
he glanced at the amount-seven thousand dollars.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t afford to pay more than six per cent,&rdquo; he
said huskily.
</p>

<p>
Martin wanted to laugh, but, instead, demanded:-
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How much would that be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lemme see. Six per cent&mdash;six times seven&mdash;four hundred
an&rsquo; twenty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would be thirty-five dollars a month, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Higginbotham nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, if you&rsquo;ve no objection, we&rsquo;ll arrange it this
way.&rdquo; Martin glanced at Gertrude. &ldquo;You can have the principal to
keep for yourself, if you&rsquo;ll use the thirty-five dollars a month for
cooking and washing and scrubbing. The seven thousand is yours if you&rsquo;ll
guarantee that Gertrude does no more drudgery. Is it a go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Higginbotham swallowed hard. That his wife should do no more housework was
an affront to his thrifty soul. The magnificent present was the coating of a
pill, a bitter pill. That his wife should not work! It gagged him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay the
thirty-five a month, and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He reached across the table for the check. But Bernard Higginbotham got his
hand on it first, crying:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I accept! I accept!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Martin got on the electric car, he was very sick and tired. He looked up
at the assertive sign.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The swine,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;The swine, the swine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s Magazine</i> published &ldquo;The Palmist,&rdquo;
featuring it with decorations by Berthier and with two pictures by Wenn,
Hermann von Schmidt forgot that he had called the verses obscene. He announced
that his wife had inspired the poem, saw to it that the news reached the ears
of a reporter, and submitted to an interview by a staff writer who was
accompanied by a staff photographer and a staff artist. The result was a full
page in a Sunday supplement, filled with photographs and idealized drawings of
Marian, with many intimate details of Martin Eden and his family, and with the
full text of &ldquo;The Palmist&rdquo; in large type, and republished by
special permission of <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s Magazine</i>. It caused quite a
stir in the neighborhood, and good housewives were proud to have the
acquaintances of the great writer&rsquo;s sister, while those who had not made
haste to cultivate it. Hermann von Schmidt chuckled in his little repair shop
and decided to order a new lathe. &ldquo;Better than advertising,&rdquo; he
told Marian, &ldquo;and it costs nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better have him to dinner,&rdquo; she suggested.
</p>

<p>
And to dinner Martin came, making himself agreeable with the fat wholesale
butcher and his fatter wife&mdash;important folk, they, likely to be of use to
a rising young man like Hermann von Schmidt. No less a bait, however, had been
required to draw them to his house than his great brother-in-law. Another man
at table who had swallowed the same bait was the superintendent of the Pacific
Coast agencies for the Asa Bicycle Company. Him Von Schmidt desired to please
and propitiate because from him could be obtained the Oakland agency for the
bicycle. So Hermann von Schmidt found it a goodly asset to have Martin for a
brother-in-law, but in his heart of hearts he couldn&rsquo;t understand where
it all came in. In the silent watches of the night, while his wife slept, he
had floundered through Martin&rsquo;s books and poems, and decided that the
world was a fool to buy them.
</p>

<p>
And in his heart of hearts Martin understood the situation only too well, as he
leaned back and gloated at Von Schmidt&rsquo;s head, in fancy punching it
well-nigh off of him, sending blow after blow home just right&mdash;the
chuckle-headed Dutchman! One thing he did like about him, however. Poor as he
was, and determined to rise as he was, he nevertheless hired one servant to
take the heavy work off of Marian&rsquo;s hands. Martin talked with the
superintendent of the Asa agencies, and after dinner he drew him aside with
Hermann, whom he backed financially for the best bicycle store with fittings in
Oakland. He went further, and in a private talk with Hermann told him to keep
his eyes open for an automobile agency and garage, for there was no reason that
he should not be able to run both establishments successfully.
</p>

<p>
With tears in her eyes and her arms around his neck, Marian, at parting, told
Martin how much she loved him and always had loved him. It was true, there was
a perceptible halt midway in her assertion, which she glossed over with more
tears and kisses and incoherent stammerings, and which Martin inferred to be
her appeal for forgiveness for the time she had lacked faith in him and
insisted on his getting a job.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t never keep his money, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; Hermann
von Schmidt confided to his wife. &ldquo;He got mad when I spoke of interest,
an&rsquo; he said damn the principal and if I mentioned it again, he&rsquo;d
punch my Dutch head off. That&rsquo;s what he said&mdash;my Dutch head. But
he&rsquo;s all right, even if he ain&rsquo;t no business man. He&rsquo;s given
me my chance, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Invitations to dinner poured in on Martin; and the more they poured, the more
he puzzled. He sat, the guest of honor, at an Arden Club banquet, with men of
note whom he had heard about and read about all his life; and they told him
how, when they had read &ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo; in the
<i>Transcontinental</i>, and &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; in <i>The
Hornet</i>, they had immediately picked him for a winner. My God! and I was
hungry and in rags, he thought to himself. Why didn&rsquo;t you give me a
dinner then? Then was the time. It was work performed. If you are feeding me
now for work performed, why did you not feed me then when I needed it? Not one
word in &ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo; nor in &ldquo;The Peri and the
Pearl&rdquo; has been changed. No; you&rsquo;re not feeding me now for work
performed. You are feeding me because everybody else is feeding me and because
it is an honor to feed me. You are feeding me now because you are herd animals;
because you are part of the mob; because the one blind, automatic thought in
the mob-mind just now is to feed me. And where does Martin Eden and the work
Martin Eden performed come in in all this? he asked himself plaintively, then
arose to respond cleverly and wittily to a clever and witty toast.
</p>

<p>
So it went. Wherever he happened to be&mdash;at the Press Club, at the Redwood
Club, at pink teas and literary gatherings&mdash;always were remembered
&ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; when
they were first published. And always was Martin&rsquo;s maddening and
unuttered demand: Why didn&rsquo;t you feed me then? It was work performed.
&ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; are
not changed one iota. They were just as artistic, just as worth while, then as
now. But you are not feeding me for their sake, nor for the sake of anything
else I have written. You&rsquo;re feeding me because it is the style of feeding
just now, because the whole mob is crazy with the idea of feeding Martin Eden.
</p>

<p>
And often, at such times, he would abruptly see slouch in among the company a
young hoodlum in square-cut coat and under a stiff-rim Stetson hat. It happened
to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon. As he rose from his
chair and stepped forward across the platform, he saw stalk through the wide
door at the rear of the great room the young hoodlum with the square-cut coat
and stiff-rim hat. Five hundred fashionably gowned women turned their heads, so
intent and steadfast was Martin&rsquo;s gaze, to see what he was seeing. But
they saw only the empty centre aisle. He saw the young tough lurching down that
aisle and wondered if he would remove the stiff-rim which never yet had he seen
him without. Straight down the aisle he came, and up the platform. Martin could
have wept over that youthful shade of himself, when he thought of all that lay
before him. Across the platform he swaggered, right up to Martin, and into the
foreground of Martin&rsquo;s consciousness disappeared. The five hundred women
applauded softly with gloved hands, seeking to encourage the bashful great man
who was their guest. And Martin shook the vision from his brain, smiled, and
began to speak.
</p>

<p>
The Superintendent of Schools, good old man, stopped Martin on the street and
remembered him, recalling seances in his office when Martin was expelled from
school for fighting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I read your &lsquo;Ring of Bells&rsquo; in one of the magazines quite a
time ago,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was as good as Poe. Splendid, I said at the
time, splendid!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yes, and twice in the months that followed you passed me on the street and did
not know me, Martin almost said aloud. Each time I was hungry and heading for
the pawnbroker. Yet it was work performed. You did not know me then. Why do you
know me now?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was remarking to my wife only the other day,&rdquo; the other was
saying, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to have you out to dinner some
time? And she quite agreed with me. Yes, she quite agreed with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dinner?&rdquo; Martin said so sharply that it was almost a snarl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, yes, yes, dinner, you know&mdash;just pot luck with us, with your
old superintendent, you rascal,&rdquo; he uttered nervously, poking Martin in
an attempt at jocular fellowship.
</p>

<p>
Martin went down the street in a daze. He stopped at the corner and looked
about him vacantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; he murmured at last. &ldquo;The old
fellow was afraid of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap45"></a>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<p>
Kreis came to Martin one day&mdash;Kreis, of the &ldquo;real dirt&rdquo;; and
Martin turned to him with relief, to receive the glowing details of a scheme
sufficiently wild-catty to interest him as a fictionist rather than an
investor. Kreis paused long enough in the midst of his exposition to tell him
that in most of his &ldquo;Shame of the Sun&rdquo; he had been a chump.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t come here to spout philosophy,&rdquo; Kreis went on.
&ldquo;What I want to know is whether or not you will put a thousand dollars in
on this deal?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not chump enough for that, at any rate,&rdquo; Martin
answered. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do. You gave me the
greatest night of my life. You gave me what money cannot buy. Now I&rsquo;ve
got money, and it means nothing to me. I&rsquo;d like to turn over to you a
thousand dollars of what I don&rsquo;t value for what you gave me that night
and which was beyond price. You need the money. I&rsquo;ve got more than I
need. You want it. You came for it. There&rsquo;s no use scheming it out of me.
Take it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kreis betrayed no surprise. He folded the check away in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At that rate I&rsquo;d like the contract of providing you with many such
nights,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too late.&rdquo; Martin shook his head. &ldquo;That night was the one
night for me. I was in paradise. It&rsquo;s commonplace with you, I know. But
it wasn&rsquo;t to me. I shall never live at such a pitch again. I&rsquo;m done
with philosophy. I want never to hear another word of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The first dollar I ever made in my life out of my philosophy,&rdquo;
Kreis remarked, as he paused in the doorway. &ldquo;And then the market
broke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Morse drove by Martin on the street one day, and smiled and nodded. He
smiled back and lifted his hat. The episode did not affect him. A month before
it might have disgusted him, or made him curious and set him to speculating
about her state of consciousness at that moment. But now it was not provocative
of a second thought. He forgot about it the next moment. He forgot about it as
he would have forgotten the Central Bank Building or the City Hall after having
walked past them. Yet his mind was preternaturally active. His thoughts went
ever around and around in a circle. The centre of that circle was &ldquo;work
performed&rdquo;; it ate at his brain like a deathless maggot. He awoke to it
in the morning. It tormented his dreams at night. Every affair of life around
him that penetrated through his senses immediately related itself to
&ldquo;work performed.&rdquo; He drove along the path of relentless logic to
the conclusion that he was nobody, nothing. Mart Eden, the hoodlum, and Mart
Eden, the sailor, had been real, had been he; but Martin Eden! the famous
writer, did not exist. Martin Eden, the famous writer, was a vapor that had
arisen in the mob-mind and by the mob-mind had been thrust into the corporeal
being of Mart Eden, the hoodlum and sailor. But it couldn&rsquo;t fool him. He
was not that sun-myth that the mob was worshipping and sacrificing dinners to.
He knew better.
</p>

<p>
He read the magazines about himself, and pored over portraits of himself
published therein until he was unable to associate his identity with those
portraits. He was the fellow who had lived and thrilled and loved; who had been
easy-going and tolerant of the frailties of life; who had served in the
forecastle, wandered in strange lands, and led his gang in the old fighting
days. He was the fellow who had been stunned at first by the thousands of books
in the free library, and who had afterward learned his way among them and
mastered them; he was the fellow who had burned the midnight oil and bedded
with a spur and written books himself. But the one thing he was not was that
colossal appetite that all the mob was bent upon feeding.
</p>

<p>
There were things, however, in the magazines that amused him. All the magazines
were claiming him. <i>Warren&rsquo;s Monthly</i> advertised to its subscribers
that it was always on the quest after new writers, and that, among others, it
had introduced Martin Eden to the reading public. <i>The White Mouse</i>
claimed him; so did <i>The Northern Review</i> and <i>Mackintosh&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, until silenced by <i>The Globe</i>, which pointed triumphantly to
its files where the mangled &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; lay buried. <i>Youth and
Age</i>, which had come to life again after having escaped paying its bills,
put in a prior claim, which nobody but farmers&rsquo; children ever read. The
<i>Transcontinental</i> made a dignified and convincing statement of how it
first discovered Martin Eden, which was warmly disputed by <i>The Hornet</i>,
with the exhibit of &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl.&rdquo; The modest claim of
Singletree, Darnley &amp; Co. was lost in the din. Besides, that publishing
firm did not own a magazine wherewith to make its claim less modest.
</p>

<p>
The newspapers calculated Martin&rsquo;s royalties. In some way the magnificent
offers certain magazines had made him leaked out, and Oakland ministers called
upon him in a friendly way, while professional begging letters began to clutter
his mail. But worse than all this were the women. His photographs were
published broadcast, and special writers exploited his strong, bronzed face,
his scars, his heavy shoulders, his clear, quiet eyes, and the slight hollows
in his cheeks like an ascetic&rsquo;s. At this last he remembered his wild
youth and smiled. Often, among the women he met, he would see now one, now
another, looking at him, appraising him, selecting him. He laughed to himself.
He remembered Brissenden&rsquo;s warning and laughed again. The women would
never destroy him, that much was certain. He had gone past that stage.
</p>

<p>
Once, walking with Lizzie toward night school, she caught a glance directed
toward him by a well-gowned, handsome woman of the bourgeoisie. The glance was
a trifle too long, a shade too considerative. Lizzie knew it for what it was,
and her body tensed angrily. Martin noticed, noticed the cause of it, told her
how used he was becoming to it and that he did not care anyway.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to care,&rdquo; she answered with blazing eyes.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never healthier in my life. I weigh five pounds more than I ever
did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t your body. It&rsquo;s your head. Something&rsquo;s wrong
with your think-machine. Even I can see that, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t
nobody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked on beside her, reflecting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything to see you get over it,&rdquo; she broke out
impulsively. &ldquo;You ought to care when women look at you that way, a man
like you. It&rsquo;s not natural. It&rsquo;s all right enough for sissy-boys.
But you ain&rsquo;t made that way. So help me, I&rsquo;d be willing an&rsquo;
glad if the right woman came along an&rsquo; made you care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he left Lizzie at night school, he returned to the Metropole.
</p>

<p>
Once in his rooms, he dropped into a Morris chair and sat staring straight
before him. He did not doze. Nor did he think. His mind was a blank, save for
the intervals when unsummoned memory pictures took form and color and radiance
just under his eyelids. He saw these pictures, but he was scarcely conscious of
them&mdash;no more so than if they had been dreams. Yet he was not asleep.
Once, he roused himself and glanced at his watch. It was just eight
o&rsquo;clock. He had nothing to do, and it was too early for bed. Then his
mind went blank again, and the pictures began to form and vanish under his
eyelids. There was nothing distinctive about the pictures. They were always
masses of leaves and shrub-like branches shot through with hot sunshine.
</p>

<p>
A knock at the door aroused him. He was not asleep, and his mind immediately
connected the knock with a telegram, or letter, or perhaps one of the servants
bringing back clean clothes from the laundry. He was thinking about Joe and
wondering where he was, as he said, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was still thinking about Joe, and did not turn toward the door. He heard it
close softly. There was a long silence. He forgot that there had been a knock
at the door, and was still staring blankly before him when he heard a
woman&rsquo;s sob. It was involuntary, spasmodic, checked, and stifled&mdash;he
noted that as he turned about. The next instant he was on his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ruth!&rdquo; he said, amazed and bewildered.
</p>

<p>
Her face was white and strained. She stood just inside the door, one hand
against it for support, the other pressed to her side. She extended both hands
toward him piteously, and started forward to meet him. As he caught her hands
and led her to the Morris chair he noticed how cold they were. He drew up
another chair and sat down on the broad arm of it. He was too confused to
speak. In his own mind his affair with Ruth was closed and sealed. He felt much
in the same way that he would have felt had the Shelly Hot Springs Laundry
suddenly invaded the Hotel Metropole with a whole week&rsquo;s washing ready
for him to pitch into. Several times he was about to speak, and each time he
hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No one knows I am here,&rdquo; Ruth said in a faint voice, with an
appealing smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was surprised at the sound of his own voice.
</p>

<p>
She repeated her words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, then wondered what more he could possibly say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw you come in, and I waited a few minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said again.
</p>

<p>
He had never been so tongue-tied in his life. Positively he did not have an
idea in his head. He felt stupid and awkward, but for the life of him he could
think of nothing to say. It would have been easier had the intrusion been the
Shelly Hot Springs laundry. He could have rolled up his sleeves and gone to
work.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then you came in,&rdquo; he said finally.
</p>

<p>
She nodded, with a slightly arch expression, and loosened the scarf at her
throat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw you first from across the street when you were with that
girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;I took her down to night
school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me?&rdquo; she said at the end of
another silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; He spoke hastily. &ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t it rash of
you to come here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I slipped in. Nobody knows I am here. I wanted to see you. I came to
tell you I have been very foolish. I came because I could no longer stay away,
because my heart compelled me to come, because&mdash;because I wanted to
come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She came forward, out of her chair and over to him. She rested her hand on his
shoulder a moment, breathing quickly, and then slipped into his arms. And in
his large, easy way, desirous of not inflicting hurt, knowing that to repulse
this proffer of herself was to inflict the most grievous hurt a woman could
receive, he folded his arms around her and held her close. But there was no
warmth in the embrace, no caress in the contact. She had come into his arms,
and he held her, that was all. She nestled against him, and then, with a change
of position, her hands crept up and rested upon his neck. But his flesh was not
fire beneath those hands, and he felt awkward and uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What makes you tremble so?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is it a chill? Shall
I light the grate?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He made a movement to disengage himself, but she clung more closely to him,
shivering violently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is merely nervousness,&rdquo; she said with chattering teeth.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll control myself in a minute. There, I am better
already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Slowly her shivering died away. He continued to hold her, but he was no longer
puzzled. He knew now for what she had come.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My mother wanted me to marry Charley Hapgood,&rdquo; she announced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Charley Hapgood, that fellow who speaks always in platitudes?&rdquo;
Martin groaned. Then he added, &ldquo;And now, I suppose, your mother wants you
to marry me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not put it in the form of a question. He stated it as a certitude, and
before his eyes began to dance the rows of figures of his royalties.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She will not object, I know that much,&rdquo; Ruth said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She considers me quite eligible?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ruth nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And yet I am not a bit more eligible now than I was when she broke our
engagement,&rdquo; he meditated. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t changed any. I&rsquo;m
the same Martin Eden, though for that matter I&rsquo;m a bit worse&mdash;I
smoke now. Don&rsquo;t you smell my breath?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In reply she pressed her open fingers against his lips, placed them graciously
and playfully, and in expectancy of the kiss that of old had always been a
consequence. But there was no caressing answer of Martin&rsquo;s lips. He
waited until the fingers were removed and then went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not changed. I haven&rsquo;t got a job. I&rsquo;m not looking for a
job. Furthermore, I am not going to look for a job. And I still believe that
Herbert Spencer is a great and noble man and that Judge Blount is an
unmitigated ass. I had dinner with him the other night, so I ought to
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t accept father&rsquo;s invitation,&rdquo; she
chided.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you know about that? Who sent him? Your mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She remained silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then she did send him. I thought so. And now I suppose she has sent
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No one knows that I am here,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Do you think
my mother would permit this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;d permit you to marry me, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a sharp cry. &ldquo;Oh, Martin, don&rsquo;t be cruel. You have not
kissed me once. You are as unresponsive as a stone. And think what I have dared
to do.&rdquo; She looked about her with a shiver, though half the look was
curiosity. &ldquo;Just think of where I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I could die for you! I could die for
you</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;Lizzie&rsquo;s words were ringing in his ears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you dare it before?&rdquo; he asked harshly.
&ldquo;When I hadn&rsquo;t a job? When I was starving? When I was just as I am
now, as a man, as an artist, the same Martin Eden? That&rsquo;s the question
I&rsquo;ve been propounding to myself for many a day&mdash;not concerning you
merely, but concerning everybody. You see I have not changed, though my sudden
apparent appreciation in value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that
point. I&rsquo;ve got the same flesh on my bones, the same ten fingers and
toes. I am the same. I have not developed any new strength nor virtue. My brain
is the same old brain. I haven&rsquo;t made even one new generalization on
literature or philosophy. I am personally of the same value that I was when
nobody wanted me. And what is puzzling me is why they want me now. Surely they
don&rsquo;t want me for myself, for myself is the same old self they did not
want. Then they must want me for something else, for something that is outside
of me, for something that is not I! Shall I tell you what that something is? It
is for the recognition I have received. That recognition is not I. It resides
in the minds of others. Then again for the money I have earned and am earning.
But that money is not I. It resides in banks and in the pockets of Tom, Dick,
and Harry. And is it for that, for the recognition and the money, that you now
want me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are breaking my heart,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;You know I love
you, that I am here because I love you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid you don&rsquo;t see my point,&rdquo; he said gently.
&ldquo;What I mean is: if you love me, how does it happen that you love me now
so much more than you did when your love was weak enough to deny me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forget and forgive,&rdquo; she cried passionately. &ldquo;I loved you
all the time, remember that, and I am here, now, in your arms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I am a shrewd merchant, peering into the scales, trying
to weigh your love and find out what manner of thing it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She withdrew herself from his arms, sat upright, and looked at him long and
searchingly. She was about to speak, then faltered and changed her mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, it appears this way to me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;When I was
all that I am now, nobody out of my own class seemed to care for me. When my
books were all written, no one who had read the manuscripts seemed to care for
them. In point of fact, because of the stuff I had written they seemed to care
even less for me. In writing the stuff it seemed that I had committed acts that
were, to say the least, derogatory. &lsquo;Get a job,&rsquo; everybody
said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She made a movement of dissent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;except in your case you told me to get
a position. The homely word <i>job</i>, like much that I have written, offends
you. It is brutal. But I assure you it was no less brutal to me when everybody
I knew recommended it to me as they would recommend right conduct to an immoral
creature. But to return. The publication of what I had written, and the public
notice I received, wrought a change in the fibre of your love. Martin Eden,
with his work all performed, you would not marry. Your love for him was not
strong enough to enable you to marry him. But your love is now strong enough,
and I cannot avoid the conclusion that its strength arises from the publication
and the public notice. In your case I do not mention royalties, though I am
certain that they apply to the change wrought in your mother and father. Of
course, all this is not flattering to me. But worst of all, it makes me
question love, sacred love. Is love so gross a thing that it must feed upon
publication and public notice? It would seem so. I have sat and thought upon it
till my head went around.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor, dear head.&rdquo; She reached up a hand and passed the fingers
soothingly through his hair. &ldquo;Let it go around no more. Let us begin
anew, now. I loved you all the time. I know that I was weak in yielding to my
mother&rsquo;s will. I should not have done so. Yet I have heard you speak so
often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of humankind. Extend
that charity to me. I acted mistakenly. Forgive me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I do forgive,&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;It is easy to
forgive where there is really nothing to forgive. Nothing that you have done
requires forgiveness. One acts according to one&rsquo;s lights, and more than
that one cannot do. As well might I ask you to forgive me for my not getting a
job.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I meant well,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You know that I could not
have loved you and not meant well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True; but you would have destroyed me out of your well-meaning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he shut off her attempted objection. &ldquo;You would
have destroyed my writing and my career. Realism is imperative to my nature,
and the bourgeois spirit hates realism. The bourgeoisie is cowardly. It is
afraid of life. And all your effort was to make me afraid of life. You would
have formalized me. You would have compressed me into a two-by-four pigeonhole
of life, where all life&rsquo;s values are unreal, and false, and
vulgar.&rdquo; He felt her stir protestingly. &ldquo;Vulgarity&mdash;a hearty
vulgarity, I&rsquo;ll admit&mdash;is the basis of bourgeois refinement and
culture. As I say, you wanted to formalize me, to make me over into one of your
own class, with your class-ideals, class-values, and class-prejudices.&rdquo;
He shook his head sadly. &ldquo;And you do not understand, even now, what I am
saying. My words do not mean to you what I endeavor to make them mean. What I
say is so much fantasy to you. Yet to me it is vital reality. At the best you
are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw boy, crawling up out of the mire
of the abyss, should pass judgment upon your class and call it vulgar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She leaned her head wearily against his shoulder, and her body shivered with
recurrent nervousness. He waited for a time for her to speak, and then went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now you want to renew our love. You want us to be married. You want
me. And yet, listen&mdash;if my books had not been noticed, I&rsquo;d
nevertheless have been just what I am now. And you would have stayed away. It
is all those damned books&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swear,&rdquo; she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Her reproof startled him. He broke into a harsh laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at a high moment, when what
seems your life&rsquo;s happiness is at stake, you are afraid of life in the
same old way&mdash;afraid of life and a healthy oath.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was stung by his words into realization of the puerility of her act, and
yet she felt that he had magnified it unduly and was consequently resentful.
They sat in silence for a long time, she thinking desperately and he pondering
upon his love which had departed. He knew, now, that he had not really loved
her. It was an idealized Ruth he had loved, an ethereal creature of his own
creating, the bright and luminous spirit of his love-poems. The real bourgeois
Ruth, with all the bourgeois failings and with the hopeless cramp of the
bourgeois psychology in her mind, he had never loved.
</p>

<p>
She suddenly began to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know that much you have said is so. I have been afraid of life. I did
not love you well enough. I have learned to love better. I love you for what
you are, for what you were, for the ways even by which you have become. I love
you for the ways wherein you differ from what you call my class, for your
beliefs which I do not understand but which I know I can come to understand. I
shall devote myself to understanding them. And even your smoking and your
swearing&mdash;they are part of you and I will love you for them, too. I can
still learn. In the last ten minutes I have learned much. That I have dared to
come here is a token of what I have already learned. Oh, Martin!&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was sobbing and nestling close against him.
</p>

<p>
For the first time his arms folded her gently and with sympathy, and she
acknowledged it with a happy movement and a brightening face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; he said. He remembered Lizzie&rsquo;s words.
&ldquo;I am a sick man&mdash;oh, not my body. It is my soul, my brain. I seem
to have lost all values. I care for nothing. If you had been this way a few
months ago, it would have been different. It is too late, now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not too late,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I will show you. I will
prove to you that my love has grown, that it is greater to me than my class and
all that is dearest to me. All that is dearest to the bourgeoisie I will flout.
I am no longer afraid of life. I will leave my father and mother, and let my
name become a by-word with my friends. I will come to you here and now, in free
love if you will, and I will be proud and glad to be with you. If I have been a
traitor to love, I will now, for love&rsquo;s sake, be a traitor to all that
made that earlier treason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stood before him, with shining eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am waiting, Martin,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;waiting for you to
accept me. Look at me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was splendid, he thought, looking at her. She had redeemed herself for all
that she had lacked, rising up at last, true woman, superior to the iron rule
of bourgeois convention. It was splendid, magnificent, desperate. And yet, what
was the matter with him? He was not thrilled nor stirred by what she had done.
It was splendid and magnificent only intellectually. In what should have been a
moment of fire, he coldly appraised her. His heart was untouched. He was
unaware of any desire for her. Again he remembered Lizzie&rsquo;s words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sick, very sick,&rdquo; he said with a despairing gesture.
&ldquo;How sick I did not know till now. Something has gone out of me. I have
always been unafraid of life, but I never dreamed of being sated with life.
Life has so filled me that I am empty of any desire for anything. If there were
room, I should want you, now. You see how sick I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leaned his head back and closed his eyes; and like a child, crying, that
forgets its grief in watching the sunlight percolate through the tear-dimmed
films over the pupils, so Martin forgot his sickness, the presence of Ruth,
everything, in watching the masses of vegetation, shot through hotly with
sunshine that took form and blazed against this background of his eyelids. It
was not restful, that green foliage. The sunlight was too raw and glaring. It
hurt him to look at it, and yet he looked, he knew not why.
</p>

<p>
He was brought back to himself by the rattle of the door-knob. Ruth was at the
door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How shall I get out?&rdquo; she questioned tearfully. &ldquo;I am
afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, forgive me,&rdquo; he cried, springing to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not myself, you know. I forgot you were here.&rdquo; He put his hand to his
head. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m not just right. I&rsquo;ll take you home. We
can go out by the servants&rsquo; entrance. No one will see us. Pull down that
veil and everything will be all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She clung to his arm through the dim-lighted passages and down the narrow
stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am safe now,&rdquo; she said, when they emerged on the sidewalk, at
the same time starting to take her hand from his arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll see you home,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she objected. &ldquo;It is
unnecessary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again she started to remove her hand. He felt a momentary curiosity. Now that
she was out of danger she was afraid. She was in almost a panic to be quit of
him. He could see no reason for it and attributed it to her nervousness. So he
restrained her withdrawing hand and started to walk on with her. Halfway down
the block, he saw a man in a long overcoat shrink back into a doorway. He shot
a glance in as he passed by, and, despite the high turned-up collar, he was
certain that he recognized Ruth&rsquo;s brother, Norman.
</p>

<p>
During the walk Ruth and Martin held little conversation. She was stunned. He
was apathetic. Once, he mentioned that he was going away, back to the South
Seas, and, once, she asked him to forgive her having come to him. And that was
all. The parting at her door was conventional. They shook hands, said good
night, and he lifted his hat. The door swung shut, and he lighted a cigarette
and turned back for his hotel. When he came to the doorway into which he had
seen Norman shrink, he stopped and looked in in a speculative humor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She lied,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;She made believe to me that she
had dared greatly, and all the while she knew the brother that brought her was
waiting to take her back.&rdquo; He burst into laughter. &ldquo;Oh, these
bourgeois! When I was broke, I was not fit to be seen with his sister. When I
have a bank account, he brings her to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he swung on his heel to go on, a tramp, going in the same direction, begged
him over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say, mister, can you give me a quarter to get a bed?&rdquo; were the
words.
</p>

<p>
But it was the voice that made Martin turn around. The next instant he had Joe
by the hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye remember that time we parted at the Hot Springs?&rdquo; the
other was saying. &ldquo;I said then we&rsquo;d meet again. I felt it in my
bones. An&rsquo; here we are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking good,&rdquo; Martin said admiringly, &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;ve put on weight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I sure have.&rdquo; Joe&rsquo;s face was beaming. &ldquo;I never knew
what it was to live till I hit hoboin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m thirty pounds heavier
an&rsquo; feel tiptop all the time. Why, I was worked to skin an&rsquo; bone in
them old days. Hoboin&rsquo; sure agrees with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re looking for a bed just the same,&rdquo; Martin chided,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a cold night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huh? Lookin&rsquo; for a bed?&rdquo; Joe shot a hand into his hip pocket
and brought it out filled with small change. &ldquo;That beats hard
graft,&rdquo; he exulted. &ldquo;You just looked good; that&rsquo;s why I
battered you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin laughed and gave in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve several full-sized drunks right there,&rdquo; he
insinuated.
</p>

<p>
Joe slid the money back into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in mine,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;No gettin&rsquo; oryide for me,
though there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to stop me except I don&rsquo;t want to.
I&rsquo;ve ben drunk once since I seen you last, an&rsquo; then it was
unexpected, bein&rsquo; on an empty stomach. When I work like a beast, I drink
like a beast. When I live like a man, I drink like a man&mdash;a jolt now
an&rsquo; again when I feel like it, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin arranged to meet him next day, and went on to the hotel. He paused in
the office to look up steamer sailings. The <i>Mariposa</i> sailed for Tahiti
in five days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Telephone over to-morrow and reserve a stateroom for me,&rdquo; he told
the clerk. &ldquo;No deck-stateroom, but down below, on the
weather-side,&mdash;the port-side, remember that, the port-side. You&rsquo;d
better write it down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Once in his room he got into bed and slipped off to sleep as gently as a child.
The occurrences of the evening had made no impression on him. His mind was dead
to impressions. The glow of warmth with which he met Joe had been most
fleeting. The succeeding minute he had been bothered by the
ex-laundryman&rsquo;s presence and by the compulsion of conversation. That in
five more days he sailed for his loved South Seas meant nothing to him. So he
closed his eyes and slept normally and comfortably for eight uninterrupted
hours. He was not restless. He did not change his position, nor did he dream.
Sleep had become to him oblivion, and each day that he awoke, he awoke with
regret. Life worried and bored him, and time was a vexation.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap46"></a>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Say, Joe,&rdquo; was his greeting to his old-time working-mate next
morning, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a Frenchman out on Twenty-eighth Street.
He&rsquo;s made a pot of money, and he&rsquo;s going back to France. It&rsquo;s
a dandy, well-appointed, small steam laundry. There&rsquo;s a start for you if
you want to settle down. Here, take this; buy some clothes with it and be at
this man&rsquo;s office by ten o&rsquo;clock. He looked up the laundry for me,
and he&rsquo;ll take you out and show you around. If you like it, and think it
is worth the price&mdash;twelve thousand&mdash;let me know and it is yours. Now
run along. I&rsquo;m busy. I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now look here, Mart,&rdquo; the other said slowly, with kindling anger,
&ldquo;I come here this mornin&rsquo; to see you. Savve? I didn&rsquo;t come
here to get no laundry. I come here for a talk for old friends&rsquo; sake, and
you shove a laundry at me. I tell you what you can do. You can take that
laundry an&rsquo; go to hell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was out of the room when Martin caught him and whirled him around.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now look here, Joe,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if you act that way,
I&rsquo;ll punch your head. And for old friends&rsquo; sake I&rsquo;ll punch it
hard. Savve?&mdash;you will, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Joe had clinched and attempted to throw him, and he was twisting and writhing
out of the advantage of the other&rsquo;s hold. They reeled about the room,
locked in each other&rsquo;s arms, and came down with a crash across the
splintered wreckage of a wicker chair. Joe was underneath, with arms spread out
and held and with Martin&rsquo;s knee on his chest. He was panting and gasping
for breath when Martin released him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll talk a moment,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t get fresh with me. I want that laundry business finished first of
all. Then you can come back and we&rsquo;ll talk for old sake&rsquo;s sake. I
told you I was busy. Look at that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A servant had just come in with the morning mail, a great mass of letters and
magazines.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I wade through that and talk with you? You go and fix up that
laundry, and then we&rsquo;ll get together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Joe admitted reluctantly. &ldquo;I thought you was
turnin&rsquo; me down, but I guess I was mistaken. But you can&rsquo;t lick me,
Mart, in a stand-up fight. I&rsquo;ve got the reach on you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put on the gloves sometime and see,&rdquo; Martin said with
a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure; as soon as I get that laundry going.&rdquo; Joe extended his arm.
&ldquo;You see that reach? It&rsquo;ll make you go a few.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin heaved a sigh of relief when the door closed behind the laundryman. He
was becoming anti-social. Daily he found it a severer strain to be decent with
people. Their presence perturbed him, and the effort of conversation irritated
him. They made him restless, and no sooner was he in contact with them than he
was casting about for excuses to get rid of them.
</p>

<p>
He did not proceed to attack his mail, and for a half hour he lolled in his
chair, doing nothing, while no more than vague, half-formed thoughts
occasionally filtered through his intelligence, or rather, at wide intervals,
themselves constituted the flickering of his intelligence.
</p>

<p>
He roused himself and began glancing through his mail. There were a dozen
requests for autographs&mdash;he knew them at sight; there were professional
begging letters; and there were letters from cranks, ranging from the man with
a working model of perpetual motion, and the man who demonstrated that the
surface of the earth was the inside of a hollow sphere, to the man seeking
financial aid to purchase the Peninsula of Lower California for the purpose of
communist colonization. There were letters from women seeking to know him, and
over one such he smiled, for enclosed was her receipt for pew-rent, sent as
evidence of her good faith and as proof of her respectability.
</p>

<p>
Editors and publishers contributed to the daily heap of letters, the former on
their knees for his manuscripts, the latter on their knees for his
books&mdash;his poor disdained manuscripts that had kept all he possessed in
pawn for so many dreary months in order to fund them in postage. There were
unexpected checks for English serial rights and for advance payments on foreign
translations. His English agent announced the sale of German translation rights
in three of his books, and informed him that Swedish editions, from which he
could expect nothing because Sweden was not a party to the Berne Convention,
were already on the market. Then there was a nominal request for his permission
for a Russian translation, that country being likewise outside the Berne
Convention.
</p>

<p>
He turned to the huge bundle of clippings which had come in from his press
bureau, and read about himself and his vogue, which had become a furore. All
his creative output had been flung to the public in one magnificent sweep. That
seemed to account for it. He had taken the public off its feet, the way Kipling
had, that time when he lay near to death and all the mob, animated by a
mob-mind thought, began suddenly to read him. Martin remembered how that same
world-mob, having read him and acclaimed him and not understood him in the
least, had, abruptly, a few months later, flung itself upon him and torn him to
pieces. Martin grinned at the thought. Who was he that he should not be
similarly treated in a few more months? Well, he would fool the mob. He would
be away, in the South Seas, building his grass house, trading for pearls and
copra, jumping reefs in frail outriggers, catching sharks and bonitas, hunting
wild goats among the cliffs of the valley that lay next to the valley of
Taiohae.
</p>

<p>
In the moment of that thought the desperateness of his situation dawned upon
him. He saw, cleared eyed, that he was in the Valley of the Shadow. All the
life that was in him was fading, fainting, making toward death.
</p>

<p>
He realized how much he slept, and how much he desired to sleep. Of old, he had
hated sleep. It had robbed him of precious moments of living. Four hours of
sleep in the twenty-four had meant being robbed of four hours of life. How he
had grudged sleep! Now it was life he grudged. Life was not good; its taste in
his mouth was without tang, and bitter. This was his peril. Life that did not
yearn toward life was in fair way toward ceasing. Some remote instinct for
preservation stirred in him, and he knew he must get away. He glanced about the
room, and the thought of packing was burdensome. Perhaps it would be better to
leave that to the last. In the meantime he might be getting an outfit.
</p>

<p>
He put on his hat and went out, stopping in at a gun-store, where he spent the
remainder of the morning buying automatic rifles, ammunition, and fishing
tackle. Fashions changed in trading, and he knew he would have to wait till he
reached Tahiti before ordering his trade-goods. They could come up from
Australia, anyway. This solution was a source of pleasure. He had avoided doing
something, and the doing of anything just now was unpleasant. He went back to
the hotel gladly, with a feeling of satisfaction in that the comfortable Morris
chair was waiting for him; and he groaned inwardly, on entering his room, at
sight of Joe in the Morris chair.
</p>

<p>
Joe was delighted with the laundry. Everything was settled, and he would enter
into possession next day. Martin lay on the bed, with closed eyes, while the
other talked on. Martin&rsquo;s thoughts were far away&mdash;so far away that
he was rarely aware that he was thinking. It was only by an effort that he
occasionally responded. And yet this was Joe, whom he had always liked. But Joe
was too keen with life. The boisterous impact of it on Martin&rsquo;s jaded
mind was a hurt. It was an aching probe to his tired sensitiveness. When Joe
reminded him that sometime in the future they were going to put on the gloves
together, he could almost have screamed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember, Joe, you&rsquo;re to run the laundry according to those old
rules you used to lay down at Shelly Hot Springs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No
overworking. No working at night. And no children at the mangles. No children
anywhere. And a fair wage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Joe nodded and pulled out a note-book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at here. I was workin&rsquo; out them rules before breakfast this
A.M. What d&rsquo;ye think of them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He read them aloud, and Martin approved, worrying at the same time as to when
Joe would take himself off.
</p>

<p>
It was late afternoon when he awoke. Slowly the fact of life came back to him.
He glanced about the room. Joe had evidently stolen away after he had dozed
off. That was considerate of Joe, he thought. Then he closed his eyes and slept
again.
</p>

<p>
In the days that followed Joe was too busy organizing and taking hold of the
laundry to bother him much; and it was not until the day before sailing that
the newspapers made the announcement that he had taken passage on the
<i>Mariposa</i>. Once, when the instinct of preservation fluttered, he went to
a doctor and underwent a searching physical examination. Nothing could be found
the matter with him. His heart and lungs were pronounced magnificent. Every
organ, so far as the doctor could know, was normal and was working normally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing the matter with you, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;positively nothing the matter with you. You are in the pink of
condition. Candidly, I envy you your health. It is superb. Look at that chest.
There, and in your stomach, lies the secret of your remarkable constitution.
Physically, you are a man in a thousand&mdash;in ten thousand. Barring
accidents, you should live to be a hundred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Martin knew that Lizzie&rsquo;s diagnosis had been correct. Physically he
was all right. It was his &ldquo;think-machine&rdquo; that had gone wrong, and
there was no cure for that except to get away to the South Seas. The trouble
was that now, on the verge of departure, he had no desire to go. The South Seas
charmed him no more than did bourgeois civilization. There was no zest in the
thought of departure, while the act of departure appalled him as a weariness of
the flesh. He would have felt better if he were already on board and gone.
</p>

<p>
The last day was a sore trial. Having read of his sailing in the morning
papers, Bernard Higginbotham, Gertrude, and all the family came to say good-by,
as did Hermann von Schmidt and Marian. Then there was business to be
transacted, bills to be paid, and everlasting reporters to be endured. He said
good-by to Lizzie Connolly, abruptly, at the entrance to night school, and
hurried away. At the hotel he found Joe, too busy all day with the laundry to
have come to him earlier. It was the last straw, but Martin gripped the arms of
his chair and talked and listened for half an hour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, Joe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are not tied down to that
laundry. There are no strings on it. You can sell it any time and blow the
money. Any time you get sick of it and want to hit the road, just pull out. Do
what will make you the happiest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Joe shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more road in mine, thank you kindly. Hoboin&rsquo;s all right,
exceptin&rsquo; for one thing&mdash;the girls. I can&rsquo;t help it, but
I&rsquo;m a ladies&rsquo; man. I can&rsquo;t get along without &rsquo;em, and
you&rsquo;ve got to get along without &rsquo;em when you&rsquo;re
hoboin&rsquo;. The times I&rsquo;ve passed by houses where dances an&rsquo;
parties was goin&rsquo; on, an&rsquo; heard the women laugh, an&rsquo; saw
their white dresses and smiling faces through the windows&mdash;Gee! I tell you
them moments was plain hell. I like dancin&rsquo; an&rsquo; picnics, an&rsquo;
walking in the moonlight, an&rsquo; all the rest too well. Me for the laundry,
and a good front, with big iron dollars clinkin&rsquo; in my jeans. I seen a
girl already, just yesterday, and, d&rsquo;ye know, I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo;
already I&rsquo;d just as soon marry her as not. I&rsquo;ve ben whistlin&rsquo;
all day at the thought of it. She&rsquo;s a beaut, with the kindest eyes and
softest voice you ever heard. Me for her, you can stack on that. Say, why
don&rsquo;t you get married with all this money to burn? You could get the
finest girl in the land.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head with a smile, but in his secret heart he was wondering
why any man wanted to marry. It seemed an amazing and incomprehensible thing.
</p>

<p>
From the deck of the <i>Mariposa</i>, at the sailing hour, he saw Lizzie
Connolly hiding in the skirts of the crowd on the wharf. Take her with you,
came the thought. It is easy to be kind. She will be supremely happy. It was
almost a temptation one moment, and the succeeding moment it became a terror.
He was in a panic at the thought of it. His tired soul cried out in protest. He
turned away from the rail with a groan, muttering, &ldquo;Man, you are too
sick, you are too sick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He fled to his stateroom, where he lurked until the steamer was clear of the
dock. In the dining saloon, at luncheon, he found himself in the place of
honor, at the captain&rsquo;s right; and he was not long in discovering that he
was the great man on board. But no more unsatisfactory great man ever sailed on
a ship. He spent the afternoon in a deck-chair, with closed eyes, dozing
brokenly most of the time, and in the evening went early to bed.
</p>

<p>
After the second day, recovered from seasickness, the full passenger list was
in evidence, and the more he saw of the passengers the more he disliked them.
Yet he knew that he did them injustice. They were good and kindly people, he
forced himself to acknowledge, and in the moment of acknowledgment he
qualified&mdash;good and kindly like all the bourgeoisie, with all the
psychological cramp and intellectual futility of their kind, they bored him
when they talked with him, their little superficial minds were so filled with
emptiness; while the boisterous high spirits and the excessive energy of the
younger people shocked him. They were never quiet, ceaselessly playing
deck-quoits, tossing rings, promenading, or rushing to the rail with loud cries
to watch the leaping porpoises and the first schools of flying fish.
</p>

<p>
He slept much. After breakfast he sought his deck-chair with a magazine he
never finished. The printed pages tired him. He puzzled that men found so much
to write about, and, puzzling, dozed in his chair. When the gong awoke him for
luncheon, he was irritated that he must awaken. There was no satisfaction in
being awake.
</p>

<p>
Once, he tried to arouse himself from his lethargy, and went forward into the
forecastle with the sailors. But the breed of sailors seemed to have changed
since the days he had lived in the forecastle. He could find no kinship with
these stolid-faced, ox-minded bestial creatures. He was in despair. Up above
nobody had wanted Martin Eden for his own sake, and he could not go back to
those of his own class who had wanted him in the past. He did not want them. He
could not stand them any more than he could stand the stupid first-cabin
passengers and the riotous young people.
</p>

<p>
Life was to him like strong, white light that hurts the tired eyes of a sick
person. During every conscious moment life blazed in a raw glare around him and
upon him. It hurt. It hurt intolerably. It was the first time in his life that
Martin had travelled first class. On ships at sea he had always been in the
forecastle, the steerage, or in the black depths of the coal-hold, passing
coal. In those days, climbing up the iron ladders out the pit of stifling heat,
he had often caught glimpses of the passengers, in cool white, doing nothing
but enjoy themselves, under awnings spread to keep the sun and wind away from
them, with subservient stewards taking care of their every want and whim, and
it had seemed to him that the realm in which they moved and had their being was
nothing else than paradise. Well, here he was, the great man on board, in the
midmost centre of it, sitting at the captain&rsquo;s right hand, and yet vainly
harking back to forecastle and stoke-hole in quest of the Paradise he had lost.
He had found no new one, and now he could not find the old one.
</p>

<p>
He strove to stir himself and find something to interest him. He ventured the
petty officers&rsquo; mess, and was glad to get away. He talked with a
quartermaster off duty, an intelligent man who promptly prodded him with the
socialist propaganda and forced into his hands a bunch of leaflets and
pamphlets. He listened to the man expounding the slave-morality, and as he
listened, he thought languidly of his own Nietzsche philosophy. But what was it
worth, after all? He remembered one of Nietzsche&rsquo;s mad utterances wherein
that madman had doubted truth. And who was to say? Perhaps Nietzsche had been
right. Perhaps there was no truth in anything, no truth in truth&mdash;no such
thing as truth. But his mind wearied quickly, and he was content to go back to
his chair and doze.
</p>

<p>
Miserable as he was on the steamer, a new misery came upon him. What when the
steamer reached Tahiti? He would have to go ashore. He would have to order his
trade-goods, to find a passage on a schooner to the Marquesas, to do a thousand
and one things that were awful to contemplate. Whenever he steeled himself
deliberately to think, he could see the desperate peril in which he stood. In
all truth, he was in the Valley of the Shadow, and his danger lay in that he
was not afraid. If he were only afraid, he would make toward life. Being
unafraid, he was drifting deeper into the shadow. He found no delight in the
old familiar things of life. The <i>Mariposa</i> was now in the northeast
trades, and this wine of wind, surging against him, irritated him. He had his
chair moved to escape the embrace of this lusty comrade of old days and nights.
</p>

<p>
The day the <i>Mariposa</i> entered the doldrums, Martin was more miserable
than ever. He could no longer sleep. He was soaked with sleep, and perforce he
must now stay awake and endure the white glare of life. He moved about
restlessly. The air was sticky and humid, and the rain-squalls were
unrefreshing. He ached with life. He walked around the deck until that hurt too
much, then sat in his chair until he was compelled to walk again. He forced
himself at last to finish the magazine, and from the steamer library he culled
several volumes of poetry. But they could not hold him, and once more he took
to walking.
</p>

<p>
He stayed late on deck, after dinner, but that did not help him, for when he
went below, he could not sleep. This surcease from life had failed him. It was
too much. He turned on the electric light and tried to read. One of the volumes
was a Swinburne. He lay in bed, glancing through its pages, until suddenly he
became aware that he was reading with interest. He finished the stanza,
attempted to read on, then came back to it. He rested the book face downward on
his breast and fell to thinking. That was it. The very thing. Strange that it
had never come to him before. That was the meaning of it all; he had been
drifting that way all the time, and now Swinburne showed him that it was the
happy way out. He wanted rest, and here was rest awaiting him. He glanced at
the open port-hole. Yes, it was large enough. For the first time in weeks he
felt happy. At last he had discovered the cure of his ill. He picked up the
book and read the stanza slowly aloud:-
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;&lsquo;From too much love of living,<br />
    From hope and fear set free,<br />
We thank with brief thanksgiving<br />
    Whatever gods may be<br />
That no life lives forever;<br />
That dead men rise up never;<br />
    That even the weariest river<br />
    Winds somewhere safe to sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked again at the open port. Swinburne had furnished the key. Life was
ill, or, rather, it had become ill&mdash;an unbearable thing. &ldquo;That dead
men rise up never!&rdquo; That line stirred him with a profound feeling of
gratitude. It was the one beneficent thing in the universe. When life became an
aching weariness, death was ready to soothe away to everlasting sleep. But what
was he waiting for? It was time to go.
</p>

<p>
He arose and thrust his head out the port-hole, looking down into the milky
wash. The <i>Mariposa</i> was deeply loaded, and, hanging by his hands, his
feet would be in the water. He could slip in noiselessly. No one would hear. A
smother of spray dashed up, wetting his face. It tasted salt on his lips, and
the taste was good. He wondered if he ought to write a swan-song, but laughed
the thought away. There was no time. He was too impatient to be gone.
</p>

<p>
Turning off the light in his room so that it might not betray him, he went out
the port-hole feet first. His shoulders stuck, and he forced himself back so as
to try it with one arm down by his side. A roll of the steamer aided him, and
he was through, hanging by his hands. When his feet touched the sea, he let go.
He was in a milky froth of water. The side of the <i>Mariposa</i> rushed past
him like a dark wall, broken here and there by lighted ports. She was certainly
making time. Almost before he knew it, he was astern, swimming gently on the
foam-crackling surface.
</p>

<p>
A bonita struck at his white body, and he laughed aloud. It had taken a piece
out, and the sting of it reminded him of why he was there. In the work to do he
had forgotten the purpose of it. The lights of the <i>Mariposa</i> were growing
dim in the distance, and there he was, swimming confidently, as though it were
his intention to make for the nearest land a thousand miles or so away.
</p>

<p>
It was the automatic instinct to live. He ceased swimming, but the moment he
felt the water rising above his mouth the hands struck out sharply with a
lifting movement. The will to live, was his thought, and the thought was
accompanied by a sneer. Well, he had will,&mdash;ay, will strong enough that
with one last exertion it could destroy itself and cease to be.
</p>

<p>
He changed his position to a vertical one. He glanced up at the quiet stars, at
the same time emptying his lungs of air. With swift, vigorous propulsion of
hands and feet, he lifted his shoulders and half his chest out of water. This
was to gain impetus for the descent. Then he let himself go and sank without
movement, a white statue, into the sea. He breathed in the water deeply,
deliberately, after the manner of a man taking an anaesthetic. When he
strangled, quite involuntarily his arms and legs clawed the water and drove him
up to the surface and into the clear sight of the stars.
</p>

<p>
The will to live, he thought disdainfully, vainly endeavoring not to breathe
the air into his bursting lungs. Well, he would have to try a new way. He
filled his lungs with air, filled them full. This supply would take him far
down. He turned over and went down head first, swimming with all his strength
and all his will. Deeper and deeper he went. His eyes were open, and he watched
the ghostly, phosphorescent trails of the darting bonita. As he swam, he hoped
that they would not strike at him, for it might snap the tension of his will.
But they did not strike, and he found time to be grateful for this last
kindness of life.
</p>

<p>
Down, down, he swam till his arms and legs grew tired and hardly moved. He knew
that he was deep. The pressure on his ear-drums was a pain, and there was a
buzzing in his head. His endurance was faltering, but he compelled his arms and
legs to drive him deeper until his will snapped and the air drove from his
lungs in a great explosive rush. The bubbles rubbed and bounded like tiny
balloons against his cheeks and eyes as they took their upward flight. Then
came pain and strangulation. This hurt was not death, was the thought that
oscillated through his reeling consciousness. Death did not hurt. It was life,
the pangs of life, this awful, suffocating feeling; it was the last blow life
could deal him.
</p>

<p>
His wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about, spasmodically and
feebly. But he had fooled them and the will to live that made them beat and
churn. He was too deep down. They could never bring him to the surface. He
seemed floating languidly in a sea of dreamy vision. Colors and radiances
surrounded him and bathed him and pervaded him. What was that? It seemed a
lighthouse; but it was inside his brain&mdash;a flashing, bright white light.
It flashed swifter and swifter. There was a long rumble of sound, and it seemed
to him that he was falling down a vast and interminable stairway. And somewhere
at the bottom he fell into darkness. That much he knew. He had fallen into
darkness. And at the instant he knew, he ceased to know.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
