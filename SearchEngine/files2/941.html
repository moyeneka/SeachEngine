<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>More than a million pounds of concealed sugar have been
discovered in New York. It is suspected that this was intended as
the nucleus of a hoard.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A contemporary recently stated that LENIN claims to stand for
the leadership of Russia. But surely they do not stand for
leadership in Russia. They rush for it with revolvers.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"This is a time for action, not for talk," said Colonel HOUSE on
his arrival in England. A stinging rejoinder is expected from the
FOOD-CONTROLLER'S Department.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is rumoured that the restaurant keepers have agreed among
themselves that to avoid confusion the price of all beefsteaks
shall be stamped clearly on the sole.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Meat Order will probably be amended to make meat-stalls rank
as shops. At present of course they suffer under the stigma of
being merely places where you can purchase meat.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We understand that, in order to avoid confusion and undue alarm,
German prisoners in this country will in future be expected to give
twelve hours' notice of their intention to escape.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Sugar is to be omitted from a number of medical preparations
from December 1st, and children are complaining that the decision
has quite spoilt their Christmas prospects.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Counsel, in a prosecution for selling a tobacco substitute, has
stated that there is nothing in the Act to prevent a man from
smoking what he likes. In the trade this is generally regarded as a
nasty underhand jab at the British cigar industry.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Lord RHONDDA, in announcing his new rationing scheme,
differentiates between brain workers and manual workers. It will be
interesting to see to which category certain Government officials
will be assigned.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The bamboo," according to a weekly paper, "holds the record
among plants for rapid growth, having been known to grow two feet
in twelve hours." The silence of allotment holders on this subject
is significant.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. SYDNEY G. GAMBLE, second in command of the London Fire
Brigade, is about to retire. There is some talk of arranging a
farewell fire.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We understand, by the way, that retirement from the London Fire
Brigade always carries with it the privilege of wearing the uniform
at one's own fires.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A theatrical paper advertises for a "Male impersonator" for
pantomime. No conscientious objector need apply.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A news message to the <i>Politiken</i> states that the people of
Iceland are making demands for their own flag or separation. The
movement seems to be an isolated one and not likely to spread.
Anyhow, there is no cause for alarm at Tooting, where the
authorities are not expecting any trouble of this kind.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Cranford dairyman has been selling milk at threepence per
quart. In trade circles it is supposed that he is doing it for a
wager.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>According to <i>The Evening News</i>, Councillor WILLIAM
SHEARRING, the new Mayor of Bermondsey, started life as a van boy.
This gave him a pull over most of us, who started life as
infants.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>After December 17th, parcels for neutral countries may not be
sent without a permit. Cement and other articles intended for enemy
consumption can only be forwarded by special arrangement with the
Ministry of Blockade.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The average man, says a correspondent of <i>The Daily Mail</i>,
does not know how to invest five pounds in War Loan. Yet all he has
to do is to pay his little fiver across the counter just as if he
were buying a pound of tea.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The LORD MAYOR'S Coachman has retired after twenty-eight years'
service. He was a splendid fellow, taking him all round.</p>

<p>An official memo from the Front:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A complaint has been received from the Provost Corps that two
horses, apparently ridden by grooms, committed a civil offence in
&mdash;&mdash;, in that they crashed into a motor car, which at the
time was stationary, damaging same. On being questioned where they
came from, they replied, 'From Australia,' and after paying a few
more like compliments disappeared at the gallop."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is supposed that these intelligent animals had been reading a
recent article by "Patlander."</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The R.F.C. on the same day bombed the junction. There was a
large numtity of rolling stock in the station, on which, and on the
station building, several direct hits were observed to cause
considerable damage."&mdash;<i>The Times</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Numtity" is doubtless a dodge of the CENSOR to prevent us
knowing too much. We suspect that "quanber" was what the writer
really wanted to say.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Drucker (for the trustees of the Testator) said the late
Lord Blythswood had made 51 oleograph codicils to his will, and the
difficulty arose over two of them."&mdash;<i>Evening Paper</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It rather looks as if the two were not genuine oleographs but
only colourable imitations.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"American eggs arriving at Manchester yesterday were quoted from
27<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to 28<i>s</i>. per 120, which caused Irish eggs to be reduced
from sixpence to a shilling."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very Irish eggs.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"12 Feet Corsets at a ridiculous price of Re. 1 each, all
sizes."&mdash;<i>Advt. in "Advocate of India."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"A ridiculous price," says the advertiser, but "an absurd
figure" would have been even better.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"The Examiners appointed by the Board of the Faculty of Natural
Science give notice that Wilfrid Dyson Hambly, Jesus College,
having submitted a dissertation on 'Tattooing and other forms of
body-marking among primitive peoples,' will be publicly examined on
Monday, November 12, at 2.30 p.m., in the Department of Social
Anthropology, Barnett House."&mdash;<i>Oxford University
Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>We trust he showed, and obtained, full marks.</p>

<h2>NIGHTMARES.</h2>
<p class="center">II.</p>
<p class="center">OF A T.B.D. CAPTAIN, WHO DREAMS THAT HE HAS FOUND
HIS LOG BOOK MADE UP BY MR. PH*L*P G*BBS.</p>
<p><i>Time:&mdash;7.30 A.M.</i>&mdash;Once more we set out on our
never-ending mission, our ceaseless vigil of the seas. The ruddy
weather-stained coxswain swung the wheel this way and
that&mdash;his eyes were of the blue that only the sea can
give&mdash;in obedience to, or rather in accord with, the curt,
mystic, seaman-like orders of the young officer of the watch. "Hard
a-port! Midships! Hard a-starboard! Port 20! Steady as she goes!"
And ceaselessly the engine-room telegraph tinkled, and the handy
little craft, with death and terror written in her workmanlike
lines for the seaman, for all her slim insignificance to the
landlubber on the towering decks of the great liner, swung smartly
through the crowded water-way out to the perils lurking 'neath the
seeming smile of the open sea: the guardian angel of our commerce
it went, to meet&mdash;what Heaven alone could foretell!</p>
<p><i>Course</i>.&mdash;S. 70&deg; E. Towards the rising sun and
our brethren in khaki, toiling in the wet mud as we toil on the wet
waters!</p>
<p><i>Deviation</i>.&mdash;1&deg; E. Wonderful the accuracy of the
little instrument whereon men's lives do hang, wise in the lore of
the firmament!</p>
<p><i>Patent Log</i>.&mdash;O. Nothing&mdash;as yet! What will it
register ere the day be done? Or will its speckless copper lie
rusting in the grey chill of the sea's dank depths?</p>
<p><i>Revs</i>.&mdash;I don't know, but the propellers swirl
faithfully and unceasingly.</p>
<p><i>Wind</i>.&mdash;W. by E. Bearing a message across the vast
Atlantic of hope and present succour from our new great Ally, the
mighty Republic of the West. America, ah America! But we of the sea
are men of few words, and this is not the place.</p>
<p><i>Force</i>.&mdash;3. A balmy zephyr, yet with the sharp salt
tang of the sea that a sailor loves.</p>
<p><i>Sea</i>.&mdash;2. Softly undulating is the swell, scarce
perceptible to inexperienced eyes, such as those of the
land-lubbers on the towering decks of the great liners; gleaming
dead copper and blue in the morning sun, flecked with spectral
white in the distance&mdash;the easy roll of untrammelled
waters!</p>
<p><i>Weather</i>.&mdash;C. Detached clouds. Almost had I written
"B," seeing the perfect filmy blue all around the horizon; but a
seaman's scrutiny showed me faint fluffy wisps o'erhead, luminous
and marged with palest gold; and ever must a sailor be suspicious
of the treacherous weather-god.</p>
<p><i>Thermometer</i>.&mdash;42&deg;. Not yet is Winter here, but
its threat approaches.</p>
<p><i>Barometer</i>.&mdash;30&middot;01. Will it stay there?</p>
<p><i>Remarks</i>.&mdash;Once more we set out on our ceaseless
vigil, our never-ending mission of the sea!</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Remarks</i>.&mdash;(7.30 P.M.).&mdash;Another day has passed,
another day's duty has been done. Nothing <i>apparently</i> has
happened outside the ordinary routine of the ship. One keen-eyed
young officer has succeeded another on the bridge, with tired lines
on a face grey beneath the great brown hood of his duffle&mdash;a
face so youthful, yet with the knowledge of the command of men writ
plain thereon. The propellers have swirled faithfully and
unceasingly; the good ship in consequence has cleft the passive
waves. But who knows what hideous lurking peril of mine or torpedo
we have not survived, what baleful eye has not glowered at us,
itself unseen, and retired again to its foul underworld, baulked of
its thirsted prey?</p>

<h2>HOW TO BECOME A TOWN-MAJOR.</h2>
<p>Through large and luminous glasses Second-Lieut. St. John
regards this War and its problems. He is a man of infinite jobs.
There are few villages in France of which he has not been Town
Major. Between times he has been Intelligence Officer, Divisional
Burial Officer, Divisional Disbursing Officer, Salvage Officer,
Claims, Baths, Soda-water and Canteens Officer.</p>
<p>He was once appointed Town-Major of some brick-dust, a rafter
and two empty bully-beef tins&mdash;all of which in combination
bore the name of a village. He assumed his duties with a bland
Pickwickian zest, which did good to the heart. He had boards
painted.</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="10" summary="THIS IS BLANK VILLAGE">

<p>though there was nothing there to incinerate and (incidentally)
no incinerator. "HORSES," shouted another didactically, "MUST NOT
TROT THROUGH THE MAIN STREET." That there was no street there at
all did not detract from the splendour of his notices, on which he
spent much paint and happiness.</p>
<p>With the slightest encouragement he would have placarded that
arid wilderness with "NO SMOKING IN THE LIFTS," and "BEWARE OF
PICKPOCKETS," but he had small encouragement, and so he contented
himself with a final placard which warned the troops against riding
through standing crops and occupying the houses of civilians
without permission from the Town-Major.</p>
<p>Still, no one becomes a Town-Major without some sort of claim to
the post.</p>
<p>Second-Lieut. St. John's first appearance in Armageddon took
place during "peace-time warfare." An unpleasant and quite
unnecessary little bulge in the trench-line, known as the
Toadstool, was manned by the platoon of which he found himself
second-in-command. It is rumoured that a Hun patrol, crawling to
the edge of our parapet, saw in the ghastly glare of a Verey light
the benign and spectacled countenance of Second-Lieut. St. John
staring amiably across No Man's Land, and came to the hasty
conclusion that they had made a mistake as to direction, since here
was obviously one of their own officers of the Herr Professor type.
Rumour adds that they retired to their own lines and were promptly
shot for cowardice.</p>
<p>Certain it is that on that particular night Second-Lieut. St.
John did a thing the full details of which are now revealed to the
Intelligence Corps for the first time. He fired a Verey light. It
pleased him enormously. The sense that he, and he alone, was the
cause of all those sliding shadows and that flood of greenish light
in No Man's Land went to his head like strong drink. He fired
another and another and another.... The Hun was puzzled at this
departure from routine, and opened a morose machine-gun fire which
skimmed the top of the parapet and covered Second-Lieut. St. John
with earth from shattered sandbags. He went on firing Verey lights
in a sort of bland ecstasy till his supply ran out, when he went to
his Company Commander's dug-out for more. He filled his pockets
with fresh ammunition, went back to his post, and began firing
again. The first light was mauve. He almost clapped his hands at
it, and fired the second. It was pink. The third was yellow, the
fourth scarlet, and the fifth emerald green.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg
347]</span>
<p>"The Crystal Palace," said Second-Lieut. St. John, "isn't in
it." And then, because his watch had ended, he handed over to
another yawning subaltern and went to bed.</p>
<p>Over miles and miles of country wild-eyed gunners were glaring
into the night and asking each other blasphemous questions. What
did it mean?</p>
<p>"It must be Huns," said the British gunners; "they're coming
over."</p>
<p>"That is without doubt an English signal," said the enemy. "We
will prepare for an attack."</p>
<p>Then the Hun gunners suddenly made up their minds to be on the
safe side, and they put down a tremendous barrage on to No Man's
Land.</p>
<p>"Told you so; they're on to our front line," said we, and put
down a tremendous barrage on to No Man's Land.</p>
<p>A Hun sentry, waking with a start, sounded the gas alarm. It was
taken up all along the German line and overheard by a vigilant
British sentry, who promptly set himself to make all possible noise
with every possible means.</p>
<p>Old French ladies in villages twenty miles back from the line
lay all that night hideous in respirators. Anxious Staffs rang up
other anxious Staffs. Gunners questioned the infantry. The infantry
desired information from the gunners. All along the line the
private soldier was jolted from that kind of trance which he calls
"getting down to it," and was bidden to stand to till morning.</p>
<p>And our Mr. St. John, who was a new and superfluous officer and
liable to be overlooked, slept through it all with a fat smile.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It was after that that they made him a Town-Major.</p>

<h2>THE NEW MRS. MARKHAM.</h2>
<p class="center">v.</p>
<p class="center">CONVERSATION ON CHAPTER LXXIII.</p>
<p><i>Mary</i>. There were two things in your last chapter that I
did not quite understand&mdash;the National Debt and the
Flappers.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M</i>. About the National Debt, my dear child, I think
you must wait until your papa comes home to tea, but perhaps I can
satisfy your curiosity about the Flappers, who were indeed amongst
the most singular and formidable products of the age we have been
discussing. The origin of the term is obscure, some authorities
connecting it with the term "flap-doodle," others with the motion
of a bird's wings, and I remember a verse in an old song which ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Place me somewhere east of Suez</p>
<p class="i4">On a lone and rocky shore,</p>
<p class="i2">Where the Britons cease from Britling</p>
<p class="i4">And the flappers flap no more."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This, however, does not throw much light on the subject. Perhaps
the term Flapper may best be defined as meaning a twentieth-century
hoyden, and was applied to a type of girl from the age of thirteen
to seventeen, whose extravagances in speech, manner and dress
caused deep dismay among the more serious members of the community.
In particular the learned Dr. SHADWELL denounced them with great
severity in a leading review, but with little result. They
bedizened themselves with frippery, shrieked like parrots on all
occasions and interpreted the motto of the time, "Carry On," in a
sense deplorably remote from its higher significance.</p>
<p><i>George</i>. I think it seems, Mamma, as if the young girls of
those times must have tried to make themselves as unpleasant as
possible. How thankful I am that Mary is not a Flapper!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M</i>. You may well be. But allowance must be made for
the misapplied energy of our ancestors. If the Flappers excite our
disgust, their subsequent treatment moves our commiseration, since
the Sumptuary and Disciplinary Laws passed by the House of Ladies
dealt in drastic fashion with the offences which I have described.
As a matter of fact many Flappers grew up into excellent and
patriotic women. I remember my grandmother saying to me once, "When
I was sixteen I had a voice like a cockatoo and the manners of a
monkey," but nothing could have been more discreet or sedate than
her deportment in old age.</p>
<p><i>Richard</i>. Did the Flappers speak English?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M</i>. Presumably; but, judging from the records of
their dialect which have come down to us, their speech was made up
of a succession of squeals rather than of articulate words, and has
so far defied the efforts of modern philologists. Indeed speech
seems to have been almost at a discount, owing to the immense
popularity of the moving picture play, then in its infancy and as
yet unaccompanied by mechanical reproduction of the voices of the
actors. Indeed at one time it was said that there were only three
adjectives in use in Flapper society&mdash;"ripping," "rotten" and
"top-hole," I think they were.</p>
<p><i>George</i>. What stupid words! I wish they could have heard
some of papa's adjectives.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M</i>. Your father, my dear, has a copious and
picturesque vocabulary, but phrases which are pardonable in moments
of expansion in a person of mature years are not always suitable
for juveniles.</p>

<h2>THE TRANSGRESSOR.</h2>
<p>I was walking painfully along a lonely road towing my
three-thousand-guinea ten-cylinder twelve-seater. According to
Regulation 777 X, both brakes were on. My overcoat collar was
turned up to protect my sensitive skin from a blasting easterly
gale, and through the twilight I was able to see but a few yards
ahead. I had a blister on my heel. Somewhere, many miles to the
eastward, lay my destination. Suddenly two gigantic forms emerged
from the hedgerow and laid each a gigantic paw upon my shoulders. A
gruff voice barked accusingly in my ear.</p>
<p>"You are the owner of a motorcar?"</p>
<p>Was it any use denying the fact? I thought not.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied humbly, "I am."</p>
<p>"Have you the permit which allows you to possess this?" He waved
towards the stagnant 'bus.</p>
<p>"I have."</p>
<p>"Have you the licence which allows you to take it upon the high
road?"</p>
<p>With frozen fingers I held it out to him. He moved to the back
of the car, unscrewed the entrance to the petrol tank and applied
his nose to the aperture. After three official sniffs he turned
upon me aggressively.</p>
<p>"There is an undeniable odour of petroleum. How do you account
for that?"</p>
<p>"Sir," I replied, "last week my little son had his knockabout
suit dry-cleaned in Perthshire by the petrol-substitute process.
This morning he climbed upon the back of the car to see whether his
Silver Campine had laid an egg in the hood."</p>
<p>He glared at me.</p>
<p>"Ah! Have you the necessary extension which allows you to use a
motorcar as a habitation for hens?"</p>
<p>I gave it to him.</p>
<p>Then, frustrated with fury, he thundered at me successively:
"Have you a towing permit? Have you a dog licence? Can you produce
a boot and shoe grant? Do you hold any rubber shares? Have you been
inoculated for premature decay? What did you do in the Great
War?"</p>
<p>I gave him the necessary documents in perfect order. For a
moment he was nonplussed. Then he asked with sly intention, "Have
you the champagne and chicken sandwich ration which is apportioned
to super-inspectors?"</p>
<p>I handed it to him with a table-napkin (unused) and a pair of
wire-cutters thrown in. For some minutes he remained silent, except
in the gustatory sense, then he turned upon me and, handing back an
empty bottle, said triumphantly, "You must now produce, under
Clause 5005 Gerrard, framed this morning at 11-30 o'clock, one pint
of old ale and six ounces of bread and cheese for the sustentation
of the sub-inspector."</p>
<p>I regarded him stonily and leant against the cold, cold bonnet
of the car. Alas! I had it not.</p>
<p>"Sir," I pleaded, "I did not know ... give me time. The next inn
is but a few miles. If you and your companion will take a seat I
will bring you to the inn door and all will be well."</p>
<p>He laughed in my face.</p>
<p>"Algernon Brocklebank Smith," he said sternly, "you have
betrayed yourself into our hands." He turned to his myrmidon: "Get
a move on you, Herbert; it's a bit parky standing about here."</p>
<p>After all he was but a coarse fellow.</p>
<p>Herbert, galvanised into action, produced a small oblong object
from his pocket, lighted the end of it with the glowing butt of one
of my Corona Coronas, and placed it underneath the car. In a few
moments all that remained of my three-thousand-guinea
ten&mdash;cylinder twelve-seater was one small nut, which was
immediately impounded.</p>
<p>I raised the collar of my overcoat (second reef), shifted my
face to the eastward, and, notwithstanding the blister on my heel,
turned my steps towards my destination.</p>
<p>I uttered no plaint. I had transgressed against the immutable
law.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p><i>Monday, November 12th</i>.&mdash;An old Parliamentarian, when
asked by a friend to what party the PRIME MINISTER now belonged,
sententiously replied, "He used to be a Radical; he will some day
be a Conservative; and at present he is the leader of the
Improvisatories."</p>
<p>The latest example of his inventive capacity does not meet with
unmitigated approval. Members were very curious to know exactly how
the new Allied Council was going to work, and what would be the
relations between the Council's Military advisers and the existing
General Staffs of the countries concerned. Mr. BONAR LAW assured
the House that the responsibility for strategy would remain where
it is now, but did not altogether succeed in explaining why in that
case the Council required other military advisers.</p>
<p>The SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND is about the mildest-mannered man
that ever sat upon the Treasury Bench. But even he can be
"<i>tr&egrave;s m&eacute;chant</i>" at a pinch. When Mr. WATT
renewed his complaint that sheriffs-principal in Scotland had very
little to do for the high salaries they received, Mr. MUNRO replied
that "it would just be as unsafe to measure the activities of the
sheriff-principal by the number of appeals he hears as to measure
the political activities of my hon. friend by the number of
questions he puts."</p>
<div class="figright" style="width:35%"><a href=

"" /></a>
<p class="center">PENSIONS.</p>
<p class="center">Mr. Hodge.</p>
</div>
<p>The Pensions Department at Chelsea is to be reorganised. Mr.
HODGE excused the delays by pointing out that an average of
thirty-three thousand letters a day is despatched, but, as he added
that there is a staff of four thousand five hundred persons to do
it, it hardly looks as if they were overworked.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, November 13th</i>.&mdash;The House of Lords was to
have discussed the state of Ireland, but, owing to the absence of
its LEADER, fell back upon the less exciting but more practical
topics of sugar-substitutes for jam, and barley for beer. It was
cheering to learn from the Duke of MARLBOROUGH that the
jam-manufacturers gave great care to exclude arsenic from their
glucose, and from Lord RHONDDA that there would be plenty of barley
for both cakes and ale.</p>
<p>Mr. WARDLE is the latest example of the poacher turned
gamekeeper. A few months ago, as leader of the Labour Party, he was
instant in criticism of the ineptitutes of Government officials.
This afternoon, upon his old friend, Mr. TYSON WILSON, venturing to
refer to the "stupid decisions" of the Board of Trade, Mr. WARDLE
was down on him in a moment. With the air of one who had been born
and brought up in Whitehall Gardens, he replied, "Stupid decisions
are not made by the Board of Trade."</p>
<p>The Pacifists had rather a mixed day. They were visibly relieved
when Mr. BONAR LAW (supported by Mr. ASQUITH) declined to admit
into the Bill for extending the life of this Parliament a provision
enabling constituencies to get rid of Members who had ceased to
represent them. But they did not like his contemptuous reference to
their argumentative powers. Mr. TREVELYAN, who regards himself as
the representative (by literary descent) of CHARLES JAMES FOX, was
particularly annoyed.</p>
<p>As party-funds are rather under a cloud just now the Government
thought they might justify their existence by drawing on them for
the campaign against enemy propaganda. But their custodians thought
otherwise. The Tory Whip was prepared to make a small contribution;
the Liberal would give nothing, on the ground that the total
required was extravagantly large. So the country will have to foot
the bill.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, November 14th</i>.&mdash;The knowledge that Mr.
ASQUITH was to "interpellate" the PRIME MINISTER regarding his
recent speech in Paris, and the Allied War Council therein
described, brought a crowd of Members to the House, and filled the
Peers' Gallery with ex-Ministers scenting a first-class crisis.</p>
<p>The protagonists on entering the arena were loudly cheered by
their respective adherents, but the expected duel did not come off.
Mr. ASQUITH'S questions were searching enough, but not provocative.
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE'S reply was comprehensive and conciliatory, and
ended with the promise of a day for discussion. Instead of a fight
there was only an armistice, usually a preliminary to a definite
peace.</p>
<p>A little disappointed, perhaps, the Peers betook themselves to
their own Chamber, there to hear Lord PARMOOR discourse upon the
woes of conscientious objectors. Many of them, he thought, had been
vindictively punished for their peculiar opinions. Nobody, in a
somewhat cloudy discussion, made it quite clear whether the
Tribunals or the Army authorities or the Home Office were most at
fault; and Lord CURZON'S suggestion that persons who refused not
merely to fight but to render any kind of service to their country
in its time of need were not wholly free from blame had almost the
air of novelty.</p>
<p>The Air-Force Bill passed through Committee in one sitting. The
credit for this achievement may be divided equally between Major
BAIRD, who proved himself once more a skilful pilot, and Mr.
BILLING, who spoke so often that other intending critics got little
chance. Counting speeches and interruptions, I find from the
official reports that he addressed the House exactly one hundred
times; and it is therefore worth noticing that his last words were,
"This is what you call muzzling the House of Commons."</p>
<p><i>Thursday, November 15th</i>.&mdash;Lord WIMBORNE did his best
to-night to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id=
"page353"></a>[pg 353]</span> defend the inaction of the Irish
Executive in the face of the Sinn Fein menace. But he would have
been wiser not to have adduced the argument that Ireland was a
<i>terra incognita</i>. If there is one subject that the Peers
think they know all about it is the sister-island. Lord CURZON
thought it would be a mistake, by enforcing "a superficial quiet,"
to check the wholesome influences brought into being by the
Convention. He did not go so far as to say that Mr. DE VALERA was
one of them.</p>
<p>At last the Government have decided to take short order with the
pernicious literature of the Pacifists. In future all such
documents are to be submitted to the Press Bureau before
publication. A howl of derisive laughter greeted the HOME
SECRETARY'S announcement, but when Mr. SNOWDEN essayed to move the
adjournment, although he and his friends were joined by some of the
Scotch and Irish malcontents, the total muster was only
thirty-three, and the motion accordingly came to earth with a
thud.</p>
<p>By a large majority the House refused to reinstate the Livery
franchise in the City of London. In any case this ancient privilege
could not long have survived the curtailment of the Lord Mayor's
Feast.</p>

<h3>BOON FOR BUSY BRIDEGROOMS.</h3>
<p>In these days of military hustle, when a soldier comes home,
falls in love, gets engaged, marries, sets up a home, and returns
to the Front in less than a week, there is little time for the
ordinary courtesies of matrimonial procedure. It is felt,
therefore, that the appended printed form of thanks for wedding
presents&mdash;based on the model of the Field Service

matrimony during short leave. It will be found sufficient merely to
strike out inappropriate words in the printed form, which is as

<h3>ONCE UPON A TIME.</h3>
<p class="center">THE LETTER.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, not so very long ago, an illustrious man of
affairs&mdash;soldier and statesman too&mdash;visited our shores,
and by his wise counsels so captured the imagination of his hearers
and readers that one of the greatest of all compliments was paid to
him, and anyone with a black cocker spaniel to name named it after
him; and he had a name rather peculiarly adapted to such ends
too.</p>
<p>It chanced that among the puppies thus made illustrious was one
which a young soldier before leaving for France to win the War gave
to his sister, and when writing to him, as, being a good girl, she
regularly and abundantly did, she never omitted to give tidings as
to how the little creature was developing; and I need hardly say
that in the whole history of dogs, from TOBIT'S faithful trotting
companion onwards, there never was a dog so packed with
intelligence and fidelity as this. Most girls' dogs are perfect,
but this one was more remarkable still.</p>
<p>Now it happened that the gallant brother, in the course of his
duties as a war-winner, was moved from place to place so often that
he gradually lost definition, as the photographers say, and the
result was that one of her recent letters failed to catch up with
him. That was a pity, because it was a better letter than usual. It
gave all the news that he would most want to hear. It said what
picture her father was working on at the moment, and told, without
spoiling them, his two last jokes. It said whom her mother had
called on and who had called on her mother and how something must
be done to stop her smoking too many cigarettes. It said that their
young brother, having sprained his ankle at hockey, had become a
wolf for jig-saw puzzles. It said where their parents had dined
recently and where they were going to dine and who was coming next
week. It said what she had seen at the theatre last Saturday and
what book she was reading. It said which of the other V.A.D.'s had
become engaged. It said what an awful time they had had trying to
buy some tea, and how scarce butter had become, and what a cold she
had caught in the last raid, and how Uncle Jim had influenza and
couldn't go on being a special, and how Aunt Sibyl had been
introduced to one of the GEDDESES and talked to him as though it
was the other, and how she herself had met Evelyn in the street the
other day and Evelyn had asked "with suspicious interest after
you"&mdash;and a thousand other things such as a good sister, even
though busy at a hospital, finds time to write to a brother over
there, all among the mud and the shells, winning the War. And not
being in the habit of signing her name, when writing in this
familiar way, she finished up with a reference to the darlingest of
all dogs by sending its love at the very end: "Love from
&mdash;&mdash;" and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, the letter, as I have said, could not be delivered. The
postal people at the Front, and behind the Front, are astonishingly
good, but they could not get in touch with the brother this time,
and therefore they opened the letter and looked at the foot of it
for the name of the writer and found that of the dog, and at the
head of it for the street and town where the writer lived, and sent
it back as "insufficiently addressed."</p>
<p>And that is why in a certain house in Chelsea a treasured
possession is a returned letter for General SMUTS.</p>

<h3>THE VERY GLAD EYE.</h3>
<p>Mother put down the key of the hen-house and took up the letters
that lay beside her plate.</p>
<p>"If only Joan would write larger," she sighed, turning over an
envelope across which an ant seemed to have walked and left an inky
trail. "I've mislaid my glass too, and shan't be able to read a
word. Where could I have put the miserable thing?" she asked,
peering again at the ridiculous little script.</p>
<p>Father put down his paper and said these hunts for Aunt Matilda
were getting monotonous. Only yesterday he had rescued her from
some dried bulbs in the greenhouse, and didn't Mother think it time
she saw a good oculist and had proper spectacles, instead of using
the old lens in that carved gold bauble belonging once to his
grandmother's aunt.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it's just a bad habit," she answered with a smile, "or
my eyes are getting lazy. But really I can see <i>so</i> well
through it, and if they would print the newspapers
better&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No one we know in this morning's list," said Father shortly, as
he turned a sheet; "and we should be hearing from those rascals now
that the push is over," he added, glancing at Mother who began to
sip her coffee hurriedly.</p>
<p>"They might even get leave together," ventured Margery. "It's
five months since Dick came home, and as for
Christopher&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What swank for old Margots, now her hair is up," piped Archie.
"Two brothers from the trenches to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"If you'd make a little less noise, my son," said Father in a
strange voice, "I might be able to take in what I'm reading.
There's something here about Christopher."</p>
<p>"What?" cried Mother, springing from her chair.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's Christopher plain enough," he repeated with shining
eyes. "Christopher Charles Bentley, and&mdash;God bless my
soul!&mdash;the boy has been splendid! It's all down here,
and&mdash;-</p>
<p>"Read, read!" we clamoured, as his voice grew husky and
indistinct.</p>
<p>"Read!" again we shouted, as Mother came and took the paper
gently from him.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg

<p>"When you're all quiet, children," she began, devouring the
words before her.</p>
<p><i>Quiet!</i> Even the canary held its breath while Mother read
that wonderful paragraph.</p>
<p>It was a long one, and every word of it a tribute to our
magnificent Chris, who had organised a small volunteer party,
attacked a strong point, and captured fifteen of the enemy and a
machine-gun, for which gallant act he had been awarded the M.C.</p>
<p>With lingering pride she went through it a second time, and only
then did we see that she was staring at the paper, proudly and
fiercely, through the handle of the hen-house key!</p>

<p>"Francesca," I said, "listen to this."</p>
<p>"I will," she said, "if it's worth listening to."</p>
<p>"You can't tell that till you've heard it, can you?"</p>
<p>"Well, what is it, anyhow?"</p>
<p>"It's a letter," I said, "from Harry Penruddock."</p>
<p>"That doesn't sound very exciting."</p>
<p>"Ah, but wait a bit."</p>
<p>"Well, get a move on. I've got to see the cook."</p>
<p>"He sends me," I said, "a notice which has been served upon him
about his cottage at Smoltham. He wants to have my opinion about
it."</p>
<p>"Very well, give him your opinion, and let's get on with the
War."</p>
<p>"Francesca," I said, "are you not more than a little peevish
this morning?"</p>
<p>"I have no patience," she said, "with notices that have to be
served. It's always done by sanitary inspectors and rate
collectors, and people of that sort. Why can't they just post them
and have done with it?"</p>
<p>"Who are you," I said, "that you should fly in the face of
Providence in this way? Can't you see that if a notice is 'served,'
it immediately becomes twice as important?"</p>
<p>"Oh, if it adds to the dignity of an inspector, well and good;
but for my part I should have posted it."</p>
<p>"You are not a sanitary inspector, and cannot realise the
feelings of one."</p>
<p>"They have no feelings, and that's why they're made
inspectors."</p>
<p>"Hush!" I said, and began to read:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'In pursuance of the directions given in an Act passed in the
fifth and sixth years of the reign of King William the Fourth,
entitled "An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to
Highways in that part of Great Britain called England," I, T.
Bradish, of the Town Hall, Smoltham, do hereby give you notice
forthwith to cut, prune, plash or lop certain Trees and Hedges
overhanging the highway immediately adjoining your premises, No.
15, East Gate, in the Parish of Smoltham, and which are causing an
obstruction and annoyance to the said highway, so that the
obstructions caused to the said highway shall be removed.</p>
<p>"'Dated this 19th day of October, 1917.'"</p>
<p>"Isn't it priceless?" I said.</p>
<p>"It is," said Francesca. "I never knew before that a road could
be annoyed."</p>
<p>"Even a road has its feelings."</p>
<p>"Yes, perhaps it's a short lane, and everybody tramples on it,
and it turns at last."</p>
<p>"So do borough engineers and surveyors, it seems."</p>
<p>"I bet this one's a Tartar."</p>
<p>"How can you tell that?"</p>
<p>"I can tell it by his style, which is very severe and
uncompromising."</p>
<p>"His style," I said, "is as the statute made it, and mustn't be
impugned by us."</p>
<p>"I particularly like that bit about plashing the trees. How in
the name of all that's English do you plash a tree?"</p>
<p>"If," I said, "you were a fountain and wanted to be poetical,
you would plash, instead of splashing."</p>
<p>"That's nonsense," she said.</p>
<p>"No," I said, "it's poetry."</p>
<p>"But you don't pour poetry on overhanging trees. It must mean
something else."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what; we'll get a dictionary."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, "you get it. I'm no good at dictionaries. I
always find such a lot of fascinating words that I never get to the
one I want."</p>
<p>"I'm rather like that myself," I said. "However I'll exercise
self-restraint. Here you are: Packthread, Pastime,
Pin&mdash;there's a lot about Pin&mdash;Plash. Got it! It means 'to
bend down and interweave the branches or twigs of.'"</p>
<p>"Now," she said, "we know what Mr. Bradish wants."</p>
<p>"He's a very arbitrary man," I said. "How can he expect Harry
Penruddock to bend down and interweave the branches or twigs
of?"</p>
<p>"Anyway, Harry's got to do it, whether he understands it or
not."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "borough surveyors take no denials. And now that
you've had your lesson in English, you can go and see the
cook."</p>
<p>"Half a mo'," she said; "I'm acquiring a lot of useful

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p class="center"><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
Clerks.)</i></p>
<p>Generally speaking, stories left unfinished because of the death
of the writer in mid course can only be at best an uncomfortable,
exasperating legacy to his admirers. But by a thrice happy chance
this is not the case with the two novels upon which the late HENRY
JAMES was engaged at the time of his fatal illness. This good
fortune comes from the fact that it was the writer's habit "to test
and explore," in a written or dictated sketch, the possible
developments of any theme before embarking upon its treatment in
detail. I get the phrase "test and explore," than which there could
be no better, from the brief preface to the volume now before me,
<i>The Ivory Tower</i> (COLLINS). It exactly suggests the method of
this preliminary study, doubly precious now, both as supplying the
key by which we can understand the fragment that has been worked
out, and as in itself giving us a glimpse, wonderfully fascinating,
of its evolution. <i>The Ivory Tower</i> (called so
characteristically after an object whose bearing upon the intrigue
is of the slightest) is a study of wealth in its effect upon the
mutual relations of a small group of persons belonging to the
plutocracy of pre-war America. Its special motive was to be a
development of situation as between a young legatee, in whom the
business instinct is entirely wanting, and his friend and adviser,
whom he was presently to detect in dishonest dealing, yet refrain
from any act of challenge that would mean exposure.
"Refrain"&mdash;does this not give you in one word the whole secret
of what would have been a study in character and emotion obviously
to the taste of the writer? For itself, and still more for the
glimpse of what it was to become, <i>The Ivory Tower</i> must have
a place in every collection where the unmatchable wit of HENRY
JAMES is honoured as it should be.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Something less successful perhaps for itself, though even more
absorbing technically, is the volume containing the unfinished
fragment of another HENRY JAMES novel, to be called <i>The Sense of
the Past</i> (COLLINS). Here especially it is the preliminary study
that furnishes the chief interest; the spectacle of this so-skilled
craftsman struggling to master an idea that might well, I think,
have been found later too unsubstantial, too subtly fantastic, for
working out. Very briefly, the theme is to treat of a young
American, in whom this "Sense of the Past" is all-powerful; whom
the gift of an old London house and its furnishings enables to
transport himself bodily into the life of 1820. More than this, he
lives that life (and it is here that one suspects the idea of
becoming unmanageable) in the person of an actual youth of that
time, in whom a corresponding Sense of the Future has been so
strong that he has answered the curiosity of his descendant by an
exchange of personalities. Of course the dangers and confusions of
the plan, a kind of psychological version of one often used in
farce (except that it precisely wasn't to be any manner of dream),
are such as might well alarm any writer&mdash;and, one might add,
any reader also. It is a further misfortune that the style of what
is actually written should be in the master's most remote and
obscure manner, so much so that one is forced <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg 358]</span> to
wonder whether, without the notes as guide, it would be in any sort
clear what the whole thing was about. The transition, for example,
from the actual to the supernatural event is so abrupt that it
might well have left the uninformed helplessly befogged. But this
very fact again, as supposing some further treatment only now to be
guessed at, helps to make the unique fascination of the book as
revealing the difficulties and rewards of letters.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Whatever Mr. ERNEST THOMPSON SETON cares to write I am glad to
read, but there were moments in <i>The Preacher of Cedar
Mountain</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) when the great moral lesson of
the story was as much as I could bear. The tale reveals the
spiritual and moral development of <i>Jim Hartigan</i>. The author
assures us that most of the characters are drawn from life, and
that some of the main events are historical. All which I can easily
believe, for Mr. SETON'S blunt method of describing <i>Jim
Hartigan's</i> evolution from an unhallowed stable-boy to a
muscular Christian continually suggests reality. It is not a
stylish method, but it gets home, and in a tale of this kind that
is the main, if not the only, matter of importance. <i>Jim's</i>
besetting weaknesses were drink and an overwhelming love for
horses. The former he conquered fairly soon, but the latter tripped
him up more than once, and if he had not been guided by the wisest
woman who ever came from the West his end would have been chaotic.
The races at Fort Ryan are excellently described, and as a picture
of the West of America some forty years ago you will find this
story of <i>Jim's</i> conversion both instructive and intriguing.
All the same Mr. SETON has so often delighted me by his tales of
the animal world that I hope this excursion is merely a holiday
from the work for which he has a real genius.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Up to the present time the crop of German spy-stories has been
distinguished by quantity rather than by quality. Possibly the
authors, realising that the wildest flights of their highly-trained
fancies could never match the actual machinations of the German
Secret Service as revealed in the official news, have not put their
hearts into the work. In <i>The Lost Naval Papers</i> and other
stories (MURRAY) Mr. BENNET COPPLESTONE has shown unusual boldness
in connecting the activities of his super-policeman, <i>Dawson</i>,
with the more prominent events of the War. Indeed, I am not sure
that the terror he professes to feel in the presence of the
Scotland Yard official (for he tells his stories <i>in propria
persona</i>) is not to some extent justified. "Dora" is very
sensitive and six months ago would never have permitted Mr.
COPPLESTONE to reveal to our enemies either the bumptious egoism of
a nameless First Lord or the platitudinous vacillations of an
anonymous Premier, even in the interests of popular fiction. Though
we concede his audacity in allowing his superlative sleuth to stop
a general strike of engineers by threatening them with martial law
and to tempt the German fleet to come out by sending it false news
of our battleship strength, or to enable the battle of the Falkland
Islands to be won by piling dummy battle cruisers up outside
Plymouth harbour, the merit of Mr. COPPLESTONE'S book does not lie
in the complexity or vitality of his plots. It lies in a keen sense
of humour and clever character suggestion, and the recognition that
the thing written about is of less importance than the manner of
writing. We earnestly desire that Mr. COPPLESTONE should devote
another volume&mdash;a whole one&mdash;to the inimitable <i>Madame
Guilbert</i>; but whatever he writes about will be welcome,
provided it be written in the vein of the volume before us.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Out of such workaday elements as the hypnotic fascinations of a
sleek music-master, the follies of a runaway schoolgirl and the
well-disciplined affections of a most superior young gentleman, Mr.
W.E. NORRIS has contrived to create yet another new story, without
infringement of his own or anyone else's copyright. Thanks to the
incidence of War and the author's skilful manipulation of Europe's
distresses (for once the KAISER'S intrusion into the middle of a
peaceful&mdash;almost too peaceful&mdash;narrative is not
unwelcome), the second half of <i>The Fond Fugitives</i>
(HUTCHINSON) is better than the first. Not, indeed, that such a
wary hand as the writer has been so ill-advised as to follow his
hero to Flanders, or even to let his heroine do so; but his wounded
soldier, come home with sympathy and understanding grown big enough
to realise that a girl, though indiscreet once, may yet be adorable
ever after, is certainly more to one's taste than the philanderer
about town, admiring other men's wives, in July, 1914. And so the
story, slight though it is, ends on a strong note and with fair
hope of happiness for two wiser and not much sadder people. Some of
the minor characters are quite capitally drawn, particularly the
old father and mother in pathetic flight before the shadow of their
daughter's disgrace; but it is the freshness of the heroine
herself, outraging all tradition by refusing, though without
bravado, to remain for ever in the gloom of a childish error, that
one likes to remember. Altogether, the author's friends will find
this book not at all below the level of his best work.</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
