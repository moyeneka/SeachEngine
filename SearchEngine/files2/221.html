xi</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the learned first gave serious
attention to popular ballads, from the time of Percy to that of
Scott, they laboured under certain disabilities.&nbsp; The
Comparative Method was scarcely understood, and was little
practised.&nbsp; Editors were content to study the ballads of
their own countryside, or, at most, of Great Britain.&nbsp;
Teutonic and Northern parallels to our ballads were then adduced,
as by Scott and Jamieson.&nbsp; It was later that the ballads of
Europe, from the Faroes to Modern Greece, were compared with our
own, with European <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, or children&rsquo;s
tales, and with the popular songs, dances, and traditions of
classical and savage peoples.&nbsp; The results of this more
recent comparison may be briefly stated.&nbsp; Poetry begins, as
Aristotle says, in improvisation.&nbsp; Every man is his own
poet, and, in moments of stronge motion, expresses himself in
song.&nbsp; A typical example is the Song of Lamech in
Genesis&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have slain a man to my wounding,<br />
And a young man to my hurt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>Instances perpetually occur in the Sagas: Grettir,
Egil, Skarphedin, are always singing.&nbsp; In <i>Kidnapped</i>,
Mr. Stevenson introduces &ldquo;The Song of the Sword of
Alan,&rdquo; a fine example of Celtic practice: words and air are
beaten out together, in the heat of victory.&nbsp; In the same
way, the women sang improvised dirges, like Helen; lullabies,
like the lullaby of Dan&aelig; in Simonides, and flower songs, as
in modern Italy.&nbsp; Every function of life, war, agriculture,
the chase, had its appropriate magical and mimetic dance and
song, as in Finland, among Red Indians, and among Australian
blacks.&nbsp; &ldquo;The deeds of men&rdquo; were chanted by
heroes, as by Achilles; stories were told in alternate verse and
prose; girls, like Homer&rsquo;s Nausicaa, accompanied dance and
ball play, priests and medicine-men accompanied rites and magical
ceremonies by songs.</p>
<p>These practices are world-wide, and world-old.&nbsp; The
thoroughly popular songs, thus evolved, became the rude material
of a professional class of minstrels, when these arose, as in the
heroic age of Greece.&nbsp; A minstrel might be attached to a
Court, or a noble; or he might go wandering with song and harp
among the people.&nbsp; In <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>either case, this class of men
developed more regular and ample measures.&nbsp; They evolved the
hexameter; the <i>laisse</i> of the <i>Chansons de Geste</i>; the
strange technicalities of Scandinavian poetry; the metres of
Vedic hymns; the choral odes of Greece.&nbsp; The narrative
popular chant became in their hands the Epic, or the
medi&aelig;val rhymed romance.&nbsp; The metre of improvised
verse changed into the artistic lyric.&nbsp; These lyric forms
were fixed, in many cases, by the art of writing.&nbsp; But
poetry did not remain solely in professional and literary
hands.&nbsp; The medi&aelig;val minstrels and <i>jongleurs</i>
(who may best be studied in L&eacute;on Gautier&rsquo;s
Introduction to his <i>Epop&eacute;es Fran&ccedil;aises</i>) sang
in Court and Camp.&nbsp; The poorer, less regular brethren of the
art, harped and played conjuring tricks, in farm and grange, or
at street corners.&nbsp; The foreign newer metres took the place
of the old alliterative English verse.&nbsp; But unprofessional
men and women did not cease to make and sing.</p>
<p>Some writers have decided, among them Mr. Courthope, that our
traditional ballads are degraded popular survivals of literary
poetry.&nbsp; The plots and situations of some ballads are,
indeed, the same as those of <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>some literary medi&aelig;val
romances.&nbsp; But these plots and situations, in Epic and
Romance, are themselves the final literary form of
<i>m&auml;rchen</i>, myths and inventions originally
<i>popular</i>, and still, in certain cases, extant in popular
form among races which have not yet evolved, or borrowed, the
ampler and more polished and complex <i>genres</i> of
literature.&nbsp; Thus, when a literary romance and a ballad have
the same theme, the ballad may be a popular degradation of the
romance; or, it may be the original popular shape of it, still
surviving in tradition.&nbsp; A well-known case in prose, is that
of the French fairy tales.</p>
<p>Perrault, in 1697, borrowed these from tradition and gave them
literary and courtly shape.&nbsp; But <i>Cendrillon</i> or
<i>Chaperon Rouge</i> in the mouth of a French peasant, is apt to
be the old traditional version, uncontaminated by the refinements
of Perrault, despite Perrault&rsquo;s immense success and
circulation.&nbsp; Thus tradition preserves pre-literary forms,
even though, on occasion, it may borrow from literature.&nbsp;
Peasant poets have been authors of ballads, without being, for
all that, professional minstrels.&nbsp; Many such poems survive
in our ballad literature.</p>
<p><a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>The
material of the ballad may be either romantic or
historical.&nbsp; The former class is based on one of the
primeval invented situations, one of the elements of the
<i>M&auml;rchen</i> in prose.&nbsp; Such tales or myths occur in
the stories of savages, in the legends of peasants, are
interwoven later with the plot in Epic or Romance, and may also
inspire ballads.&nbsp; Popular superstitions, the witch,
metamorphosis, the returning ghost, the fairy, all of them
survivals of the earliest thought, naturally play a great
part.&nbsp; The Historical ballad, on the other hand, has a basis
of resounding fact, murder, battle, or fire-raising, but the
facts, being derived from popular rumour, are immediately
corrupted and distorted, sometimes out of all knowledge.&nbsp;
Good examples are the ballads on Darnley&rsquo;s murder and the
youth of James VI.</p>
<p>In the romantic class, we may take <i>Tamlane</i>.&nbsp; Here
the idea of fairies stealing children is thoroughly popular; they
also steal young men as lovers, and again, men may win fairy
brides, by clinging to them through all transformations.&nbsp; A
classical example is the seizure of Thetis by Peleus, and Child
quotes a modern Cretan example.&nbsp; The dipping in milk and
water, <a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>I
may add, has precedent in ancient Egypt (in <i>The Two
Brothers</i>), and in modern Senegambia.&nbsp; The fairy tax,
tithe, or teind, paid to Hell, is illustrated by old trials for
witchcraft, in Scotland. <a name="citation0a"></a><a
href="#footnote0a" class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; Now, in
literary forms and romance, as in <i>Ogier le Danois</i>, persons
are carried away by the Fairy King or Queen.&nbsp; But here the
literary romance borrows from popular superstition; the ballad
has no need to borrow a familiar fact from literary
romance.&nbsp; On the whole subject the curious may consult
&ldquo;The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and
Fairies,&rdquo; by the Reverend Robert Kirk of Aberfoyle,
himself, according to tradition, a victim of the fairies.</p>
<p>Thus, in <i>Tamlane</i>, the whole <i>donn&eacute;e</i> is
popular.&nbsp; But the current version, that of Scott, is
contaminated, as Scott knew, by incongruous modernisms.&nbsp;
Burns&rsquo;s version, from tradition, already localizes the
events at Carterhaugh, the junction of Ettrick and Yarrow.&nbsp;
But Burns&rsquo;s version does not make the Earl of Murray father
of the hero, nor the Earl of March father of the heroine.&nbsp;
Roxburgh is the hero&rsquo;s father in Burns&rsquo;s variant,
which is more plausible, and the modern verses do not
occur.&nbsp; This <a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>ballad apparently owes nothing to literary
romance.</p>
<p>In <i>Mary Hamilton</i> we have a notable instance of the
Historical Ballad.&nbsp; No Marie of Mary Stuart&rsquo;s suffered
death for child murder.</p>
<p>She had no Marie Hamilton, no Marie Carmichael among her four
Maries, though a lady of the latter name was at her court.&nbsp;
But early in the reign a Frenchwoman of the queen&rsquo;s was
hanged, with her paramour, an apothecary, for slaying her
infant.&nbsp; Knox mentions the fact, which is also recorded in
letters from the English ambassador, uncited by Mr. Child.&nbsp;
Knox adds that there were ballads against the Maries.&nbsp; Now,
in March 1719, a Mary Hamilton, of Scots descent, a maid of
honour of Catherine of Russia, was hanged for child murder
(<i>Child</i>, vi. 383).&nbsp; It has therefore been supposed,
first by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe long ago, later by Professor
Child, and then by Mr. Courthope, that our ballad is of 1719, or
later, and deals with the Russian, not the Scotch, tragedy.</p>
<p>To this we may reply (1) that we have no example of such a
throwing back of a contemporary event, in ballads.&nbsp; (2)
There <a name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xviii</span>is a version (<i>Child</i>, viii. 507) in which Mary
Hamilton&rsquo;s paramour is a &ldquo;pottinger,&rdquo; or
apothecary, as in the real old Scotch affair.&nbsp; (3) The
number of variants of a ballad is likely to be proportionate to
its antiquity and wide distribution.&nbsp; Now only <i>Sir
Patrick Spens</i> has so many widely different variants as
<i>Mary Hamilton</i>.&nbsp; These could hardly have been evolved
between 1719 and 1790, when Burns quotes the poem as an old
ballad.&nbsp; (4) We have no example of a poem so much in the old
ballad manner, for perhaps a hundred and fifty years before
1719.&nbsp; The style first degraded and then expired: compare
<i>Rob Roy</i> and <i>Killiecrankie</i>, in this collection, also
the ballads of <i>Loudoun Hill</i>, <i>The Battle of
Philiphaugh</i>, and others much earlier than 1719.&nbsp; New
styles of popular poetry on contemporary events as
<i>Sherriffmuir</i> and <i>Tranent Brae</i> had arisen.&nbsp; (5)
The extreme historic inaccuracy of <i>Mary Hamilton</i> is
paralleled by that of all the ballads on real events.&nbsp; The
mention of the Pottinger is a trace of real history which has no
parallel in the Russian affair, and there is no room, says
Professor Child, for the supposition that it was voluntarily
inserted by reciter or copyist, <a name="pagexix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xix</span>to tally with the narrative in
Knox&rsquo;s History.</p>
<p>On the other side, we have the name of Mary Hamilton occurring
in a tragic event of 1719, but then the name does not uniformly
appear in the variants of the ballad.&nbsp; The lady is there
spoken of generally as Mary Hamilton, but also as Mary Myle, Lady
Maisry, as daughter of the Duke of York (Stuart), as Marie Mild,
and so forth.&nbsp; Though she bids sailors carry the tale of her
doom, she is not abroad, but in Edinburgh town.&nbsp; Nothing can
be less probable than that a Scots popular ballad-maker in 1719,
telling the tale of a yesterday&rsquo;s tragedy in Russia, should
throw the time back by a hundred and fifty years, should change
the scene to Scotland (the heart of the sorrow would be
Mary&rsquo;s exile), and, above all, should compose a ballad in a
style long obsolete.&nbsp; This is not the method of the popular
poet, and such imitations of the old ballad as <i>Hardyknute</i>
show that literary poets of 1719 had not knowledge or skill
enough to mimic the antique manner with any success.</p>
<p>We may, therefore, even in face of Professor Child, regard
<i>Mary Hamilton</i> as an old example of popular perversion <a
name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>of history in
ballad, not as &ldquo;one of the very latest,&rdquo; and also
&ldquo;one of the very best&rdquo; of Scottish popular
ballads.</p>
<p><i>Rob Roy</i> shows the same power of perversion.&nbsp; It
was not Rob Roy but his sons, Robin Oig (who shot Maclaren at the
plough-tail), and James Mohr (alternately the spy, the Jacobite,
and the Hanoverian spy once more), who carried off the heiress of
Edenbelly.&nbsp; Indeed a kind of added epilogue, in a different
measure, proves that a poet was aware of the facts, and wished to
correct his predecessor.</p>
<p>Such then are ballads, in relation to legend and
history.&nbsp; They are, on the whole, with exceptions,
absolutely popular in origin, composed by men of the people for
the people, and then diffused among and altered by popular
reciters.&nbsp; In England they soon won their way into printed
stall copies, and were grievously handled and moralized by the
hack editors.</p>
<p>No ballad has a stranger history than <i>The Loving Ballad of
Lord Bateman</i>, illustrated by the pencils of Cruikshank and
Thackeray.&nbsp; Their form is a ludicrous cockney perversion,
but it retains the essence.&nbsp; Bateman, a captive of
&ldquo;this Turk,&rdquo; is beloved by the Turk&rsquo;s daughter
<a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>(a
staple incident of old French romance), and by her
released.&nbsp; The lady after seven years rejoins Lord Bateman:
he has just married a local bride, but &ldquo;orders another
marriage,&rdquo; and sends home his bride &ldquo;in a coach and
three.&rdquo;&nbsp; This incident is stereotyped in the ballads
and occurs in an example in the Romaic. <a
name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a></p>
<p>Now Lord Bateman is <i>Young Bekie</i> in the Scotch ballads,
who becomes <i>Young Beichan</i>, <i>Young Bichem</i>, and so
forth, and has adventures identical with those of Lord Bateman,
though the proud porter in the Scots version is scarcely so
prominent and illustrious.&nbsp; As Motherwell saw, Bekie
(Beichan, Buchan, Bateman) is really Becket, Gilbert Becket,
father of Thomas of Canterbury.&nbsp; Every one has heard how
<i>his</i> Saracen bride sought him in London.&nbsp; (Robert of
Gloucester&rsquo;s <i>Life and Martyrdom of Thomas Becket</i>,
Percy Society.&nbsp; See Child&rsquo;s Introduction, IV., i.
1861, and <i>Motherwell&rsquo;s Minstrelsy</i>, p. xv.,
1827.)&nbsp; The legend of the dissolved marriage is from the
common stock of ballad lore, Motherwell found an example in the
state of <i>Cantefable</i>, alternate prose and verse, <a
name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxii</span>like
<i>Aucassin and Nicolette</i>.&nbsp; Thus the cockney rhyme
descends from the twelfth century.</p>
<p>Such are a few of the curiosities of the ballad.&nbsp; The
examples selected are chiefly chosen for their romantic charm,
and for the spirit of the Border raids which they record.&nbsp; A
few notes are added in an appendix.&nbsp; The text is chosen from
among the many variants in Child&rsquo;s learned but still
unfinished collection, and an effort has been made to choose the
copies which contain most poetry with most signs of
uncontaminated originality.&nbsp; In a few cases Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s versions, though confessedly &ldquo;made up,&rdquo;
are preferred.&nbsp; Perhaps the editor may be allowed to say
that he does not merely plough with Professor Child&rsquo;s
heifer, but has made a study of ballads from his boyhood.</p>
<p>This fact may exempt him, even in the eyes of too patriotic
American critics, from &ldquo;the common blame of a
plagiary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, as Professor Child has not yet
published his general theory of the Ballad, the editor does not
know whether he agrees with the ideas here set forth.</p>
<p>So far the Editor had written, when news came of Professor
Child&rsquo;s regretted <a name="pagexxiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>death.&nbsp; He had lived to
finish, it is said, the vast collection of all known traditional
Scottish and English Ballads, with all accessible variants, a
work of great labour and research, and a distinguished honour to
American scholarship.&nbsp; We are not told, however, that he had
written a general study of the topic, with his conclusions as to
the evolution and diffusion of the Ballads: as to the influences
which directed the selection of certain themes of
<i>M&auml;rchen</i> for poetic treatment, and the processes by
which identical ballads were distributed throughout Europe.&nbsp;
No one, it is to be feared, is left, in Europe at least, whose
knowledge of the subject is so wide and scientific as that of
Professor Child.&nbsp; It is to be hoped that some pupil of his
may complete the task in his sense, if, indeed, he has left it
unfinished.</p>

<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1">1</a></span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Child</span> finds the first published
version of &ldquo;the grand old ballad of Sir Patrick
Spens,&rdquo; as Coleridge calls it, in Bishop Percy&rsquo;s
<i>Reliques</i>.&nbsp; Here the name is &ldquo;Spence,&rdquo; and
the middle rhyme&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Haf owre, haf
owre to Aberdour,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is not of early date.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Cork-heeled
Shoon,&rdquo; too, cannot be early, but ballads are subject, in
oral tradition, to such modern interpolations.&nbsp; The verse
about the ladies waiting vainly is anticipated in a popular song
of the fourteenth century, on a defeat of the <i>noblesse</i> in
Flanders&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Their ladies
them may abide in bower and hall well long!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there be historical foundation for the ballad, it is
probably a blending of the voyage of Margaret, daughter of
Alexander III., to wed Eric, King of Norway, in 1281 (some of her
escort were drowned on their way home), with the rather
mysterious death, or disappearance, of Margaret&rsquo;s daughter,
&ldquo;The Maid of Norway,&rdquo; on her voyage to marry the son
of Edward I., in 1290.&nbsp; A woman, who alleged that she was
the Maid of Norway, was later burned at the stake.&nbsp; The
great number and variety of versions sufficiently indicate the
antiquity of this ballad, wherein exact history is not to be
expected.</p>

230</span><span class="smcap">The Battle of
Otterburn</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page5">5</a></span></h3>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>, Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s
latest edition of 1833: the copy in the edition of 1802 is less
complete.&nbsp; The gentle and joyous passage of arms here
recorded, took place in August 1388.&nbsp; We have an admirable
account of Otterburn fight from Froissart, who revels in a
gallant encounter, fairly fought out hand to hand, with no
intervention of archery or artillery, and for no wretched
practical purpose.&nbsp; In such a combat the Scots, never
renowned for success at long bowls, and led by a Douglas, were
likely to prove victorious, even against long odds, and when
taken by surprise.</p>
<p>Choosing an advantage in the discordant days of Richard II.,
the Scots mustered a very large force near Jedburgh, merely to
break lances on English ground, and take loot.&nbsp; Learning
that, as they advanced by the Carlisle route, the English
intended to invade Scotland by Berwick and the east coast, the
Scots sent three or four hundred men-at-arms, with a few thousand
mounted archers and pikemen, who should harry Northumberland to
the walls of Newcastle.&nbsp; These were led by James, Earl of
Douglas, March, and Murray.&nbsp; In a fight at Newcastle,
Douglas took Harry Percy&rsquo;s pennon, which Hotspur vowed to
recover.&nbsp; The retreat began, but the Scots waited at
Otterburn, partly to besiege the castle, partly to abide
Hotspur&rsquo;s challenge.&nbsp; He made his attack at moonlight,
with overwhelming odds, but was hampered by a marsh, and
incommoded by a flank attach of the Scots.&nbsp; Then it came to
who would pound longest, with axe and sword.&nbsp; Douglas cut
his way through the English, axe in hand, and was overthrown, but
his men protected his body.&nbsp; The Sinclairs and Lindsay
raised his banner, with his cry; March and Dunbar came up;
Hotspur was taken by Montgomery, and the English were routed with
heavy loss.&nbsp; Douglas was buried in Melrose Abbey; very many
years later the English defiled his grave, but were punished at
Ancram Moor.&nbsp; There is an English poem on the fight of
&ldquo;about 1550&rdquo;; it has many analogies with our Scottish
version, and, doubtless, ours descends from a ballad almost
contemporary.&nbsp; The ballad was a great favourite of
Scott&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In a severe <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>illness, thinking of Lockhart, not
yet his son-in-law, he quoted&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My wound is deep, I fain would sleep,<br />
Take thou the vanguard of the three.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Child thinks the command to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;yield to the bracken-bush&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>unmartial.&nbsp; This does not seem a strong objection, in
Froissart&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; It is explained in an oral
fragment&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For there lies aneth yon bracken-bush<br />
Wha aft has conquered mair than thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Child also thinks that the &ldquo;dreamy dream&rdquo; may
be copied from Hume of Godscroft.&nbsp; It is at least as
probable that Godscroft borrowed from the ballad which he
cites.&nbsp; The embroidered gauntlet of the Percy is in the
possession of Douglas of Cavers to this day.</p>

Tamlane</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page10">10</a></span></h3>
<p>Burns&rsquo;s version, in Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Museum</i>
(1792).&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s version is made up of this copy,
Riddell&rsquo;s, Herd&rsquo;s, and oral recitations, and contains
feeble literary interpolations, not, of course, by Sir
Walter.&nbsp; <i>The Complaint of Scotland</i> (1549) mentions
the &ldquo;Tale of the Young Tamlene&rdquo; as then
popular.&nbsp; It is needless here to enter into the subject of
Fairyland, and captures of mortals by Fairies: the Editor has
said his say in his edition of Kirk&rsquo;s <i>Secret
Commonwealth</i>.&nbsp; The Nereids, in Modern Greece, practise
fairy cantrips, and the same beliefs exist in Samoa and New
Caledonia.&nbsp; The metamorphoses are found in the
<i>Odyssey</i>, Book iv., in the winning of Thetis, the
<i>Nereid</i>, <i>or Fairy Bride</i>, by Peleus, in a modern
Cretan fairy tale, and so on.&nbsp; There is a similar incident
in <i>Penda Baloa</i>, a Senegambian ballad (<i>Contes Populaires
de la S&eacute;n&eacute;gambie</i>, Berenger Ferand, Paris,
1885).&nbsp; The dipping of Tamlane has precedents in <i>Old
Deccan Days</i>, in a Hottentot tale by Bleek, and in <i>Les Deux
Fr&egrave;res</i>, the Egyptian story, translated by Maspero (the
Editor has already given these parallels in a note to <i>Border
Ballads</i>, by Graham R. Thomson).&nbsp; Mr. Child also cites
Mannhardt, &ldquo;Wald und Feldkulte,&rdquo; ii.
64&ndash;70.&nbsp; <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>Carterhaugh, the scene of the ballad, is at the

Philiphaugh.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Thomas Rymer</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page16">16</a></span></h3>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>; the original was derived
from a lady living near Erceldoune (Earlston), and from Mrs.
Brown&rsquo;s MSS.&nbsp; That Thomas of Erceldoune had some
popular fame as a rhymer and soothsayer as early as
1320&ndash;1350, seems to be established.&nbsp; As late as the
Forty Five, nay, even as late as the expected Napoleonic
invasion, sayings attributed to Thomas were repeated with some
measure of belief.&nbsp; A real Thomas Rymer of Erceldoune
witnessed an undated deed of Peter de Haga, early in the
thirteenth century.&nbsp; The de Hagas, or Haigs of Bemersyde,
were the subjects of the prophecy attributed to Thomas,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Betide, betide, whate&rsquo;er betide,<br
/>
There will aye be a Haig in Bemersyde,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and a Haig still owns that ancient <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> on the
Tweed, which has a singular set of traditions.&nbsp; Learmont is
usually given as the Erceldoune family name; a branch of the
family owned Dairsie in Fifeshire, and were a kind of hereditary
provosts of St. Andrews.&nbsp; If Thomas did predict the death of
Alexander III., or rather report it by dint of clairvoyance, he
must have lived till 1285.&nbsp; The date of the poem on the
Fairy Queen, attributed to Thomas, is uncertain, the story itself
is a variant of &ldquo;Ogier the Dane.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scene is
Huntly Bank, under Eildon Hill, and was part of the lands
acquired, at fantastic prices, by Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; His
passion for land was really part of his passion for collecting
antiquities.&nbsp; The theory of Fairyland here (as in many other
Scottish legends and witch trials) is borrowed from the
Pre-Christian Hades, and the Fairy Queen is a late refraction
from Persephone.&nbsp; Not to eat, in the realm of the dead, is a
regular precept of savage belief, all the world over.&nbsp; Mr.
Robert Kirk&rsquo;s <i>Secret Commonwealth of Elves</i>,
<i>Fauns</i>, <i>and Fairies</i> may be consulted, or the
Editor&rsquo;s <i>Perrault</i>, p. xxxv. (Oxford, 1888).&nbsp; Of
the later legends about Thomas, Scott gives plenty, in <i>The
Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>long ancient romantic poem on the
subject is probably the source of the ballad, though a local
ballad may have preceded the long poem.&nbsp; Scott named the
glen through which the Bogle Burn flows to Chiefswood, &ldquo;The
Rhymer&rsquo;s Glen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Sir Hugh</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page19">19</a></span></h3>
<p>The date of the Martyrdom of Hugh is attributed by Matthew
Paris to 1225.&nbsp; Chaucer puts a version in the mouth of his
Prioress.&nbsp; No doubt the story must have been a mere excuse
for Jew-baiting.&nbsp; In America the Jew becomes &ldquo;The
Duke&rdquo; in a version picked up by Mr. Newells, from the
recitation of a street boy in New York.&nbsp; The daughter of a
Jew is not more likely than the daughter of a duke to have been
concerned in the cruel and blasphemous imitation of the horrors
attributed by Horace to the witch Canidia.&nbsp; But some such
survivals of pagan sorcery did exist in the Middle Ages, under
the influence of &ldquo;Satanism.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Son Davie</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page22">22</a></span></h3>
<p>Motherwell&rsquo;s version.&nbsp; One of many ballads on
fratricide, instigated by the mother: or inquired into by her, as
the case may be.&nbsp; &ldquo;Edward&rdquo; is another example of
this gloomy situation.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Wife of Usher&rsquo;s
Well</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a

<p>Here</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The cock doth
craw, the day doth daw,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>having a middle rhyme, can scarcely be of extreme
antiquity.&nbsp; Probably, in the original poem, the dead return
to rebuke the extreme grief of the Mother, but the poem is
perhaps really more affecting in the absence of a didactic
motive.&nbsp; Scott obtained it from an old woman in West
Lothian.&nbsp; Probably the reading &ldquo;fashes,&rdquo;
(troubles), &ldquo;in the flood&rdquo; is correct, not
&ldquo;fishes,&rdquo; or &ldquo;freshes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mother
desires that the sea may never cease to be troubled till her sons
return (verse 4, line 2).&nbsp; The peculiar doom of women dead
in child-bearing occurs even in Aztec mythology.</p>

<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page26">26</a></span></h3>
<p>From the third volume of <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, derived by
Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe from a traditional version.&nbsp; The
English version, &ldquo;Three Ravens,&rdquo; was published in
<i>Melismata</i>, by T. Ravensworth (1611).&nbsp; In Scots, the
lady &ldquo;has ta&rsquo;en another mate&rdquo; his hawk and
hound have deserted the dead knight.&nbsp; In the English song,
the hounds watch by him, the hawks keep off carrion birds, as for
the lady&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She buried him before the prime,<br />
She was dead herselfe ere evensong time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably the English is the earlier version.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Bonnie Earl of

<p>Huntly had a commission to apprehend the Earl, who was in the
disgrace of James VI.&nbsp; Huntly, as an ally of Bothwell, asked
him to surrender at Donibristle, in Fife; he would not yield to
his private enemy, the house was burned, and Murray was slain,
Huntly gashing his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have spoiled a better
face than your own,&rdquo; said the dying Earl (1592).&nbsp;
James Melville mentions contemporary ballads on the murder.&nbsp;
Ramsay published the ballad in his <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>,
and it is often sung to this day.</p>

&ldquo;Sweet Willie&rsquo;s Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; The evasions
practised by the lady, and the austerities vowed by her have many
Norse, French, and Spanish parallels in folk-poetry.&nbsp;
Scott&rsquo;s version is &ldquo;made up&rdquo; from several
sources, but is, in any case, verse most satisfactory as
poetry.</p>

<p>From Ramsay&rsquo;s <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>, a curiously
composite gathering of verses.&nbsp; There is a verse, obviously
a variant, in a sixteenth century song, cited by <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>Leyden.&nbsp; St. Anthon&rsquo;s Well is on a hill

<h3><span class="smcap">Love Gregor</span>.&mdash;p. <span

<p>There are French and Romaic variants of this ballad.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lochroyal,&rdquo; where the ballad is localized, is in
Wigtownshire, but the localization varies.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;tokens&rdquo; are as old as the Return of Odysseus, in the
<i>Odyssey</i>: his token is the singular construction of his
bridal bed, attached by him to a living tree-trunk.&nbsp; A
similar legend occurs in Chinese.&nbsp; See Gerland&rsquo;s
<i>Alt-Giechische M&auml;rchen</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Queen&rsquo;s
Marie</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mary
Hamilton</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page41">41</a></span></h3>
<p>A made-up copy from Scott&rsquo;s edition of 1833.&nbsp; This
ballad has caused a great deal of controversy.&nbsp; Queen Mary
had no Mary Hamilton among her Four Maries.&nbsp; No Marie was
executed for child-murder.&nbsp; But we know, from Knox, that
ballads were recited against the Maries, and that one of the
Mary&rsquo;s chamberwomen was hanged, with her lover, a
pottinger, or apothecary, for getting rid of her infant.&nbsp;
These last facts were certainly quite basis enough for a ballad,
the ballad echoing, not history, but rumour, and rumour adapted
to the popular taste.&nbsp; Thus the ballad might have passed
unchallenged, as a survival, more or less modified in time, of
Queen Mary&rsquo;s period.&nbsp; But in 1719 a Mary Hamilton, a
Maid of Honour, of Scottish descent, was executed in Russia, for
infanticide.&nbsp; Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe conceived that this
affair was the origin of the ballad, and is followed by Mr.
Child.</p>
<p>We reply (1) The ballad has almost the largest number of
variants on record.&nbsp; This is a proof of antiquity.&nbsp;
Variants so many, differing in all sorts of points, could not
have arisen between 1719, and the age of Burns, who quotes the
poem.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; This is especially improbable, because, in 1719, the
old vein of ballad poetry had run dry, popular song <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>had chosen
other forms, and no literary imitator could have written Mary
Hamilton in 1719.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; There is no example of a popular ballad in which a
contemporary event, interesting just because it is contemporary,
is thrown back into a remote age.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp; The name, Mary Hamilton, is often <i>not</i> given
to the heroine in variants of the ballad.&nbsp; She is of several
names and ranks in the variants.</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp; As Mr. Child himself remarked, the
&ldquo;pottinger&rdquo; of the real story of Queen Mary&rsquo;s
time occurs in one variant.&nbsp; There was no
&ldquo;pottinger&rdquo; in the Russian affair.</p>
<p>All these arguments, to which others might be added, seem
fatal to the late date and modern origin of the ballad, and Mr.
Child&rsquo;s own faith in the hypothesis was shaken, if not
overthrown.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Kinmont Willie</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page45">45</a></span></h3>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The account in
Satchells has either been based on the ballad, or the ballad is
based on Satchells.&nbsp; After a meeting, on the Border of
Salkeld of Corby, and Scott of Haining, Kinmont Willie was seized
by the English as he rode home from the tryst.&nbsp; Being
&ldquo;wanted,&rdquo; he was lodged in Carlisle Castle, and this
was a breach of the day&rsquo;s truce.&nbsp; Buccleugh, as
warder, tried to obtain Willie&rsquo;s release by peaceful
means.&nbsp; These failing, Buccleugh did what the ballad
reports, April 13, 1596.&nbsp; Harden and Goudilands were with
Buccleugh, being his neighbours near Branxholme.&nbsp; Dicky of
Dryhope, with others, Armstrongs, was also true to the call of
duty.&nbsp; A few verses in the ballad are clearly by <i>aut
Gualterus aut diabolus</i>, and none the worse for that.&nbsp;
Salkeld, of course, was not really slain; and, if the men were
&ldquo;left for dead,&rdquo; probably they were not long in that
debatable condition.&nbsp; In the rising of 1745 Prince
Charlie&rsquo;s men forded Eden as boldly as Buccleuch, the
Prince saving a drowning Highlander with his own hand.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Jamie Telfer</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page52">52</a></span></h3>
<p>Scott, for once, was wrong in his localities.&nbsp; The
Dodhead of the poem is <i>not</i> that near Singlee, in <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>Ettrick,
but a place of the same name, near Skelfhill, on the southern
side of Teviot, within three miles of Stobs, where Telfer vainly
seeks help from Elliot.&nbsp; The other Dodhead is at a great
distance from Stobs, up Borthwick Water, over the tableland, past
Clearburn Loch and Buccleugh, and so down Ettrick, past
Tushielaw.&nbsp; The Catslockhill is not that on Yarrow, near
Ladhope, but another near Branxholme, whence it is no far cry to
Branxholme Hall.&nbsp; Borthwick Water, Goudilands (below
Branxholme), Commonside (a little farther up Teviot), Allanhaugh,
and the other places of the Scotts, were all easily
&ldquo;warned.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are traces of a modern hand in
this excellent ballad.&nbsp; The topography is here corrected
from MS. notes in a first edition of the <i>Minstrelsy</i>, in
the library of Mr. Charles Grieve at Branxholme&rsquo; Park, a
scion of &ldquo;auld Jock Grieve&rdquo; of the Coultart
Cleugh.&nbsp; Names linger long in pleasant Teviotdale.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Douglas Tragedy</span>.&mdash;p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page59">59</a></span></h3>
<p>The ballad has Norse analogues, but is here localized on the
Douglas Burn, a tributary of Yarrow on the left bank.&nbsp; The
St. Mary&rsquo;s Kirk would be that now ruinous, on St.
Mary&rsquo;s Loch, the chapel burned by the Lady of Branxholme
when she</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;gathered
a band<br />
Of the best that would ride at her command,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>.&nbsp; The ancient keep
of Blackhouse on Douglas Burn may have been the home of the
heroine, if we are to localize.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Bonny Hind</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page62">62</a></span></h3>
<p>Herd got this tragic ballad from a milkmaid, in 1771.&nbsp;
Mr. Child quotes a verse parallel, preserved in Faroe, and in the
Icelandic.&nbsp; There is a similar incident in the cycle of
Kullervo, in the Finnish <i>Kalevala</i>.&nbsp; Scott says that
similar tragedies are common in Scotch popular poetry; such cases
are &ldquo;Lizzie Wan,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s
Dochter, Lady Jean.&rdquo;&nbsp; A sorrow nearly as bitter occurs
in the French &ldquo;Milk White Dove&rdquo;: a brother kills his
sister, metamorphosed into a white deer.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Bridge
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>of
Death&rdquo; (French) seems to hint at something of the same
kind; or rather the Editor finds that he has arbitrarily read
&ldquo;The Bonny Hind&rdquo; into &ldquo;Le Pont des
Morts,&rdquo; in Puymaigre&rsquo;s <i>Chants Populaires du Pays
Messin</i>, p. 60.&nbsp; (<i>Ballads and Lyrics of Old
France</i>, p. 63)</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Young Beichan</span>, <span
class="smcap">or Young Bicham</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page65">65</a></span></h3>
<p>This is the original of the Cockney <i>Loving Ballad of Lord
Bateman</i>, illustrated by Cruikshank, and by Thackeray.&nbsp;
There is a vast number of variants, evidence to the antiquity of
the story.&nbsp; The earliest known trace is in the familiar
legend of the Saracen lady, who sought and found her lover,
Gilbert Becket, father of Thomas &agrave; Becket, in London (see
preface to <i>Life of Becket</i>, or Beket), Percy Society,
1845.&nbsp; The date may be <i>circ.</i> 1300.&nbsp; The kind of
story, the loving daughter of the cruel captor, is as old as
Medea and Jason, and her search for her lover comes in such
<i>M&auml;rchen</i> as &ldquo;The Black Bull o&rsquo;
Norraway.&rdquo;&nbsp; No story is more widely diffused (see <i>A
Far Travelled Tale</i>, in the Editor&rsquo;s <i>Custom and
Myth</i>).&nbsp; The appearance of the &ldquo;True Love,&rdquo;
just at her lover&rsquo;s wedding, is common in the
<i>M&auml;rchen</i> of the world, and occurs in a Romaic ballad,
as well as in many from Northern Europe.&nbsp; The &ldquo;local
colour&rdquo;&mdash;the Moor or Saracen&mdash;is derived from
Crusading times, perhaps.&nbsp; Motherwell found the ballad
recited with intervals of prose narrative, as in <i>Aucassin and
Nicolette</i>.&nbsp; The notes to Cruikshank&rsquo;s <i>Loving
Ballad</i> are, obviously, by Thackeray.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Bonny House o&rsquo;
Airly</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page73">73</a></span></h3>
<p>Lord Airly&rsquo;s houses were destroyed by Argyll,
representing the Covenanters, and also in pursuance of a private
feud, in 1639, or 1640.&nbsp; There are erroneous versions of
this ballad, in which Lochiel appears, and the date is,
apparently, transferred to 1745.&nbsp; Montrose, in his early
Covenanting days, was not actually concerned in the burning of
the Bonnie House, which he, when a Royalist, revenged on the
possessions of &ldquo;gleyed Argyll.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reference
to &ldquo;Charlie&rdquo; is out of keeping; no one, perhaps, ever
called Charles I. <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>by that affectionate name.&nbsp; Lady Ogilvie had not
the large family attributed to her: her son, Lord Ogilvie,
escaped from prison in the Castle of St. Andrews, after
Philiphaugh.&nbsp; A Lord Ogilvie was out in 1745; and, later,
had a regiment in the French Service.&nbsp; Few families have a
record so consistently loyal.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Rob Roy</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page75">75</a></span></h3>
<p>The abductors of the widowed young heiress of Edenhelly were
Rob&rsquo;s sons, Robin Oig, who went through a form of marriage
with the girl, and James Mohr, a good soldier, but a double-dyed
spy and scoundrel.&nbsp; Robin Oig was hanged in 1753.&nbsp;
James Mohr, a detected traitor to Prince Charles, died miserably
in Paris, in 1754.&nbsp; Readers of Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s
<i>Catriona</i> know James well; information as to his villanies
is extant in Additional MSS. (British Museum).&nbsp; This is
probably the latest ballad in the collection.&nbsp; It occurs in
several variants, some of which, copied out by Burns, derive
thence a certain accidental interest.&nbsp; In Mr.
Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>Catriona</i>, the heroine of that name takes
a thoroughly Highland view of the abduction.&nbsp; Robin Oig, in
any case, was &ldquo;nane the waur o&rsquo; a hanging,&rdquo; for
he shot a Maclaren at the plough-tail, before the
Forty-Five.&nbsp; The trial of these sons of Alpen was published
shortly after Scott&rsquo;s <i>Rob Roy</i>.</p>

the modern road by the railway, but higher up the hill, in the
grounds of Urrard House.&nbsp; Two shelter trenches, whence
Dundee&rsquo;s men charged, are still visible, high on the
hillside above Urrand.&nbsp; There is said, by Mr. Child, to have
been a contemporary broadside of the ballad, which is an example
of the evolution of popular ballads from the old traditional
model.&nbsp; There is another song, by, or attributed to, Burns,
and of remarkable spirit and vigour.</p>

class="indexpageno"><a href="#page79">79</a></span></h3>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i> Scott says that these are
the original words of the tune of &ldquo;Allan Water,&rdquo; and
that he has added two verses from a variant with a fortunate
conclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allan Water&rdquo; is a common river
name; the stream so called joins Teviot above Branxholme.&nbsp;
Annan is the large stream that flows into the Solway Frith.&nbsp;
The Gate-slack, in Annandale, fixes the locality.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Elphin Nourrice</span>.&mdash;p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page81">81</a></span></h3>
<p>This curious poem is taken from the reprint of Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe&rsquo;s tiny <i>Ballad Book</i>, itself now
almost <i>introuvable</i>.&nbsp; It does not, to the
Editor&rsquo;s knowledge, occur elsewhere, but is probably
authentic.&nbsp; The view of the Faery Queen is more pleasing and
sympathetic than usual.&nbsp; Why mortal women were desired as
nurses (except to attend on stolen mortal children, kept to
&ldquo;pay the Kane to hell&rdquo;) is not obvious.&nbsp; Irish
beliefs are precisely similar; in England they are of frequent
occurrence.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Johnnie Armstrang</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page87">87</a></span></h3>
<p>Armstrang of Gilnockie was a brother of the laird of
Mangertoun.&nbsp; He had a kind of Robin Hood reputation on the
Scottish Border, as one who only robbed the English.&nbsp;
Pitscottie&rsquo;s account of his slaying by James V. (1529)
reads as if the ballad were his authority, and an air for the
subject is mentioned in the <i>Complaint of Scotland</i>.&nbsp;
In Sir Herbert Maxwell&rsquo;s <i>History of Dumfries and
Galloway</i> is an excellent account of the historical facts of
the case.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Edom o&rsquo; Gordon</span>.&mdash;p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page92">92</a></span></h3>
<p>Founded on an event in the wars between Kingsmen and
Queensmen, in the minority of James VI., while Queen Mary was
imprisoned in England.&nbsp; &ldquo;Edom&rdquo; was Adam Gordon
of Auchindown, brother of Huntley, and a Queen&rsquo;s man.&nbsp;
He, by his retainer, Car, or Ker, <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>burned Towie House, a seat of the
Forbes&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Ker recurs in the long and more or less
literary ballad of <i>The Battle of Balrinnes</i>.&nbsp; In
variants the localities are much altered, and, in one version,
the scene is transferred to Ayrshire, and Loudoun Castle.&nbsp;
All the ballads of fire-raising, a very usual practice, have
points in common, and transference was easy.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Lady Anne Bothwell&rsquo;s
Lament</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page98">98</a></span></h3>
<p>Tradition has confused the heroine of this piece with the wife
of Bothwelhaugh, who slew the Regent Murray.&nbsp; That his
motive was not mere political assassination, but to avenge the
ill-treatment and death of his wife, seems to be disproved by
Maidment.&nbsp; The affair, however, is still obscure.&nbsp; This
deserted Lady Anne of the ballad was, in fact, not the wife of
Bothwelhaugh, but the daughter of the Bishop of Orkney; her lover
is said to have been her cousin, Alexander Erskine, son of the
Earl of Mar.&nbsp; Part of the poem (Mr. Child points out) occurs
in Broome&rsquo;s play, <i>The Northern Lass</i> (1632).&nbsp;
Though a popular favourite, the piece is clearly of literary
origin, and has been severely &ldquo;edited&rdquo; by a literary
hand.&nbsp; This version is Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Jock o&rsquo; The Side</span>.&mdash;p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page101">101</a></span></h3>
<p>A Liddesdale chant.&nbsp; Jock flourished about
1550&ndash;1570, and is commemorated as a receiver by Sir Richard
Maitland in a poem often quoted.&nbsp; The analogies of this
ballad with that of &ldquo;Kinmont Willie&rdquo; are very
close.&nbsp; The reference to a punch-bowl sounds modern, and the
tale is much less plausible than that of &ldquo;Kinmont
Willie,&rdquo; which, however, bears a few obvious marks of Sir
Walter&rsquo;s own hand.&nbsp; A sceptical editor must choose
between two theories: either Scott of Satchells founded his
account of the affair of &ldquo;Kinmont Willie&rdquo; on a
pre-existing ballad of that name, or the ballad printed by Scott
is based on the prose narrative of Scott of Satchells.&nbsp; The
former hypothesis, everything considered, is the more
probable.</p>

<p>Published in Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i>, from a Scotch

<h3><span class="smcap">Fair Annie</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page111">111</a></span></h3>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; There are Danish,
Swedish, Dutch, and German versions, and the theme enters
artistic poetry as early as Marie de France (<i>Le Lai del
Freisne</i>).&nbsp; In Scotch the Earl of Wemyss is a recent
importation: the earldom dates from 1633.&nbsp; Of course this
process of attaching a legend or <i>M&auml;rchen</i> to a
well-known name, or place, is one of the most common in
mythological evolution, and by itself invalidates the theory
which would explain myths by a philological analysis of the
proper names in the tale.&nbsp; These may not be, and probably
are not, the original names.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Downie Dens of
Yarrow</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page116">116</a></span></h3>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; Scott thought that
the hero was Walter Scott, third son of Thirlestane, slain by
Scott of Tushielaw.&nbsp; The &ldquo;monument&rdquo; (a standing
stone near Yarrow) is really of a very early, rather Post-Roman
date, and refers to no feud of Thirlestane, Oakwood, Kirkhope, or
Tushielaw.&nbsp; The stone is not far from Yarrow Krik, near a
place called Warrior&rsquo;s Rest.&nbsp; Hamilton of
Bangour&rsquo;s version is beautiful and well known.&nbsp; Quite
recently a very early interment of a corpse, in the curved
position, was discovered not far from the standing stone with the
inscription.&nbsp; Ballad, stone, and interment may all be
distinct and separate.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Sir Roland</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page119">119</a></span></h3>
<p>From Motherwell&rsquo;s <i>Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The
authenticity of the ballad is dubious, but, if a forgery, it is a
very <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>skilled one for the early nineteenth century.&nbsp;
Poets like Mr. Swinburne, Mr. Rossetti, and Mrs. Marriot Watson
have imitated the genuine popular ballad, but never so closely as
the author of &ldquo;Sir Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Rose the Red and White
Lily</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page123">123</a></span></h3>
<p>From the Jamieson-Brown MS., originally written out by Mrs.
Brown in 1783: Sir Waiter made changes in <i>The Border
Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The ballad is clearly a composite
affair.&nbsp; Robert Chambers regarded Mrs. Brown as the Mrs.
Harris of ballad lore, but Mr. Norval Clyne&rsquo;s reply was
absolutely crushing and satisfactory.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Battle of Harlaw</span>.&mdash;p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page131">131</a></span></h3>
<p>Fought on July 24, 1411.&nbsp; This fight broke the Highland
force in Scotland.&nbsp; The first version is, of course,
literary, perhaps a composition of 1550, or even earlier.&nbsp;
The second version is traditional, and was procured by Aytoun
from Lady John Scott, herself the author of some beautiful
songs.&nbsp; But the best ballad on the Red Harlaw is that placed
by Scott in the mouth of Elspeth, in <i>The Antiquary</i>.&nbsp;
This, indeed, is beyond all rivalry the most splendid modern
imitation of the ancient popular Muse.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Dickie Macphalion</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page142">142</a></span></h3>
<p>A great favourite of Scott&rsquo;s, who heard it sung at Miss
Edgeworth&rsquo;s, during his tour in Ireland (1825).&nbsp; One
verse recurs in a Jacobite chant, probably of 1745&ndash;1760,
but the bibliography of Jacobite songs is especially obscure.</p>
<h3>A <span class="smcap">Lyke-Wake Dirge</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page143">143</a></span></h3>
<p>From the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The ideas are mainly
pre-Christian; the Brig o&rsquo; Dread occurs in Islamite and
Iroquois belief, and in almost all mythologies the souls have to
cross a River.&nbsp; Music for this dirge is given in Mr. Harold
Boulton&rsquo;s and Miss Macleod&rsquo;s <i>Songs of the
North</i>.</p>

244</span><span class="smcap">The Laird of
Waristoun</span>.&mdash;p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page145">145</a></span></h3>
<p>This version was taken down by Sir Walter Scott from his
mother&rsquo;s recitation, for Jamieson&rsquo;s book of
ballads.&nbsp; Jamieson later quarrelled bitterly with Sir
Walter, as letters at Abbotsford prove.&nbsp; A variant is given
by Kinloch, and a longer, less poetical, but more historically
accurate version is given by Buchan.&nbsp; The House of Waristoun
is, or lately was, a melancholy place hanging above a narrow
lake, in the northern suburbs of Edinburgh, near the Water of
Leith.&nbsp; Kincaid was the name of the Laird; according to
Chambers, the more famous lairds of Covenanting times were
Johnstons.&nbsp; Kincaid is said to have treated his wife
cruelly, wherefore she, or her nurse, engaged one Robert Weir, an
old servant of her father (Livingstone of Dunipace), to strangle
the unhappy man in his own bedroom (July 2, 1600).&nbsp; The lady
was beheaded, the nurse was burned, and, later, Weir was also
executed.&nbsp; The line</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;I wish that ye
may sink for sin&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>occurs in an earlier ballad on Edinburgh Castle&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And that all for the black dinner<br />
Earl Douglas got therein.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="smcap">May Colven</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page147">147</a></span></h3>
<p>From Herd&rsquo;s MS.&nbsp; Versions occur in Polish, German,
Magyar, Portuguese, Scandinavian, and in French.&nbsp; The ballad
is here localised on the Carrick coast, near Girvan.&nbsp; The
lady is called a Kennedy of Culzean.&nbsp; Prof. Bugge regards
this widely diffused ballad as based on the Apocryphal legend of
Judith and Holofernes.&nbsp; If so, the legend is <i>diablement
chang&eacute; en route</i>.&nbsp; More probably the origin is a
<i>M&auml;rchen</i> of a kind of <i>Rakshasa</i> fatal to
women.&nbsp; Mr. Child has collected a vast mass of erudition on
the subject, and by no means acquiesces in Prof. Bugge&rsquo;s
ingenious hypothesis.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Johnie Faa</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page150">150</a></span></h3>
<p>From Pinkerton&rsquo;s Scottish Ballads.&nbsp; The event
narrated is a legend of the house of Cassilis (Kennedy), <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>but is
wholly unhistorical.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir John Faa,&rdquo; in the
fable, is aided by Gypsies, but, apparently, is not one of the
Earls of Egypt, on whom Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s novel, <i>The
Raiders</i>, may be consulted.&nbsp; The ballad was first
printed, as far as is known, in Ramsay&rsquo;s <i>Tea Table
Miscellany</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Hobbie Noble</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page152">152</a></span></h3>
<p>The hero recurs in <i>Jock o&rsquo; the Side</i>, and Jock
o&rsquo; the Mains is an historical character, that is, finds
mention in authentic records, as Scott points out.&nbsp; The
Armstrongs were deported in great numbers, as &ldquo;an ill
colony,&rdquo; to Ulster, by James I.&nbsp; Sir Herbert
Maxwell&rsquo;s <i>History of Dumfries and Galloway</i> may be
consulted for these and similar reivers.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Twa Sisters</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page157">157</a></span></h3>
<p>A version of &ldquo;Binnorie.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ballad here
ends abruptly; doubtless the fiddler made fiddle-strings of the
lady&rsquo;s hair, and a fiddle of her breast-bone, while the
instrument probably revealed the cruelty of the sister.&nbsp;
Other extant versions are composite or interpolated, so this
fragment (Sharpe&rsquo;s) has been preferred in this place.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mary Ambree</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page160">160</a></span></h3>
<p>Taken by Percy from a piece in the Pepys Collection.&nbsp; The
girl warrior is a favourite figure in popular romance.&nbsp;
Often she slays a treacherous lover, as in <i>Billy
Taylor</i>.&nbsp; Nothing is known of Mary Ambree as an
historical personage; she may be as legendary as fair maiden
Lilias, of Liliarid&rsquo;s Edge, who &ldquo;fought upon her
stumps.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that case the local name is demonstrably
earlier than the mythical Lilias, who fought with such
tenacity.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Alison Gross</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page165">165</a></span></h3>
<p>Jamieson gave this ballad from a manuscript, altering the
spelling in conformity with Scots orthography.&nbsp; Mr. Child
prints the manuscript; here Jamieson&rsquo;s more <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>familiar
spelling is retained.&nbsp; The idea of the romance occurs in a
Romaic <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, but, in place of the Queen of Faery,
a more beautiful girl than the sorceress (Nereid in Romaic),
restores the youth to his true shape.&nbsp; Mr. Child regarded
the tale as &ldquo;one of the numerous wild growths&rdquo; from
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.&nbsp; It would be more correct to
say that <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> is a late, courtly, French
adaptation and amplification of the original popular &ldquo;wild
growth&rdquo; which first appears (in literary form) as <i>Cupid
and Psyche</i>, in Apuleius.&nbsp; Except for the metamorphosis,
however, there is little analogy in this case.&nbsp; The friendly
act of the Fairy Queen is without parallel in British Folklore,
but Mr. Child points out that the Nereid Queen, in Greece, is
still as kind as Thetis of old, not a sepulchral siren, the
shadow of the pagan &ldquo;Fairy Queen Proserpina,&rdquo; as
Campion calls her.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Heir of Lynne</span>.&mdash;p. <span

<p>Percy got this piece from Lord Hailes, with pseudo-antiquated

&ldquo;From the Finnish.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are a number of
parallel ballads on Cruel Brothers, and Cruel Sisters, such as
<i>Son Davie</i>, which may be compared.&nbsp; Fratricides and
unconscious incests were motives dear to popular poetry.</p>

<p>From the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; That corpses
<i>might</i> begin to &ldquo;thraw,&rdquo; if carelessly watched,
was a prevalent superstition.&nbsp; Scott gives an example: the
following may be added, as less well known.&nbsp; The watchers
had left the corpse alone, and were dining in the adjoining room,
when a terrible noise was heard in the chamber of death.&nbsp;
None dared enter; the minister was sent for, and passed into the
room.&nbsp; He emerged, asked for a pair of tongs, and returned,
bearing in the tongs <i>a bloody glove</i>, and the noise
ceased.&nbsp; He always declined to say what he had
witnessed.&nbsp; Ministers were exorcists in the last century,
and the father of James Thomson, the poet, died suddenly in an
interview with a guest, in a haunted house.&nbsp; The house was
pulled down, as being uninhabitable.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Auld Maitland</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page180">180</a></span></h3>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; This ballad is
inserted, not for its merit, still less for its authenticity, but
for the problem of its puzzling history.&nbsp; Scott certainly
got it from the mother of the Ettrick Shepherd, in 1801.&nbsp;
The Shepherd&rsquo;s father had been a grown-up man in 1745, and
his mother was also of a great age, and unlikely to be able to
learn a new-forged ballad by heart.&nbsp; The Shepherd himself
(then a most unsophisticated person) said, in a letter of June
30, 1801, that he was &ldquo;surprized to hear this song is
suspected by some to be a modern forgery; the contrary will be
best proved by most of the old people, here about, having a great
part of it by heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two last lines of verse
seven were, confessedly, added by Hogg, to fill a
<i>lacuna</i>.&nbsp; They are especially modern in style.&nbsp;
Now thus to fill up sham <i>lacun&aelig;</i> in sham ballads of
his own, with lines manifestly modern, was a favourite trick of
Surtees of Mainsforth.&nbsp; He used the device in
&ldquo;Barthram&rsquo;s Dirge,&rdquo; which entirely took in Sir
Walter, and was guilty of many other <i>supercheries</i>,
especially of the &ldquo;Fray of Suport Mill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Could
the unlettered Shepherd, fond of hoaxes as he was, have invented
this stratagem, sixteen years before he joined the
<i>Blackwood</i> set?&nbsp; And is it conceivable that his old
mother, entering into the joke, would <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>commit her son&rsquo;s fraudulent
verses to memory, and recite them to Sir Walter as genuine
tradition?&nbsp; She said to Scott, that the ballad &ldquo;never
was printed i&rsquo; the world, for my brothers and me learned it
and many mae frae auld Andrew Moore, and he learned it frae auld
Baby Mettlin&rdquo; (Maitland?) &ldquo;wha was housekeeper to the
first laird o&rsquo; Tushilaw.&rdquo;&nbsp; (On Ettrick, near
Thirlestane.&nbsp; She doubtless meant the first of the Andersons
of Tushielaw, who succeeded the old lairds, the Scotts.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was said to hae been another or a guid ane, and there
are many queer stories about hersel&rsquo;, but O, she had been a
grand singer o&rsquo; auld songs an&rsquo; ballads.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Hogg&rsquo;s <i>Domestic Manners of Sir Walter Scott</i>, p. 61,
1834.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maitland upon auld beird gray&rdquo; is mentioned by
Gawain Douglas, in his <i>Palice of Honour</i>, which the
Shepherd can hardly have read, and Scott identified this Maitland
with the ancestor of Lethington; his date was
1250&ndash;1296.&nbsp; On the whole, even the astute Shepherd, in
his early days of authorship, could hardly have laid a plot so
insidious, and the question of the authenticity and origin of the
ballad (obvious interpolations apart) remains a mystery.&nbsp;
Who could have forged it?&nbsp; It is, as an exercise in
imitation, far beyond <i>Hardyknute</i>, and at least on a level
with <i>Sir Roland</i>.&nbsp; The possibility of such forgeries
is now very slight indeed, but vitiates early collections.</p>
<p>If we suspect Leyden, who alone had the necessary knowledge of
antiquities, we are still met by the improbability of old Mrs.
Hogg being engaged in the hoax.&nbsp; Moreover, Leyden was
probably too keen an antiquary to take part in one of the
deceptions which Ritson wished to punish so severely.&nbsp; Mr.
Child expresses his strong and natural suspicions of the
authenticity of the ballad, and Hogg is, certainly, a dubious
source.&nbsp; He took in Jeffrey with the song of &ldquo;Donald
Macgillavray,&rdquo; and instantly boasted of his triumph.&nbsp;
He could not have kept his secret, after the death of
Scott.&nbsp; These considerations must not be neglected, however
suspicious &ldquo;Auld, Maitland&rdquo; may appear.</p>

<p>From Buchan&rsquo;s <i>Ballads of the North of
Scotland</i>.&nbsp; There are Elizabethan references to the poem,
and a twelfth century romance turns on the main idea of sleep
magically induced.&nbsp; The lover therein is more fortunate than
the hero of the ballad, and, finally, overcomes the spell.&nbsp;
The idea recurs in the Norse poetry.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Willie&rsquo;s Ladye</span>.&mdash;p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page193">193</a></span></h3>
<p>Scott took this ballad from Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s celebrated
Manuscript.&nbsp; The kind of spell indicated was practised by
Hera upon Alcmena, before the birth of Heracles.&nbsp; Analogous
is the spell by binding witch-knots, practised by Simaetha on her
lover, in the second Idyll of Theocritus.&nbsp; Montaigne has
some curious remarks on these enchantments, explaining their
power by what is now called &ldquo;suggestion.&rdquo;&nbsp; There

translated by Jamieson.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Robin Hood Ballads</span>.&mdash;p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page196">196</a></span></h3>
<p>There is plentiful &ldquo;learning&rdquo; about Robin Hood,
but no real knowledge.&nbsp; He is first mentioned in literature,
as the subject of &ldquo;rhymes,&rdquo; in <i>Piers Plowman</i>
(<i>circ.</i> 1377).&nbsp; As a topic of ballads he must be much
older than that date.&nbsp; In 1439 his name was a synonym for a
bandit.&nbsp; Wyntoun, the Scots chronicler, dates the outlaw in
the time of Edward I.&nbsp; Major, the Scots philosopher and
master of John Knox, makes a guess (taken up by Scott in
<i>Ivanhoe</i>) as the period of Richard I.&nbsp; Kuhn seeks to
show that Hood is a survival of Woden, or of his <i>Wooden</i>,
&ldquo;wooden horse&rdquo; or hobby horse.&nbsp; The Robin Hood
play was parallel with the May games, which, as Mr. Frazer shows
in his <i>Golden Bough</i>, were really survivals of a world-wide
religious practice.&nbsp; But Robin Hood need not be confused
with the legendary May King.&nbsp; Mr. Child judiciously rejects
these mythological conjectures, based, as they are, on
far-fetched etymologies and analogies.&nbsp; Robin is an
idealized bandit, reiver, or Klepht, as in modern Romaic ballads,
and his adventures are precisely such as popular fancy everywhere

conjectured to be &ldquo;possibly as old as the reign of Edward
II.&rdquo;&nbsp; That the murder of a monk should be pardoned in
the facile way described is manifestly improbable.&nbsp; Even in
the lawless Galloway of 1508, McGhie of Phumpton was fined six
merks for &ldquo;throwing William Schankis, monk, from his
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; (History of Dumfries and Galloway, by Sir

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
